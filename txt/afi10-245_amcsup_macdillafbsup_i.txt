SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
This document has changed significantly in format in order to mirror DoDI 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism
Standards. This AFI changes from the 31 series, Security to the 10 series, Operations. Additionally, the
term antiterrorism is stressed in this document over the term force protection. It corrects administrative
errors, updates references, changes format and incorporates clarifications and changes from MAJCOMs
and field units. It adds Terrorist Consequence Management planning and Vulnerability Assessments
(VAs) as baseline program standards. Requires installation Antiterrorism Officers (ATOs) to be qualified
by attending an approved Level II course. Identifies basic ATO roles and responsibilities. Changes DoD
Threat Levels and Threat Analysis factors to reflect revised Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) terminol-
ogy. It also changes Threat Conditions (THREATCONs) to Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs) and
requires installations to implement all FPCON measures ordered from higher headquarters, unless granted
specific relief. Adds considerations for food and water security and mail handling procedures. An AT Plan
listing unit location, site-specific measures, and linked to a FPCON will be classified, as a minimum,
CONFIDENTIAL. Directs commanders to use the AFOSI local counterintelligence threat assessment as
the basis for AT planning. Requires AT Plans to include procedures for using counterintelligence defen-
sive programs locally. Requires installation Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) for all FPCONs
and requires at least three RAMs per day. Defines the minimum key elements required in an AT Plan.
Requires installations establish detailed barrier plans. Requires reporting on AF Strategic Plan, Volume 2
Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) Performance Measures. Requires commanders to maintain les-
sons learned and AT/FP exercise documentation for at least one year. Changes requirement for personnel
to receive Level I AT Awareness Training. Changes requirement for area of responsibility (AOR) specific
updates for personnel traveling OCONUS. Requires all Level II courses to establish Personnel Data Sys-
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                                                             3


tem (PDS) Code “AFI.” Requires MAJCOMs to conduct annual curriculum review of their Level II
courses. RAVEN graduates, prior to Jan 2001, are awarded AT Level II credit based on the curriculum in
place prior to the aforementioned date. RAVEN graduates after Jan 2001 are not authorized to perform
duties as ATOs or Level I instructors, due to additional training requirements listed in DoDI 2000.16,
Table 1.1, and this instruction. Establishes documentation procedures for USAF personnel who have com-
pleted Level II training offered by other Services. Changes curriculum requirements for AT Level II and
Level III Training. Requires VAs be classified in accordance with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency
(DTRA) VA Classification Guide. Requires local VAs be conducted annually, with the exception of the
year the installation receives a higher headquarters VA. Establishes criteria for determining which DoD
sites/facilities require VAs. Requires commanders to prioritize, track and report vulnerabilities identified
during VAs to the next general officer/flag officer or equivalent. Adds procedures for installations receiv-
ing HQ Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC) VAs. Introduces the Force Protection Integrated Sup-
port Team (FIST) mission and capabilities. Adds list of approved Level II AT Courses.
(AMC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
(AMC) Adopts the term AT Advisor in lieu of AT Officer and/or AT NCO, as the primary individual(s)
for Antiterrorism (AT) related issues. Places the Wing AT Advisor position at the Wing Plans Office (XP).
Additionally, replaces the acronym CINC with “geographic commander (CDR)”.
(MACDILL) This interim change adds representatives from United States Marine Corps Forces Central
Command (USMARCENT) and Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) to the Force Protec-
tion Working Group (FPWG) in paragraph 1.1.3.2. (Added) A margin bar indicates newly revised mate-
rial.

                                      AIR FORCE AT PROGRAM

1.1. Air Force AT Program. The program seeks to deter or blunt terrorist acts against the US Air Force
by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating timely threat information, providing training to all AF
members, developing comprehensive plans to deter, and counter terrorist incidents, allocating funds and
personnel, and implementing AT measures.
1.1. (AMC) AMC AT Program. The AMC AT program enhances the Department of Defense and Air
Force programs of deterrence designed to blunt terrorist acts against personnel and resources by providing
timely guidance on collecting and disseminating threat information. This will be accomplished by provid-
ing training to all command members, developing comprehensive plans, allocating funds, and implement-
ing defensive measures. AMC/CC established a 3-tier AT/FP Corporate Structure, consisting of a Force
Protection Working Group (FPWG), Force Protection Board (FPB) and Force Protection Council (FPC)
that addresses all AMC Force Protection (FP) matters and policy. See paragraph 2.1.1.14. for additional
guidance on the AT/FP Corporate Structure.
1.1. (MACDILL) Air Force AT Program. The MacDill AFB AT program is designed to complement
and enhance the Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force, and Air Mobility Command AT programs. The
program provides installation specific guidance and direction to counter acts of terrorism against person-
nel and resources.
   1.1.1. US Position on Terrorism. The US position on terrorism is to encourage all nations to band
   together and give no sanctuary to terrorists. National security decision directives and statements by
   the President and senior officials set forth this policy. This instruction implements DoDI 2000.16,
   DoD Antiterrorism Standards, and adds Air Force-specific standards.
       1.1.1.1. The US Government is opposed to domestic and international terrorism and is prepared
       to act unilaterally, or in concert with other nations, when necessary to counter terrorist acts.
       1.1.1.2. The US Government considers terrorism by any person or group to be a threat to US
       national security. It will resist the use of terrorism by any legal means. The US will take measures
       to protect its citizens, property, and interests when evidence exists that a state or any terrorist orga-
       nization is mounting a terrorist act against this country.
       1.1.1.3. The US Government will make no concessions to terrorists. Simultaneously, the US will
       use every available resource to gain the safe return of American citizens held hostage by terrorists.
       1.1.1.4. The US will act decisively against terrorists without surrendering basic freedoms or
       endangering democratic principles. The US will encourage other governments to take similar
       stands.
   1.1.2. AT Responsibility. AT is a command responsibility and must be thoroughly integrated into
   every unit mission. Commanders must continually review their AT posture to keep current with
   changing policies and threat levels. Risk management, based on current threat, is the key when deter-
   mining vulnerabilities and resource prioritization. Any threat or potential vulnerability with risk that
   cannot be controlled to an acceptable level must be forwarded to the next level in the chain of com-
   mand for resolution. AT also requires every individual's participation to maintain awareness, practice
   personal security measures and report suspicious activity.

    1.1.2. (AMC) AT Responsibility. AT is an installation commander responsibility and must be thor-
    oughly integrated into every unit attached to the installation, to include tenants, Sister Services, and
    attached agencies (i.e., AAFES, DECA, TRICARE, etc).
    1.1.2. (MACDILL) AT Responsibility. The Wing Commander, 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW/
    CC), is responsible for the AT program at MacDill AFB.
       1.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) The program is an integrated effort where all units and installation com-
       manders must have the mindset combating terrorism is not solely the responsibility of the Security
       Forces (SF). Security Forces are merely one component of a comprehensive, successful team
       effort.
    1.1.3. Countering the Threat. Countering the terrorist threat requires a fully integrated and coordi-
    nated AT approach with a number of key areas that include at a minimum: Civil Engineers (readiness
    and security engineering), NBC Defense, EOD, Fire Protection, Services (food), Public Affairs, Com-
    munications, Intelligence, Operations, Security Forces, Surgeon General, Judge Advocate, Comptrol-
    ler and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).
    1.1.3. (AMC) Countering the Threat. Each AMC installation will establish an AT/FP decision-mak-
    ing body to fully integrate and coordinate AT/FP actions. Key functional membership for this deci-
    sion-making body, at a minimum, will include: Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI),
    Communications (SC), Civil Engineering (CE), Intelligence (IN), Judge Advocate (JA), Operations,
    Security Forces (SF), Financial Management (FM), and Surgeon General (SG). This may be accom-
    plished by enhancing the Installation Security Council (ISC) or by establishing a separate Force Pro-
    tection Working Group (FPWG). The installation threat-working group (TWG) should maintain its
    unique functions. See also paragraph 2.1.1.14. in the AFI.
    1.1.3. (MACDILL) Countering the Threat. MacDill AFB has a 3-tiered AT corporate structure
    consisting of the Force Protection Executive Council (FPEC), Force Protection Working Group
    (FPWG), and the Threat Working Group (TWG).
       1.1.3.1. (Added-MACDILL) The FPEC, chaired by the 6 AMW/CC or the Vice Wing Com-
       mander (6 AMW/CV), is comprised of the group commanders and representatives from the Staff
       Judge Advocate (6 AMW/SJA), US Central Command (USCENTCOM), US Special Operations
       Command (USSOCOM), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the
       Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE). The FPEC is the installation commander’s vehi-
       cle for evaluating the effectiveness of the installation’s force protection programs and is the senior
       decision making body for AT issues concerning MacDill AFB. The FPEC will:
           1.1.3.1.1. (Added-MACDILL) Meet at least semiannually, or at the request of the 6 AMW/
           CC or CV.

AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                       19


       2.2.1.4.1. AT Funding. There are two methods for obtaining AT funding. The first method is
       through the normal Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process. The Deputy Assistant
       Secretary of the Air Force (Budget) (SAF/FMB) includes approved AT budget requests in
       budget submissions and tracks program execution. SAF/FMB also provides policy and guid-
       ance on legal budget limitations and obligation criteria. Installations may use the template at
       Attachment 8 for their POM submissions.
       2.2.1.4.1. (AMC) AT Funding. Installation commanders should address vulnerabilities identi-
       fied in local or Higher Headquarters Vulnerability Assessments. Installation AT Advisors col-
       lect and prioritize vulnerabilities that require funding. The Vulnerability Assessment
       Management Program (VAMP) provides a tool for tracking, reporting, and prioritizing vulner-
       abilities. Through coordination with the Installation FPWG, AT Advisors and installation com-
       manders should prioritize these vulnerabilities and submit unfunded requests through their
       local FMB to HQ AMC/FMB utilizing Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RCCC) 104380
       (Antiterrorism). A copy of unfunded requirements should also be forwarded to AMC/SFXP
       and AMC/SFOF.
       2.2.1.4.1. (MACDILL) The FPWG will approve or disapprove requests and determine if it
       will be included in the Installation’s Finplan, UFR listing, or if it will be submitted for consid-
       eration through operational contingency funding, the CbTRIF, or BEDAL programs. If the
       project will be considered for inclusion in the Installation’s Finplan, UFR listing, or CbTRIF
       process, the Installation ATA will coordinate the funding request with the unit, Base Finance
       and Headquarters, Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC/SF). The Installation Readiness Flight,
       6 CES/ CEX, will consolidate all BEDAL requests and submit them to HQ AMC/CEXR.
       2.2.1.4.2. A second method of obtaining AT funding is through the Chairman of the Joint
       Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund (CbTRIF). Unlike
       POM submissions, CbTRIFs are to fund emergent high-priority combating terrorism require-
       ments in the year of execution. CbTRIFs are not intended to replace the POM process or sub-
       sidize ongoing projects. They also do not supplement budget shortfalls or support routine
       activity that is normally a Service responsibility. Units may refer to Chairman of the Joint
       Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 5261.01, Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund
       for specific guidance/fund submission process.
       2.2.1.4.2. (AMC) CbTRIF Funding. Submit emergent CbTRIF submissions to HQ AMC/
       SFX twice a year (1 Sep and 1 Jan) IAW CJCS 5261-01B, Enclosure B. All emergent require-
       ments must have an approved, executable, and exercised AT Plan prior to submitting a
       CbTRIF request. The installation FP decision-making body, e.g., ISC, should review all
       CbTRIF submissions and approve before submission to HQ AMC/SFX. Action officers pre-
       paring the CbTRIF submissions must research funding amounts, and ensure the requested
       amounts are firm and can be obligated within 90 days upon receipt of funding. Ensure budget
       requests have a direct AT/FP application with wide-ranging impact. Emergency requirements
       can be submitted anytime during the fiscal year using Enclosure B of CJCS 5261-01B. Emer-
       gency requirements are unanticipated requirements created by a combination of circumstances
       or the resulting state that requires immediate action to prevent, deter, or respond to a terrorist
       act.

           2.2.1.4.2. (MACDILL) The Installation ATA is responsible for accomplishing the AT budget
           request. The budget request must be coordinated through the FPWG for approval before being
           submitted to HQ AMC/SFX.
              2.2.1.4.2.1. Air Force commands serving as components of combatant commands shall
              coordinate their requests IAW CbTRIF program guidelines. In addition, MAJCOMs shall
              provide a copy of their requests to SAF/FMBO and AF/XOFP, when they submit their
              request to the CINC. Once a submission is initially processed by the Joint Staff (J34), it
              shall be sent to the appropriate offices (Air Staff functionals) for coordination. SAF/FMBO
              will coordinate on requests and annotate whether or not Air Force funds are available.
           2.2.1.4.3. (Added-AMC) Force Protection Board (FPB) Funding. The FPB receives funds
           from AMC/CC to operate the command’s AT/FP Program. The fund is BA02 (O&M) dollars.
           On occasion, AMC/SF (through the FPWG and FPB) may request installation AT Advisors
           and/or AMC directorates, submit proposals to obligate portions of this fund, throughout the
           calendar year.
              2.2.1.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) At no time, should an installation commander or AT Advisor
              consider this fund for their AT/FP projects, future funding, or supplemental funding
              sources, nor should it be utilized to replace un-funded requirements. Funds requests should
              only be submitted if the FPWG/FPB initially asked for submissions. At no time, should a
              unit submit proposals without a prior request by the AMC FPWG/FPB.
              2.2.1.4.3.2. (Added-AMC) If such a request is made, installation submissions should be
              coordinated by the FPWG, however all submissions must be approved by the Installation
              Commander, as a minimum. Submissions must be within the allocated dollar amount, oth-

2.3. DoD Standard 3 - Assignment of AT Operational Responsibility. When AT responsibilities for
the CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agencies conflict or overlap, and are not otherwise governed by
law, a specific DoD policy or an appropriate memorandum of agreement, the geographic CINC’s force
protection policies will take precedence over all force protection policies or programs of any DoD compo-
nent deployed in that command’s area of responsibility (AOR) and not otherwise under the security
responsibility of the Department of State (DoS). Commanders at all levels shall take appropriate measures
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                        21


to protect DoD personnel, families, facilities, material and reduce the vulnerability to terrorist use of
WMD.
   2.3.1. MAJCOMs, Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) and installa-
   tion commanders shall identify AT specific operational responsibilities in their supplement to this
   instruction. Responsibilities shall include the scope of AT programs for facilities and operations that
   do not meet the legal definition of an installation (i.e., Recruiting Offices, Red Horse at Korea, ROTC
   and other Geographic Separated Units).
   2.3.1. (AMC) Installation/site commanders have operational responsibility for AT/FP for all units
   and individuals whether permanently or temporarily assigned. In accordance with Joint Pub 3-10,
   Doctrine for Joint Rear Area Operations, Chapter II, paragraph 3b, tenant AMC units of another
   MAJCOM or service installations will comply with the requirements of the host AT/FP program. Ten-
   ant commanders maintain overall responsibility for their command’s physical security and AT/FP
   planning not provided by the host installation.
       2.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) Air Mobility Warfare Center (AMWC). The AMWC, an AMC DRU, is
       located at Ft Dix, an active Army installation. Therefore, as a tenant of Ft Dix, the center assumes
       the Provost Marshall and/or Commander, Ft Dix’s FP measures and posture. The AMWC receives
       vulnerability assessments as a tenant of Ft Dix. The AMWC provides AT/FP Level II training by
       formal school and/or mobile training team (MTT) visits to AMC installations.
       2.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Defense Courier Stations (DCS). Defense Courier Stations are AMC
       DRUs, located on US military installations worldwide. DCS assumes the FP measures and posture
       of the parent (host) organization. In the absence of a host organization, DCS assumes the FP pos-
       ture of the geographic CDR. DCS is afforded AT/FP Level II training from AMWC through for-
       mal MOA between AMC/SF and DCS/JS (Directorate of Plans and Operations).
   2.3.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and installation commanders shall ensure action to combat terrorism
   outside the United States comply with lead CINC, Service, or Agency guidance. MAJCOMs, FOAs,
   DRUs and installation commanders will also ensure such actions comply with applicable status of
   forces agreements (SOFA), the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide and MOUs.
   2.3.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and installation commanders shall work with other Air Force orga-
   nizations, US Service branches and DoD agencies to reduce vulnerability to terrorism. MAJCOMs
   FOAs, DRUs and installation commanders shall establish an AT program tailored to the local mission,
   conditions, the terrorist threat and the national security environment.
   2.3.4. Installation commanders shall:
   2.3.4. (MACDILL) The 6 AMW/CC will:
       2.3.4.1. Implement an AT program to combat the local terrorist threat and support the US Air
       Force AT program. This program shall identify tasked agencies, required actions and means of
       exercising and evaluating the program through annual operational and command post AT exer-
       cises. Commanders will document a review of their Installation AT Plan on an annual basis or
       within 60 days of assuming command.
       2.3.4.1. (AMC) Installation-wide antiterrorism exercises (both operational and command post)
       will be conducted at the installation commander’s discretion, but no less than annually. The exer-
       cises will be used to test and evaluate the installation's ability to respond to the local terrorist
       threat. Exercises will test a broad range of required FPCON actions specified within the installa-
22                              AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     tion's local plans and may be combined with other base exercises such as a MARE, BROKEN
     ARROW, etc. Installation commanders will document a review of their Installation AT Plan on an
     annual basis or within 60 days of assuming command. Installation AT Advisors must maintain the
     commander’s review with the AT Plan. A copy of the commander’s review must be forwarded to
     AMC/SFO within 15 days of completion. See also, AMC Sup 1, AFI 31-101, paragraph 4.10.
     2.3.4.1. (MACDILL) Implement an Antiterrorism Program tailored to the needs of MacDill AFB
     that will combat local terrorist threats and support the Air Force Antiterrorism Program in accor-
     dance with AFI 10-245.
     2.3.4.2. Establish an active public affairs program to combat terrorism. Public affairs personnel
     are the primary spokespersons for installation commanders. Public Affairs should help dispel
     rumors and misinformation by providing appropriate and timely information to the news media
     and base populace, according to current Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public
     Affairs and SAF/PA AT guidance. Public Affairs Officers shall stay current on the subject of ter-
     rorism to enhance their effectiveness in dealing with this issue. Ensure all terrorist incidents/threat
     reports to news media are coordinated with installation commanders and his/her Threat Working
     Group prior to official release.
     2.3.4.2. (AMC) Installations are tasked through the public affairs program, with providing peri-
     odic AT/FP awareness information on terrorist threats and personnel protection principles and
     techniques to the base populace. This may be satisfied using cable access station, base newspaper
     articles or flyers distributed at accessible points throughout the installation. Incidents of terrorism
     and crime will generate external media interest. In response to queries concerning a possible or
     real terrorist threat at a particular activity, installation, or community, the commander may
     acknowledge that increased security measures have been or will be taken without going into spe-
     cific details regarding the measures being taken. In other words, it may be appropriate and opera-
     tionally sound to acknowledge the obvious. For example, increased security measures such as
     additional guards at the gate and/or more stringent identification checks are usually obvious to the
     public, and acknowledgement may serve to send a positive message of increased readiness. Com-
     manders must exercise care and prudent judgment in any discussion of these or other security
     measures to preclude revealing tactics and techniques that an adversary could exploit. Discussion
     of site-specific FPCON measures IAW the Installation AT Plan are classified confidential IAW
     paragraph 2.13. of the parent AFI.
     2.3.4.2. (MACDILL) Establish an active public affairs program to combat terrorism.
     2.3.4.3. In coordination with AFOSI, provide assistance when directed or requested by the terror-
     ist incident lead agency. The lead agency for terrorist incidents outside the United States is the
     DoS. The Department of Justice (DoJ) is the lead agency for incidents within the United States.
     The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the lead agency for certain aviation incidents.
     2.3.4.3. (MACDILL) Coordinate with tenant units, USAF organizations, sister services, and
     DoD agencies to take appropriate measures to protect DoD personnel, families, facilities, and
     material, and reduce the vulnerability to terrorist attacks to include the use of WMD.
     2.3.4.4. Review, support, and implement DoD critical infrastructure protection requirements in
     accordance with DoD Directive 5160.54, Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and AFPD
     10-24, Air Force Critical Infrastructure Protection.

2.4. DoD Standard 4 - AT Coordination in Overseas Locations. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD
Agencies in overseas locations shall coordinate their AT efforts with host nation authorities and the US
Embassy as appropriate. DoD Intelligence and Counterintelligence elements shall coordinate their activi-
ties in support of AT plans and programs through established DoD procedures.
2.4. (AMC) The AMC Threat Working Group (TWG) is the command focal point for coordinated threat
analysis and FP recommendations for AMC operations in high-risk locations. The TWG meets daily to
assess potential threats affecting AMC operations using a six-step Operational Risk Management (ORM)
process to review hundreds of weekly missions transiting secure launch, monitor, and RAVEN required
locations around the world. The AMC Virtual Risk Assessment Database (VRAD) is the TWGs most
widely used product and is available via AMC Intelligence's classified website
http://www.amcin.scott.af.smil.mil. The VRAD contains published analysis detailing threats and FP
recommendations for locations where AMC operates. Included in each airfield risk assessment is
approved AMC DO policy used for planning and executing missions. Requests to deviate from estab-
lished policy are reviewed by the TWG, on a case-by-case basis. The final approval authority is either the
AMC Director of Operations (DO) or the AMC Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC) Commander, based
upon when then mission enters into execution. Waiver requests should be submitted electronically via
AMC Intelligence's classified website listed above.
   2.4.1. CINCs with geographic responsibilities shall coordinate AT matters with Chiefs of Mission
   (CoMs) in countries within their AOR, and with functional CINCs and DoD Agencies, whose person-
   nel are stationed in or transit the geographic CINC’s AOR.
   2.4.1. (AMC) Ensure local and host nation support planning efforts consider Threat Levels 1 and 2
   (AFI 31-301, Air Base Defense), as well as the known criminal threat in the immediate area of the
   installation. Installation/Site Commanders will ensure all agreements for local emergency support;
   e.g., fire, police, health service support, etc., are formally coordinated for their installations/sites.
   Review of agreements is a part of the AT/FP vulnerability assessment process.

     2.4.2. To ensure timely geographic CINC visibility of additional AT obligations, functional CINCs,
     and DoD Agencies, whose forces will station in or transit the AOR of a geographic CINC shall initiate
     coordination of AT matters with the geographic CINC.
     2.4.3. DoD elements not under the force protection responsibility of a geographic CINC, by law or
     under provisions of a CINC-CoM MOA, shall comply with the State Department's Overseas Security
     Policy Board (OSPB) Security Standards.
     2.4.4. The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), acting as DoD's executive agent for
     diplomatic security matters, shall, through the United States Defense Representative (USDR), ensure
     that non-CINC assigned DoD elements, whose AT responsibility rests with the CoM, comply with
     OSPB standards.
     2.4.5. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Combating Terrorism Policy and Sup-
     port (CTP&S), or designee, is DoD's designated representative for resolving disputes with DoS offi-
     cials, in countries where the MOU on Security of DoD Elements and Personnel in Foreign Areas is
     between the DoS and the DoD. CINCs concerned with DoS standards shall address them with the
     DASD through the Chairman of the Joint Staff.

2.5. DoD Standard 5 - Comprehensive AT Development, Implementation and Assessment. C o m -
manders at all levels shall develop and implement a comprehensive AT program for personnel under their
respective control designed to accomplish all the standards contained in this Instruction.
     2.5.1. AT Management. To develop and implement AT programs and plans, CINCs, Services, and/or
     DoD Agencies, shall designate a full-time staff officer in writing to supervise, inspect, exercise,
     review, assess and report on the AT program within the theater of command. At the theater level, com-
     ponent commanders provide the critical linkage from the CINC to the operating forces. Therefore,
     component commanders are responsible to provide direct AT/FP support to all forces, including tran-
     sit forces. This direct support should include threat and VAs of routes and sites used by transiting
     forces, intelligence support, and AT augmentation. In order to effectively implement the standards in
     DoDI 2000.16, component commanders shall maintain a full-time Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) and
     consider a full-time AT/FP staff.
     2.5.1. (AMC) Installation commanders will designate, in writing, a full-time staff officer to super-
     vise, inspect, exercise, review, assess and report on the AT program at the installation. Installation
     commanders will appoint and maintain a full-time Antiterrorism Advisor and consider a full-time
     staff.
        2.5.1.1. MAJCOM, FOA, DRU AT staff officers and installation ATOs shall be trained in AT pro-
        cedures as described in DoDI 2000.16 and DoD O-2000.12-H. Training will include attendance at
        a parent Level II Service-approved course (USAF approved courses are listed in Attachment 7).
        When possible, this training should be accomplished prior to assuming AT responsibilities.
        2.5.1.1. (AMC) AT Advisors must be trained in AT procedures as described in DoDI 2000.16 and
        DOD O-2000.12-H. Training will include attendance at a parent AT Level II MAJCOM approved
        course. Courses that specialize in Air Force installation vulnerability assessments are encouraged.
        This training is required within 120 days of appointment to the position. When possible, the per-
        son(s) appointed should remain in the position for at least 18 months.
        2.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Every effort should be made to ensure the AT Advisor is not TDY within
        120 days of a higher headquarters vulnerability assessment.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                       31


  2.5.2. Another critical link to operating forces is logistics support. The logistics contracting process
  for support of operational forces shall incorporate considerations for AT measures during contracting
  requirement, award, execution, and the evaluation process when the effort to be contracted for could
  affect the security of operating forces, particularly in-transit forces. Geographic CINCs shall ensure
  that component commanders, in coordination with the relevant country team, verify that all logistics
  support contracts and agreements consider AT for a particular security environment. During the eval-
  uation process, future contract awards shall consider adequate AT performance.
  2.5.2. (AMC) The AMC FPWG points of contact (POCs) will coordinate (as determined by the Con-
  tract Owner) on all contracts and/or Statements of Work (SOW). The process is as follows:
     2.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) All FPWG members email addresses are maintained by AMC/SFOF, in a
     database updated as significant changes occur. Each FPWG member will maintain this address
     group and forward contracts/SOWs that originate in their area of expertise.
     2.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) The contract owner and/or FPWG member will determine, based on the
     nature of the contract, who should provide coordination on the electronic SSS. The contract owner
     or FPWG member then forwards the SSS to all FPWG members in the address group, regardless
     of required coordination. FPWG members identified as requiring coordination must provide their
     3 or 4 digit coordination directly to the contract owner (POC identified on the SSS).
     2.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) The contract owner will resolve issues with directorates who non-concur
     or do not provide coordination. All efforts to resolve conflict from the coordination process should
     be handled by the contract owner.
     2.5.2.4. (Added-AMC) Upon completion of all coordination action, the contract owner will then
     provide a completed SSS to AMC/SFOF via email. AMC/SFOF will establish a cover letter for
     the FPWG chairman (AMC/SFO) to sign, indicating a FPWG review has taken place on the spe-
     cific contract. Upon signature, a copy will be provided to the contract owner.
     2.5.2.5. (Added-AMC) AMC/SFOF will maintain copies of all cover letters signed by the FPWG
     chairman. The specific contract owner will maintain copies of all coordination actions, along with
     the signed letter from the FPWG chairman.
     2.5.2.6. (Added-AMC) AMC/JA review IAW the above process will occur prior to contract
     award and not during FPWG review, to alleviate redundant review requirements.
  2.5.3. Elements of the Comprehensive AT Program Development, Implementation and Assessment.
  AT program elements include threat assessments, VAs, planning, exercises, program reviews and
  training. The process, or sequence, of AT program elements should be iterative and serve to continu-
  ously refine the AT Plan.
  2.5.3. (AMC) AT Plans will be assessed during higher headquarters program reviews as identified in
  Standard 26 to DoDI 2000.16 and paragraph 2.26. to AFI 10-245. Plans shall address areas outlined in
  paragraph 2.2.1. Commanders are encouraged to use the DD ATFP (previously J-34) AT/FP Installa-
  tion Planning Template CDROM in developing/revising their installation plans.
  2.5.4. AF Strategic Plan Performance Measures. Installations will report to MAJCOMs the status of
  their installation’s AT plans IAW with AF Strategic Plan, Volume 2, Performance Measure 2.A.12,
  Antiterrorism/Force Protection Program. (RCS: HAF-SFC(SA)0125, Status of Antiterrorism Plans
  Report) This report is designated emergency status code C-2. Continue reporting during emergency
  conditions.

     2.5.4. (AMC) Installation commanders will report Air Force Strategic Plan, Vol. 2, Performance Plan
     FP Performance Measures 2.A.12, Antiterrorism/Force Protection Program, semi-annually, no later
     than 1 Apr and 1 Oct of each year to AMC/SFOF. Installation commanders must coordinate on the
     report prior to release to AMC/SFOF. Installation AT Advisors should be afforded minimal levels of
     staffing in order for the Installation commander to provide coordination within the suspense dates
     above. Continue reporting during emergency conditions.
        2.5.4.1. MAJCOMs will, in turn, report the status of their respective installations AT plan to HQ
        USAF/XOFP NLT 10 Oct and 10 Apr of each year. MAJCOMs will establish their own reporting
        suspenses for receiving installation information.
        2.5.4.1. (AMC) Reporting periods for both FP Performance Measures are 1 Oct through 31 Mar,
        and 1 Apr through 30 Sept.
        2.5.4.2. Further details regarding calculation data using this performance measure can be found at
        https://www.afmia.randolph.af.mil/afmia/mip/mipp/perf_mgt/documents/vol2annex.doc.
        2.5.4.2. (AMC) Use the AMC AT/FP self-inspection checklist to report FP Performance Measure
        2.A.12. Do not use the AMC IG Unit Compliance Checklist for this report, as it is a pared down
        version and may not incorporate the entire requirements of the AFI.

2.6. DoD Standard 6 - Designation of Antiterrorism Officers (ATOs). Antiterrorism Officers (ATOs)
shall be assigned, in writing, at each installation or base, as well as deploying units (i.e., battalion, squad-
ron, ship). Commanders shall designate a commissioned officer, non-commissioned officer or civilian
staff officer, in writing as the ATO who shall be trained in AT procedures in a formal Service-approved
Level II AT training course.
2.6. (AMC) Installation/site commanders must appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate AT/FP Advi-
sor. The primary AT Advisor will be assigned to a full time civil service position at wing XP Plans Divi-
sion, identified under the installation commander’s functional account code (FAC). The primary and
alternate advisors serve as the Installation AT/FP subject matter experts. Installation alternate AT Advi-
sors must be an officer or NCO (E-6 or above), designated by the Installation Commander. Recommend
the alternate advisor be a Security Forces member. Those appointed as primary and alternate AT Advisors
should not have secondary duties that conflict with or take precedence over, those duties associated with
the AT program. Appointment of the AT Advisor shall be a primary duty. Individuals should have at least
18 months retainability, to serve in the installation AT position. Installation AT Advisors (primary and
alternates) must receive Level II AT Training within 120 days of appointment. This requirement cannot be
waived. The installation commander, based on mission need, may waive target grades for the alternate
advisor; however, it must be done in writing. Once the primary and alternate Installation Advisors have
been designated, forward a copy of the appointment letter containing the names, SSANs, security clear-
ances, duty phone numbers and e-mail addresses to HQ AMC/SFOF. Update appointment letters as
changes occur; pen and ink changes are not authorized.
     2.6.1. Installation commanders will designate, in writing, a commissioned officer, non-commissioned
     officer (E-6 or higher) or civilian equivalent as installation ATOs. Primary and alternates will be
     assigned. ATOs shall be trained in AT procedures in a formal service approved level II AT training
     course listed in Attachment 7 and complete the training listed in Table 1.2.

  FP subject matter expert and advisor, for the squadron, unit or agency. Once the primary and alternate
  AT Advisors have been designated, forward a courtesy copy of the appointment letter containing the
  names, SSANs, security clearances, duty phone numbers and e-mail addresses to the Installation AT
  Advisor. Update appointment letters as changes occur; pen and ink changes are not authorized.
  2.6.2. Commanders deploying with their units outside the United States (US) and its territories and
  possessions, will assign a primary and alternate ATO as the unit’s AT subject matter expert/advisor.
  The ATO shall ensure each person within the unit is aware of the terrorism threat, reporting proce-
  dures, and is trained to employ methods that reduce risk or mitigate the effects should an attack occur.
  2.6.2. (AMC) TALCE deployments are not required to have an AT Level II trained individual, how-
  ever, every effort should be made to ensure personnel are fully aware of AT/FP programs and require-
  ments. If the TALCE is designated to stay in place as part of the follow-on force, an AT Level II
  trained individual should be assigned.
  2.6.3. Commanders shall ensure ATOs have access to the AT publications listed in Attachment 1.
  2.6.4. Installation ATOs shall:
  2.6.4. (AMC) The primary Installation Advisor should be appointed, in writing, as the VAMP OPR.
  Provide a separate VAMP appointment letter to AMC/SFOF when changes occur. Do not combine the
  AT Advisor and VAMP letters.
     2.6.4.1. In addition to regularly scheduled FPWGs, meets with installation AFOSI, Security
     Forces, Intelligence office, medical, fire, public health, and other agencies often enough to man-
     age a comprehensive AT program. ATOs will at the same time work closely with intelligence per-
     sonnel to ensure they possess the full spectrum of threat information. Installation ATOs shall
     review MOAs/MOUs with the functional experts, at a minimum annually, and assess the adequacy
     of the MOAs/MOUs to ensure installations are able to respond to terrorist threats/attacks.
     2.6.4.2. Maintain liaison with MAJCOM AT staff officers to ensure AT currency.

34                                    AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


         2.6.4.9. Review new construction with civil engineers from the early planning stage through
         project completion to ensure new and renovated projects meet minimum DoD Antiterrorism/Force
         Protection Construction Standards.
         2.6.4.10. Serve as the OPR for the development of the installation’s AT plan.
         2.6.4.11. Monitors, tracks, and analyzes Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) implementa-
         tion efforts.
         2.6.4.12. When designated by the installation commander, shall implement the responsibilities
         identified in AFPD 10-24, CIP to identify mission critical infrastructures and their vulnerability to
         terrorist attack.

2.7. DoD Standard 7 - Application of Department of Defense (DoD) Terrorism Threat Analysis
Methodology. Commanders shall use the DoD Terrorism Threat Level classification system to identify
the terrorism threat in a specific overseas country.
     2.7.1. The DoD Terrorism Threat Level classification system is a set of standardized terms used to
     quantify the level of terrorism threat on a country-by-country basis. The terrorism threat level terms
     are Low, Moderate, Significant and High, and are defined in Attachment 4. The system evaluates the
     threat using a variety of analytical threat factors. Defense Terrorism Warning Reports are used to con-
     vey terrorist groups are operationally active and specifically targeting US interests. Either DIA or the
     Combatant Commanders, regardless of a country’s assigned threat level, issues warning reports.
     2.7.2. The DIA sets the DoD general terrorism threat level identifying the potential risk to US person-
     nel in a particular country. The DIA will coordinate, for clarity purposes, with DoS to minimize con-
     flicting threat levels assigned by each organization. The DoD threat level applies whether or not US
     personnel are present in the country. CINCs, with geographic responsibilities, may also set terrorism
     threat levels for specific personnel, family members, units and installations in countries within their
     AOR, using the definitions established by DIA. Commanders at all levels shall use their own threat
     analysis as the basis for developing plans and programs to protect assets for which they have AT
     responsibility. Terrorism Threat Levels are estimates with no direct relationship to specific Force Pro-
     tection Conditions (FPCONs). A FPCON is a security posture promulgated by the commander in con-
     sideration of a variety of factors (i.e., a terrorist threat analysis, threat level, etc.). Threat levels should
     not be confused with FPCONs.
     2.7.2. (AMC) All AMC installations are located in CONUS. The DIA is the only DoD agency autho-
     rized to determine the CONUS Terrorism Threat Level. AMC bases do not have the authority to set
     their own terrorism threat level. Commanders should consider the DIA threat level, along with the
     local threat assessment provided by the supporting OSI unit, to develop plans and programs to protect
     their assets. OSI units will provide current Local Threat Assessments (LTA) upon request. These
     LTAs, provide details regarding the current terrorism threat, the current DIA terrorism threat level,
     and any local situations of concern regarding possible threats to the military installations in the area.
         2.7.2.1. (Added-AMC) Per Homeland Security Presidential Directive-3, March 11, 2002, the
         HSAS does not apply to military facilities. Installation AT Advisors and commanders should not
         use the Homeland Security (Terrorist Threat) Advisory System (HSAS) as a point of reference.
         The HSAS is designed to warn the public and private sector and uses different criteria to deter-
         mine the advisory warning level. AMC installation commanders should not execute protection
         measures for their installation based on the HSAS. However, commanders may take action based
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                          35


       on the intelligence information that drove the HSAS warning. Additionally, the DIA terrorism
       threat levels should not be confused or correlated with the Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs).
       Paragraph 2.7. strictly refers to the terrorism threat levels only, as defined in Attachment 4.
   2.7.3. Effective application of the DoD Terrorism Threat Level classification system requires an inte-
   grated terrorism threat analysis, incorporating information collection and analysis from all sources,
   coupled with a thorough understanding of the threat analysis factors. Threat analysis factors must be
   viewed in the context of the specific security environment pertaining to individuals, deployed units,
   facilities and installations resident in the country being analyzed. An integrated terrorism threat
   assessment uses a variety of intelligence information about a specified terrorist group to determine an
   individual, unit, facility and/or an installation’s vulnerability to a specific form of terrorist attack
   based on capabilities of terrorists and terrorist groups. Thus, the threat analysis should be supported by
   intelligence gathering (overseas) and information gathering (domestically) on the part of appropriate
   authorities.
   2.7.3. (AMC) The AMC Threat Working Group (TWG) will, upon written or verbal request from
   OCONUS commanders who don’t have AMC Intelligence personnel assigned, provide the most cur-
   rent terrorism threat in overseas areas of operation. Commanders should also refer to the HQ AMC
   Intelligence homepage for additional threat information. (http://www.amcin.scott.af.smil.mil/
   homeIE.asp)
   2.7.4. (Added-AMC) Installation/site commanders should use intelligence information (to include
   terrorist, criminal and other potential threats, as well as the security environment of the local area) in
   developing/updating plans and programs to protect assets for which they are responsible.

2.8. DoD Standard 8 - Threat Information Collection and Analysis. Commanders shall task the
appropriate organizations under their command to gather, analyze, and disseminate terrorism threat infor-
mation, as appropriate.
   2.8.1. To support the commander, the Services should continuously ensure that forces are trained to
   maximize the use of information derived from law enforcement liaison, intelligence, and counterintel-
   ligence processes and procedures. This includes intelligence procedures for handling priority intelli-
   gence requests for in-transit units, as well as, implementation of procedures to conduct intelligence
   preparation of the battlefield and mission analysis.
   2.8.1. (MACDILL) Risk Assessments. Risk assessments provide commanders a method to assist in
   making resource allocation decisions designed to protect their people and assets from possible terror-
   ist threats in a resource-constrained environment. Commanders shall conduct risk assessments to inte-
   grate threat and vulnerability information in order to make conscious and informed decisions to
   commit resources or enact policies and procedures to mitigate the threat or define the risk. A risk
   assessment allows the commander to obtain a clear picture of the current AT posture and identify
   those areas requiring improvement. During the risk assessment, important information is collected to
   assist in writing the overall AT Plan. While conducting risk assessments, commanders shall consider:
       2.8.1.1. (Added-MACDILL) The terrorist threat.
       2.8.1.2. (Added-MACDILL) The criticality of infrastructures, facilities, and assets.
       2.8.1.3. (Added-MACDILL) The vulnerability of critical infrastructures, facilities, food and
       water, programs, Installation criticality assessment: identify key assets and infrastructures located
       on the installation that traditionally appeal to a specific terrorist group.

        2.8.1.4. (Added-MACDILL) The ability to conduct activities to deter terrorist incidents, employ
        countermeasures, mitigate the effects of a terrorist incident, and recover from a terrorist incident.
        2.8.1.5. (Added-MACDILL) Utilize the Demography/Mission, History, Accessibility, Recog-
        nizability, Population, and Proximity (DSHARPP or MSHARPP) Matrix Explanation.
     2.8.2. Identifying the potential terrorism threat to DoD personnel and assets is the first step in devel-
     oping an effective AT program. Commanders at all levels, who understand the threat, can assess their
     ability to prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack.
     2.8.3. A terrorism threat assessment requires the analysis of all available information on terrorist
     activities. In addition to tasking appropriate agencies to collect information, commanders, at all levels,
     can and should encourage personnel under their command to report information on individuals, events
     or situations that could pose a threat to the security of DoD personnel, families, facilities and
     resources.
     2.8.4. At a strategic level, Headquarters Air Force Directorate of Intelligence, Surveillance and
     Reconnaissance (AF/XOI) is responsible for ensuring the timely collection processing, analysis, pro-
     duction and dissemination of foreign intelligence, current intelligence, and national level intelligence
     information concerning terrorist activities, terrorist organizations, and force protection issues. These
     efforts will focus on, but will not be limited to, transnational and state sponsored entities and organi-
     zations.
     2.8.4. (AMC) Installation/Site Commanders shall task the appropriate intelligence/counterintelli-
     gence organizations under their command to collect, analyze, and disseminate terrorist threat informa-
     tion, as appropriate. Commanders at all levels shall ensure personnel under their command report
     information on events or situations that could pose a threat to the security of DoD personnel and
     resources.
        2.8.4.1. (Added-AMC) To enlist the help of everyone at AMC installations and local communi-
        ties, AFOSI created and manages the US Air Force Eagle Eyes program. The program puts each
        person on the anti-terrorism team by identifying the information needed to recognize and report
        suspicious behavior. This information can be submitted 24 hours a day and is immediately shared
        with the appropriate law enforcement agencies and military commanders for rapid assessment and
        investigation as necessary. Commanders should be familiar with the Eagle Eyes program and can
        contact the local AFOSI unit to obtain briefings and/or Eagle Eyes material (brochures, contact
        cards, etc.).
     2.8.5. Headquarters Air Force Office of Special Investigation (HQ AFOSI) has primary responsibility
     for the collection, all source tactical analysis, production and dissemination to U. S. military com-
     manders, the DOD and U.S. Intelligence communities of terrorist threat information gathered from
     federal, state and local authorities, host nation security services, and counterintelligence (CI) sources.
     2.8.6. (Added-AMC) Although much of the information posted on the Internet is publicly available,
     intelligence professionals must follow established Intelligence Oversight (IO) guidelines regarding
     collection, storage, and dissemination of such Internet information.
     2.8.7. (Added-AMC) Intelligence oversight (IO) also applies to vulnerability assessments (VAs). In
     the conduct of AT/FP awareness and VAs, the local threat assessment must come from the agency with
     the official mission to produce it (OSI for Air Force units). The VA team must use this as their threat
     baseline, and cannot conduct their own threat assessment (primarily applies to CONUS threat assess-
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                           37


   ments where the threat comes from domestic terrorists). IO applies to all AFSCs, not just intel. For
   example, Security Forces members must realize that when acting in an AT/FP or VA capacity, they are
   not engaged in law enforcement activity, and IO restrictions apply.
   2.8.8. (Added-AMC) SECDEF policy guidance for Intelligence Support to Force Protection. Com-
   manders and AT officers must be aware that military members are not to collect or disseminate infor-
   mation on U.S. persons, with very few exceptions. Some AT/FP officers are under the mistaken
   assumption that they can collect information on U.S. persons as long as the information is publicly
   available. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Publicly available information on U.S. persons can only be collected
   if such information is a specifically authorized function of an individual unit’s mission. In general, this
   means CID, OSI and NCIS units. It does not mean AT/FP officers. Source: 181700ZNov98 Message,
   Subj: Policy Guidance for Intelligence Support to Force Protection.
   2.8.9. (Added-AMC) The term “U.S. person” includes “U.S. citizens”. It includes permanent resi-
   dent aliens, unincorporated associations substantially composed of U.S. citizen or permanent resident
   aliens, and corporations incorporated in the U.S. and not directly controlled by a foreign government.
   2.8.10. (Added-AMC) Intelligence oversight applies to all members of the DoD intelligence com-
   munity, not just to collectors. DoD intelligence personnel engaged in any intelligence activity (e.g.
   collection, research, analysis, production, retention, or dissemination), as well as all non-intelligence
   personnel assigned to a DoD intelligence unit, must be familiar with the provisions of EO 12333, DoD
   Regulation 5240.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DoD Intelligence Components That
   Affect United States Persons and AFI 14-104, Oversight of Intelligence Activities.

2.9. DoD Standard 9 - Threat Information Flow. Commanders, at all levels shall forward up and down
the chain of command all information pertaining to suspected terrorist threats or acts of terrorism involv-
ing DoD personnel or assets for which they have AT responsibility.
   2.9.1. The pattern of terrorist surveillance, targeting and planning is best recognized through the shar-
   ing of information. These efforts shall include the chain of command and the interagency process, at
   the appropriate level. When local information indicates gaps, unit commanders should forward timely
   requests for information to AFOSI, AF Intelligence, or other organizations via appropriate intelli-
   gence collection and production channels. Likewise, Component Commanders shall provide transit-
   ing units with tailored terrorist threat information.
   2.9.1. (MACDILL) Commanders at all levels shall forward, up and down the chain of command, all
   information pertaining to suspected terrorist threats or acts of terrorism involving DoD personnel or
   assets for which they have AT responsibility.
   2.9.2. Installation commanders shall establish a Threat Working Group (TWG) to address the threat.
   TWGs generally consist of personnel from AFOSI, IN, SF, SG (Medical Intelligence Officer) and the
   installation ATO. A TWG’s primary function is to assess the threat for the commander and recom-
   mend courses of action to mitigate or counter the threat. Installation commanders should consider
   adding other agencies, particularly CE and SV, as appropriate, to enhance the TWG. A TWG does not
   fulfill the function of a FPWG. The TWG will meet, at a minimum, weekly to review the current threat
   and advise the installation commander accordingly.
   2.9.3. The installation's/activity's servicing AFOSI detachment is the primary focal point for collect-
   ing and reporting the terrorist threat. AFOSI detachments obtain terrorist threat information from a
   wide variety of counterintelligence activities and other sources of information.
38                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     2.9.4. Commanders, down to the installation level, shall develop procedures to ensure Terrorism
     Threat Advisories, Terrorism Warning Reports, Terrorism Threat Level changes, and FPCON changes
     are immediately disseminated to all personnel and, as appropriate, supporting law enforcement agen-
     cies. Commanders should consider using “Giant Voice,” commander access cable channels, cable
     overrides, e-mail, marquees and any other methods that rapidly disseminate threat information to all
     personnel.
     2.9.5. (Added-MACDILL) Unit commanders will ensure personnel report information on events or
     situations that could pose a threat to the security of personnel and resources.
     2.9.6. (Added-MACDILL) AFOSI Det 323 and 6 OSS/IN will work closely with the housing office
     when intelligence indicators affecting off-base housing areas, where our personnel are billeted, are
     present.

2.10. DoD Standard 10 – Potential Threat of Terrorist Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMD). Commanders, at all levels shall take appropriate measures to protect DoD personnel, families,
facilities and material, and reduce the vulnerability to terrorist use of WMD. Thus, CINCs and/or Services
and/or DoD Agencies shall develop WMD Threat Assessments for potential terrorist use of WMD against
personnel and assets for which they have AT responsibility. Reports through the chain of command shall
be processed immediately when significant information is obtained identifying organizations with WMD
capabilities.
2.10. (AMC) Reports will be sent to HQ AMC/SFOF who will in turn pass the information to AFSFC/
SFP.
     2.10.1. AF/XOI and HQ AFOSI collect, assess and disseminate intelligence estimates pertaining to
     the potential terrorist use of WMD, as referenced in DoD O 2000.12-H.
     2.10.1. (AMC) Installation/site commanders shall task the appropriate intelligence/counterintelli-
     gence organizations under their command to collect, analyze, and disseminate terrorist threat informa-
     tion pertaining to the potential terrorist use of WMD.
     2.10.2. HQ AFOSI will incorporate terrorist use of WMD into their installation’s threat assessment.

2.11. DoD Standard 11 - Adjustment of Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs). Combatant com-
manders have ultimate AT and force protection authority and responsibility within their AOR. Service
chiefs are responsible for AT and force protection authority for those personnel and assets for which they
have AT responsibility within the 50 United States. Commanders at all levels shall develop a process,
based on terrorism threat information and/or guidance from higher headquarters, to raise or lower
FPCONs.
2.11. (AMC) The FPCON development process will incorporate the procedures outlined in paragraph
2.12. as supplemented.
     2.11.1. The process to raise or lower FPCONs shall be tailored to the local mission and allow higher
     headquarters to direct downward implementation. The FPCON process shall comply with the guid-
     ance contained in DoD O-2000.12-H.
     2.11.1. (AMC) AMC/SFO is the executive agency for accomplishing FPCON messages for AMC/
     CC or AMC/CV release. All messages will be coordinated with the AMC FPWG/FPB prior to release,
     time permitting. All AMC generated FPCON messages to raise, lower, or initiate measures will be
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                     39


  coordinated with the AMC Command Center (previously referred to as TACC/EA Cell) after coordi-
  nation with AMC/CC or AMC/CV. After coordination with AMC Command Center, AMC/SF will
  transmit the message via DMS to the appropriate address group(s). AMC Command Center will also
  release an FPCON message to AMC command posts, IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Table
  3.1, rule 7b, Terrorist Events and Attachment 3.
  2.11.2. Downward directed FPCONs (force protection condition alerting message [FPCAM]) require
  implementation of all measures for that FPCON, as listed in DoD O-2000.12-H, unless the directing
  authority grants relief.
     2.11.2.1. Periodically, after the initial FPCON implementation date, installation commanders
     shall reassess the local threat and report to higher headquarters conditions that would warrant a
     change to the current FPCONs and proposed measures to be taken based on the reassessment
     2.11.2.1. (AMC) Installation commanders cannot lower higher-level directed FPCON measures
     without the higher-level commander’s concurrence, IAW paragraph 2.13.2.1. Installation com-
     manders shall provide proposed measures for higher-level consideration, to the Director, Security
     Forces (AMC/SF) through DMS or official email. Provide a courtesy copy to the TACC Director
     of Operations (Senior Controller) through AMC Command Center, on all FPCON correspon-
     dence.
     2.11.2.1. (MACDILL) Changes in the local threat to MacDill AFB and downward directed threat
     changes will be evaluated by the TWG. Recommendations for action will be forwarded to the
     Wing Commander for approval.
     2.11.2.2. (Added-AMC) AMC SF Commanders will notify AMC/SF of any FPCON measures
     the installation is unable to fully implement. The memorandum will include corrective action,
     ECD for full implementation, and installation OPR.
  2.11.3. (Added-AMC) AMC installations will utilize a standard FPCON sign system. These stan-
  dards are meant to reduce visual clutter at facility entrances, provide a professional appearance, and
  quickly communicate the current FPCON condition. FPCON “NORMAL” signs will not be dis-
  played. Only the AMC format shown at Attachment 12 (Added) (Figure A12.1. (Added) AMCVA
  10-245, Force Protection Condition A, Figure A12.2. (Added) AMCVA 10-246, Force Protection
  Condition B, Figure A12.3. (Added) AMCVA 10-247, Force Protection Condition C, and Figure
  A12.4. AMCVA 10-248, Force Protection Condition D.) will be used. These Visual Aids are posted
  separately at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil and
  http://www.amc.scott.af.mil/pubs/hqamc.htm.
  2.11.3. (MACDILL) All MacDill AFB organizations will utilize the following AMC FPCON visual
  aids to identify the current FPCON: AMCVA 10-245 (ALPHA), AMCVA 10-246 (BRAVO),
  AMCVA 10-247 (CHARLIE), or AMCVA 10-248 (DELTA). Organizations will use the following
  new MacDill FPCON EXERCISE visual aids to identify the appropriate FPCON during exercises:
  MACDILLAFBVA 10-249 (ALPHA), MACDILLAFBVA 10-250 (BRAVO), MACDILLAFBVA
  10-251 (CHARLIE), or MACDILLAFBVA 10-252 (DELTA) (see Attachment 13 (Added)-Attach-
  ment 16 (Added)).
     2.11.3.1. (Added-AMC) FPCON signs will be printed on colored paper or cardstock IAW their
     ISP and/or AT Plan.
     2.11.3.1. (MACDILL) FPCON signs will be printed on white heavyweight paper or cardstock.
40                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


        2.11.3.2. (Added-AMC) Sign sizes may be either 4 ¼” x 5 ½” or 8 ½” x 11”. The smaller format
        is preferred in most situations.
        2.11.3.2. (MACDILL) MacDill AFB organizations will utilize a standard FPCON sign system.
        These standards are meant to reduce visual clutter at facility entrances, provide a professional
        appearance, and quickly communicate the current FPCON condition.
        2.11.3.3. (Added-AMC) Signs will be laminated and mounded parallel with frame or mullion.
        Use minimal clear tape to affix the sign to the door in a location that is immediately visible at each
        entrance to the facility.
        2.11.3.3. (MACDILL) Facilities with glass doors will use an 8 ½” x 11” clear acrylic document
        holder with four suction cups. The sign holder must be mounted to the door in a location that is
        immediately visible upon entering the facility. The 8 ½” x 11” clear, acrylic document holder can
        be obtained from the on base supply store.
        2.11.3.4. (Added-AMC) If laminated signs cannot be used at particular facility or entrance, rec-
        ommend using clear acrylic document holders that won’t detract from the appearance of the facil-
        ity and that can be left empty when conditions are normal. The sign holder must be permanently
        mounted to either the door or wall in a location that is immediately visible upon entering the facil-
        ity. Use an adhesive (clear silicon on glass doors) or screws to fasten the frame/holder to the door
        or wall. Avoid flexible sheet protectors or paper signs mounted directly with tape, as these do not
        present a proper professional image.
        2.11.3.4. (MACDILL) Facilities without glass doors will use an 8 ½” x 11” wooden document
        holder. The sign holder must be mounted to the wall in a location that is immediately visible upon
        entering the facility. The 8 ½” x 11” wooden document holder can be obtained from the on base
        supply store.

2.12. DoD Standard 12 - FPCON Measures Implementation. CINCs and/or Services, and/or DoD
Agencies shall ensure that FPCON transition procedures and measures are properly implemented and dis-
seminated by subordinate commanders.
2.12. (AMC) Develop local checklists from DoD O-2000.12-H, Protection of DoD Personnel and Activ-
ities against Acts of Terrorism and Political Turbulence. As a minimum, follow FPCON measures out-
lined in Attachment 3 of this supplement and the AFI. Commanders at all levels shall establish local
measures to transition between FPCONs. These procedures will be included in installation AT plans.
     2.12.1. Tenant units, regardless of MAJCOM or service component, shall conform to the host instal-
     lation's FPCON. Additionally, tenants shall participate in all exercises with the host unit.
     2.12.1. (AMC) Tenants on AMC bases should coordinate owning MAJCOM/Service directed
     FPCON changes with the host, and seek concurrence prior to implementation. Installation Command-
     ers will consider the request, determine local threats, and make a base-wide determination. There
     should only be one FPCON on AMC bases with final determination by the installation/site com-
     mander.
     2.12.2. All agencies shall report their FPCON changes IAW AFMAN 10-206, Operational Report-
     ing. MAJCOM/SFs and FOAs will relay the FPCON change as soon as possible to HQ AFSFC Oper-
     ations Center, DSN: 473-0960, or SIPRNET hqafsfc@acc.af.smil.mil and/or STU III DSN:
     473-5543 for secure communications.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                              41


   2.12.3. (Added-AMC) After-action reports, containing comprehensive discussion of lessons learned
   will be forwarded to HQ AMC/SFOF within 30 days of a reported terrorist threat or terrorist incident.

2.13. DoD Standard 13 - FPCON Measures. Commanders at all levels, both stationary and in transit,
shall develop site-specific measures or action tasks for each FPCON which supplements those measures/
actions enumerated for each FPCON as listed within Appendix A of DoD O-2000.12-H (reference c). An
AT Plan with a complete listing of site-specific AT measures, linked to a FPCON, will be classified, as a
minimum, CONFIDENTIAL. When separated from the AT Plan, site-specific AT measures and FPCONs
remain FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (if classification is necessary, mark as follows: Classified by: DoDI
2000.16, Standard 13, 14 Jun 01; Reason: 1.5(a); Declassify on: X4). These measures will change as the
threat situation increases from FPCON Normal to FPCON Delta.
   2.13.1. In developing site-specific FPCON measures, the commander must always consider those
   additional FPCON measures, which permit sufficient time and space to determine hostile intent, par-
   ticularly in accordance with the Standing Rules of Engagement. The component commander’s organic
   intelligence, counterintelligence, law enforcement resources, institutional knowledge of their area of
   AT responsibility and comprehensive understanding of unit capabilities, supported by national and
   theater assets, shall be leveraged in directing tailored FPCON measures to be implemented at specific
   sites for both stationary and in-transit units. To support both the component and local commanders in
   this effort, CINCs with geographic responsibilities should negotiate with host nations for authority to
   implement AT measure to provide such time and space.
   2.13.2. Commanders, at all levels (i.e. installation, tenant, GSU levels etc), shall establish local mea-
   sures to supplement DoD O-2000.12-H procedures to transition between FPCONs. Whereas Terror-
   ism Threat Levels are analytical assessments of terrorist activity in a country, FPCONs are graduated
   categories of measures or actions commanders take to protect personnel and assets from attack.
       2.13.2.1. Commanders, at all levels shall set local FPCONs. Subordinate commanders may raise
       a higher-level commander’s FPCON for those personnel and assets for which they have AT
       responsibilities. However, subordinate commanders shall not lower a higher commander's
       FPCONs without the higher-level commander's concurrence. Commanders shall ensure proper
       notifications are made.
       2.13.2.1. (AMC) Installation/Site Commanders may implement higher FPCONs based on local
       conditions. Downward directed FPCON changes for AMC units will come from or through AMC/
       CC. In those instances where local threats are absent, commanders will seek clarification from
       AMC prior to increasing FPCONs. There should only be one FPCON on AMC bases with final
       determination by the installation/site commander.
       2.13.2.2. Installation and GSU commanders shall establish specific FPCON measures (tailored to
       the local mission, conditions, and the terrorist threat) to augment the DoD FPCON measures,
       listed in Attachment 3.
       2.13.2.3. Installation commanders must continuously evaluate available information about local
       terrorist activity to determine whether a terrorist threat to installation facilities or personnel exists.
       If the information warrants action, select and declare the appropriate FPCON. Commanders may
       modify their locally developed FPCON measures based on their requirements and to counter local
       threats.
42                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


        2.13.2.3. (AMC) Installation commanders may implement higher FPCONs without prior notifi-
        cation if the threat warrants. Notify AMC Command Center as soon as possible after declaration
        of a higher FPCON, but not later than 12 hours after. Installation AT Advisors will notify AMC/
        SFOF via official email, within 3 hours of an Installation commander’s determination to imple-
        ment higher FPCONs and will include the AMC Command Center as an action addressee.
     2.13.3. Installation commanders, in coordination with the installation TWG and/or FPWG, shall
     review local FPCON measures semi-annually to ensure threat mitigation measures are appropriate.
     Consideration shall be given to the most recent VA and current AFOSI counterintelligence threat
     assessment, when conducting this review.
     2.13.3. (AMC) Document the semi-annual review and attach with the local FPCON measures. In the
     case of a FPWG, maintain minutes to provide review upon request.
     2.13.4. Installation and GSU commanders shall develop and implement a Random Antiterrorism
     Measures (RAM) program according to DoD O-2000.12-H that will include all units on the installa-
     tion. The RAM program shall be included in AT plans and tie directly with all FPCONs (including
     FPCON Normal), as listed in DoD O-2000.12-H to ensure continuity and standardization among the
     Services, should threats require USAF-wide implementation. Installations shall add local measures as
     required.
     2.13.4. (AMC) Installations will develop and implement local Random Antiterrorism Measures
     (RAMs) encompassing all units from across the installation. RAMs will include all organizations on
     an installation to include (but not limited to) NAF functions, DECA, AAFES, local area schools on
     the installation, higher headquarter tenants. Installations with higher headquarters tenants will coordi-
     nate RAM employment with the Director of Staff (DS), or Executive Officer where the DS function
     does not exist.
        2.13.4.1. At least three RAMs chosen from higher FPCONs are required daily. RAM times for
        implementation, location and duration shall be regularly changed to avoid predictability.
        2.13.4.2. RAM execution shall be broad based and involve all units and personnel. ATOs are
        required to monitor, track and analyze RAM implementation efforts. Installation commanders will
        develop procedures to ensure RAMs are being conducted and reported to the ATO.
        2.13.4.2. (AMC) Two of the three mandatory daily RAMs will be non-Security Forces related.
        RAMs will be employed during all FPCONs (including NORMAL) to enhance force protection.
        As a minimum, utilize the required RAMs contained in DoD 0-2000.12-H. Locally developed
        measures should be used, as directed by the installation/site commander. Base entry point checks
        (BEPCS) do not count as installation RAMs.
     2.13.5. Installation commanders shall incorporate AT measures in plans for functions such as change
     of commands, open houses, air shows and organized off-base activities.
     2.13.5. (AMC) Installation commanders will develop local procedures, outlined in the installation AT
     plan.

2.14. DoD Standard 14 - Commanders Shall Maintain a Comprehensive AT Program for Those
Personnel and Assets for Which They Have AT Responsibilities. Planning is critical to deterrence,
detection, defense and response to terrorist incidents. Where possible, commanders may use as a guide,
the DoD Deputy Directorate for Operations (Combating Terrorism) J34, AT/FP Planning Template
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                           43


CD-ROM and WMD Appendix. in DoDI 2000.16. The AT plan and elements shall clearly describe
site-specific AT measures. The AT plan and elements should be written from the CINC, Service, or DoD
Agency level, down to the installation level for permanent operations or locations and incorporated in
operations orders for temporary operations or exercises.
   2.14.1. To be proactive, all AT programs shall include tenets of countersurveillance (CS), counterin-
   telligence (CI) and other specialized skills as a matter of routine, and shall identify an appropriate
   organization as the focal point for the integration of local and/or host nation intelligence, counterintel-
   ligence and criminal intelligence information into AT operations. To that end, commanders at all lev-
   els shall constantly strive to ensure that proactive techniques and assets can be incorporated to detect
   and deter terrorists. CINCs and Services should ensure component commanders incorporate CI/CS
   assets in support of in-transit units, particularly at higher threat-level areas.
   2.14.2. Commanders, down to installation and GSU level, will develop and implement an AT plan.
   Commanders may use a stand-alone plan or include AT annexes in their existing force protection plan.
   Guidelines on AT planning are found in AFMAN 10-401, Volumes 1 & 2. Stand-alone documents
   (i.e., Standard Operating Procedures, local regulations, or Operations Orders that articulate require-
   ments for AT key elements) shall be replicated in and/or referenced in the AT Plan. Task appropriate
   level units for support, ensuring all organic, tenant and supported units are considered, and receive
   copies of the plans.
   2.14.2. (AMC) AT/FP plans will be assessed during higher headquarters program reviews as identi-
   fied in Standard 26 to DoDI 2000.16 and paragraph 3.26 in the AFI. Plans shall address areas outlined
   in DoD Standard 2 as supplemented, and include these additional areas to meet security requirements
   (NOTE: this list is not all inclusive): media control during terrorist incidents, FPCON procedures, to
   include the means to rapidly advise all units of FPCON changes, and all DoD elements and personnel
   for whom the installation/activity has force protection responsibility. See paragraph 2.5.3. for addi-
   tional guidance.
       2.14.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC installations will establish a stand-alone AT plan. A copy of the
       installation AT plan will be forwarded to AMC/SFOF. For those installations that do not already
       have a stand-alone plan, they have 180 days from the date of this supplement to comply.
   2.14.3. At a minimum, the AT Plan shall address the following key elements:
   2.14.3. (AMC) Installation AT Plans will also include:
       2.14.3.1. Terrorism Threat Assessment (see Standard 15)
       2.14.3.2. Vulnerability Assessment (see Standard 26)
       2.14.3.3. Risk Assessment (see Standard 15)
       2.14.3.4. AT Physical Security Measures (see Standard 16)
       2.14.3.5. Terrorist Incident Response Measures (see Standard 17)
       2.14.3.6. Terrorist Consequence Management Measures (see Standard 18)
       2.14.3.7. (Added-AMC) Oversized Vehicle/Contract Vehicle Gate Operations.
       2.14.3.8. (Added-AMC) Installation Entry Point Overwatch Procedures.
       2.14.3.9. (Added-AMC) Guidance for conducting Local Vulnerability Assessments.

        2.14.3.10. (Added-AMC) Team membership for conducting Local Vulnerability Assessments.
        2.14.3.11. (Added-AMC) Employment of High-Tech screening devises i.e., ION Scanners/Sniff-
        ers, Vehicle X-Ray, Thermal Imagers, etc.
        2.14.3.12. (Added-AMC) Local FPCON procedures, either attached to (CONFIDENTIAL) or as
        an Annex (FOUO).
        2.14.3.13. (Added-AMC) Barrier Plan with numbers and priorities for employment. Physical
        drawings of placement for the barriers are required. The Barrier Plan must be coordinated with all
        base agencies, with emphasis on response force units to include: Fire Department, Medical Group,
        Security Forces and Alert Crews.
     2.14.4. (Added-AMC) The installation force protection corporate structure, e.g., ISC, FPWG, will
     review all AT plans annually and when the local threat level changes. Installation AT Advisors will
     document and maintain all reviews of AT plans with the existing publication. Discrepancies should be
     corrected as soon as possible but before the next annual review.
     2.14.5. (Added-AMC) All organizations on AMC installations will forward their specific AT/FP
     plans to the installation AT Advisor.

2.15. DoD Standard 15 - Terrorism Threat Assessment. Commanders shall prepare a terrorism threat
assessment for those personnel, assets, and mission critical infrastructures for which they have AT respon-
sibilities. Threat assessments shall be prepared at least annually and should identify the full range of
known or estimated terrorist capabilities for use in conducting VAs and planning countermeasures. Threat
analysis is required to adequately support risk management decisions of both stationed forces within, and
those in-transit through, higher-threat areas including ports, airfields and inland movement routes. Terror-
ism threat assessments shall be the basis and justification for recommendations on AT enhancements, pro-
gram/budget requests and the establishment of FPCONs.
2.15. (AMC) Installation OSI offices will forward a copy of their Terrorism Threat Assessment to
AFOSI Region 3, no later than 30 days after completion or when changes occur.
     2.15.1. The terrorism threat assessment is the tool that commanders shall use to arrive at a judgment
     of risk and consequences of terrorist attack. Commanders shall integrate threat information prepared
     by the intelligence community, technical information from security and engineering planners and
     information from other sources to prepare their assessments. In addition to the annual threat assess-
     ment used for AT Program planning, continuous analysis of threat information is required to support
     the threat warning process.
     2.15.1. (MACDILL) Threat Assessments. Evaluation of intelligence, threat analysis, and vulnerabil-
     ities to assess the local threat and give input to command on suggested countermeasures and dissemi-
     nation of information and warnings. Commanders shall prepare a terrorism threat assessment for those
     personnel, assets, and mission critical infrastructures for which they have AT responsibilities. Threat
     assessments shall be prepared at least annually and should identify the full range of known or esti-
     mated terrorist capabilities for use in conducting vulnerability assessments and planning countermea-
     sures. Threat analysis is required to adequately support risk management decisions of both stationed
     forces within, and those in-transit through, higher-threat areas including ports, airfields, and inland
     movement routes. Terrorism threat assessments shall be the basis and justification for recommenda-
     tions on AT enhancements, program/budget requests, and the establishment of FPCONs.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                     45


  2.15.2. CINCs and/or Services, and/or DoD Agencies shall designate which subordinate commanders
  will prepare these terrorism threat assessments. This normally applies to installation commanders and
  above.
     2.15.2.1. AFOSI will provide the installation’s counterintelligence threat assessment, which will
     address the threats from terrorism, agitational and subversive groups, criminal elements, and for-
     eign intelligence services. The counterintelligence threat assessment will be prepared annually
     and as changes in the threat require. AFOSI shall also provide a counterintelligence threat assess-
     ment to Air Force units deploying overseas. Upon notification of deployment, unit commanders
     will immediately contact their servicing AFOSI detachment and request a counterintelligence
     threat assessment. The assessment will be provided within 15 days of the unit's departure. .
     2.15.2.1. (MACDILL) AFOSI Det 323 will provide the installation’s counterintelligence threat
     assessment that will address the threats from terrorism, agitational and subversive groups, crimi-
     nal elements, and foreign intelligence services. The counterintelligence threat assessment will be
     prepared annually and as changes in the threat require.
  2.15.3. The process of producing terrorism threat assessments should include, as a minimum, liaison
  with the country team, host national security, husbanding contractor, and port authority, where appli-
  cable.
  2.15.4. Risk assessments provide commanders with a method to assist them in making resource allo-
  cation decisions designed to protect their people and assets from possible terrorist threats in a
  resource-constrained environment. Commanders shall conduct risk assessments to integrate threat and
  vulnerability information in order to make conscious and informed decisions to commit resources or
  enact policies and procedures to mitigate the threat or define the risk. A risk assessment allows the
  commander to obtain a clear picture of the current AT posture and identify those areas requiring
  improvement. During the risk assessment, important information is collected to assist in writing the
  overall AT Plan. While conducting risk assessments, commanders shall consider the following four
  elements:
  2.15.4. (AMC) Installation/Site Commanders shall ensure terrorist threat assessments for their area
  of responsibility are incorporated in the risk assessment development process and included in appro-
  priate AT/FP plans.
     2.15.4.1. The terrorist threat.
     2.15.4.2. The criticality of infrastructures, facilities and assets.
     2.15.4.3. The vulnerability of critical infrastructures, facilities, food and water, programs, and
     systems to acts of terrorism (refer to paragraph 2.26.).
     2.15.4.4. The ability to conduct activities to deter terrorist incidents, employ countermeasures,
     mitigate the effects of a terrorist incident, and recover from a terrorist incident.
  2.15.5. The installation risk assessment must be reviewed annually by the Installation FPWG.
  2.15.6. (Added-MACDILL) AFOSI Det 323 will be responsible for conducting and publishing an
  annual local threat assessment. It will be updated once new threat information arises.
  2.15.7. (Added-MACDILL) The Commander, AFOSI Det 323, will prepare an annual local criminal
  and terrorist threat assessment to identify potential threats to MacDill AFB. This assessment will be
  updated when significant information arises or at the request of the 6 AMW/CC.
46                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     2.15.8. (Added-MACDILL) The TWG, FPWG, and FPEC will conduct an annual review of the local
     terrorist threat assessment or when new information arises.

2.16. DoD Standard 16 - AT Physical Security Measures. AT physical security measures shall be con-
sidered, must support, and must be referenced within the AT Plan to ensure an integrated approach to ter-
rorist threats. Where there are multiple commanders at an installation, the installation commander is
responsible for coordinating and integrating individual unit physical security plans and measures into the
AT Plan.
     2.16.1. Tenant and in-transit units will comply with the host installation’s AT physical security mea-
     sures.
     2.16.1. (AMC) AT plans must include tenant activities and/or DoD elements and personnel for whom
     the commander has force protection responsibility. Where there are multiple command authorities on
     the installation, the installation/site commander is responsible for coordinating the physical security
     plans for all units on the installation. Review these program plans on an annual basis or when the local
     threat level changes.
     2.16.2. The AT physical security measures shall integrate facilities, equipment, trained personnel and
     procedures into a comprehensive effort designed to provide maximum AT protection to personnel and
     assets. Well-designed AT physical security measures include detection, assessment, delay, denial and
     notification. This is best accomplished through the development of a synchronized matrix that out-
     lines who will do what, where, when and how. The measures should include provisions for the use of
     physical structures: physical security equipment; chemical, biological, radiological detections and
     protection equipment; security procedures; RAMs; response forces and emergency measures suffi-
     cient to achieve the desired level of AT protection and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack.
     RAMs constitute a particularly effective method of deterrence of terrorist attack and should be used
     for both in place and transiting forces.
        2.16.2.1. Installation commanders shall incorporate physical security actions for the installation’s
        AT program in the installation security plans, full spectrum threat response plan, public affairs
        plans and/or resource protection plans. Forward all plans to the installation ATO. Plan actions
        shall be incorporated into the overarching AT plan and include the following:
            2.16.2.1.1. AT physical security measures.
            2.16.2.1.2. FPCON measures (must be site specific).
            2.16.2.1.3. Access control and entry control points.
            2.16.2.1.4. Mass notification.
            2.16.2.1.5. Delay elements - barrier plan, perimeter controls, RAMs and sensors.
            2.16.2.1.6. Response elements - security and law enforcement assets, contract/hired forces,
            unit guards, Resource Augmentation Duty (READY) and on-call support from reaction forces.
            2.16.2.1.7. Assessment of appropriate response measures, installation priorities and proce-
            dures for enhanced AT measures.
            2.16.2.1.8. Vulnerabilities and associated countermeasures (i.e., measures in a classified
            annex).
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                           47


           2.16.2.1.9. AT training and education.
           2.16.2.1.10. Physical security of family members.
           2.16.2.1.11. Coordination/integration of individual unit physical security plans and measures.
   2.16.3. The installation barrier plan shall list in priority order: gates, roads and facilities to be pro-
   tected and types of passive barriers (i.e., serpentine jersey barriers, speed bumps, hedgehog barriers)
   to be used. The plan will detail the number of barriers required, where the barriers will be maintained/
   pre-positioned, the required equipment and the personnel assigned to move them and a detailed map
   of where/how the barriers will be placed. Installation commanders are highly encouraged to pre-posi-
   tion barriers at installation gates and key facilities to allow for the most rapid response to increased
   threats. Include basic elements of this plan as sub-elements of installation FPCON measures.
   2.16.3. (AMC) AMC installation commanders should not solely use pre-positioned temporary barri-
   ers as encouraged in the AFI since AMC/CV policy is to program for aesthetic, permanent barriers
   (refer to Force Protection Sustainment Team report, 4 Mar 2002). Examples include, benches, devel-
   oped trees and shrubs, and high curbing on roadways. This also includes permanent, movable/remov-
   able barriers such as gates, drop arms and removable bollards. The intent is to eliminate jersey barriers
   wherever possible because of their appearance and temporary nature. The installation commander has
   discretion on how and where pre-positioned barriers will be employed.
       2.16.3.1. (Added-AMC) The installation barrier plan will be an annex in the installation AT plan.

2.17. DoD Standard 17 - Terrorist Incident Response Measures. Limiting the effects and the number
of casualties resulting from an attack will undermine the terrorist’s overall objectives. An effective inci-
dent response strategy and capability can contribute to deterring terrorist attacks if our adversaries recog-
nize the US ability to limit the effects of their attacks. Thus, installation and/or afloat commanders shall
prepare installation-wide and/or shipboard terrorist incident response measures. These measures shall
include procedures for determining the nature and scope of terrorist incident response; procedures for
coordinating security, fire and medical first responders; and steps to reconstitute the installation’s ability
to perform AT measures. Terrorist Incident Response measures should address the full scope of an instal-
lation’s response to a terrorist incident. The nature of the response depends on many factors. The character
of operations underway at the time of the terrorist incident will have significant bearing on the scope,
magnitude and intensity of response.
   2.17.1. Terrorist incident response measures shall include emergency response and disaster planning/
   consequence management for installation engineering, security, law enforcement, logistics, medical,
   mass casualty response, transportation, personnel administration and local/host nation support. In
   addition, special circumstances imposed by the nature of a terrorist attack may require broader analy-
   ses to include higher levels of authority or command. A terrorist attack on DoD installations requires
   immediate, close coordination with higher command.
   2.17.1. (AMC) Close coordination must also be maintained with local authorities. Terrorist incidents
   may not be confined within the boundaries of the installation. Maintain appropriate MOA/MOUs that
   detail the response and containment efforts of incidents that are not confined to an installation.
   2.17.1. (MACDILL) The 6 AMW OPLAN 31-1, 6 AMW Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR)
   Plan 10-2, 6 AMW OPLAN 10-245, and 6 MDG Plan 41-4-97, Medical Contingency Response Plan,
   published under separate covers, outline specific terrorist incident response measures for incidents on
   MacDill AFB. Terrorist incident response measures shall include:
48                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


        2.17.1.1. It is critical that geographic CINCs are able to deploy in a timely manner an organic Ter-
        rorist Incident Response Team capable of providing advice to the host nation, supporting emer-
        gency lifesaving and rescue functions, providing protection to DoD personnel and property,
        reducing the effects of further damage, and when appropriate, conducting/supporting criminal
        investigations. This preparation shall include the integration of teams in contingency planning for
        in-transit units. All MAJCOMs shall prepare command-wide terrorist incident response measures
        and ensure integration with the appropriate geographic CINC’s Terrorist Incident Response Team.
        2.17.1.1. (AMC) Commanders of AMC tenant units will ensure procedures for the protection of
        AMC personnel are included in the host installation’s terrorist incident response plan. Likewise,
        installation commanders will ensure procedures for protection of tenant organizations are included
        in their terrorist incident response plan.
        2.17.1.2. Terrorist incident response measures shall include host nation/local law enforcement
        procedures to coordinate and employ response including communications, security, fire, explosive
        ordnance disposal (EOD) and medical. As terrorist attacks are criminal acts subject to prosecution,
        preservation of the scene for evidence collection and processing shall be addressed to the extent
        possible and when it would not jeopardize human life.
        2.17.1.3. (Added-MACDILL) Emergency response and disaster planning.
        2.17.1.4. (Added-MACDILL) Consequence management for installation engineering.
        2.17.1.5. (Added-MACDILL) Security and law enforcement responsibilities.
        2.17.1.6. (Added-MACDILL) Logistics and transportation.
        2.17.1.7. (Added-MACDILL) Medical and mass casualty responses.
        2.17.1.8. (Added-MACDILL) Personnel and administration.
        2.17.1.9. (Added-MACDILL) Local county/state/federal support.
            2.17.1.9.1. (Added-MACDILL) Include procedures for interagency coordination, communi-
            cation, and employment of available resources, et al, security, fire, explosive ordnance dis-
            posal, and medical.
            2.17.1.9.2. (Added-MACDILL) Treat any terrorist incident as a criminal act and preserve the
            scene for evidence collection and processing to the greatest extent possible and when it would
            not jeopardize human life.
     2.17.2. Installation commanders shall establish an incident response plan to ensure the installation
     can respond to a terrorist attack. This plan may be an annex in existing plans. This plan/annex will
     include procedures for determining the nature and scope of post-incident response measures, plans to
     reconstitute the installation’s ability to perform AT measures, handle mass casualties and other areas
     as outlined in DoD Standard #17. For more detailed response measures to incidents involving WMD,
     refer to Annex D to the Full Spectrum Threat Response Plan, OPLAN 10-2., which may be cross-ref-
     erenced as a sup-portion of the overall installation AT plan. This plan will, as a minimum, be exer-
     cised annually.
     2.17.2. (AMC) The incident response plan will be coordinated with the Installation CE readiness
     flight via the installation Readiness Working Group. The plan will be exercised annually. Installation
     commanders should ensure coordination with off-base local response agencies are integrated into the
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                             49


  exercise. When possible, a physical exercise is recommended over a “table-top” exercise. At no time,
  will there be two “table-top” exercises back-to-back.
  2.17.3. Installation service contracts will include measures to preclude the unmonitored presence of
  cleaning or other service personnel in vulnerable facilities. Contracts should also include procedures
  to have personnel consent to criminal background checks prior to being granted entry onto the instal-
  lation.
  2.17.3. (AMC) Installation AT Advisors will establish a process to ensure all service and/or contrac-
  tor personnel have adequate background checks before access is granted to the installation or vulner-
  able facilities. Determine installation vulnerable facilities using CARVER and/or D(M)SHARPP. The
  installation should correlate with the critical facility list in the AT Plan and/or ISP. The process to
  determine contractor access should be part of the AT Plan.
      2.17.3.1. (Added-AMC) All installation contracts (wing generated) require an extensive force
      protection review. Installation commanders will establish procedures to ensure all contracts are
      reviewed for adequate force protection measures. See paragraph 2.5.2. for HQ AMC FPWG pro-
      cess as a model.
  2.17.4. Installation entry control procedures will be established for non-base connected personnel
  attending education classes, sporting events teams or other functions. Individuals should be briefed
  that their privileges are restricted to transit to and from the location of the activity. Installations should
  consider a means to readily identify (by distinctive pass or other identification) vehicles and personnel
  admitted to the installation for these purposes.
  2.17.4. (AMC) Installation entry procedures for non-base personnel attending base events should be
  included in the Installation Security Plan, IAW AFI 31-101, as supplemented. These procedures
  should be referenced in the AT Plan.
  2.17.5. Inclusion of Off-Installation Personnel in AT Plans. Commanders shall ensure Terrorism Inci-
  dent Response measures contain current residential location information for all DoD personnel and
  their family members, when stationed outside of the United States, territories, and possessions in
  Moderate, Significant and High Terrorism Threat Level areas. Such measures should provide for
  enhanced security and/or possible evacuation of DoD personnel and their dependents. Furthermore,
  commanders in Moderate, Significant and High Terrorism Threat Level areas should investigate spe-
  cial security arrangements to protect DoD personnel and their dependents living on the economy.
  Close coordination with other US government agencies and the host nation is essential to ensure effec-
  tive allocation of security resources and protection of DoD personnel.
  2.17.6. (Added-MACDILL) Special circumstances imposed by the nature of a terrorist attack may
  require broader analysis to include higher levels of authority or command. A terrorist attack on DoD
  installations requires immediate, close coordination with higher command.
  2.17.7. (Added-MACDILL) Employment of tactical measures to contain or resolve terrorist inci-
  dents: a standardized crisis response to include off-base personnel. These measures shall include pro-
  cedures for determining the nature and scope of terrorist incident response; procedures for
  coordinating security, fire, and medical first responders; and steps to reconstitute the installation’s
  ability to perform AT measures.
  2.17.8. (Added-MACDILL) Terrorist Incident Response measures should address the full scope of
  an installation’s response to a terrorist incident. The nature of the response depends on many factors.
50                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     The character of operations underway at the time of the terrorist incident will have significant bearing
     on the scope, magnitude, and intensity of response.
     2.17.9. (Added-MACDILL) 6 CONS will ensure installation service contracts include measures to
     preclude the unmonitored presence of cleaning or other service personnel in vulnerable facilities.
     Contracts should also include procedures to have personnel consent to criminal background checks
     prior to being granted entry onto the installation.

2.18. DoD Standard 18 - Terrorist Consequence Management Measures. Although not an element
of AT, commanders shall include terrorist consequence management preparedness and response measures
as an adjunct to the installation AT Plan. The Terrorist Consequence Management measures should
include emergency response and disaster planning and/or preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack for
installation engineering, logistics, medical, mass casualty response, transportation, personnel administra-
tion and local and/or host nation support. In addition, special circumstances imposed by the nature of a
terrorist attack may require broader analyses to include higher levels of authority or command. Terrorist
use of WMD, or terrorist attacks on dignitaries, while visiting DoD installations, will require immediate
close coordination with higher command and the host nation and/or federal, state, and local authorities.
2.18. (AMC) Terrorist consequence management preparedness and response measures will be included
in the AT plan. Ensure the AT plan includes any necessary guidance and measures not addressed in other
installation plans. Do not duplicate the consequence management portions of other installation plans such
as the Full Spectrum Threat Response Plan 10-2, the Medical Contingency Response Plan, and the Civil
Engineer Contingency Response Plan. However, where applicable, ensure the AT plan clearly and specif-
ically references the relevant sections and paragraphs of other plans.
     2.18.1. Terrorist Consequence Management planning will be in accordance with AFI 10-2501 and
     will address:
     2.18.1. (MACDILL) Although not an element of AT, commanders shall include terrorist conse-
     quence management preparedness and response measures as an adjunct to the installation AT Plan.
     The Terrorist Consequence Management measures should include emergency response and disaster
     planning and/or preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack for installation engineering, logistics,
     medical, mass casualty response, transportation, personnel administration, and local and/or host
     nation support. In addition, special circumstances imposed by the nature of a terrorist attack may
     require broader analyses to include higher levels of authority or command. Terrorist use of WMD or
     terrorist attacks on dignitaries, while visiting DoD installations, will require immediate close coordi-
     nation with higher command and the host nation and/or federal, state, and local authorities.

annually. AT training and exercises shall be provided the same emphasis afforded combat task training
and executed with the intent to identify shortfalls impacting the protection of personnel and assets against
terrorist assault and subsequent consequence management efforts. AT training, particularly pre-deploy-
ment training, shall be supported by measurable standards and include credible deterrence/response, tac-
tics, techniques, and procedures. AT training shall also be incorporated into unit-level training plans and
pre-deployment exercises. To realize incorporation of lessons learned, commanders should maintain exer-
cise documentation for no less than one year.
     2.19.1. Commanders, at all levels, shall ensure joint and/or combined operations and/or exercises
     incorporate AT training and planning for forces involved. To realize incorporation of lessons learned:
     2.19.1. (AMC) Local command authorities will exercise all portions of their AT plans annually. Exer-
     cises shall involve local off-base agencies to the extent possible, and encompass duty and non-duty
     hours. Exercises shall include all tenant activities and/or DoD elements and personnel for whom the
     commander has force protection responsibility. Properly documented “Real World” scenarios may
     satisfy portions of this requirement. Exercises should not be limited to raising and lowering FPCONs.
     Documentation should be maintained at the installation level; however, installation AT Advisor’s will
     maintain documentation of all AT exercises for 2 calendar years.
        2.19.1.1. AF installations/sites shall exercise and evaluate the installations overall AT Awareness
        posture IAW Table 1.1 of this instruction and DoDI 2000.16, Standard 22, table 1.1. Exercise the
        installation terrorism incident response plan annually.
        2.19.1.2. Pre-deployment training regimes shall include credible deterrence and response stan-
        dards and deterrence-specific tactics, techniques and procedures. Pre-deployment training shall
        also include terrorist scenarios and hostile intent decision-making.
        2.19.1.3. AT training shall also be incorporated into unit-level training plans and exercises.
        2.19.1.4. Installation commanders will ensure base-wide training exercises are conducted annu-
        ally IAW the AT Plan. The exercises shall include all FPCON measures, evacuation procedures,
        notification plan, terrorist use of WMD and other key areas outlined in their installation’s AT
        Plans.
        2.19.1.4. (AMC) It is the AT Advisors inherent responsibility to ensure the installation com-
        mander is aware of their role in exercise requirements.

2.20. DoD Standard 20 - Comprehensive AT Review. Commanders at all levels shall review their own
AT Programs and Plans at least annually to facilitate AT program enhancement. Furthermore, for the same
purpose, commanders at all levels shall likewise review the AT program and plan of their immediate sub-
ordinate in the chain of command at least annually. While such reviews do not constitute a VA, they are
intended to ensure compliance with the standards contained in this Instruction. To ensure the design and
implementation of physical security measures coincident with the AT program are consistent with the
local terrorist threat level, AT programs shall also be reviewed when the terrorism threat level changes.
2.20. (AMC) AMC’s review of installation AT programs and plans will be conducted during unit staff
assistance visits (SAV). AMC CE, SC, SG, and SF directorates will conduct installation AT/FP reviews
under their purview, during unit SAVs. AMC/SFO will conduct installation AT/FP reviews during secu-
rity forces SAVs at an installation. All AMC reviews of installation AT/FP programs will be documented
and maintained at the AMC/SFOF section.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                      53


   2.20.1. AF installations/sites will review and exercise their AT Program/Plan, listed in paragraph
   2.20., at least annually.
   2.20.1. (AMC) AMC/SFO also conducts review of the installation AT program via the US
   TRANSCOM (USTC) Force Protection Oversight Program (FPOP) located on the SIPRNET. This
   database provides oversight with the standards contained herein. The updates to the FPOP are com-
   pleted by AMC/SFOF semi-annually, utilizing an expanded Unit Compliance Checklist (UCI),
   received by each installation AT Advisor, 1 Apr & 1 Oct. Additional quarterly reporting to the data-
   base will be accomplished by AMC/SFOF without the use of checklist updates from the installation
   AT Advisor. Checklist completion is only required during the April and October reporting periods.
   AMC/CC monitors the FPOP as necessary, through the USTC FP directorate. Specific review of the
   AT Plan is not part of the FPOP.

2.21. DoD Standard 21 - General Requirements for AT Training. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD
Agencies shall ensure all assigned personnel receive appropriate training to advance AT awareness. Indi-
vidual records shall be updated to reflect AT training in accordance with DoD Component policy.
2.21. (AMC) Modification to the MILPDS program is not complete. As an interim measure, unit ancil-
lary training managers will document (through any available method) the full name, rank, ssan, and date
of training for each member receiving Level I training. This documentation will be kept on file for three
years or two months after permanent change of station (PCS). Retention of the record beyond a member's
PCS will provide Level I verification to a gaining commander, should the question arise. Refer to para-
graph 2.22.4. for further documentation requirements.
   2.21.1. AF installations/sites will update AT awareness training IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Train-
   ing Program.
   2.21.2. (Added-AMC) Installation commanders will program funds for training courses such as
   Level II Installation AT Training, Dynamics of International Terrorism, Combating Terrorism on Mil-
   itary Installations, and the Individual Terrorism Awareness Course. NOTE: Do not request funding
   quotas for Air Education and Training Command funded schools as these are not funded locally.

2.22. DoD Standard 22 - Level I AT Awareness Training. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agen-
cies shall ensure that every military service member, DoD employee, and local national hired by the DoD,
regardless of rank, is made aware of the need to maintain vigilance for possible terrorist actions and
employ AT tactics, techniques and procedures, as discussed in DoD O-2000.12-H and Joint Pub 3-07.2.
Furthermore, the Air Force shall offer Level I AT Awareness Training to contractor employees, under
terms and conditions as specified in the contract.
   2.22.1. CINCs, and/or Services, and/or DoD Agencies shall ensure every family member accompa-
   nying DoD personnel overseas is made aware of the need to maintain vigilance for possible terrorist
   actions and employ AT tactics, techniques and procedures, as discussed in 2000.12H and Joint Pub
   3-07.2. Thus, family members 14 years and older (or younger at discretion of the DoD sponsor) trav-
   eling beyond CONUS on official business, (i.e. on an accompanied permanent change of station
   move) shall receive Level I AT Awareness Training as part of their pre-departure requirements. Fur-
   thermore, the commander should encourage family members to receive Level I AT Awareness Train-
   ing prior to any OCONUS travel ( i.e., leave).
54                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     2.22.1. (AMC) Commanders will develop written procedures to provide Level I training, conducted
     prior to overseas TDY or PCS. Family members, 14-years and older traveling beyond CONUS on
     official orders (not to include leaves) will receive Level I AT Awareness Training as part of their
     pre-departure requirements. Personnel who have not completed Level I Awareness training will not be
     issued orders for overseas travel. Gaining commanders may deny travel to personnel who do not
     accomplish AT Level I training. Every member should have access to the Joint Staff Guide 5260,
     available via
     https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/ (click on Office, then locate HQ AFSFC, then select Force Pro-
     tection Division, followed by Reference Library, and finally JCS Documents, for the JS Guide and
     other appropriate documents).
     2.22.2. Individual security awareness and individual AT training are essential elements of an overall
     AT program. Each individual must be exposed at the earliest opportunity to share the responsibility of
     ensuring alertness and the application of personal protection measures. Therefore, CINCS/and/or Ser-
     vices and/or DoD agencies shall provide Level I AT Awareness Training in basic training or in general
     military subject training for all initial entry Service and DoD Agency personnel.
     2.22.3. Thereafter, CINCs, and/or Services, and/or DoD agencies shall provide Level I AT Awareness

        deployment will receive Level I AT Awareness Training annually. All uniformed personnel
        attached to an AMC installation will receive Level I AT Awareness Training annually. For the pur-
        pose of providing training, AAFES and DECA personnel eligible to deploy OCONUS should be
        provided Level I training. Installation AT Advisors should make every attempt to ensure personnel
        not assigned under the installation commander, receives Level I training. Tenant organizations
        should comply with the host installation’s Level I AT Awareness Training requirements. AT Advi-
        sors must document lack of cooperation in achieving installation-wide Level I training.
        2.22.3.3. Annually to all CONUS-based DoD personnel, regardless of duty status, if the CONUS
        Terrorism Threat Level is promulgated above "MODERATE."
        2.22.3.4. Annual Level 1 AT awareness training may be accomplished by any level II certified
        personnel or per DoD sponsored computer-based training and/or distance learning.
     2.22.4. Level I training shall be documented as follows:

     ing with the date of completion in Military Modernization Personnel Data System (MILPDS).
     2.22.4.3. Unit training mangers shall document Level 1 AT awareness training through normal
     ancillary records when documentation through PCS/TDY checklist or MILPDS is not possible.
  2.22.5. The unit responsible for preparing orders shall refer to DoD 4500.54-G, DoD Foreign Clear-
  ance Guide (can be web-accessed at http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg/geninfo1.htm) for individuals
  going PCS or TDY and ensure compliance and documentation of AT training.
  2.22.6. AF installation/site commanders shall:
     2.22.6.1. Develop procedures to ensure Level I AT Awareness Training is offered to all military
     service and DoD employee family members traveling OCONUS on unofficial travel such as leave.
     2.22.6.2. Ensure everyone traveling to DoD-designated high physical threat countries, as defined
     in the Foreign Clearance Guide, receives (briefed) the OASD SO/LIC or USAF/ILT DoD Travel
     Security Advisories and any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) travel advisories.
     2.22.6.3. Report quarterly to HQ USAF/XOFP, (through installation ATOs through MAJCOM
     ATOs) all personnel who arrive on-station without Level I AT Awareness Training. Full Name,
     Rank, Sending Unit, Sending MAJCOM, Receiving Unit, Receiving MAJCOM and total number
     of gains for the period shall be included in the report. (RCS: HAF-SFC(AR)0126, Training

  ods:
     2.22.8.1. Attending a formal Service-approved Level II ATO Training course of instruction (see
     Table 1.2 for minimum training standards). The training must include a review of current AT pub-
     lications and methods for obtaining AOR-specific terrorism threat analysis, updates and warnings.
56                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


        2.22.8.2. Certification by the installation commander. Installation commanders, may qualify indi-
        viduals who are subject matter experts and have received formal training in AT and individual pro-
        tection measures (i.e., security forces, AFOSI special agents, etc.) and who have received specific
        formal training in AT tactics, techniques, and procedures. Installation commanders may individu-
        ally exempt these individuals from the Level II ATO training requirements, as outlined in Table
        1.2, if the individuals have also received training that covers reviewing current AT publications
        and identifying methods for obtaining AOR-specific updates.
        2.22.8.2. (AMC) AMC installation commanders will not exempt individuals from Level II AT
        training requirements. Personnel within AMC who perform Level I AT Awareness Training will
        be trained at an approved MTT or school, as found in Attachment 7. Installation AT Advisors
        must receive Level II AT Training within 120 days of appointment (see paragraph 6). This require-
        ment cannot be waived.
            2.22.8.2.1. All Air Force AT Officers/NCOs (required by Standard 6) will receive formal edu-
            cation at an approved Level II course. This requirement cannot be waived. Installation com-
            manders may qualify individuals to deliver Level I training, as stated in the previous
            paragraph, but not designate them as their Standard 6 AT Officer/NCO. Attachment 7 lists
            USAF approved courses.
     2.22.9. HQ AFOSI and HQ AFSFC/SFP jointly develop AT awareness briefings for use in delivering
     Level I training. AFOSI will prepare and ensure the AOR specific terrorist threat is updated quarterly
     or when significant changes in the threat warrant. Level I training offered by other Services or DoD
     agencies meets DoD requirements as long as they fulfill all requirements listed in Table 1.1.
        2.22.9.1. Table 2.1. below outlines Level I AT Awareness Training requirements.

3-07.2.                                             and AOR- specific requirements, as provided
                                                    by the receiving geographic CINC.

2.23. DoD Standard 23 - AOR-Specific Training Requirements for all DoD Personnel. CINCs with
geographic responsibilities shall ensure that all DoD personnel entering their AOR have been provided
access to AOR-specific information on AT protection.
   2.23.1. CINCs, with geographic responsibilities have significant responsibilities for protecting per-
   sonnel within their AOR. Individuals traveling outside CONUS for either permanent or temporary
   duty shall have completed annual Level I AT Awareness Training and have received an AOR-specific
   threat update within three months prior to travel. This information may be provided through multiple
   means including CINCs publications, messages, and computer home pages. Losing CINCs and/or
58                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     Services and/or DOD Agencies shall ensure that personnel departing to another CINC’s geographical
     AOR shall be exposed to and execute the requirements of the gaining CINC’s AOR-update.
     2.23.2. Furthermore, to enhance the situational awareness and AT preparedness of units prior to tran-
     sit through and/or deployment to heightened threat areas, gaining CINCs, with geographic responsi-
     bilities, shall provide detailed threat information covering transit routes and sites that will be visited
     by the deployed unit. Such information shall include detailed, focused information on potential terror-
     ist threat (i.e., tailored production and analysis) to aid in the development of tailored AT planning.
     Since component commanders possess organic intelligence and organic or supporting law enforce-
     ment resources, institutional knowledge of their AOR and a comprehensive understanding of unit
     capabilities, they are best suited to provide such information, when augmented or supported by
     national and theater assets.
     2.23.3. Commanders shall ensure personnel deploying, PCSing, or traveling on leave outside the
     CONUS receive pre-deployment AT awareness training with a special emphasis on AOR-specific ter-
     rorist and medical threats. Commanders shall develop procedures to ensure this training is conducted
     prior to departing home station and AOR-specific information is incorporated into their pre-deploy-
     ment AT Level I awareness-training program. AOR-specific threat briefing information for the geo-
     graphic CINCs can be found on the Internet & SIPRNET sites listed in Attachment 5.
     2.23.3. (AMC) Procedures will prohibit the issuance of orders for overseas travel (deployed, PCS,
     TDY or leave) for those personnel who have not received AT/FP training with special emphasis on
     AOR-specific threat and medical threats. Refer to Attachment 5 for AOR specific web sites.
     2.23.4. (Added-AMC) Mobility aircrews, accomplish annual AT training IAW AFI 10-245, The Air
     Force Antiterrorism(AT) Program Standards and MDS specific AFI 11-2 series training instructions.
     Document this training as ARMS Event Code G110 (AT Level I Awareness Training).
     2.23.5. (Added-AMC) AT training may be accomplished as part of the aircrew intelligence briefing.
     Prior to departing home station on missions outside the CONUS, crews will receive a briefing empha-
     sizing terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military developments in the area in which they will
     be operating. This briefing will also include AOR specific AT information as directed by the geo-
     graphic CDR, OPORD, or OPLAN. Once in theater, aircrews should receive an intelligence update
     upon initial arrival at a forward operating location (FOL) or enroute stop, and thereafter as significant
     developments occur.
     2.23.6. (Added-AMC) Aircrews and Phoenix Raven personnel who have received Level I AT/FP
     training in the past year, regularly deploying to OCONUS locations, retain an AT/FP training status
     similar to individuals deployed (TDY/PCS) continually to overseas locations. This training status
     remains in effect as long as they have traveled OCONUS within the past 6 months. Individuals who
     experience a break in travel of more than 6 months do not fall into this category, and are required to
     accomplish the required training prior to deployment.
     2.23.7. (Added-AMC) AT awareness training is required for travel to Puerto Rico even though it is a
     US territory.

2.24. DoD Standard 24 - Level II Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) Training. Level II ATO Training is
designed to produce an AT advisor to the commander. CINCs and/or Services and/or DoD Agencies shall
ensure that each installation and/or deploying unit (i.e., battalion, squadron, ship) is assigned at least one
Level II ATO trained individual.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                         59


2.24. (AMC) Individuals appointed as installation AT Advisors (primary and alternates) must attend
Level II training within 120 days of appointment. Installation AT Advisors must be an E-6 or above.
These personnel serve as advisors to the installation commander. Personnel appointed to this position
should be in place at least one year. Installation commanders must appoint their AT Advisors in writing.
   2.24.1. Level II training is designed to qualify individuals assigned as installation ATOs. The training
   also serves as the primary venue for qualifying AT representatives that deploy forward as AT Advi-
   sors. Each AF installation and deploying unit will assign a primary and alternate ATO who will attend
   Level II training as a minimum standard. While not required, ATOs may also attend courses such as
   Dynamics of International Terrorism (DIT), Combating Terrorism on Military Installations, and other
   Service Level II Courses to enhance their proficiency. Level II graduates can also provide Level I
   training. Each installation requiring Level II training for their assigned ATO or other personnel will
   schedule training through their MAJCOM/SF or MAJCOM training course IAW MAJCOM instruc-
   tions. Level II training is open to all career fields.
   2.24.1. (AMC) Installation AT Advisor will schedule Level II training through AMC/SFXT for their
   unit AT Advisors. Personnel selected to attend the Level II course must be prioritized as follows: (1)

   other specialties on the installation key to successful UTC deployment, i.e., combat logistics, commu-
   nications, prime beef, medical personnel and other unique teams. Submit prioritized Level II training
   requests to HQ AMC/SFXT through the Installation AT Advisor. Requests must include full name,
   rank/grade, SSN, security clearance, and duty phone to facilitate orders preparation. Each organiza-
   tion on the installation should have a primary and alternate AT Advisor, as part of the Installation AT
   Program.
   2.24.2. MAJCOMs who desire to establish their own Level II training programs, will submit a Plan of
   Instruction to HQ AFSFC/SFP for approval prior to initiating any training.
   2.24.2. (AMC) AMC installations should use the Air Mobility Warfare Center (AMWC), Ft Dix, NJ
   for their Level II AT Training. Other training sites are available on a case-by-case basis. All requests
   for training should be through AMC/SFXT.
       2.24.2.1. All Air Force Level II programs will use the standardized curriculum based on the
       requirements for Level II courses found in Table 1.2. MAJCOMs may add command-specific
       requirements to the core curriculum. MAJCOMs will develop measurable standards for Level II
       training and determine evaluation methods to ensure trainees are proficient.
           2.24.2.1.1. MAJCOMs shall conduct an annual review of their Level II Course Curriculum,
           using lesson plans developed by the Nov 00, USAF AT Training Workshop to validate mini-
           mum curriculum content. HQ AFSFC/SFP maintains the master lesson plans, located on the
           HQ AFSFC web site, Force Protection Division, AT/FP Training, at
           https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/
           2.24.2.1.2. Each Level II course will maintain a reference library of all publications, listed in
           Attachment 1 to this publication.
           2.24.2.1.3. Each course will develop an AF Form 797 to task certify personnel serving as
           instructors.
           2.24.2.1.4. While not required, each Level II course should add the following capabilities to
           enhance the effectiveness of their Level II courses:

        Academic Instructor School, Basic Instructor Course, etc. The Principles of Instruction course is
        the minimum required standard.
            2.24.5.1.1. Personnel may begin instructing students without having completed this require-
            ment provided they have a certified instructor serving as the Assistant Instructor. However,
            they are required to have a date to attend one of the above courses within 90 days of assign-
            ment of these duties.
        2.24.5.2. Be a graduate of an approved Level II Antiterrorism Course listed in Attachment 7.
        2.24.5.3. Shadow a Level II Certified Instructor as the Level II course is being taught.
        2.24.5.4. Be task certified on an AF Form 797.

        courses such as Dynamics of International Terrorism (DIT), Combating Terrorism on Military
        Installations and other Service Level II courses. Additionally, conducting over-the-shoulder obser-
        vations of higher headquarters Vulnerability Assessment Teams adds to credibility and subject
        matter expertise.
     2.24.6. Personnel may receive credit for Level II training through any of the following:
        2.24.6.1. By attending any of the training courses listed in Attachment 7 of this instruction.
        2.24.6.2. RAVEN graduates prior to Jan 2001 are awarded AT Level II credit based on the curric-
        ulum in place prior to the aforementioned date. RAVEN graduates after Jan 2001 are not autho-
        rized to perform duties as ATOs or Level I instructors, due to additional training requirements
        listed in DoDI 2000.16, Table 1.1 and this instruction.
        2.24.6.3. USAF personnel, who attend Level II courses conducted by other Services, will receive
        credit for completing Level II training. These personnel, upon completion of training and return to
        home station, will report to the Formal Training Section of their servicing Military Personnel
        Flight with their Certificate of Training. Formal training will update the individual's completion of
        training via (OTA) Database.
        2.24.6.3. (AMC) AMC units requiring training at other than Air Force courses of instruction must
        receive approval by AMC/SF prior to course selection. Individuals who are trained at other than
        Air Force courses of instructions should not serve as AT advisor to an Air Force installation com-
        mander, unless specific instruction encompasses Air Base vulnerability assessments. Squadron/

   2.24.10. Level IV AT Executive Seminar. The Level IV AT Executive Seminar is designed to expose
   senior officers in the grade of O-6 through O-8 and DoD civilians equivalent in grades to AT issues.
   2.24.10. (AMC) U.S. TRANSCOM Force Protection (TCFP) receives quotas from the Joint Staff and
   allocates positions to AMC throughout the year. Installation AT Advisors should coordinate requests
   for available seminar slots through their Installation CC to AMC/SFOF. AMC/SFOF will conduct a
   cursory review of the duty position of the individual request, then forward the request to TCFP who
   will make final determination on allocation of seminar slots.
       2.24.10.1. AF Level IV Executive-Level Commander Training is accomplished by the Combat-
       ing Terrorism Directorate of the Joint Staff (J34). It is designed for installation commanders, Joint
       Task Force (JTF)/Battle Group level commanders, and those responsible for AT policy, planning
       and execution. Once training quotas are established through J34, allocations are made through the
       AF General Officer Matters Office and AF Colonel Matters Office. Nominee selection will be by
       position, based on assignment in, or to high-risk locales.
       2.24.10.2. Table 2.4. Outlines Level IV AT Executive Seminar training requirements.

   2.24.11. Commanders at all levels, who receive individuals that are not properly trained, shall, in the
   interest of force protection, provide the required AT training as soon as practicable upon the gain.
   Concurrently, they shall report the deficiency through their DoD component chain of command. The
   DoD component shall subsequently notify the providing commander and ensure appropriate measures
   are generated to prevent reoccurrence of the discrepancy.
   2.24.11. (AMC) Installation commanders must have processes in place to ensure personnel assigned
   are not deployed or PCSed to a gaining commander without the proper level of AT training required
   herein. Failure to provide training must be corrected as soon as identified to alleviate reoccurrences.

2.25. DoD Standard 25 - Training for High-Risk Personnel and High-Risk Billets. C I N C s a n d / o r
Services and/or DoD Agency Heads have been given substantial AT responsibilities for DoD personnel
assigned to high-risk billets or at high risk to terrorist attacks. High-risk personnel are eligible for
advanced AT training. In some instances, this training may be extended to include family members.
2.25. (AMC) In accordance with DoD Directive 2000.12, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Program, and DOD
2000.12-H, Protection of DoD Personnel and Activities Against Acts of Terrorism and Political Turbu-
66                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


lence, installation commanders and AMC Staff Directors will conduct annual reviews of high-risk billets
and identify all high-risk personnel assigned to their units/staff. When feasible, these personnel should
attend a regional orientation course (Middle East Orientation Course, Latin America Orientation Course,
etc.) at the United States Air Force Special Operations School, Hurlburt Field FL. Other available courses
include the Individual Terrorism Awareness Course at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center at Fort
Bragg, North Carolina. Emergency response and medical incident command system officers are encour-
aged to attend terrorism response courses developed by the Department of Justice and Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). AMC installation/site commanders deployed or deploying outside the
continental United States will designate high-risk personnel based on localized threats at the deployed
location.
     2.25.1. The Services and DoD Agency Heads shall ensure personnel designated as “Personnel at
     High-Risk to Terrorist Attack” and “Personnel Assigned to High-Risk Billets” receive appropriate
     training. To this end, CINCs with geographic responsibilities shall communicate high-risk positions
     and high-risk personnel to their Service authority for AT, not less than annually to enable the Services
     to provide for the requisite training. Whenever possible, the Services should conduct the appropriate
     AT training of designated personnel prior to arrival in theater.
     2.25.2. MAJCOM, FOA and DRU commanders decide if senior Air Force officials assigned to or vis-
     iting high-threat areas will be designated high-risk personnel.
     2.25.2. (AMC) All AMC general officers and senior executive schedule equivalents are designated
     “high-risk” personnel when assigned to high-risk/high-threat areas.
     2.25.3. Travel of high-risk personnel. When the threat dictates, commanders shall restrict details of
     the travel arrangements for high-risk individuals or senior officials (general officer or civilian equiva-
     lent) to reduce the vulnerability to attack. Unless absolutely necessary for travel security, do not stop
     public announcements of special events, guest speakers or other ceremonies senior officials attend.
     Make such announcements without divulging the specific travel itinerary or local arrangements.
     2.25.4. Itineraries for high-risk billeted personnel and personnel susceptible to terrorist attacks shall,
     at a minimum, be marked For Official Use Only (FOUO). Consider classifying travel itineraries as
     CONFIDENTIAL, when officials travel to high-threat areas. Declassify itineraries when the trip is
     over.
     2.25.4. (AMC) Executive officers, executive secretaries, and others responsible for accomplishing
     itineraries for general officers and DAF civilian equivalents are responsible for marking travel itiner-
     aries for official use only (FOUO) or classifying the itineraries confidential when required.
     2.25.5. During increased FPCONs, residential and travel security of assigned or visiting high- risk
     personnel or other probable terrorist targets, should be increased to counter the threat. Ensure these
     personnel receive timely security awareness briefings. For the most serious cases, request protective
     services from AFOSI. AFOSI will provide protective services, including long-term protective service
     operations (PSO), when specific, credible threats exist and when the requester and AFOSI jointly
     determine such protection is needed.

2.26. DoD Standard 26 - Vulnerability Assessment of Installations.
     2.26.1. Assessment Focus. Vulnerability assessment shall focus on the assessed installation overarch-
     ing AT program. AT programs should be subject to continual assessment to avoid complacency and
     gain benefit from experience from other assessments. Evolving terrorism threats, changes in security
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                           67


  technology, development and implementation of alternative concepts of peacetime operations and
  changing local conditions make periodic assessment essential. VAs will normally occur at the installa-
  tion commander level and above; however, because VAs are critical to forces transiting through ports,
  airfields, and inland movement routes, geographic CINCs shall ensure component commanders con-
  duct VAs frequently enough to ensure timely and accurate information is available. These assessments
  should consider the range of identified and projected terrorism threats against a specific location or
  installation, personnel, family members, facilities and other assets. The assessment should identify
  vulnerabilities and solutions for enhanced protection of DoD personnel and resources.
     2.26.1.1. AT Assessment Functional Areas. AT VAs provide a vulnerability-based analysis of an
     activity's AT program. The assessment identifies, for the commander, vulnerabilities that may be
     exploited by terrorists and suggests options that may eliminate or mitigate those vulnerabilities.
     The assessment team shall evaluate the installations overall AT Awareness posture IAW Table 1.1
     of this instruction and DoDI 2000.16, Standard 22, table 1.1.
     2.26.1.2. All VAs will be classified in accordance with the DTRA Security Classification Guide.
     2.26.1.2. (AMC) Vulnerability Classification Rules. A portion of the document where a vulnera-
     bility has been identified and it is associated with a specific U.S. military site identified in the
     same portion of the report is classified Confidential, at a minimum. A portion of the document
     where a vulnerability has been identified but is not associated with a specific U.S. military site
     identified in the same portion of the report is FOUO. When in doubt, the vulnerability should be
     classified.
  2.26.2. There are two types of VAs: the local VA and the higher headquarters VA.
     2.26.2.1. Installation commanders shall have the ATO form a multi-functional VA team (i.e.,
     AFOSI, CE, SV, SF, IN, SC, MG, etc.) to conduct the local VA. The VA shall address the full spec-
     trum of threats to mission-essential critical infrastructures and assets, security of personnel, phys-
     ical threats and installation infrastructures. Utilities, facilities with large populations, food, water,
     fire protection, medical response, communication centers, etc., shall all be addressed in the assess-
     ment. The assessment shall provide solutions for enhanced protection of DoD personnel and
     resources. Installation commanders shall forward copies of the VA to their NAF and MAJCOM to
     help coordinate resource allocation and advocacy.
     2.26.2.1. (AMC) Conducting a local VA demands a dedicated effort from all organizations and
     should be cohesive and jointly orchestrated. Daily cross-functional meetings enhance the assess-
     ment process. Commanders should release vulnerability assessment team members from their pri-
     mary duties for the duration of the assessment. Normally, a local vulnerability should not take
     more than two weeks to complete. Installation commanders should be out-briefed upon conclusion
     of the assessment. Installation commanders shall validate and forward a copy of the local VA to
     their respective NAF and AMC/SFOF within 15 days of completion of the report. Local VA
     reports must be accomplished within 60 days of completion of the assessment.
         2.26.2.1.1. Local VAs shall be conducted at least annually, except for those years when a
         higher headquarters VA is conducted.
         2.26.2.1.1. (AMC) Local VAs are not required to be conducted during the calendar year of a
         Higher Headquarters (HHQ) VA, however, there should be a period of no more than 15 months
         prior to, or preceding the HHQ VA. All local VAs must be documented and signed by the
         installation commander.
68                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


            2.26.2.1.1. (MACDILL) A local vulnerability assessment is not required during the calendar
            year of a higher headquarters assessment; however, there should not be a period of more than
            15 months between any level of assessment. All local assessments must be signed by the
            installation commander.
     2.26.3. Higher Headquarters (HHQ) VAs. CINCs/Services/Agencies shall ensure lower level AT Pro-
     grams receive a HHQ VA, at least once every three years, to ensure unity of AT efforts throughout
     their subordinate commands. Each CINC, Service Chief and DoD Agency Director shall track and
     identify vulnerabilities throughout the chain of command. As a minimum, each commander or direc-
     tor shall prioritize, track and report to the next general/flag officer, the action to be taken to address
     vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability assessment.
     2.26.3. (AMC) Installation commanders shall prioritize, track and report to their respective NAF
     commander, the action to be taken to address vulnerabilities identified in the VA. Refer to paragraph
     2.26.13. for additional guidance on use of the VAMP. All local VAs must be inputted into the VAMP.
     2.26.3. (MACDILL) The Installation ATA coordinates the schedule of all higher headquarters
     (JSVIA, AF, and AMC) Vulnerability Assessment Team visits/inspections through the FPWG, TWG,
     6 AMW/CVI, and the Wing Gatekeeper.
        2.26.3.1. Installation commanders shall work with their MAJCOM to ensure they receive such
        assessments once every three years as a minimum, or as specified by the CINC with responsibility
        for the AOR. To provide essential visibility, as a minimum, installation commanders shall priori-
        tize, track and report the vulnerabilities identified to the next general officer or equivalent and the
        action taken following the VA.
        2.26.3.1. (AMC) Installation commanders will contact AMC/SF if problems arise in receiving a
        HHQ VA within three years, as a minimum.
     2.26.4. JSIVA, AF or MAJCOM VA Teams shall accomplish HHQ VAs. Each of these agencies may
     conduct independent or joint assessments. The Air Force VA Team (VAT) may also conduct
     "over-the-shoulder" observations of MAJCOM assessments and conduct other assessments, as
     directed by AF/XOF or the Air Staff FPWG. MAJCOMs may establish a team to conduct the assess-
     ments and, if established, shall provide a copy of their assessment schedule to AFSFC/SFP by 15 Sep-
     tember annually. Installations scheduled to receive AF VAs shall provide the information requested in
     Attachment 6 of this instruction to HQ AFSFC/SFP NLT 30 days prior to their scheduled assessment
     by way of e-mail.
     2.26.4. (AMC) HQ AMC will conduct independent VAs of AMC installation/sites in addition to
     those conducted by the AF team and the JSIVA.
        2.26.4.1. (Added-AMC) AMC VAT members may provide over-the-shoulder MAJCOM repre-
        sentation of all JSIVA or Air Force VAs. Prior coordination between the HHQ VA team leader and
        the FPWG representative is paramount, and required. Every effort should be made by AMC/SF to
        provide the over-the-shoulder representative, however any VAT member may assist.
        2.26.4.2. (Added-AMC) Installation AT Advisors will coordinate all actions for HHQ VAs with
        AMC/SFOF.
     2.26.5. HHQ VA Scheduling. MAJCOM SFs are responsible for keeping track of the frequency and
     scheduling of VAs for their subordinate installations. HQs AFSFC schedules HHQ VAs contingent on
     input from the MAJCOM SF. This process is accomplished once a year with candidate installation
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                         69


  input provided from the MAJCOM SF to HQ AFSFC. HQ AFSFC will request VA nominees by 15
  September of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the assessment.
  2.26.5. (AMC) HQ AMC/SF schedules JSIVA, AF and AMC vulnerability assessments of AMC
  installations and sites through HQ AF/XOFP. The schedule will be coordinated with the HQ AMC/IG
  Gatekeeper and the respective installation /site commander.
  2.26.6. HHQ VAs satisfies the annual requirement for Local VAs.
  2.26.6. (AMC) HHQ VAs take the place of the Local VA, however, no more than 15 months must
  pass between a HHQ and the next Local VA.
  2.26.7. VA Site Criteria. HHQ VAs shall be conducted at DoD components, housing areas, facilities
  and/or activities/locations and command levels identified as "installations." For the purposes of this
  instruction, the following defines an assessment-eligible installation:
  2.26.7. (AMC) VAs will ensure installation/site commanders have included all tenant organizations
  (on the installation/site or remote but administratively attached), into force protection plans, and that
  they are afforded the same level of AT/FP support as AMC units.
     2.26.7.1. Any DoD facility consisting of 300 or more personnel on a daily basis.
     2.26.7.2. Any DoD facility bearing responsibility for emergency response and physical security
     plans and programs.
     2.26.7.3. Any DoD facility possessing authority to interact with local non-military or host nation
     agencies or having agreements with other agencies or host nation agencies to procure these ser-
     vices.
     2.26.7.4. HHQ VAs may be conducted at any DoD Component Activity, when CINCs, and/or
     Services and/or Agencies identify a time critical requirement or emergent need.
  2.26.8. VAs conducted to meet the requirement contained in this standard must assess as a minimum,
  the following functional areas:
  2.26.8. (AMC) Use the CARVER matrix and/or the D(M)SHARPP criteria when conducting critical-
  ity and vulnerability assessments. Descriptions on CARVER and D(M)SHARPP are at Attachment
  10 (Added) and Attachment 11 (Added).
     2.26.8.1. AT Plans and Programs. The assessment shall examine the assessed installation's/activ-
     ity's AT program and ability to accomplish appropriate standards contained in DoDI 2000.16, this
     AFI, and applicable prescriptive standards established by the appropriate CINC/Service/Agency.
         2.26.8.1.1. The assessment shall examine written plans in the areas of counterintelligence,
         law enforcement liaison, intelligence support, security and post-incident response (the ability
         of the installation/activity to respond to terrorist incidents, especially mass casualty events, to
         include a disease outbreak caused by terrorist use of a biological weapon).
         2.26.8.1.2. The assessment shall examine the degree to which plans complement one another
         and support the assessed installation's/activity's ability to identify changes in the terrorist
         threat, react to threat changes by implementing appropriate AT measures and provide appro-
         priate responses should a terrorist event occur.
         2.26.8.1.3. The assessment shall examine the availability of resources to support plans as
         written and the frequency and extent to which plans have been exercised.
70                               AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     2.26.8.2. Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement Liaison and Intelligence Support. The assess-
     ment shall focus on an installation’s/activity’s ability to receive threat information and warnings
     from HHQ and local resources, actively collect information on the threat (when permitted), pro-
     cess that information to include local fusion and analysis, and develop a reasonable postulated
     threat statement of the activity. The assessment shall also examine an installation’s/activity’s abil-
     ity to disseminate threat information to subordinate commands, tenant organizations, in-transit
     units, geographically separated units and assigned or visiting DoD personnel (including military
     members, civilian and contractor employees and family members). The assessment shall also
     examine how the process supports the implementation of appropriate force protection measures to
     protect military personnel, DoD civilians, and family members.
         2.26.8.2.1. The assessment shall focus on the most probable terrorist threat for the installa-
         tion/activity and appropriate countermeasures. In cases where no identified threat exists, the
         installation/activity shall be assessed on their ability to implement AT measures under increas-
         ing FPCONs, in response to increased terrorist threat levels or terrorist threat warnings.
     2.26.8.3. AT Physical Security Measures. The assessment shall determine the assessed installa-
     tion's/activity's ability to protect personnel by detecting or deterring terrorists, and failing that, to
     protect by delaying or defending against terrorist acts. Physical security techniques include proce-
     dural measures such, as perimeter security, security force training, security surveys, medical sur-
     veillance for unnatural disease outbreaks and armed response to warning or detection. The
     assessment shall also determine physical security measures such as fences, lights, food and water,
     intrusion detection devices, access control systems, closed circuit television cameras, personnel
     (to include Resource Augmentation Duty (READY), vehicle barriers, biological, chemical and
     radiological agent detectors and filters, and other security systems effectiveness. The assessment
     shall consider commercial, off-the-shelf AT technology enhancements and potential solutions for
     those circumstances where existing technology or procedural modifications do not provide satis-
     factory solutions.
     2.26.8.4. Vulnerability to a Threat and Terrorist Incident Response Measures. The assessment
     shall examine the assessed installation's/activity's ability to determine its vulnerabilities against
     commonly used terrorist weapons and explosive devices, to include terrorist use of WMD. The
     assessment shall further examine the ability to provide structural or infrastructure protection
     against terrorist events. The ability to respond to a terrorist event, with emphasis on a mass casu-
     alty situation, shall also be examined.
     2.26.8.5. VAs for Terrorist Use of WMD. The assessment shall assess the vulnerability of instal-
     lations, facilities and personnel, and family members within their AOR to terrorist use of WMD.
     Such assessments address potential use of chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological agents and
     shall be developed with supporting base agencies, such as civil engineering, readiness, medical,
     etc.
     2.26.8.6. Host Nation, Local Community, Inter-Service and Tenant Support. The assessment shall
     examine the level and adequacy of support available to an installation/activity from the host nation
     or local community, MAJCOM, HQ USAF and where appropriate, inter-service and tenant orga-
     nizations to enhance AT measures or response to terrorist incidents.
         2.26.8.6.1. The assessment shall determine the integration and feasibility of plans with host
         nation, local community, MAJCOM, HQ USAF, and inter-service and tenant organizations to
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                          71


         provide security, law enforcement, fire, medical and emergency response capability in
         response to terrorist events, with emphasis on mass casualty situations.
         2.26.8.6.1. (AMC) The AMC/VAT will assess local MOA/MOUs with local authorities, to
         include, but not limited to, Law Enforcement, Emergency Services, HAZMAT response, Fire
         and Medical Aid and joint use agreements. The assessment team will also review agreements
         to provide utility services (water, gas, electric) to the installation (to include off base Gov’t
         housing areas).
         2.26.8.6.2. The assessment shall determine the adequacy of resources available to execute
         agreements and the extent and frequency to which plans have been exercised.
         2.26.8.6.3. The assessment shall determine the status of formal agreements with supporting
         organizations by way of Memorandums of Understanding or Agreement, Inter-Service Sup-
         port Agreements and Host Tenant Support Agreements, or other methods.
         2.26.8.6.4. (Added-AMC) The Installation AT Advisor must be familiar with all installation
         MOA/MOUs with local authorities, regarding response, containment, and recovery of a terror-
         ist event, however, they are not necessarily the OPR for such agreements. The appropriate
         OPR shall maintain signed copies of any agreements pertaining to areas listed in paragraph
         2.26.8.6.1.
         2.26.8.6.5. (Added-AMC) As a minimum, assessments should include information from
         intelligence, logistics, medical, physical security, facility engineering, meteorological, explo-
         sive ordnance disposal, and NBC staff elements. The entire range of potential terrorist WMD
         should be considered when conducting assessments. Threats from commercial chemical, bio-
         logical, nuclear, and radiological sources should be included as well as traditional military
         agents. Examples of factors to consider include: Individual protective clothing and equipment,
         collective protection equipment and facilities, medical response and emergency services capa-
         bility, training of personnel, physical security and protective barriers, facility design and con-
         struction, early warning and detection, alarms and attack warning, threat intelligence,
         preventive medicine and vaccination programs, sustainment operations and follow on support,
         storage of bulk hazardous material, explosive ordnance disposal response capability/availabil-
         ity and food and water sources.
  2.26.9. Site-Specific Characteristics. Site-specific circumstances may require assessment of addi-
  tional functional areas. These additional requirements shall be as directed by the CINC, Service, and
  DoD Agency or MAJCOM creating the team and should be based on site-specific characteristics, such
  as terrorism threat level, terrorist characteristics, geography and security environment.
  2.26.9. (AMC) AMC VATs will consider off installation housing, utilities and other local military
  agencies when conducting the VA.
  2.26.10. Team Composition and Level of Expertise. As a minimum, assessment team composition
  and level of expertise must support the functional areas assessed. Team membership shall have exper-
  tise in the following areas: physical security; civil, electrical or structural engineering; special opera-
  tions; operational readiness; law enforcement and medical operations; infrastructure; intelligence/
  counterintelligence, information management, and civil engineer readiness for consequence manage-
  ment. In exceptional cases, commanders may be required to tailor team composition and scope of the
  assessment to meet unique requirements of a particular installation/activity, but must meet the intent
  of a comprehensive assessment.
72                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     2.26.10. (AMC) AMC VAT composition may vary based on the type of installation being assessed.
     The assessment team shall consist of a team chief (an O-6 appointed by the AMC FPB), assessment
     structural engineer, infrastructure engineer, communications/information management specialist,
     counterintelligence specialist, antiterrorism/force protection and physical security specialists, preven-
     tive medicine specialist, and an operations readiness/response specialist. Other functional experts may
     augment the team as needed. Augmentation will depend on type of assessment required, the nature of
     the installation's/site's mission, the terrorist threat level, and the FPCON.
        2.26.10.1. Force Protection Integrated Support Team (FIST). Based on site-specific factors such
        as a Terrorism Threat Level, terrorist characteristics, geography or emergent force protection chal-
        lenges, specialized assessment teams may be commissioned with expertise to address a com-
        mander’s force protection posture. One such team is the AFSFC’s Force protection Integrated
        Support Team. The FIST is charged to mitigate or solve emergent USAF-wide AT/FP require-
        ments. Team expertise may include: AT technology; explosive ordinance disposal; communica-
        tions; information assurance or operations and other specialties as determined by the CINC,
        Service, DoD Agency or MAJCOM sponsoring the assessment. Requests for FIST support should
        pass through command channels to HQ AFSFC/SFP, DSN 473-0896, or through the 24-hour
        AFSFC Operations Center, DSN 473-0960.
        2.26.10.1. (AMC) Installation commanders will ensure all requests for a Force Protection Inte-
        grated Support Team is routed to AMC/SF for further coordination to HQ AFSFC/SFP. Requests
        may be made to AMC/SF (Director or Deputy) in writing, via email or by phone, depending on the
        nature and severity (emergent need) of the request.
     2.26.11. HQ AFSFC shall disseminate lessons learned, trends and best practices to MAJCOMs for
     their use and further dissemination.
     2.26.11. (AMC) AT Advisors should also use the VAMP located on the SIPRNET for additional les-
     sons learned and Best Practices. AT Advisors should make every effort to populate the VAMP with
     their own site specific best practices/lessons learned for appropriate cross-feed.
     2.26.12. Air Force units will use the Air Force Vulnerability Assessment Management Program
     (VAMP) to comply with DoD tracking and report requirements. VAMP is a web-based program
     accessed through the SIPRNET. HQ Air Force Security Forces Center, Force Protection Division
     (AFSPC/SFP) is the VAMP Program Manager. MAJCOMs and installations will appoint VAMP
     Administrators and notify AFSFC/SFP of the appointee.
     2.26.12. (AMC) AMC/SFOF is the MAJCOM VAMP administrator. All installation requests for
     VAMP rights must be directed to AMC/SFOF, DSN 779-0647.
        2.26.12.1. (Added-AMC) Installation AT Advisors must provide AMC/SFO with a letter listing
        their Installation VAMP administrators, within 30 days of a position or administrative change. The
        installation commander must sign the letter.
     2.26.13. The Air Force VA Guide is the source document for all Air Force (local, MAJCOM & AF)
     VAs. Vulnerabilities identified during the VA outbrief are to be entered into VAMP NLT 10 duty days
     after the VA outbrief. Observations, concerns, and best practices identified by the VA team will be
     entered into VAMP NLT 30 duty days following the receipt of the final VA report.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                      73


  2.26.13. (AMC) The AMC VA team should provide a final VA report on CD ROM within 60 days of
  the assessment visit to the Installation Commander. The commander should ensure the Installation AT
  Advisor receives the report in order to meet the 30-day requirement to populate VAMP.
  2.26.14. A color-coded rating scheme will be used by MAJCOM and installations to give visibility to
  vulnerabilities and to facilitate tracking of corrective actions. Following the receipt of a DoD, AF,
  MAJCOM or local VA report, the installation commander must determine the baseline color-code rat-
  ing using the Critical Program Requirements listed in 2.26.14. Failure to achieve a “GO” rating in any
  of the Critical Program Requirement areas will result in an overall “Red” rating.
  2.26.14. (AMC) The AMC VA team will use the Installation out-brief to identify, by color-coded
  scheme, the nine Critical Program Requirements listed in paragraph 2.26.15. The final report will also
  have reference to the nine Critical Program Requirements, as identified during the out-brief.
     2.26.14.1. The color-code denotes an installation or agency’s overall assessment status: Red - AT/
     FP practices and procedures do not adequately address the current local threat level; AMBER -
     AT/FP practices and procedures are marginally acceptable given the current local threat level;
     GREEN - AT/FP practices and procedures are satisfactory given the current local threat level.
     2.26.14.2. Those installations that commanders have assessed as RED will require a reassessment
     with six months after the original assessment. The appropriate HHQ will determine the type and
     scope of assessment required. If the vulnerabilities identified, that drove the RED rating, can’t be
     corrected at the time of the reassessment, the appropriate HHQ will be notified and will determine
     if a HHQ assessment is required for that location. Once the identified vulnerability areas have
     been corrected, commanders will reevaluate their installation’s AT/FP readiness and assign a new
     color-rating.
     2.26.14.2. (AMC) An actual return to an installation assessed as RED, may not be required if
     physical documentation is provided to the MAJCOM POC (i.e., AT Advisor appointment letter in
     writing or signed plans received by AMC).
  2.26.15. There are nine Critical Program Requirements which all installations and agencies must
  meet to satisfy the basic AT/FP program standards promulgated by DoD. The nine standards are:
     2.26.15.1. Comprehensive AT/FP Program Established and Maintained. (Standards 2 and 14)
     2.26.15.2. Trained AT Officer (AT)) Assigned in Writing. (Standard 6)
     2.26.15.3. Local Threat Assessment Conducted Within Last 12 Months. (Standard 15)
     2.26.15.4. Threat Information Notification System Established. (Standard 9)
     2.26.15.5. Comprehensive Local Vulnerability Assessment and Program Review Completed
     Annually. (Standards 20 and 26)
     2.26.15.6. Signed, Distributed, Executable AT/FP Plan Fully Coordinated with Tasked Units.
     (Standard 14)
     2.26.15.7. At/FP Plan Exercised Annually and Lessons Learned Documented. Standard 19)
     2.26.15.8. Countermeasures in Place to Mitigate Known Vulnerabilities. (Standard 14)
     2.26.15.9. Adoption/Adherence to “Interim DoD AT/FP Construction Standards.” (Standard 28)

     2.26.16. VAMP access is controlled and limited to a “need to know” basis. Access will be requested
     through and revalidated semi-annually by the AFSFC VAMP Program Manager and MAJCOM
     VAMP Administrators. The below listed positions have been identified with a continuing need for
     access to VAMP:
        2.26.16.1. AF/XO and AF/XOO staff divisions, as appropriate.
        2.26.16.2. Director of Security Forces (AF/XOF)
        2.26.16.3. Commander, HQ AFSFC (AFSFC/CC)
        2.26.16.4. Chief, Force Protection Division (AFSFC/SFP)
        2.26.16.5. MAJCOM Commanders, SF Directors, and VAMP Administrators or designated rep-
        resentatives.
        2.26.16.6. Installation Commanders and VAMP Administrators
        2.26.16.6. (AMC) Installation Commanders and Installation AT Advisor will have a VAMP
        account. Installation Vice Commanders and Mission Support Group Commanders may have a
        VAMP account.
        2.26.16.7. (Added-AMC) NAF Commanders should maintain a VAMP account (monitored by
        AMC/SFOF) in order to review the installation VAMP program. NOTE: Paragraph 2.26.3.1.
        requires installation commanders to prioritize, track and report vulnerabilities to the next general
        officer following a VA. VAMP provides a means to accomplish this task via the NAF Com-
        mander’s account.
     2.26.17. MAJCOM and Installation VAMP Administrators will strictly monitor the number of per-
     sonnel who have access to VAMP. MAJCOM VAMP Program Administrators are responsible for
     accuracy of data entered into VAMP and will ensure Installation VAMP Administrators are trained.
        2.26.17.1. (Added-AMC) Installation/Site Commanders must address, mitigate and correct AT/
        FP vulnerabilities identified during all vulnerability assessments, especially those that are proce-
        dural or relatively inexpensive and would improve the AT/FP posture. Conversely, high cost
        improvements must be considered in context with threat and risk assessment, and if necessary,
        planned for, and programmed.
        2.26.17.2. (Added-AMC) Data entry into VAMP should initially be listed as “procedural”, in
        order to timely input data into VAMP. Strict follow-up must be maintained to ensure the appropri-
        ate installation-level review (Threat Working Group, Force Protection Working Group and/or
        Installation Security Council) is conducted to address the vulnerabilities initially entered as “pro-
        cedural”. Project numbers, and funding information must be entered as soon as possible, following
        installation review.
        2.26.17.3. (Added-AMC) The Installation VAMP administrator is not required to be the Installa-
        tion AT Advisor.
     2.26.18. VAMP Program Manager is responsible for training MAJCOM VAMP Administrators.
     2.26.19. USAF Strategic Plan Performance Measures. MAJCOMs will report the VA status of their
     respective installations to HQ USAF/XOFP NLT 15 Oct and 15 Apr of each year, IAW with Air Force
     Strategic Plan, Volume 2, Performance Measure 2.A.13, Antiterrorism/Force Protection Program
     Assessments. (This vulnerability assessment status reporting requirement is exempt from report con-

       https://www.afmia.randolph.af.mil/afmia/mip/mipp/perf_mgt/ppm.htm

2.27. DoD Standard 27 - Pre-deployment AT Vulnerability Assessment. DoD Components shall
ensure the execution of pre-deployment AT VA prior to deployment. At the theater level, Component
Commanders shall provide onboard and/or advance-site assessments prior to and during visits to
higher-threat areas of Significant or High Threat Levels, or where a geographically specific Terrorism
Warning Report is in effect. This includes ports, airfields and inland movement routes that may be used by
transiting forces. At the discretion of the geographic CINC, such security efforts may be waived for
deployments and/or visits to controlled locations such as existing military installations or ships afloat.
Augmentation of assessment personnel may be necessary to enable Component Commanders to discharge
their responsibility to provide security, surveys and assessments, counterintelligence and countersurveil-
lance support and to act as the liaison with the country team, host nation security force, husbanding con-
tractor and port authority. Such advance-site deployment would also be able to communicate current local
threat information to transiting units, enabling the onboard AT team to more effectively tailor measures to
the specific threat environment.
   2.27.1. Deploying commanders shall implement appropriate AT measures to reduce risk and vulnera-
   bility. Commanders shall direct implementation of AT measures that reduce risks before, during and
   after deployment. Assessments and the subsequent implementation of standards must occur in a
   timely manner and should be incorporated in pre-deployment planning and training. Pre-deployment
   assessments should assist commanders in updating AOR-specific training and in obtaining necessary
   physical security materials and equipment to implement protective measures.
   2.27.1. (AMC) The AMC Threat Working Group (TWG) will conduct pre-deployment assessments
   of contingency or forward operating locations, and ensure the most current terrorism, criminal, mili-
   tary and health threat information is available via the classified HQ AMC Intelligence homepage
   <http://www.amcin.scott.af.smil.mil/homeIE.asp>.
       2.27.1.1. If warranted, commanders faced with emergent AT and force protection requirements
       prior to movement of forces, should submit CbTRIF requests through established channels to pro-
       cure necessary materials or equipment for required protective measures.
       2.27.1.1. (AMC) CENTCOM AOR specific vulnerability assessments can be found at the SIPR-
       NET site:
       http://recluse.centcom.smil.mil/ccjs/jsd.htm. Personnel should also review the Joint Security
       Directorate (JSD) AT/FP Guide (unclassified), found on site.
       2.27.1.2. Equipment and technology can significantly enhance all DoD forces, but in particular
       the transiting units’ posture against terrorist threats. For this reason, component commanders
       should research and identify AT equipment or technology requirements to their chain of com-
       mand. The use of commercial-off-the shelf or government-off-the-shelf products should be
       stressed to meet near-term requirements.
   2.27.2. The senior deploying commander will ensure a pre-deployment VA has been conducted and a
   counterintelligence threat assessment provided by AFOSI prior to deployment. The assessment team
   will include medical members qualified to conduct site selection evaluations to include: vulnerability
76                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     of local food and water sources, medical threats, , local medical capabilities, vector/pest risk assess-
     ment, field sanitation and of hygiene of local billeting and public facilities, and environmental risk
     assessment. Assessments will provide the necessary background data for sizing the force protection
     package required to reduce the threat to Air Force personnel and assets. MAJCOMs will determine the
     expertise level for persons conducting these assessments.
     2.27.3. Servicing AFOSI detachments will provide a threat assessment for any deployments to the
     supported installation
     2.27.4. The command intelligence officer will ensure the commander and key unit personnel possess
     appropriate sensitive compartmented information (SCI) clearances and have access to communica-
     tions to receive urgent threat information at the deployed location.

2.28. DoD Standard 28 - Construction Considerations. DoD Components shall adopt and adhere to
common criteria and minimum construction (i.e., new construction, renovation, or rehabilitation) stan-
dards to mitigate AT vulnerabilities and terrorist threats.
2.28. (AMC) Use AMCI 24-101, Vol 24, AMC Passenger Terminal Force Protection in addition to other
applicable directives, when designing or upgrading air terminals.
     2.28.1. The Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/ILE) shall develop construction guidelines IAW DoD
     O-2000.12-H. The guidelines shall cover antiterrorism planning, design, refurbishment and construc-
     tion (MILCON) of all Air Force facilities to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force personnel to terrorist
     attacks. At a minimum, they will meet the 16 Dec 99 Interim DoD AT/FP Construction Standards.
     2.28.2. Developing facilities that provide a safe and secure living and working environment, in poten-
     tially hostile areas, shall be a primary consideration in the planning, programming and design of Air
     Force facilities. Analysis conducted during the planning and programming phases will include assess-
     ing potential threats, reviewing design opportunities and constraints, and integrating protective strate-
     gies in the facility and its immediate surroundings.
        2.28.2.1. Installation commanders shall ensure all new construction projects and applicable reno-
        vation projects, regardless of the funding source, employ AT features and meet minimum DoD AT
        Construction Standards.
        2.28.2.2. Construction of temporary/expeditionary structures. For temporary and expeditionary
        discussions refer to Air Force Handbook 10-222, Volume 3. Commanders are also expected to use
        expeditionary measures commensurate with the identified FPCON.
        2.28.2.3. The Base Civil Engineer shall coordinate security requirements with the installation
        ATO on all facility construction and rehabilitation projects to ensure compliance with AT criteria
        and resource protection/AFOSI input/coordination. The installation ATO shall ensure all facility
        related AT/FP enhancements (i.e., fences, bollards, barriers, barricades, etc.) funded by the AT/FP
        program funds are coordinated with the Base Civil Engineer and MAJCOM CE. At a minimum,
        these efforts should be documented on an Air Force Form 332, Civil Engineer Work Request.
        2.28.2.3. (AMC) Procedures for the AT/FP review must be in writing, in the installation supple-
        ment of this AFI.
            2.28.2.3.1. All waivers to this criteria will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be
            approved by HQ/ILEC.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                            77


2.29. DoD Standard 29 - Facility and Site Evaluation and/or Selection Criteria. Commanders shall
develop a prioritized list of AT factors for site selection teams. These criteria shall be used to determine if
facilities, either currently occupied or under consideration for occupancy by DoD personnel, can ade-
quately protect occupants against terrorism attack. Circumstances may require the movement of DoD per-
sonnel or assets to facilities the US government has not previously used or surveyed. AT standards should
be a key consideration in evaluating the suitability of these facilities for use.
2.29. (AMC) These criteria must be used to determine if facilities/sites, either currently occupied or
under consideration for occupancy by DoD personnel, can adequately protect occupants against terrorist
attacks.
   2.29.1. The servicing AFOSI detachment, medical, intelligence, security forces and civil engineers,
   as a minimum, will participate in the site selection process.

2.30. DoD Standard 30 - AT Guidance for Off-Installation Housing. Commanders shall ensure DoD
personnel assigned to Moderate, Significant or High Terrorist Threat Level areas, who are not provided
on-installation or other government quarters, are furnished guidance on the selection of private residences
to mitigate risk of terrorist attack. The best protection for individuals is an awareness of the threat and the
willingness to take steps necessary to reduce threat exposure.
   2.30.1. Residential Security Reviews for Off-Installation Housing. Commanders, in Significant or
   High Terrorist Threat Level areas, shall conduct physical security reviews of off-installation resi-
   dences for permanently assigned and temporary-duty DOD personnel. Such reviews shall use the
   same terrorism threat, risk and vulnerability criteria as that used to assess the safety and security of
   occupants of other facilities or installations housing DoD personnel for which they have AT responsi-
   bility.
       2.30.1.1. Such reviews shall be conducted at least annually.
       2.30.1.2. Based on the review results, commanders shall provide AT recommendations to resi-
       dents and facility owners, facilitate additional mitigating measures, and as appropriate, recom-
       mend to appropriate authorities the construction of on-installation housing or lease of housing in
       safer areas.
   2.30.2. Commanders shall complete residential security reviews, in Significant or High Terrorist
   Threat Level areas, prior to personnel entering into formal contract negotiations for the lease or pur-
   chase of off-installation housing. Residences overseas are more apt to install security enhancements
   prior to the entering into a contract.
       2.30.2.1. Installation commanders will develop procedures through their local AFOSI, security
       forces, and civil engineer housing flights to ensure personnel are provided guidance on housing
       selection in areas with Moderate, Significant or High Terrorist Threat Levels. This guidance pro-
       vides information as to selection of homes to minimize the risk of terrorist acts.
   2.30.3. Installation commanders assigned to Low or Moderate Terrorist Threat Level areas will eval-
   uate the need to conduct assessments of off-installation housing areas.
   2.30.3. (AMC) Where applicable, installation/site commanders will ensure residential security
   assessments for off-installation housing are conducted. Results of these evaluations, if conducted,
   must be documented and maintained on file for review by higher headquarters assessment officials
   pursuant to Standard 26.
78                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     2.30.4. Use the VA process outlined in paragraph 2.26. to ensure proper assessment of off-installation
     housing, if deemed necessary.
     2.30.5. Commanders shall include coverage of private residential housing in AT plans where private
     residential housing must be used in Moderate, Significant or High Terrorist Threat Level areas.
     2.30.6. The best protection for individuals is an awareness of the threat and the willingness to take the
     steps necessary to reduce threat exposure. Proper selection of private residences can help reduce per-
     sonnel threat exposure.
     2.30.7. Commanders, at all levels, should incorporate family member and dependent vulnerabilities
     into all AT assessment, mitigation and reporting tools. In Moderate, Significant or High Threat areas,
     commanders shall include coverage of facilities (i.e., DoD schools and child development centers)
     and transportation services and routes (i.e., bus routes) used by DoD employees and their family
     members.
     2.30.8. (Added-AMC) AMC assigned forces located within or transiting geographical commander’s
     AORs will comply with that commander’s established requirements and guidance governing
     off-installation accommodations. This includes, but is not limited to, lodging, routes traveled and
     modes of travel.

2.31. DoD Standard 31 - Executive Protection and High Risk Personnel Security. C o m m a n d e r s
shall be familiar with treaty, statutory, policy, regulatory and local constraints on the application of sup-
plemental security measures for certain high-ranking DoD officials whom are entitled to additional pro-
tection as a result of their position. Commanders shall take measures necessary to provide appropriate
protective services for such individuals in high-risk billets and high-risk personnel. Review and revalida-
tion of protective services shall occur on at least an annual basis.
     2.31.1. Commanders should ensure individuals requesting supplemental security measures are aware
     of constraints and understand their individual responsibilities in accepting additional security mea-
     sures. Commanders should ensure individuals receiving supplemental security measures have com-
     pleted AT training, are cleared for assignment to billets, facilities or countries requiring such
     protection, and have been thoroughly briefed on the duties of protective service personnel.
     2.31.2. Reviews of supplemental security needs should be undertaken within 30 days of a change in
     the Terrorism Threat Level assigned to an AOR containing high-risk billets or to which high-risk per-
     sonnel have been assigned.
     2.31.3. HQ AFOSI provides special AT training including the Protective Service Operation/AT Train-
     ing Course, Senior Officer Security Seminar and defensive driving courses. AFOSI also provides
     security advisory services and protective service operations for designated high-risk personnel based
     on threat.
     2.31.3. (AMC) Installation/site commanders shall consult with their servicing AFOSI detachment if
     executive protection/protective services are needed.

2.32. Associated Standards from DoD O-2000.12-H. Table A2.1. In Attachment 2 associates stan-
dards from this instruction with the existing DoD O-2000.12-H. Use this handbook as guidance to imple-
ment the installation AT program.

Terms
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to
terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military forces. Also called AT. (Joint
Pub 1-02)
Antiterrorism Officer/NCO (ATO)—The installation , base, regional, facility, or deploying AT advisor
charged with managing the AT Program. He/she shall be a graduate of an approved Level II Course and
be identified in writing by the installation and/or force commander.
Antiterrorism Plan (AT Plan)—An AT Plan is the specific measures taken to establish and maintain an
AT Program.
Antiterrorism Program Element 28047F—Includes manpower authorization, antiterrorism equipment,
procurement, military construction and the associated costs specifically identified and measurable to
those resources and activities associated with the Air Force Antiterrorism Program.
Combating Terrorism—Combating terrorism within the DoD encompasses all actions, including
antiterrorism (defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to terrorist acts), counterterrorism
(offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism), terrorism consequence
management (preparation for and response to the consequences of a terrorist incident/event), and
intelligence support (collection and dissemination of terrorism-related information) taken to oppose
84                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum, to include terrorist use of chemical, biological,
radiological, nuclear materials or high-yield explosive devices (CBRNE).
Counterintelligence—Information gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage, other
intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or
elements thereof, foreign organizations, or foreign persons or international terrorist activities. Also called
CI. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Counterintelligence Analysis—CI analysis is the function of assimilating, evaluating, and interpreting
information about areas of CI prepotency and responsibility. Information derived from all available
sources is considered and integrated in the analytical process.
Counterintelligence Collection—The systematic acquisition of information (through investigations,
operations, or liaison) concerning espionage, sabotage, terrorism, other intelligence activities or
assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign
organizations, or foreign person.
Counterintelligence Investigation—Counterintelligence investigations establish the elements of proof
for prosecution or administrative action. Counterintelligence investigations can provide a basis for or be
developed from conducting counterintelligence operations. Counterintelligence investigations are
conducted against individuals or groups suspected of committing acts of espionage, sabotage, sedition,
subversion, terrorism, and other major security violations as well as failure to follow defense agency and
Military Service directives governing reporting of contacts with foreign citizens and “out-of-channel”
requests for defense information. Counterintelligence investigations provide military commanders and
policy makers with information used to eliminate security vulnerabilities and otherwise to improve the
security posture of threatened interests.
Counterintelligence Operation—Actions taken against foreign intelligence services to counter
espionage and other clandestine intelligence activities damaging to the national security.
Counterintelligence Production—The process of analyzing all source information concerning
espionage or other multidiscipline intelligence collection threats, sabotage, terrorism, and other related
threats to US military commanders, the Department of Defense, and the US Intelligence Community and
developing it into a final product that is disseminated. Counterintelligence production is used in
formulating security policy, plans, and operations.
Counterintelligence Support—Conducting counterintelligence activities to protect against espionage
and other foreign intelligence activities, sabotage, international terrorist activities or assassinations
conducted for, or on behalf of, foreign powers, organizations or persons. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Countersurveillance—All measures, active or passive, taken to counteract hostile surveillance.
Counterterrorism (CT)—Offensive measures taken to prevent, deter and respond to terrorism. Also
called CT. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Deterrence —The prevention from action by fear of the consequences. Deterrence is a state of mind
brought about by the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction. (Joint Pub 1-02)
DoD Designated High Physical Threat Countries—Countries determined to be of significant terrorist
threat to DoD travelers, as designated by the ASD(SO/LIC), in coordination with the Assistant Secretary
of Defense for International Security Affairs (ASD(ISA)) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Policy (ASD(ISP)). (DoDD 2000.12)
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                         85


DoD Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAM) Program—Random, multiple security measures that
consistently change the look of an installation's force protection program. RAMs introduce uncertainty to
an installation's overall force protection program to defeat surveillance attempts and make it difficult for
a terrorist to accurately predict our actions.
Environmental Threat Assessment—Multimedia medical assessment for biological, chemical, physical
and radiological hazards at an established installation or at a deployment site.
Food and Water Vulnerability—The susceptibility to overt/covert attack of food and water assets or
sources that could cause incapacitation or death of personnel.
Force Protection—Commander’s program designed to protect Service members, civilian employees,
family members, facilities, information and equipment, in all locations and situations, accomplished
through planned and integrated application of combating terrorism, physical security, operations security,
personal protective services and supported by intelligence, counterintelligence and other security
programs. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs)—A DoD-approved system standardizing the DoD and
Military Services’ identification of and recommended preventive actions and responses to terrorist threats
against US personnel and facilities. The system is the principle means for a commander to apply an
operational decision on how to protect against terrorism and facilitates inter-Service coordination and
support for antiterrorism activities. Also called FPCONs. There are four FPCONs above normal:
FPCON NORMAL—This condition applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist activity
exists and warrants a routine security posture.
FPCON ALPHA—This condition applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist
activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable, and
circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON BRAVO measures. However, it may be
necessary to implement certain measures from higher FPCONs measures resulting from intelligence
received or as a deterrent. The measures in this FPCONs must be capable of being maintained
indefinitely.
FPCON BRAVO—This condition applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist
activity exists. The measures in this FPCON must be capable of being maintained for weeks without
causing undue hardship, affecting operational capability and aggravating relations with local authorities.
FPCON CHARLIE—This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received
indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely.
Implementation of measures in this FPCON for more than a short period probably creates hardship and
affects the peacetime activities of the unit and its personnel.
FPCON DELTA—Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when
intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent.
Normally, this FPCON is declared as a localized condition. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Force Protection Integrated Support Team (FIST)—The FIST is a dedicated team tasked to respond
to a MAJCOM’s or installation commander’s request to mitigate or solve emergent USAF-wide AT issues
that cannot be resolved internally.
Force Protection Working Group (FPWG) —The FPWG is the commander ’s cross-functional
working group made up of wing and tenant units. Working group members are responsible for
86                                AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


coordinating and providing deliberate planning for all antiterrorism/force protection issues. The FPWG
should include representatives from relevant disciplines across the installation, including civil
engineering, intelligence, AFOSI, security forces, public health, bioenvironmental, disaster preparedness,
plans, communications and other agencies the installation commander deems necessary, including tenant
units
Foreign Intelligence—Information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign powers,
organizations, or persons, but not including counterintelligence, except for information on international
terrorist activities.
Forensic Sciences Consultant—AFOSI special agents who receive thorough graduate-level training in
most aspects of the forensic sciences and further specialization in a variety of forensic areas, to include
Federal Bureau of Investigations post-bomb blast investigations. These specially trained agents provide
support ranging from reviewing major investigation and advising on the use of specialized forensic
techniques, to providing on-scene operational assistance in investigations.
High-Risk Billet (Position)—Authorized personnel billet (identified and recommended by appropriate
authority) that because of grade, assignment, travel itinerary or symbolic value may make those personnel
filling them an especially attractive or accessible terrorist target.
High-Risk Personnel—Personnel who, by their grade, assignment, symbolic value or relative isolation,
are likely to be attractive or accessible terrorist targets. (Joint Pub 1-02)
High-Risk Targets—US material resources and facilities that, because of mission sensitivity, ease of
access, isolation and symbolic value may be an especially attractive or accessible terrorist target.
Installation Commanders may designate other US facilities such as clubs, lodging, dormitories, base
exchanges, commissaries, passenger terminals, medical facilities, and DoD schools as high-risk targets
because they concentrate large numbers of US personnel. This category is for use in local planning and
does not require reporting to HQ USAF.
Hostage—A person held as a pledge that certain terms or agreements be kept. (The taking of hostages is
forbidden under the Geneva Conventions, 1949). (Joint Pub 1-02)
Improvised Explosive Device (IED)—A device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner
incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy,
incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from
nonmilitary components. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Installation—A grouping of facilities, located in the same vicinity, which support particular functions.
Installations may be elements of a base. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Installation Commander—The individual responsible for all operations performed by an installation.
(Joint Pub 1-02)
Intelligence—(1) The product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, analysis, evaluation,
and interpretation of available information concerning foreign countries or areas. (2) Information and
knowledge about an adversary obtained through observation, investigation, analysis or understanding.
(Joint Pub 1-02)
Medical Intelligence—That category of intelligence resulting from collection, evaluation, analysis and
interpretation of foreign medical, bio-scientific and environmental information which is of interest to
strategic planning and to military medical planning and operations for the conservation of the fighting
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                           87


strength of friendly forces and the formation of assessments of foreign medical capabilities in both
military and civilian sectors. Also called MEDINT.
Personal Force Health Protection—Pre-deployment countermeasures to medical threats, provided by
the commander.

personnel; to prevent unauthorized access to equipment, installations, material, and documents; and to
safeguard them against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Proactive Measures—In antiterrorism, measures taken in the preventive stage of antiterrorism designed
to harden targets and detect actions before they occur. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Protective Services—A specialized AFOSI activity which increases the personal safety and security of
distinguished visitor or other protectee. The activity may be limited to protective threat assessment or may
extend to a major protective service operation involving considerable manpower and resources ( AFI
71-101, Vol. 2).
Protective Service Operation (PSO)—The use of specialized techniques and procedures by AFOSI
personnel to ensure a protectee’s personal safety and security during a specific event, while traveling, or
over an extended period of time. When required, a PSO can be tailored to provide 24-hour protection. In
such cases, the security detail establishes defensive overt or clandestine perimeters around the protectee
for the term of the PSO at the residence, during travel, and at all sites on the protectee’s daily itinerary.
(AFI 71-101, Vol 2)
Protective Threat Assessment (PTA)—Collecting and analyzing information to identify direct any
potential threats to harm, seize, interfere with, or embarrass a specific protectee, as well as to determine
the existing and anticipated security environment. A PTA is always the initial phase of a PSO. (AFI
71-101, Vol 2)
Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA)—An agreement which defines the legal position of a visiting
military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the status of visiting
military forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the status of visiting forces may
be set forth in a separate agreement, or they may form a part of a more comprehensive agreement. These
provisions describe how the authorities of a visiting force may control members of that force and the
amenability of the force or its members to the local law or to the authority of local officials. To the extent
that agreements delineate matters affecting the relations between a military force and civilian authorities
and population, they may be considered as civil affairs agreements. Also called SOFA. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Terrorism—The calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear. It is
intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally
political, religious or ideological. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Terrorism Consequence Management (TCM)—DoD preparedness and response for mitigating the
consequences of a terrorist incident including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. DoD consequence
management activities are designed to support the lead federal agency (domestically, FEMA; overseas,
DoS) and include measures to alleviate damage, loss of life, hardship or suffering caused by the incident;
protect public health and safety; and restore emergency essential government services.
Terrorism Threat Analysis—In antiterrorism, threat analysis is a continual process of compiling and
examining all available information concerning potential terrorist activists by groups that could target a
88                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


facility. A threat analysis will review factors of the presence of a terrorist group, operational capability,
activity, intentions and operating environment.
Terrorism Threat Assessment—The process used to conduct a threat analysis and develop an evaluation
of a potential terrorist threat and the product of a threat analysis for a particular unit, installation or
activity.
Terrorist—An individual who uses violence, terror and intimidation to achieve a result. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Terrorist Groups—Any element, regardless, of size or espoused cause, that commits acts of violence or
threatens violence in pursuit of its political, religious or ideological objectives. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Terrorist Incident Response Measures—A set of procedures in place for response forces to deal with
the effects of a terrorist incident.
Threat and Vulnerability Assessment (VA)—In antiterrorism, the pairing of a facility’s threat analysis
and vulnerability analysis. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Threat Working Group (TWG) —TWGs are an AT/FP advisory body for the commander. Key
functions include analyzing threats and providing recommendations to command concerning potential
FPCON changes, AT and other measures based upon potential threats to facilities or personnel. Core
membership, should include at a minimum, the ATO, AFOSI, Intelligence Office, Medical Intelligence
Officer, Chief of Security Forces and other agencies as required by the installation commander.
Vulnerability—(1) The susceptibility of a nation or military force to any action by any means through
which its war potential or combat effectiveness may be reduced or its will to fight diminished. (2) The
characteristics of a system that cause it to suffer a definite degradation (incapability to perform the
designated mission) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of effects in an unnatural
(manmade) hostile environment. (3) In information operations, a weakness in information system security
design, procedures, implementation, or internal controls that could be exploited to gain unauthorized
access to information systems.
Vulnerability Assessment—A Department of Defense, command, or unit-level evaluation (assessment)
to determine the vulnerability of a terrorist attack against an installation, unit, exercise, port, ship,
residence, facility, or other site. Identifies areas of improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter acts of
violence or terrorism.
Weapons Of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of destruction and/
or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. Weapons of mass destruction can
be high explosives or nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, but exclude the means of

               FORCE PROTECTION CONDITIONS (FPCONS) AND MEASURES

A3.1. The FPCONs listed below describe progressive levels of terrorist threats to US military facilities
and personnel. As DoD and Service’s-approved terminology, these terms, definitions and security mea-
sures are intended to facilitate interservice coordination and support of US military antiterrorism and
force protection activities. Selection of the appropriate response to terrorist threats remains the responsi-
bility of the commander having jurisdiction or control over the threatened facilities or personnel. Com-
manders are responsible for ensuring measures tailored to their specific installation are developed
commensurate with the appropriate FPCON level. A FPCON Individual Reference Card is available at
https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/

A3.2. FPCON NORMAL: Commanders employ Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs) during this
and all FPCONs to enhance force protection.
   A3.2.1. FPCON ALPHA:
       A3.2.1.1. Measure 1. At regular intervals, remind all personnel and family members to be suspi-
       cious and inquisitive about strangers, particularly those carrying suitcases or other containers.
       Watch for unidentified vehicles on or in the vicinity of United States installations. Watch for aban-
       doned parcels or suitcases and any unusual activity.
           A3.2.1.1.1. Based on the threat and intelligence sources, brief appropriate personnel on the
           threat.
               A3.2.1.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 1A. Public Affairs will publish articles and other
               mass media publications to help educate and inform the base populace. Ensure procedures
               are in place to assure this same information reaches DoD families residing off the installa-
               tion.
               A3.2.1.1.1.2. (Added-AMC) Measure 1B. Ensure key personnel in all base WMD
               response agencies, including security, medical, bioenvironmental engineering, fire/
               HAZMAT, EOD, and CE readiness, are briefed on any chemical, biological, radiological,
               and explosive (CBRNE) threats.
       A3.2.1.2. Measure 2. The duty officer or personnel with access to building plans, as well as the
       plans for area evacuations, must be available at all times. Key personnel should be able to seal off
       an area immediately. Key personnel required to implement security plans should be on-call and
       readily available.
           A3.2.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 2A. This measure ensures unit readiness to immediately
           execute required actions through employment of core knowledge experts.
           A3.2.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) Measure 2B. Because FPCON Alpha may be maintained indefi-
           nitely, on a quarterly basis, verify notification and recall procedures for key WMD crisis
           response and consequence management personnel, including the Disaster Control Group
           (DCG) and/or Survival Recovery Center (SRC) members, and specialized teams.
       A3.2.1.3. Measure 3. Secure buildings, rooms and storage areas not in regular use.
92                             AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


        A3.2.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 3A. Monthly, owner/user will test the intrusion alarm
        and motion detection system at the base water-well field and reservoir, if alarmed. Consult
        with the security forces squadron for guidance on how to effectively conduct this test.
     A3.2.1.4. Measure 4. Increase security spot checks of vehicles and persons entering the installa-
     tion and unclassified areas under the jurisdiction of the United States.
        A3.2.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 4A. Vehicles entering the installation are only required
        to display DoD Form 2220 or produce locally approved vehicle passes. During this FPCON,
        randomly check identification (driver or one adult). In this FPCON, it is not intended for
        everyone in the vehicle to have their identification checked. Continue “hours of darkness”
        checks according to local procedures. Search 100% of all contract and oversized vehicles.
        Use of a Military Working Dog (MWD) and Ion Scanners to conduct searches of oversized
        vehicles are mandatory. If an installation has insufficient MWD assigned to perform this task,
        AMC/SF will be notified immediately. Ideally, the installation will create a stand-alone gate
        for oversized/contractor vehicles. The installation commander will define “oversized vehi-
        cle”. Make every attempt to isolate this entry point away from the cantonment and aircraft
        parking areas. Search 100% of all privately owned vehicles (those that have not met perma-
        nent or temporary registration requirements) at the time of their application for entry.
     A3.2.1.5. Measure 5. Limit access points for vehicles and personnel commensurate with a reason-
     able flow of traffic.
        A3.2.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 5A. During Alpha, AMC Installations have been given
        sufficient manpower to employ additional security at the installation entry points, to enhance
        entry control procedures as part of antiterrorism procedures, contrary to “day to day” entry
        control. This “overwatch” position must be employed to enhance your first line of defense
        against a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device, VBIED. During this FPCON, the over-
        watch may assist with traffic control on a random basis.
        A3.2.1.5.2. (Added-AMC) Measure 5B. In AMC, installations will employ a two-person
        security (RAM) patrol and focus efforts on early detection of potential threats at the installa-
        tion entry points and perimeter. This patrol will be equipped with the latest force protection
        technological devices (Ion Scanners, hand-held magnetometers, portable tire busters) to aid
        with vehicle and personnel searches, as well as Night Vision Equipment. This patrol may be
        divided into two one-person patrols.
        A3.2.1.5.3. (Added-AMC) Measure 5C. Isolate and control access to flightline aircraft park-
        ing areas, industrial aircraft maintenance facilities, runway and taxiways. Erect fencing and or
        barriers and establish a limited number of designated entry points IAW AMC standards and
        policy. In AMC, day-to-day operations at these entry points should be accomplished by Smart
        Card/Automated Entry Control/Key Pad type system. If the Installation Commander elects to
        position entry controllers fulltime or as a RAM, at these positions because automation is not
        utilized, owner/user will fulfill this requirement or sufficient READY personnel will be
        assigned to the Security Forces Squadron.
            A3.2.1.5.3.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 5C.1. Where a facility makes up a portion of this
            perimeter, implement circulation control (e.g., cipher locks, automated entry systems,
            etc.). As a RAM, post owner/user personnel--check entry credentials, inspect hand carried
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                          93


            and search POV’s. Consult with your Flightline Constable for searching technique train-
            ing.
     A3.2.1.6. Measure 6. As a deterrent, apply measures 14, 15, 17 or 18 from FPCON BRAVO
     either individually or in combination with each other.
     A3.2.1.7. Measure 7. Review all plans (to include AT, Disaster Preparedness Operations Plan
     32-1 (or equivalent), Physical Security, and Medical Response/Mass Casualty Plans), most recent
     VA Report, orders, personnel details and logistics requirements related to the introduction of
     higher FPCONs.
     A3.2.1.7. (AMC) Measure 7.A. In AMC it’s recommended that Installation Commanders con-
     duct quarterly “table top” or “Command Post Exercises” to review these plans and checklist. It
     may also be necessary to convene the Installation Security Council and or Force Protection Work-
     ing Group to review plans and checklist.
     A3.2.1.8. Measure 8. Review and implement security measures for high-risk personnel, facilities
     and critical infrastructure, as appropriate.
     A3.2.1.9. Measure 9. As appropriate, consult local authorities on the threat and mutual antiterror-
     ism measures. For example: Based on the threat and type of intelligence, brief local police of the
     threat, actions being taken by the installation, and request appropriate assistance. If the threat is to
     aircraft assets, request assistance in ensuring the anti-aircraft missile footprint area at arrival/
     departure runways is monitored and updated as necessary.
     A3.2.1.10. Measure 10. Review plans and procedures and train facility occupants on individual
     protective actions for response to a WMD incident that occurs inside or outside of a facility.
     A3.2.1.11. Measure 10A. Review mutual aid and host-tenant support agreements, memoranda of
     understanding, and host-nation memoranda of agreement to determine the level of WMD incident
     support the installation provides or receives and review support request and approval procedures.
     Update plans and checklists as needed.
     A3.2.1.12. Measure 10B. Provide the base populace with both general and threat-specific infor-
     mation and protective actions through the installation Disaster Preparedness Information Program.
     A3.2.1.13. Measure 10C. Secure all access to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
     Mechanical Rooms. Lock and control the access to all interior and exterior doors that contain
     HVAC equipment.
     A3.2.1.14. Measure 10D. Secure all access to hazardous and flammable material storage areas,
     especially storage areas where bulk quantities of hazardous or flammable materials are stored.
     A3.2.1.15. Measure 10E. Take action to bring specialized disaster preparedness teams, hazardous
     material emergency response teams, and the Disaster Control Group (primary and alternate posi-
     tions) to 100 percent of their authorized strength. Ensure personnel have been trained on local
     WMD attack response actions for 100 percent of currently assigned team members.
     A3.2.1.16. (Added-AMC) Measure 10F. Because the actions of FPCON Alpha must be able to
     be maintained indefinitely, in AMC Commanders cannot exempt any of the measures under this
     FPCON without completion of an AF Form 116, Request for Deviation from Security Criteria.

A3.3. FPCON BRAVO:
94                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     A3.3.1. Measure 11. Continue, or introduce, all measures listed in FPCONs ALPHA and warn per-
     sonnel of any other form of attack to be used by terrorists.
     A3.3.2. Measure 12. Keep all personnel involved in implementing antiterrorism contingency plans on
     call.
        A3.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 12A. Review WMD crisis response and consequence man-
        agement plans, checklist and procedures. Command Post or Table Top Exercises are strongly
        encouraged.
        A3.3.2.2. (Added-AMC) Measure 12B. CE Readiness and Bioenvironmental Engineering will
        place at least two NBC technicians on telephone standby.
        A3.3.2.3. (Added-AMC) Measure 12C. Verify notification and recall procedures for installation
        crisis response, consequence management agencies and personnel, including the Disaster Control
        Group (DCG), Survival Recovery Center (SRC), Unit Control Centers (UCC) and specialized
        teams. Verify procedures by conducting actual (preferred) or simulated (personnel conduct notifi-
        cations but do not physically report for duty) recalls.
     A3.3.3. Measure 13. Check plans for implementation of the next FPCONs.
     A3.3.4. Measure 14. Move cars and objects; i.e., crates and trash containers, at least 25 meters from
     buildings, particularly buildings of a sensitive nature. Consider centralized parking.
     A3.3.4. (AMC) Measure 14. The creation of a 25-meter clear zone will complement the required
     inspections in Measure 16. After careful review of your facility listing, as compared to the threat in
     your region, it is generally not necessary to establish a 25 meter clear zone around every facility on the
     installation. There is no Air Force or AMC requirement to cover facility identification signs or direc-
     tional signs. Commanders must employ sound Risk Management when making these determinations.
     A3.3.5. Measure 15. Secure and regularly inspect all buildings, rooms, and storage areas not in regu-
     lar use.
     A3.3.6. Measure 16. At the beginning and end of each workday, as well as at other regular and fre-
     quent intervals, inspect the interior and exterior of buildings in regular use for suspicious packages.
     A3.3.7. Measure 17. Examine mail (above the regular examination process) for explosives or biolog-
     ical agents.
        A3.3.7.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 17A. Consider reducing delivery points to the absolute mini-
        mum. Centralized commercial deliveries should be restricted to one designated location for
        screening and distribution.
     A3.3.8. Measure 18. Check all deliveries to dining facilities, clubs, etc. Advise family members to
     check home deliveries.
     A3.3.9. Measure 19. Increase security patrols and consider countersurveillance of military family
     housing, schools, dining facilities, clubs, child development centers and other soft targets to improve
     deterrence and defense and to build confidence among staff and family members.
     A3.3.9. (AMC) Measure 19. The Office of Special Investigation is the office of primary responsibil-
     ity for the portion of this Measure that discusses counter-surveillance.
     A3.3.10. Measure 20. Make staff and family members aware of the general situation in order to stop
     rumors and prevent unnecessary alarm.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                           95


  A3.3.11. Measure 21. At an early stage, inform members of local security committees of actions
  being taken. Explain reasons for actions.
  A3.3.11. (AMC) Measure 21. Consider town meetings and increased commander calls.
  A3.3.12. Measure 22. Physically inspect visitors and randomly inspect their suitcases, parcels and
  other containers. Ensure proper dignity is maintained, and if possible, ensure female visitors are
  inspected only by a female qualified to conduct physical inspections.
  A3.3.12. (AMC) Measure 22. In AMC this is interpreted as a check that’s conducted at the base
  entry point/visitor control center at the time when visitors are requesting an AF Form 75. This search
  will include the vehicle as well. For Non-DoD ID cardholders requesting an AF 75, their vehicle will
  be searched during every entry (unless accompanied by the sponsor) to the installation if Charlie Mea-
  sure 33 is in effect as a “plus measure” in Bravo. Utilize Magnetometers and hand held transfriskers
  to assist and enhance the searching of individuals.
  A3.3.13. Measure 23. Operate random patrols to check vehicles, people and buildings.
  A3.3.13. (AMC) Measure 23. In AMC, each Installation will employ a two-person (RAM) patrol to
  assist other base patrols with this responsibility. Pay special attention to areas such as: Installation
  Entry Point searches, Commissary, BX, Food Courts, Day Care Centers, etc.
  A3.3.14. Measure 24. Protect off-base military personnel and military vehicles in accordance with
  prepared plans. Remind drivers to lock vehicles and check vehicles before entering or exiting the
  vehicle.
  A3.3.14. (AMC) Measure 24. Public Affairs and the OSI will initiate a campaign that routinely
  informs personnel and family members of the general situation and how they can participate in the
  “Eagle Eyes” Program.
  A3.3.15. Measure 25. Implement additional security measures for high-risk personnel, facilities and
  critical infrastructure, as appropriate.
  A3.3.15. (AMC) Measure 25. It may be prudent to establish a hardened barrier around certain criti-
  cal/sensitive facilities to create standoff. Refer to your Installation Barrier Plan/Critical Facility list-
  ing. Facilities of a critical or sensitive nature are generally defined as single points of failure, C2,
  through C4, and facilities or equipment that if destroyed would result in mission failure.
  A3.3.16. Measure 26. Brief personnel who may augment guard forces on the use of deadly force.
  Ensure there is no misunderstanding of these instructions.
  A3.3.16. (AMC) Measure 26. Personnel should also be briefed on the Rules of Engagement, com-
  munications/duress procedures, and emergency reporting procedures.
  A3.3.17. Measure 27. As appropriate, consult local authorities on the threat and mutual antiterrorism
  measures.
  A3.3.18. Measure 28. CONUS installations will review NORAD Instruction 10-22, Nuclear, Biolog-
  ical, and Chemical Warning and Reporting System. OCONUS units will review their theater or MAJ-
  COM guidance.
     A3.3.18.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 28A. Review readiness of all tasked WMD response agen-
     cies, including first responders, specialized teams, DCG, SRC, and Unit Control Centers (UCC).
     Ready WMD/HAZMAT response equipment for immediate use.
96                                 AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


     A3.3.19. (Added-AMC) Measure 29A. In addition to the requirements in Measure 11, Installation
     entry control in this FPCON will also require a check of DoD or locally approved credentials, for at
     least one adult occupant. Commanders will also maintain an overwatch position as described in
     FPCON Alpha Measure 5A, however, personnel performing overwatch must not be involved with
     traffic control duties. The sentry is there to perform overwatch duties only. Should the Commander
     elect to employ an overwatch position as a final denial point during this FPCON, or because it’s
     directed by HHQ to assume “plus” measures from higher FPCONS (measure 33-strict entry control),
     procedures must be IAW FPCON Charlie Measure 33A.
     A3.3.20. (Added-AMC) Measure 29B. BEE, CEO, SFS, and OSI meet and recommend appropriate
     drinking water system “hardening” measures, (such as boosting system pressure and chlorination lev-
     els, and security measures at isolated storage tanks and pump houses) to the FPWG, DCG, SRC or
     TWG, after considering nature of threat, system mechanics/properties and operating costs. BEE rec-
     ommends appropriate monitoring locations and schedule for free available chlorine and pH as an indi-
     cator for system contamination after conducting a threat/risk analysis.

A3.4. FPCON CHARLIE:
     A3.4.1. Measure 30. Continue, or introduce, all measures listed in FPCONs ALPHA and BRAVO.
     A3.4.2. Measure 31. Keep all personnel responsible for implementing antiterrorism plans at their
     places of duty.
        A3.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 31A. Activate and staff the SRC or Contingency Support
        Staff (CSS) and UCCs. The SRC/CSS will have at least the following representatives: Security
        Forces, Fire Protection, EOD, CE Readiness, Medical and a Director. The SRC/CSS will assist
        the commander to implement passive defense measures and monitor Full Spectrum Threat
        Response preparedness through the UCCs. During periods of extended FPCON Charlie, the com-
        mander may release SRC/CSS members, if the installation has achieved (and can maintain)
        acceptable readiness levels.
     A3.4.3. Measure 32. Limit access points to the absolute minimum.
     A3.4.3. (AMC) Measure 32. All installation “convenience” gates will be closed and barricaded.
     A3.4.4. Measure 33. Strictly enforce control of entry. Randomly search vehicles.
        A3.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 33A. In AMC, strictly enforce control of entry is defined as:
        At installation entry points control entry by use of the DD Form 2220 and proper DoD identifica-
        tion (at least one adult occupant). Visitors (between the “estimated” ages of sixteen to sixty-five)
        accompanying DoD employees must produce photo identification or obtain a visitors pass. Spon-
        sors must report to the base entry point to escort visitors. Visitors will be searched IAW Measure
        22, as supplemented. Also, during FPCON Charlie and Delta, or anytime this measure is imple-
        mented, active installation entry points will transition their gate “overwatch” position (as
        described in FPCON Alpha Measure 5A) to a final denial over-watch position. This position is the
        desired final denial point for incoming traffic. The position must have non-lethal means of deny-
        ing unauthorized entry and must be positioned far enough away to have enough time to react to
        unauthorized vehicles (employing non-lethal means). Non-lethal includes but is not limited to,
        tire deflation devices, a blocking vehicles, or pop-up bollards. If the distance between the entry
        point and over-watch is limited because of existing road configurations, employ speed bumps,
        rumble strips, or serpentines between the gate and the over-watch to minimize speeds. Pre-estab-
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                         97


     lished signals (between the entry controller and the over-watch position) must be in place to
     ensure the over-watch position clearly understands when a vehicle needs to be stopped and if
     lethal or non-lethal measures must be taken. If lethal force is employed as an option, a formal
     Operational Risk Management (ORM) review must be accomplished that addresses, at a mini-
     mum, rules of engagement, fields of fire, and potential fratricide. The installation commander
     must approve the ORM package.
     A3.4.4.2. (Added-AMC) Measure 33B. Commanders should review their “key” or “critical”
     facility listing and after evaluating the regional threat, limit some, all, or none of the installation
     facilities (to include off-base assets) to a single point of entry and control with owner/user person-
     nel or other positive entry control devices, (e.g., key control, card swipe or cipher locks). For DoD
     housing facilities implement plans to enhance security.
     A3.4.4.3. (Added-AMC) Measure 33C. At flightline entry points, search all vehicles and posi-
     tively identify all occupants. Emergency response vehicles may be exempted from search pro-
     vided pre-established entry procedures have been established. It’s imperative the entry controller
     have immediate communication with a 24-hour dispatch center. Depending on the threat assess-
     ment for your region, it may be prudent to employ an armed (minimum of an M.16 rifle)
     over-watch guard at the flightline entry point(s). Create serpentines and employ portable tire bust-
     ers at the over-watch position. Terminate visitor access to the flightline.
     A3.4.4.4. (Added-AMC) Measure 33D. When intelligence indicates a potential for radiological
     attack, randomly screen vehicles for radioactivity during vehicle searches. Civil Engineer Readi-
     ness and Bioenvironmental Engineering flights possess radiological detection instruments (ADM
     300 RADIACs) that can be used for this purpose. If these agencies cannot provide manpower to
     perform radiological screening, augmentees (not base entry controllers) may be trained to operate
     the detectors.
  A3.4.5. Measure 34. Enforce centralized parking of vehicles away from sensitive buildings and criti-
  cal infrastructure.
  A3.4.5. (AMC) Measure 34. In AMC this is defined as: Those facilities identified as “Critical” to
  mission accomplishment, especially single points of failure.
  A3.4.6. Measure 35. Issue weapons and individual protective equipment to guards. Local orders
  should include specific orders on issue of ammunition.
     A3.4.6.1. (Added-AMC) Measure 35A. AMC/SG considers threat and advises on appropriate-
     ness of issuing pralidoxime chloride and atropine auto injectors to trained first responder person-
     nel. MDG/CC’s determine auto injector distribution. Consider establishing temporary on-base
     lodging for key First Responder personnel (Civil Engineers, Medical, and Security Forces).
     A3.4.6.2. (Added-AMC) Measure 35B. Activate a CBRNE Cell with BEE, CEX/CEF personnel
     trained to perform NBC and HAZMAT plotting and risk assessment (i.e., HPAC, VLS Track,
     CAMEO/ALOHA and ChemRAT), and serve as information officers for reconnaissance teams.
  A3.4.7. Measure 36. Increase patrolling of installation. If the threat and intelligence warrants, pay
  particular attention to locations where attacks against aircraft could be mounted, such as parking areas
  and arrival departure ends of the runway.
  A3.4.7. (AMC) Measure 36. Establish additional patrols, above and beyond those outlined in Mea-
  sure 23. If the threat and intelligence warrants, during flight operations maintain continuous observa-

     tion over approach and departure flight corridors. For installations where flight corridors are located
     in highly populated areas, coordinate with local authorities for assistance. In order to fulfill these
     requirements and many others, Security Forces will have their full complement of READY forces
     assigned in FPCON Charlie.
     A3.4.8. Measure 37. Protect all designated vulnerable points. Give special attention to vulnerable
     points outside the military establishment. Consider closing or enhancing security at remote, alternate,
     practice or training airfields.
     A3.4.9. Measure 38. Erect barriers and obstacles to control traffic flow.
     A3.4.9. (AMC) Measure 38. All installation entry points will have “hardened” serpentine barriers
     between the gate and the over-watch position.
     A3.4.10. Measure 39. Consult local authorities about closing public (and military) roads and facilities
     that might make sites more vulnerable to attacks.
     A3.4.11. Measure 40. Consider aircraft dispersal, or the dispersal of other high value mobile or relo-
     catable assets, based on assessment of local threat from standoff weapons, vulnerability of the assets
     and operational feasibility.
     A3.4.12. Measure 40A. Inspect and maintain WMD incident first responder equipment and supplies
     at the highest state of readiness and ready for immediate use. Identify local vendors that are able to
     provide rapid stocks of emergency response equipment and supplies.
     A3.4.12. (AMC) Measure 40A. Rehearse all threat related emergency action procedures (e.g. build-
     ing evacuations and disaster response). If not already completed in the previous FPCON, issue oper-
     ational C2 canisters to Security Forces to include augmentees.
     A3.4.13. Measure 40B. Civil Engineer units will request their servicing weather unit to provide
     12-hour and/or 24-hour effective downwind messages and chemical downwind messages.
     A3.4.13. (AMC) Measure 40B. Civil Engineering should share messages with all first responder
     UCCs.
     A3.4.14. (Added-AMC) Measure 40C. BEE recommends appropriate monitoring locations and
     schedule for free available chlorine and pH as an indicator for system contamination after conducting
     a threat/risk analysis in conjunction with CEO, SFS and OSI.

A3.5. FPCON DELTA:
     A3.5.1. Measure 41. Continue, or introduce, all measures listed for FPCON ALPHA, BRAVO and
     CHARLIE.
     A3.5.2. Measure 42. Augment guards as necessary.
     A3.5.3. Measure 43. Identify all vehicles within operational or mission support areas.
     A3.5.4. Measure 44. Search all vehicles and their contents before allowing entrance to the installa-
     tion.
     A3.5.5. Measure 45. Control access and implement positive identification of all personnel--no excep-
     tions.
     A3.5.6. Measure 46. Search all suitcases, briefcases, packages, etc., brought into the installation.

                                                   Attachment 4

                                       TERRORIST THREAT LEVELS

A4.1. The purpose of this attachment is to provide commanders and other consumers of terrorist threat
assessments a definition of terrorist threat levels and a description of the factors used to assign a threat
level in a given country.

A4.2. In assessing the terrorist threat to US personnel and interests, DoD intelligence agencies use a
four-step scale to describe the severity of the threat. These threat levels are established by DIA and the
geographic CINCs and only apply to assessments of the terrorist threat to DoD interests. The following
lists the threat levels and the combinations of analysis-based factors used to determine the level:
      A4.2.1. HIGH. Anti-US terrorists are operationally active and uses large casualty producing attacks
      (WMD) as their preferred method of operation. There is a substantial DoD presence and the operating
      environment favors the terrorist.
      A4.2.2. SIGNIFICANT: Anti-US terrorists are present and attack personnel as their preferred
      method of operation or a group uses large casualty producing attacks (WMD) as their preferred
      method but has limited operational activity. The operating environment is neutral.
      A4.2.3. MODERATE: Terrorists are present but there are no indications of anti-US activity. The
      operating environment favors the Host Nation/US.
      A4.2.4. LOW: No group is detected or the group activity is non-threatening.

A4.3. Terrorist threat levels are a product of the following four factors:
      A4.3.1. OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. This factor focuses on the attack methods used by the
      group and other measures that enhance its effectiveness, such as state sponsorship and ingenious use
      of technology. The key element is whether the group has the capability and willingness to conduct
      large casualty producing attacks, for example a suicide vehicle bomb containing thousand of kilo-
      grams of explosives or WMD timed to kill the most personnel at the target. Groups that selectively
      assassinate individuals or conduct late night bombings causing limited property damage pose a
      decreasing threat. The ability to operate on a regional or transnational basis and the overall profession-
      alism of the group is also assessed.
      A4.3.2. INTENTIONS. This factor is the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against US
      interests. Recent substantial attacks in the country or, if the group is transnational, the conduct of oper-
      ations in other countries is the higher end of the threat scale. This is especially true if the intentions are
      anti-DoD. The basis of the group ideology, whether the group is more focused on the host nation
      rather than US interests is the other key component. Whether the group will react to high profile US
      led international events, such as intervention in the Balkans, is also considered and rated.
      A4.3.3. ACTIVITY. This factor is an assessment of the actions the group is conducting and whether
      that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack. The highest threat is credible indications
      of US targeting to include the movement of key operatives, final intelligence collection and move-
      ment of weapons to the target vicinity. Less threatening actions are contingency planning, training,
      and logistical support. Activities that would make the group less likely to attack, such as robust fund
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                          101


   raising or effective safe haven are considered. Whether the group has recently been disrupted by
   arrests or strikes on training camps will reduce the threat, at least in the short term.
   A4.3.4. OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. This factor rates how the overall environment influences
   the ability, opportunity and motivation to attack DoD interests in a given location. An important ele-
   ment of this factor is the capability of the host nation security apparatus to combat terrorism, its
   degree of cooperation with the US and the quality of the reporting on terrorist groups in the country.
   A key element is whether there is a DoD presence and if so the type, size, location, political sensitivity
   and if temporary, its duration. It is also important to consider if the group is focused on DoD as its pri-
   mary target for anti-US attacks. Another part of this factor is the overall political, economic and mili-
   tary stability of the country and its effect on the ability of a group to attack.

A4.4. DIA and the responsible geographic CINC may assign different threat levels to the same country.
This is possible because analysts occasionally disagree about the conclusions to be drawn from the avail-
able information. A4.5. Threat assessments provide information to assist commanders in determining the
appropriate FPCONs. FPCON declarations remain the exclusive responsibility of commanders. Threat
levels are not tied to FPCONs in any way, and should not be confused. National-level DoD organizations
cannot provide all intelligence that might be needed to make FPCONs determinations. Information from
regional and tactical intelligence, and local law enforcement authorities must also be considered.

A4.5. Threat assessments are not to be confused with DoD-designated high physical threat countries.
DoD-designated high physical threat countries pertain exclusively to the DoD Travel Security Policy.

   INFORMATION AND PROCEDURES FOR INSTALLATIONS RECEIVING AIR FORCE
        SECURITY FORCES CENTER AT/FP VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS

A6.1. Vulnerability assessments assist installation commanders in meeting their AT responsibilities and
should be viewed as a commander’s tool to identify vulnerabilities and options (procedural and technical)
to reduce the potential impact of terrorist attacks. The focus of VAs is on the protection of Department of
Defense (DoD) personnel and their family members. To best support the installation commander, close
coordination between the Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT) and the commander’s staff is necessary.
Prior to the VAT’s arrival, a message detailing the VAT'’s requirements will be sent to the unit being
assessed.

A6.2. The following items need to be provided to the VAT prior to their arrival:
      A6.2.1. A copy of the installation terrorism threat assessment, as required by para 2.15. of this
      instruction.

      personnel assigned.
      A6.2.3. Ten copies of a prioritized list of buildings, facilities and/or specific AT concerns, which the
      installation commander may ask the VAT to focus on. When constructing the list, remember the pri-
      mary focus of the VAT is protection of personnel and secondary considerations are priority resources.
      The buildings and facilities typically listed are those with high occupancy or US Government sym-
      bolic representation.

                                  CARVER TARGET ANALYSIS TOOL
A10.1. (Added-AMC) The following is an explanation of the CARVER targeting process. US Special
Operations Forces (SOF) uses this process in targeting adversary's installations. For that reason it is
included as a tool to evaluate US installations from an adversarial point of view. For those familiar with
the CARVER tool, it may be used in addition to or in lieu of other assessment processes.
A10.2. (Added-AMC) TARGET ANALYSIS PROCESS
      A10.2.1. (Added-AMC) This attachment explains CARVER. CARVER is used to assess mission,
      validity, and requirements. It is also used in technical appreciation and target analysis. This attach-
      ment provides a step-by-step example of how to use CARVER.
A10.3. (Added-AMC) CRITICALITY, ACCESSIBILITY, RECUPERABILITY, VULNERABIL-
ITY, EFFECT, AND RECOGNIZABILITY FACTORS
      A10.3.1. (Added-AMC) The CARVER selection factors assist in selecting the best targets or compo-
      nents to attack. As the factors are considered, they are given a numerical value. This value represents
      the desirability of attacking the target. The values are then placed in a decision matrix. After CARVER
      values for each target or component are assigned, the sum of the values indicate the highest value tar-
      get or component to be attacked within the limits of the statement of requirements and commander’s
      intent.
A10.4. (Added-AMC) CRITICALITY
      A10.4.1. (Added-AMC) Criticality means target value. This is the primary consideration in target-
      ing. A target is critical when its destruction or damage has a significant impact on military, political,
      or economic operations.
      A10.4.2. (Added-AMC) Targets within a system must be considered in relation to other elements of
      the target system. The value of a target will change as the situation develops, requiring the use of
      time-sensitive methods respond to changing situations. For example, when one has few locomotives,
      railroad bridging may be less critical as targets; however, safeguarding bridges may be critical to
      maneuvering conventional forces that require use of such bridges. Criticality depends on several fac-
      tors:
         A10.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) Time: How rapidly will the impact of the target attack affect opera-
         tions?
         A10.4.2.2. (Added-AMC) Quality: What percentage of output, production, or service will be
         curtailed by target damage?
         A10.4.2.3. (Added-AMC) Surrogates: What will be the effect on the output, production, and ser-
         vice?
         A10.4.2.4. (Added-AMC) Relativity: How many targets are there? What are their positions?
         How is their relative value determined? What will be affected in the system or complex “stream”?
      A10.4.3. (Added-AMC) Table A10.1. (Added) shows how criticality values are assigned on
      CARVER matrixes.

A10.5. (Added-AMC) ACCESSIBILITY
   A10.5.1. (Added-AMC) A target is accessible when an operational element can reach the target with
   sufficient personnel and equipment to accomplish its mission. A target can be accessible even if it
   requires the assistance of knowledgeable insiders. This assessment entails identifying and studying
   critical paths that the operational element must take to achieve its objectives, and measuring those
   things that aid or impede access. The adversary must not only be able to reach the target but must also
   remain there for an extended period. The four basic steps identifying accessibility are:
      A10.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Infiltration from the staging base to the target area.
      A10.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Movement from the point of entry to the target or objective.
      A10.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) Movement to the target’s critical element.
      A10.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Exfiltration.
   A10.5.2. (Added-AMC) Factors considered when evaluating accessibility include, but are not lim-
   ited to:
      A10.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Active and passive early warning systems.
      A10.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) Swimmer detection devices.
      A10.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) Air defense capabilities within the target area.
      A10.5.2.4. (Added-AMC) Road and rail transportation systems.
      A10.5.2.5. (Added-AMC) Type of terrain and its use.
      A10.5.2.6. (Added-AMC) Concealment and cover.
      A10.5.2.7. (Added-AMC) Population density.
      A10.5.2.8. (Added-AMC) Other natural or synthetic obstacles and barriers.
      A10.5.2.9. (Added-AMC) Current and climatic weather conditions.
   A10.5.3. (Added-AMC) The analysis along each critical path to the target should measure the time it
   would take for the action element to bypass, neutralize, or penetrate barriers and obstacles along the
   way. Accessibility is measured in terms of relative ease or difficulty of movement for the operational
114                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


      element and the likelihood of detection. The use of standoff weapons should always be considered in
      such evaluations.
      A10.5.4. (Added-AMC) Table A10.2. (Added) shows how accessibility values are assigned on
      CARVER matrices.

or lowering required
Not accessible or inaccessible without extreme difficulty                            1-2
A10.6. (Added-AMC) RECUPERABILITY
      A10.6.1. (Added-AMC) A target’s recuperability is measured in time; that is, how long will it take to
      replace, repair, or bypass the destruction of or damage to the target? Recuperability varies with the
      sources and type of targeted components and the availability of spare parts availability. Factors which
      should be considered when assessing recuperability include, but are not limited to, the availability of:
         A10.6.1.1. (Added-AMC) On-hand equipment such as railroad cranes, dry docks, and cannibal-
         ization.
         A10.6.1.2. (Added-AMC) Restoration and substitution through redundancies.
         A10.6.1.3. (Added-AMC) On hand spares.
         A10.6.1.4. (Added-AMC) Equivalent OB equipment sets that backup critical equipment or com-
         ponents, and the effects of economic embargoes and labor unrest.

      CARVER matrices.

   A10.7.1. (Added-AMC) A target is vulnerable if the adversary has the means and expertise to suc-
   cessfully attack the target. When determining the vulnerability of a target, the scale of the critical com-
   ponent needs to be compared with the capability of the attacking element to destroy or damage it. In
   general, the attacking element may tend to:
      A10.7.1.1. (Added-AMC) Choose special components.
      A10.7.1.2. (Added-AMC) Do permanent damage.
      A10.7.1.3. (Added-AMC) Prevent or inhibit cannibalization.
      A10.7.1.4. (Added-AMC) Maximize effects through the use of onsite materials.
      A10.7.1.5. (Added-AMC) Cause the target to self-destruct.
   A10.7.2. (Added-AMC) Specifically, vulnerability depends on:
      A10.7.2.1. (Added-AMC) The nature and construction of the target.
      A10.7.2.2. (Added-AMC) The amount of damage required.
      A10.7.2.3. (Added-AMC) The assets available; for example, personnel, expertise, motivation,
      weapons, explosives, and equipment.
   A10.7.3. (Added-AMC) Table A10.4. (Added) shows how vulnerability values are assigned on
   CARVER matrices.

measures
A10.8. (Added-AMC) EFFECT.
   A10.8.1. (Added-AMC) The effect of a target attack is a measure of possible military, political, eco-
   nomic, psychological, and sociological impacts at the target and beyond. This is closely related to the
   measure of target criticality. The type and magnitude of given effects desired will help the adversary
   select targets and target components for attack. Effect in this context addresses all significant effects,
   whether desired or not, that may result once the selected target component is attacked. Traditionally,
   this element has addressed the effect on the local population, but now there are broader consider-
   ations. Effect is frequently neutral at the tactical adversarial level. For example, the primary effect of
   the destruction of two adjacent long-range radar sites in an early warning system may be to open a
116                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


      hole in the system that is of sufficient size and duration to permit our adversary to launch a successful
      attack against the installation. Effects can also include:
         A10.8.1.1. (Added-AMC) The triggering of countermeasures.
         A10.8.1.2. (Added-AMC) Support or negation of PSYOP themes.
         A10.8.1.3. (Added-AMC) Unemployment.
         A10.8.1.4. (Added-AMC) Reprisals against the civilian populace.
         A10.8.1.5. (Added-AMC) Collateral damage to other targets.
      A10.8.2. (Added-AMC) Possible effects can be speculative and should be labeled as such. Effects of
      the same attack may be quite different at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. For example,
      the destruction of a substation may not affect local power supply but cuts off all power to an adjacent
      region.
      A10.8.3. (Added-AMC) Table A10.5. (Added) shows how effect values are assigned on CARVER
      matrices.

A10.9. (Added-AMC) RECOGNIZABILITY
      A10.9.1. (Added-AMC) A target’s recognizability is the degree to which it can be recognized by the
      adversary and his intelligence collection and reconnaissance assets, under varying conditions.
      Weather has an obvious and significant impact on visibility. Rain, snow, and ground fog may obscure
      observation. Road segments with sparse vegetation and adjacent high ground provide excellent condi-
      tions for good observation. Distance, light, and season must also be considered. Other factors that
      influence recognizability include the size and complexity of the target, the existence of distinctive tar-
      get signatures, the presence of masking or camouflage, and the technical sophistication and training of
      the adversary.
      A10.9.2. (Added-AMC) Table A10.6. (Added) shows how recognizability values are assigned on
      CARVER matrixes.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                         117

CRITERIA                                                                          SCALE
The target is clearly recognizable under all conditions and from a                 9-10
distance; it requires little or no training for recognition
The target is easily recognizable at small-arms range and requires a                 7-8
small amount of training for recognition
The target is difficult to recognize at night in bad weather, or might               5-6
be confused with other targets or target component; it requires some
training for recognition
The target is difficult to recognize at night or in bad weather, even                3-4
with small-arms range; it is easily confused with other targets or
components, it requires extensive training for recognition
The target cannot be recognized under any conditions, except by                      1-2
experts
A10.10. (Added-AMC) CARVER MATRIX
   A10.10.1. (Added-AMC) These CARVER factors and their assigned values are used to construct a
   CARVER matrix. For the adversary this is a tool for rating the desirability of potential targets and
   wisely allocating attack resources. For the installation commander, it is a tool to counter the adversary.
   A10.10.2. (Added-AMC) To construct the matrix, list the adversary's potential targets in the left col-
   umn. For strategic level analysis, list the installation's systems or subsystems (electric power supply,
   rail system). For tactical level analysis, list the complexes or components of the subsystems or com-
   plexes selected by your MEVA analysis. (Table A10.7. (Added) shows a sample matrix for a bulk
   electric power supply facility.)
   A10.10.3. (Added-AMC) As each potential target is evaluated for each CARVER factor, enter the
   appropriate targets have been evaluated, add the values for each potential target. The sums represent
   the relative desirability of each potential target; this constitutes a prioritized list of targets. Attack
   those targets with the highest totals first.
   A10.10.4. (Added-AMC) If additional men and/or munitions are available, allocate these resources
   to the remaining potential targets in descending numerical order. This allocation scheme will maxi-
   mize the use of limited resources. Planners can use the CARVER matrix to present the installation's
   staff with a variety of adversary defeat options. With the matrix they can discuss the strengths and
   weaknesses of each COA against the installation's targeted facility.

        DEMOGRAPHY/MISSION, SYMBOLISM, HISTORY, ACCESSIBILITY,
    RECOGNIZABILITY, POPULATION, AND PROXIMITY (DSHARPP OR MSHARPP)
                          MATRIX EXPLANATION
A11.1. (Added-AMC) The purpose of the D(M)SHARPP matrix is to analyze likely terrorist targets.
Consideration is given to the local threat, likely means of attack available to the enemy, and variables
affecting the disposition (e.g., “attractiveness” to enemy, potential psychological effect on community,
etc.) of potential targets. This document provides an example of how to use D(M)SHARPP.
   A11.1.1. (Added-AMC) After developing a list of potential targets, use the D(M)SHARPP selection
   factors to assist in further refining your assessment by determining the most likely (i.e., efficient,
   effective, and plausible) method of attack and identifying vulnerabilities to that type of attack. After
   the D(M)SHARPP values for each target or component are assigned, the sum of the values indicate
   the highest value target (for a particular mode of attack) within the limits of the enemy’s known capa-
   bilities.
A11.2. (Added-AMC) DEMOGRAPHY.
   A11.2.1. (Added-AMC) Demography focuses mainly on the threat to personnel and asks the ques-
   tion “who are the targets?” Depending on the ideology of the terrorist group(s), being a member of a
   particular demographic group can make someone (or some group) a more likely target. Therefore,
   when assessing points in this area, determine whether or not the group(s) have a history of or are pre-
   dicted to target:
       A11.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) Military members.
       A11.2.1.2. (Added-AMC) Family members (US citizens in general).
       A11.2.1.3. (Added-AMC) Civilian employees of the US government (include local nationals).
       A11.2.1.4. (Added-AMC) Senior officers or other high-risk personnel.
   A11.2.2. (Added-AMC) Assess points to the target facility (scale of 1-5; 5 being worst) in this area
   based upon the MO of the group in targeting specific groups, and the potential for the target to be
   attacked based on its housing personnel of that particular group.
   A11.2.3. (Added-AMC) Demography Criteria Scale:
       A11.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) Facility routinely contains substantial numbers of personnel known to
       be targeted by the enemy.
       A11.2.3.2. (Added-AMC) Contains known target group, but rarely in large concentrations.
       A11.2.3.3. (Added-AMC) Little target value based on demographics of occupants.
A11.3. (Added-AMC) MISSION.
   A11.3.1. (Added-AMC) Mission focuses mainly on the threat to the situations, activities, capabili-
   ties, and resources on an installation that are vulnerable to a terrorist attack. The mission components
   consist of the equipment, information, facilities, and/or operations or activities that are necessary to
   accomplish the installation’s mission. When assessing points in this area, determine whether or not an
   attack on mission components will cause degradation by assessing the components:
120                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


         A11.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) Importance: Importance measures the value of the area or assets
         located in the area, considering their function, inherent nature, and monetary value.
         A11.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Effect: Effect measures the ramifications of a terrorist incident in the
         area, considering the psychological, economic, sociological, and military impacts.
         A11.3.1.3. (Added-AMC) Recoverability: Recoverability measures the time required for the
         function occurring at that area to be restored, considering the availability of resources, parts,
         expertise and manpower, and redundancies.
      A11.3.2. (Added-AMC) Assess points to the target equipment, information, facilities, and/or opera-
      tions or activities (scale of 1-5; 5 being worst) in this area based upon the degree of mission degrada-
      tion if attacked by a terrorist.
      A11.3.3. (Added-AMC) Mission Criteria Scale:
         A11.3.3.1. (Added-AMC) Installation cannot continue to carry out its mission until the attacked
         asset is restored.
         A11.3.3.2. (Added-AMC) Ability to carry out a primary mission of the installation would be sig-
         nificantly impaired if this asset were successfully attacked.
         A11.3.3.3. (Added-AMC) Half of the mission capability remains if the asset were successfully
         attacked.
         A11.3.3.4. (Added-AMC) The installation could continue to carry out its mission if this asset
         were attacked, albeit with some degradation in effectiveness.
         A11.3.3.5. (Added-AMC) Destroying or disrupting this asset would have no effect on the ability
         of the installation to accomplish its mission.
A11.4. (Added-AMC) SYMBOLISM.
      A11.4.1. (Added-AMC) A consider whether the target represents, or is perceived by the enemy to
      represent, a symbol of a targeted group (e.g., symbolic of US military, Christianity, government,
      authority, etc.). Assess points in this area based upon the symbolic value of the target to the enemy.
      A11.4.2. (Added-AMC) Symbolism Criteria Scale:
         A11.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) High profile, direct symbol of target group or ideology.
         A11.4.2.2. (Added-AMC) Low profile, direct symbol of target group or ideology.
         A11.4.2.3. (Added-AMC) Low profile and/or obscure symbol of target group or ideology.
         A11.4.2.4. (Added-AMC) (For MISSION) Asset is perceived to be vital to the mission of the
         installation.
A11.5. (Added-AMC) HISTORY.
      A11.5.1. (Added-AMC) Do terrorist groups have a history of attacking this type of target? While you
      must consider terrorist trends worldwide, focus on local targeting history and capabilities.
      A11.5.2. (Added-AMC) History Criteria Scale:
         A11.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Strong history of attacking this type of target.
         A11.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) History of attacking this type of target, but none in the immediate past.
AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006                                                       121


     A11.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) Little to no history of attacking this type of target.
A11.6. (Added-AMC) ACCESSIBILITY.
  A11.6.1. (Added-AMC) A target is accessible when an operational element can reach the target with
  sufficient personnel and equipment to accomplish its mission. A target can be accessible even if it
  requires the assistance of knowledgeable insiders. This assessment entails identifying and studying
  critical paths that the operational element must take to achieve its objectives, and measuring those
  things that aid or impede access. The enemy must not only be able to reach the target but must also
  remain there for an extended period. The four basic stages to consider, when assessing accessibility
  are:
     A11.6.1.1. (Added-AMC) Infiltration from the staging base to the target area.
     A11.6.1.2. (Added-AMC) Movement from the point of entry to the target or objective.
     A11.6.1.3. (Added-AMC) Movement to the target’s critical element.
     A11.6.1.4. (Added-AMC) Exfiltration.
  A11.6.2. (Added-AMC) Accessability Criteria Scale:
     A11.6.2.1. (Added-AMC) Easily accessible, standoff weapons can be employed.
     A11.6.2.2. (Added-AMC) Inside Perimeter fence, climbing or lowering required.
     A11.6.2.3. (Added-AMC) Not accessible or inaccessible without extreme difficulty.
A11.7. (Added-AMC) RECOGNIZABILITY.
  A11.7.1. (Added-AMC) A target’s recognizability is the degree to which an operational element and/
  or intelligence collection and reconnaissance asset under varying conditions can recognize it. Weather
  has an obvious and significant impact on visibility (yours and the enemy’s). Rain, snow, and ground
  fog may obscure observation. Road segments with sparse vegetation and adjacent high ground pro-
  vide excellent conditions for good observation. Distance, light, and season must be considered.
  A11.7.2. (Added-AMC) Other factors that influence recognizability include the size and complexity
  of the target, the existence of distinctive target signatures, the presence of masking or camouflage, and
  the technical sophistication and training of the enemy.
  A11.7.3. (Added-AMC) Recognizability Criteria Scale:
     A11.7.3.1. (Added-AMC) Target is clearly recognizable under all conditions and from a dis-
     tance; requires little or no training for recognition.
     A11.7.3.2. (Added-AMC) Target is easily recognizable at small-arms range and requires a small
     amount of training for recognition.
     A11.7.3.3. (Added-AMC) Target is difficult to recognize at night or in bad weather, or might be
     confused with other targets; requires training for recognition.
     A11.7.3.4. (Added-AMC) Target cannot be recognized under any conditions—except by experts.
A11.8. (Added-AMC) POPULATION.
122                                  AFI10-245_AMCSUP_MACDILLAFBSUP_I 11 JANUARY 2006


      A11.8.1. (Added-AMC) What is the population relative to other potential targets? Going on the
      assumption the intent of the attack is to kill or injure personnel, it follows that the more densely pop-
      ulated an area/facility is, the more lucrative a target it makes (all other things being equal).
      A11.8.2. (Added-AMC) Population Criteria Scale:
         A11.8.2.1. (Added-AMC) Densely populated; prone to frequent crowds.
         A11.8.2.2. (Added-AMC) Relatively large numbers of people, but not in close proximity (i.e.,
         spread out and hard to reach in a single attack).
         A11.8.2.3. (Added-AMC) Sparsely populated; prone to having small groups or individuals.
         A11.8.2.4. (Added-AMC) (For MISSION) The population is comprised of personnel deemed
         vital to the accomplishment of the installation’s mission.
         A11.8.2.5. (Added-AMC) (For MISSION) Population has no special segment necessary for mis-
         sion accomplishment.
         A11.8.2.6. (Added-AMC) (For MISSION) Sparsely populated or unattended.
A11.9. (Added-AMC) PROXIMITY.
      A11.9.1. (Added-AMC) Is the potential target located near other personnel, facilities, or resources
      that, because of their intrinsic value or “protected” status and a fear of collateral damage, afford it
      some form of protection? (i.e., near national monuments, protected/religious symbols, etc., which the
      enemy holds in high regard). NOTE: It is important to consider whether the target is in close proximity
      to other likely targets. Just as the risk of unwanted collateral damage may decrease the chances of
      attack; a “target-rich” environment may increase the chances of attack.
      A11.9.2. (Added-AMC) Proximity Criteria Scale:
         A11.9.2.1. (Added-AMC) Target is isolated; no chance of unwanted collateral damage to pro-
         tected symbols or personnel.
         A11.9.2.2. (Added-AMC) Target is in close enough proximity to place protected personnel, facil-
         ities, etc., at risk of injury or damage, but not destruction.
         A11.9.2.3. (Added-AMC) Target is in close proximity; serious injury/ damage or death/total
         destruction of protected personnel/facilities likely.
      A11.9.3. (Added-AMC) Table A11.1. (Added) is an example DSHARPP worksheet. Table A11.2.
      (Added) is an example MSHARPP worksheet. Values from 1 to 5 are assigned to each factor based on
      the associated data for each target. Five represents the highest vulnerability or likelihood of attack and
      1 the lowest. Accordingly, the higher the total score, the more vulnerable the target. Because this anal-
      ysis is highly subjective, some analysts prefer simple "stoplight" charts with red, yellow and green
      markers representing descending degrees of vulnerability. The D(M)SHARPP analysis must consider
      both the present force protection posture and enhanced postures proposed for escalating FPCONs.

      A11.9.4. (Added-AMC) Specific target vulnerabilities must be combined with exploitable perimeter
      control vulnerabilities. If access routes are well protected and not deemed exploitable an otherwise
      vulnerable building becomes a less likely target.
