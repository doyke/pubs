Terms
Aircraft Explosives Cargo Parking Area—Any area, commonly called a hot cargo pad, specifically
designated for parking aircraft loaded with transportation-configured explosives cargo, or those being
loaded, unloaded, or awaiting loading. McConnell AFB aircraft explosives cargo parking area is
designated as Delta-1 through Delta-4, Echo-1 through Echo-3, Echo-5, Able-7 through Able-21, Baker-7
through Baker-24.
Quantity-Distance—The quantity of explosive material and distance separation relationships that
provide defined types of protection. These relationships are based on the level of risk considered
acceptable for each stipulated exposure and are tabulated in the Q-D tables of AFMAN 91-201.
Separation distances are not absolute safe distances, but are relative protective or safe distances.
Safe Haven/Refuge—Temporary storage granted to DOE classified shipment transporters at DOD
facilities in order to assure the safety and security of nuclear material and/or nonnuclear classified
material. It also includes parking for commercial vehicles containing HC/D 1.1 through 1.4 explosives
