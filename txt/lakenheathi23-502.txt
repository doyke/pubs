This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 23-5, Reusing and Disposing of Materiel. Its pur-
pose is to establish simple procedures for turn-in or disposal of serviceable or unserviceable Expendabil-
ity/Recoverability/Reparability/Cost Designator (ERRC XB3) coded items. This instruction also
implements procedures mandated by AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 13. Current policy for
disposition of government property dictates that the only items that may be disposed of as trash are items
that have no potential value to the government. The overall objective of this instruction is to establish pro-
cedures for turn-in of consumable and expendable XB3 materiel and scrap by establishing turn-in/pick up
points throughout the base. This instruction applies to all personnel attached to RAF Lakenheath. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, prescribed by AFI11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program
(FMP); route AF IMT 847s from the field through Major Command (MAJCOM) publications/forms
managers.

     identified as:
         2.7.2.1. Serviceable identified materiel.
         2.7.2.2. Serviceable/repairable not identified materiel.

     accomplished by attaching DD Form 1574, (yellow) Serviceable Tag-Materiel, (can be ordered/
     downloaded from https://www.e-publishing.af.mil) to the property.

      2.7.5. Ensure materiel placed in the serviceable/repairable not identified container is either mate-
      riel the user considers to be unserviceable but cannot be identified by a part number and/or NSN
      or unserviceable materiel the user thinks has repair potential. Property must be clearly marked ser-
      viceable or unserviceable and annotated with organization and shop.
      2.7.6. Ensure materiel placed in the unserviceable/scrap container is materiel the user determines
      to be unserviceable and not potentially repairable by the organization.
      2.7.7. Ensure items in the serviceable/repairable not identified containers are reviewed periodi-
      cally and determine the appropriate disposition. Items that can be identified to a part number or a
      NSN are so identified and placed in the serviceable container. Those items that have repair poten-
      tial are routed to the AFREP Manager. Items determined to be unidentifiable or not repairable are
      relocated to the unserviceable/scrap container.
      2.7.8. Potential Waste Buster materiel must be properly segregated prior to scheduled pick up.
      Any co-mingled materiel, such as trash or items that have no potential value to the government,
      will not be picked up.
      2.7.9. Ensure hazardous materiel or shelf life materiel is not placed in the collection or pickup
      points for Waste Busters. This materiel should be turned-in through the Hazardous Materiel Phar-
      macy or the Hazardous Waste Disposal Site as applicable.
      2.7.10. Retain serviceable items representing less than a full issue (unit of issue Box (BX), Pack-
      age (PG), etc). Items may be retained as work order residue or when authorized on bench stock.
      Items may be retained regardless of excess position.
