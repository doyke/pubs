Plans, Requirements and Programs (DO) when the annual training allocation is submitted; daily
Chaff/Flare and 20 MM expenditure procedures to include the inventory, documentation, MC2
updates and the turn-in of unserviceable magazines; additionally each Aircraft Maintenance Unit
(AMU) will maintain required impulse cartridges on their Custody Account; and update of daily
missile flying hours tracking program with Munitions Control.
1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Maintenance personnel will be responsible for complying with the procedures of this
     instruction. The 44 AMU, 67 AMU and 33 AMU in conjunction with 18 MUNS Munitions
     Controllers are responsible for directing the timely compliance of these procedures.
     1.2. All units assigned to Kadena AB who use AFI 11-212 munitions managed by 18 MUNS
     will identify their aircrew training munitions requirements to include “Static Display” or
     Concurrent Servicing Operation (CSO) in the weekly flying schedule.
        1.2.1. All special requirements for munitions, such as a projected TDY, will be
        forecasted by the requesting organization through PACAF A4/A4MT and PACAF/DO
        when the annual training allocation is submitted. Note: Weapons Standardization (WS)
        will be notified by the Precision Guided Munitions Section (PGM) scheduler when a
        missile is coming due for inspection. PGM will make every effort to provide WS with a
        replacement missile during maintenance.
     1.3. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will assist Munitions Control when problems
     arise with munitions. MOC will notify Munitions Control immediately of accidents/incidents
     involving munitions on aircraft or the airfield. Note: Other MOC responsibilities are
     outlined in the 18 WG supplement to AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
     1.4. Requirements involving transfer of munitions allocations within the PACAF Area of
     Responsibility will be coordinated through Munitions Accountability no later than 120 days
     prior to exercise start date to ensure availability of assets to support the exercise.
