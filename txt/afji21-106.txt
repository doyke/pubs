                                          MAINTENANCE         CODES


GENERAL:   Maintenance    codes are assigned to indicate the levels of maintenance    authorized to
USE and REPAIR    support items. The maintenance    codes are entered in the third and fourth posi-
tions of the Uniform    SMR Code Format       as follows:

 USE (THIRD        POSITION):     The maintenance      code entered in the third position will indicate the
lowest maintenance     level authorized to remove, replace, and use the support item. The decision to
to code the item for removal and replacement         at the indicated maintenance    level will require that
all the capabilities  necessary to install and insure proper operation after installation       of a replace-
ment item (i.e., pre-installation     inspection, testing and post-installation   checkout)    are provided.
The maintenance      code entered in the third position will indicate one of the following levels of
maintenance.


Code                      APPLICATION/EXPLANATION

 0                        Support item     is removed,      replaced,    used at the organizational       level of
                          maintenance.

                          Note (1): To distinguish        between the organizational   maintenance   capa-
                          bilities on different classes of ships the following codes may be used intra-
                          Navy only. On joint programs,           Navy will receive and transmit   an 0 to
                          indicate organizational    maintenance    level.

                          Note (2):    On Army programs, a code “C” may be used in the third posi-
                          tion to denote crew or operator maintenance    performed  within organiza-
                          tional maintenance.    On joint programs the Army will receive or transmit
                          an 0 to indicate organizational  level.

 F                        Support   item is removed,        replaced,    used at the following    intermediate

                           * Note : For    USAF programs    and the USA safeguard      program,   Code F
                                     will be used to denote intermediate   maintenance.    On joint pro-
                                     grams, use of either Code F or H by the joining service will denote
                                     intermediate maintenance   to USAF and the USA Safeguard        pro-
                                     gram.

 D                         Support Items that are removed, replaced, used at Depot only :
                           USAF-Depot,    Mobile Depot and Specialized Repair Activity
                           USA-Depot,    Mobile Depot, Specialized Repair Activity
                           USN-Aviation    Rework, Avionics and Ordnance Facilities, and Shipyards
                           USMC-Depot

REPAIR     (Fourth Position):    The maintenance code entered in the fourth position indicates whether
the item is to be repaired and identifies the lowest maintenance        level with the capability to perform
complete repair    (i.e., all authorized  maintenance     functions).    The decision to code the support
item for repair at the indicated maintenance        levels requires that all maintenance        capability   (re-
move, replace, repair, assemble, and test) for the support items be provided to that level. This
does not preclude some repair which may be accomplished              at a lower level of maintenance.      How-
ever, because of service differences       in communicating      maintenance      repair level information       a
maintenance    code entry in this position is not required by all services. When a maintenance              code
is not used a dash (-)        sign will be entered. For multi-service        equipment/systems      or when a
code is entered, this position will contain one of the following maintenance              codes as assigned by
the service(s)   that require the code :


Code                       APPLICATION/EXPLANATION

 0                         The lowest maintenance           level capable    of complete   repair   of the support
                           item is the organizational       level.
                           Note : To distinguish between the organizational            maintenance capabilities
                                  on different classes of ships the following codes will be used intra-
                                  Navy only. On joint programs, Navy will receive and transmit an 0
                                  to indicate organizational     maintenance    level.
