                                           Chapter 1

            AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force‟s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and
sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements.
Through the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of
both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
   1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting. This
   instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations Planning
   and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full description
   of AEF concepts. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
   Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
   Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Force Presentation. The Air Force aligns its war fighting capabilities into a baseline of 10
AEFs, each intended to contain an equivalent capability from which to provide forces. During
periods of increased requirements, capability areas from these 10 AEFs may be realigned within
the Global AEF construct to a Tempo Band that provides a deeper pool of capability, deploying
that capability at a more stringent deploy-to-dwell rate. The Air Force develops and tailors force
packages to meet mission requirements. Specifically tailored forces are presented to theater
commanders as Air and Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETFs). Refer to Air Force Doctrine
Document (AFDD) 2 for doctrinal guidance on force presentation. The AEF will include
strategic “enabler” or common user assets, such as long-range mobility, Special Operations
Forces (SOF), and space forces, that will provide support to authorized organizations within and
outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force movements of AEF forces.
Also postured as enablers, the Air Force‟s High Demand/Low Supply (HD/LS) assets (U2, E-8
JSTARS, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 RIVET JOINT, SOF, CSAR, etc.), will play critical roles in
AEF operations.
1.3. Spectrum of Operations. The National Military Strategy dictates that the Air Force be
prepared to support requirements across the spectrum of operations from humanitarian and
disaster relief operations up to and including major war (MW). The Air Force will meet its day-
to-day steady-state deployed operational commitments using the UTCs assigned to the two on-
call AEFs, one on-call AEW, and available enabler forces. Any substantial or sustained
commitment of forces beyond this level will constitute a surge for the Air Force, which will
require some degree of reconstitution of the involved forces after the surge ends.
1.4. Force Management. The AEF libraries contain a finite amount of capability that at any
given time identifies forces that constitute the total force that has been made available or
allocated for scheduling. The 10 AEFs are paired (e.g. AEF 1 and 2, AEF 3 and 4, etc.) into five
4-month contingency on-call/deployment eligibility period every 20 months. Most LS/HD assets,
as defined in GMFP, are not formally assigned to individual AEFs but are postured in the
Enabler library and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Deployment levels must be
consistent with GMFP guidelines. Air refueling forces and medium-range airlift forces (currently
consisting of C-130 units) will be assigned to AEFs and enabler operations, subject to careful
scheduling to avoid over tasking.

1.5. Reporting AEF Status - General. To view the health of forces in the ten (10) designated
AEF's, AEWs, lead mobility wings and enablers, Air Force senior leadership determined a need
to collect UTC readiness status data from all AEF-allocated UTCs of sufficient detail to support
the following goals:
     1.5.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, MAJCOM's, and AFPC/DPW
     readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF operations.
     1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC‟s current and future (6 months out) ability
     or inability to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.5.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.6. System Description: The AEF UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART) is designed to support
the goals listed above. ART allows AEF-allocated units the ability to report UTC level readiness
data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It allows immediate updates and
ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of command with sufficient depth of
information to make informed decisions on the employment of forces for AEF operations. It
further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable indicators of change.
     1.6.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/) for secure
     access. Units that are levied UTC taskings under AEF, view and report their status against
     these taskings directly within the ART application.
     1.6.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
     produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
     accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access.
     1.6.3. A       fully   functional    training      site    exists      on    the     NIPRNET
     (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.mil/). This site also allows personnel to review the ART
     tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this site; anyone can login and enter
     training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT enter real world data on the
     training site.
     1.6.4. Operationally, ART supports the goals stated above by collecting and collating unit-
     reported data to answer, in whole or in part, the following associated questions:
        1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if
        tasked
        1.6.4.2. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their component tasked mission?
        1.6.4.3. Do adequate resources exist and is training available in order to accomplish and
        sustain the AEF mission(s)?

  1.6.5. ART complements readiness data reported in Status of Resources and Training
  Systems (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular scalable capability-based UTC‟s
  designed to meet the needs of the 21st century force while SORTS is unit-centric with
  reporting based on major war (MW) commitments. The basis for both systems is the AEF
  Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library (Once the UTC Availability Module
  (UTA) is available in DCAPES, it will be the basis.). The tasking baseline contained in ART
  is derived from the AEF Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library which
  supports the range of military operations (ROMO). Readiness assessments for MW and AEF
  tasking must be considered together; however, the reporting guidelines for each may be
  independent. A unit‟s C level as reported in SORTS may not directly correlate to its ability to
  support a specific UTC tasking as indicated in ART.

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each
UTC in the AEF library; and they provide higher levels of command the necessary information
to make force and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders.
Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine the most effective force
tasking. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate information at all levels.
For these reasons integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card,
but a method of identifying a UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of
resources therefore, commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.

                                  REPORTING POLICIES

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. A UTC assessments in
ART is classified confidential, aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive
Order (EO) 12958. Do not enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special
Access Required" information.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified at a minimum CONFIDENTIAL.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its impact
       on national security if released.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW it‟s original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating
       or used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance.
       Preformatted worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. As with SORTS, ART combines elements of the
       JOPES database with assessments of the ability of units to provide combat capability.
       The assessments are used in the Air Force war-planning effort as a readiness feed to the
       Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) which
       parallels SORTS and JOPES war-planning capability. The Joint Staff SORTS database is
       classified SECRET. Information extracted from this database is classified IAW, CJCSI
       3401.02 and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with EO 12958,
       except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
       contain exempted data. ART will follow this same rule set and classification guidance.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data “DERIVED FROM: AFI 10-244 dated 12 Sep 05, Declassify on:
       (date).” The date of declassification is 4 years from the date of the document for each
       level of classification. Declassification timeline is 4 years for CONFIDENTIAL, 8 years
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012                               23


       for SECRET. See DOD 5200.1r, Information Security Program and CJCSM 3150.02
       Global Status of Resources and Training for additional classification guidance.
       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit‟s current ability through the next six
months to support each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC
AEF assignment of forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART.
ART is a source for AEF UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
   3.3.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs allocated to an AEF or identified as an enabler
   shall continue to report SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement
   and AFI 10-201, in addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Assessments. Assessments are based on all aspects of the UTC to include: (1) the
ability to perform the capability defined by the Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement, (2) can
fulfill the standard manpower requirements, and (3) can fulfill the complete equipment
requirements.     The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail
(LOGDET) and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the Manpower and
Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) will be used to maintain the manpower and
equipment requirements.
   3.4.1. Response Time. A UTC readiness assessment is based on resources that are expected
   to be mission ready and available within their DOC response time, (if the UTC is referenced
   in the unit‟s DOC statement), or within 72 hours of tasking or less depending on the UTC
   requirements. A UTC is eligible to be tasked to perform its mission at any time.
   3.4.2. The Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) provides a brief description of the
   capability for which the UTC is designed.
   3.4.3. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides a list of equipment the
   UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) contains the manpower detail
   required to provide the capability for a standard UTC.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
   3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
   health of the UTC.
   3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ
   the UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, equipment, training, and equipment
   condition. Personnel must be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required mission and
   skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions. Equipment must be
   serviceable and available for deployment.
       3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
       equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
24 AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012


    problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
    the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
    available if they are assigned to the unit and are physically present at the unit for
    deployment.
        3.4.7.1.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
        “rainbowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
        but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
        be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
        deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
        of the shared equipment.
        3.4.7.1.2. (Added-AMC) Equipment and supplies are required to be available to
        redeploy within 72 hours, unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM.
    3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
    support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
    the mission. Units assess the equipment condition for combat essential and support
    equipment based on the availability of required equipment.
        3.4.7.2.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
        “rainbowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
        but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
        be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
        deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
        of the shared equipment.
    3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
    the mission for which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC
    must have all required mission and skill level training completed IAW applicable
    directives and instructions at the time of assessment. Individual training not required by
    the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment but will
    be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
    3.4.7.4. DELETED
    3.4.7.5. (Added-AMC) Personnel filling a UTC requirement may be considered
    available to deploy if the projected TDY completion date is more than 30 days prior to
    their report no later than date (RNLTD), separation date, or retirement date.
        3.4.7.5.1. (Added-AMC) When assessing the status of UTCs in ART, report skill
        level substitutions as either Yellow or Red, only if the substitutions are not
        specifically allowed in the UTC Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP). Report as
        follows: Yellow if the UTC can meet the MISCAP (include a remark specifying the
        skill level substitution). Red if the UTC cannot meet the MISCAP. This is not to be
        confused with skill level substitutions authorized during actual sourcing, as outlined
        in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
 3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
 deficient capabilities (i.e. shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red; shortage of
 one generator may, similarly a member on a 72 hour medical profile would not require a
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                    25


   UTC status change, whereas a person with a broken leg would). Remarks should reflect
   training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
   3.4.9. In addition and independent of the stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red) assessment, each
   unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can meet theater
   specific requirements including line remarks IAW timing criteria.
   3.4.10. When substitutions, not explicitly allowed in the MISCAP but authorized IAW AFI
   10-401 guidance, are used in ART reporting, they will be noted using the Standard
   Assessment Remark of AFSC, Skill Level Training or Grade, and drive at a minimum a
   "Yellow" UTC assessment.
   3.4.11. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining assets continue to be
   available for the entire deployment eligibility window. Commanders should indicate this in a
   remark.
   3.4.12. Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the
   deployed portion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information
   warrants otherwise. Commanders will also continue to submit an overall UTC assessment for
   complete UTCs that have deployed. If a UTC is deployed and was being assessed as Green,
   commanders will continue to assess the UTC as Green unless circumstances/information
   warrants otherwise. For UTCs that were deployed while being assessed Yellow or Red,
   commanders will continue with that assessment until circumstances/information warrants
   upgrading the assessment.
3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment will be rated using
the following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist (Attachment 2).
   3.5.1. Green. The complete UTC to include the exact MANFOR and LOGFOR equipment
   with only MISCAP explicit substitutions and all training for the AEF allocated UTC are
   available for deployment within 72 hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent
   criteria.
   3.5.1. (AMC) If a UTC is coded “Green” and cannot meet all or part of its MISCAP during
   an IG inspection, UTC will receive an “Unsatisfactory” or “Marginal” grade. The affected
   unit will change the UTC‟s ART status to reflect the correct assessment (yellow or red) and
   provide the rationale for not being green with an associated Get Well Date. HQ AMC/IG will
   forward the "Yellow" or "Red" UTCs to the applicable MAJCOM FAM(s) and courtesy
   copy AMC/A3OCR to ensure accurate ART reporting. Once corrective actions have been
   completed and the Wing/CC or equivalent determines the UTC can meet its full MISCAP,
   unit will return the UTC ART status to “Green.”
   3.5.2. Yellow. The UTC has a missing or deficient MANFOR or LOGFOR requirement; but
   that missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
   accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. This includes AFI 10-403
   approved standard substitutions. Provide a detailed explanation in remarks. Describe the
   condition, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date. In the event that a skill
   level or grade is dependent only on a members‟ promotion it still needs to be noted and still
   drives a „Yellow‟ state.
26 AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012


 3.5.3. Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the UTC
 from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation.
 Provide detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective
 action and provide a get-well date.
 3.5.3. (AMC) Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the
 UTC from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation
 based on the UTC MISCAP statement. However, residual capability with the UTC may still
 be capable of supporting its theater specific tasking.
 3.5.4. Incorrectly Postured. This rating is to be used when a UTC is postured against a unit
 in ART and the unit commander believes this to be in error. Assigning this rating in ART
 will generate an email to the MAJCOM ART POC, raising the issue with the MAJCOM
 FAM to help determine whether or not the UTC is correctly postured. A detailed explanation
 is to be provided in the email of why the UTC should not be postured against your unit. This
 information will be forwarded to the MAJCOM UTC FAM ,who postured the UTC against
 the unit, for coordination and resolution.
 3.5.5. Think of the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a
 Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet
 theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
 3.5.6. (Added-AMC) Assess UTCs when determined to be “bad" or "incorrectly postured”.
 Input specific rationale as to why the UTC is suspected of being bad or incorrectly postured
 using the appropriate comment area on the deficiency screen. For "incorrectly postured"
 UTCs, input the AMC UTC FAM's email address (listing provided at
 (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=20703).
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012                            27


Figure 3.1. Monthly Assessment Process.




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning
UTC‟s tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet
theater specific requirements to include line remarks. Each unit commander‟s UTC tasking
assessment is the Air Force‟s certification of forces. This assessment is independent of the
overall UTC stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific
skill level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow,
Red) does not change since the stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC assessment
due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater requirement. Even
though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
   3.6.2. (Added-AMC) When a UTC is partially tasked and the unit can meet the theater
   requirements, mark tasked line numbers within the UTC as “Tasked – Yes”, and mark “Yes”
   or “No” whether the line number is deployed. Then identify that the UTC can meet its
   tasking, (e.g., “Can Meet – Yes”). Overall UTC assessment does not change when partially
   tasked.
 28 AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012


   3.6.3. (Added-AMC) When indicating “Meets – No” outline the planned action (i.e. waiver
   requested, training scheduled, or shortfall to be submitted) in the tasked remark area. Units
   will continually update the tasked remark area with the status of the waiver request or
   reclama until final disposition.
       3.6.3.1. (Added-AMC) ART must be updated immediately with concise information
       identifying: The shortfall condition (i.e. condition 1 – 5), Shortfall justification to include
       authorized and assigned personnel, and ability to fulfill any other AFSC or equipment
       requirements.
       3.6.3.2. (Added-AMC) When possible, units tasked to deploy under a non-postured
       UTC will identify a postured UTC with similar requirements and mark it as “Tasked -
       Yes” and “Meets - Yes.” The unit must identify the actual tasked UTC in the general
       remark area.

Figure 3.2. Tasked to Deploy Assessment Process.




3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the Commander‟s Remarks section is an
additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information that affects the readiness or
availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of the
UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTSUP_I 2 FEBRUARY 2012                                   29


3.7. (AMC)Remarks. Unit ART Monitors must provide rank, last name, and Defense Switched
Network (DSN) number when entering free text remarks on any of the Remark Fields as its last
line. For example: “TSgt Buck B. Buck at DSN: (312)779-2323.”
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations are acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or
   unit/system/functional specific acronyms will be defined when first used in a report. Do not
   refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments every 30 calendar days. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
3.8. (AMC)When to Report. All AMC and AMC gained units (upon activation under Title 10)
will submit and update the overall UTC health assessments every 31 calendar days. This update
will be accomplished no earlier than the 20th and no later than the 25th of each month.
3.8. (JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST) When to Report. (JB MDL) 87 ABW and 305
AMW ART Monitors will submit and update the overall UTC health assessments every 30
calendar days but no earlier than the 20th and no later than the 23rd of each month (AMC
guidance is no later than the 25th of each month) or as directed by Wing ART POC. Unit ART
Monitor will review all additions, changes, and deletions in the ART database weekly. Ensure
updates to those related UTCs happen within 24 hours. The ART website is located at
https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil (via SIPRNET).
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC the unit
   commander will submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
   notification of a UTC change or addition.
   3.8.1. (AMC) All AMC and AMC gained units (upon activation under Title 10) will check
   ART every Tuesday and Thursday for Not Reported UTCs. These UTCs will be assessed
   within 24 hours.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTC's tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home station.

                                 ART MONITOR ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

         Table A2.1. ART Monitor Assessment Checklist.
All units MUST use this checklist as a tool to assess UTC Personnel, Training, Equipment/   Current AEF
Supplies and Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the
UTC's MISCAP states when assessing.
GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas          G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                             Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                           R
BLACK = UTC is postured incorrectly and requires MAJCOM FAM attention.

Check the appropriate shaded block (G, Y, R) below, depending on how you answer the question. The
lowest rating in any area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must have remarks
and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each month for expiration. Only the FINAL rating is used in ART.
Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.

Once an individual is associated to an AEF they cannot be changed without obtaining a MAJCOM/CV
waiver IAW AFI 10-401, 9.7.6
