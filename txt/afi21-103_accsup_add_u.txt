This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. It
applies to all F-16A/B/C/D ACC units. This Addendum applies to Air National Guard (ANG) and Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Ensure that all records created as a result of pro-
cesses prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (to be replaced
by AFMAN 33-363), and are disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Sched-
ule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required. Send
recommended changes or comments on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to
HQ ACC/A4A16, 130 Douglas St., Suite 210, Langley AFB VA 23665-2791, and send information cop-
ies to the applicable OCR.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. First, combat capability of
the F-16 fleet continues to increase and recently fielded upgrades needed to be added to the MESL. These
upgrades include Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), Link-16, Modular Mission Computer
(MMC), as well as the HARM Targeting Set, Sniper, and LITENING targeting pods. Second, all Work
Unit Codes (WUCs) were verified and updated accordingly. Finally, systems that were no longer utilized
by the F-16 fleet have been removed from the MESL, specifically the Navigation pod (WUC 74P).


1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground work for
reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that
must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or other mis-
sions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness SORTS reporting only and denotes MC air-

craft capable of being configured for a contingency mission in accordance with COMACC OMNIBUS
Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded mis-
     sion systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy FMC aircraft,
     recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft
     may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and generated to MRA status at
     an employment site.
     1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major Command
     differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another MAJCOM theater, the
     gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit’s requirements, and resource
     the differences in support/mission equipment.
     1.4. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit code (WUC) against the Full Sys-
     tems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL) across the page. Each unit’s Design
     Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft
     MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is important to compare only those col-
     umns listed in the MESL that are applicable to the unit’s assigned aircraft. For example, units with
     CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns
     related to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report
     status using only the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine
     and report status using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure
     status is reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
