                                           GENERAL

1.1. Introduction. This volume, in conjunction with AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, Formal
Flying Training Administration and Management, outlines responsibilities and procedures for
conducting Basic Sensor Operator Course. AETC conducts undergraduate Remotely Piloted
Aircraft (RPA) training courses to provide sensor operator candidates to the Combat Air Forces
(CAF) Formal Training Unit (FTU). This training course provides student aircrew with basic
understanding of RPA Sensor Operator (SO) duties. The training course syllabus outlines
training location, course entry prerequisites, and provides a summary of training/graduation
requirements.     The Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) Website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ provides student administration and processing information. Air
Combat Command (ACC) administers FTU qualification training for the MQ-1 or MQ-9 weapon
systems. This AETCI does not apply to ACC controlled training.
1.2. Specific Use:

       AETC/A3F of students whose training has been suspended more than 14 calendar days.
       Note: ANG and AFRC students are not normally assigned casual student duties. Contact
       AETC/A3F.
   1.3.6. Registrar. (12 OSS/OSR) will follow duties assigned in AETCI 36-2205V1.
1.4. Formal Course Syllabus. The syllabus is the command-approved directive for executing
each PFT formal training course. It takes precedence over local instructions and supplements. If
 6                                                         AETCI36-2205V14 8 JANUARY 2014


no clear syllabus guidance exists, resolve the conflict using the appropriate chain of command.
Only the OPR may interpret syllabus guidance. If the logical course of action conflicts with
other directives, call the OPR listed in the syllabus. AETC syllabi are not valid until signed by
AETC/A2/3/10 and will not be implemented until a signature is obtained.
     1.4.1. BSOC formal course syllabus serves as the primary BSOC training course control
     documents. It directs course organization and operation, and prescribes what each student
     should be able to do as a result of the instruction. The syllabus identifies terminal and
     enabling learning objectives and the time required for academic, simulator and operational
     phases of training, and for administrative and support activities. It approximates the
     allocation of hours to the individual units of instruction within the overall time prescribed for
     each phase, subject area, or activity except for operational training. The review cycle for
     BSOC formal course syllabus is every 2 years.
     1.4.2. AETC/A3FR is the command manager (OPR) for the AETC BSOC formal course
     syllabus, responsible for developing, editing, coordinating and gaining final approval. The
     558 FTS/DOT provides Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to help develop the syllabus.
     1.4.3. Training Developers will:
        1.4.3.1. Develop BSOC training syllabi using local guidance.
        1.4.3.2. Use proficiency codes identified in the 1U0X1 Career Field Education Training
        Plan (CFETP) Specialty Training Standards (STS) to assign terminal skill-level
        attainment. The code keys identify the type of learning in terms of subject knowledge,
        task knowledge, or task performance levels. The student must attain and demonstrate the
        specified level of learning before graduating from the course. Student accomplishment of
        training requirements is ongoing throughout training. Instructors provide continual
        feedback. Student learning outcomes are evaluated with formal written tests (academic
        instruction) or direct observation of task performance (laboratories, workshop and
        operational instruction).
        1.4.3.3. Ensure each syllabus defines course phases and categories to accurately
        determine progress review triggers.
        1.4.3.4. All written/electronic examinations require a minimum passing score of at least
        85 percent.
        1.4.3.5. Evaluate simulator and operational BSOC training on a go/no-go basis.
1.5. Instructor and Student Guides.
     1.5.1. 558 FTS/DOT develops instructor guides and student guides to support BSOC
     training. The format for these documents is defined in local guidance. 558 FTS/DOT will
     develop instructor guides to support the training in the syllabus. The syllabus support
     documents expand on the information in individual syllabuses and contain the details
     necessary to ensure consistent training for all students. The course syllabus is the governing
     document. Instructors should always refer to the courseware for event construction.
     1.5.2. AETC/A3FR staffs requests for release of courseware.
1.6. Quota Management. The programmed guidance letter (PGL) documents establishes the
baseline for student quota management, along with the PFT document reflects real-time changes
AETCI36-2205V14 8 JANUARY 2014                                                               7


and are the AETC aircrew training primary source document for class entry dates, student load,
and production schedule information. AETC/A3FR maintains the course related quota
management       worksheets.        These       worksheets       are       available        at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AE-57). AETC provides
class quotas annually via electronic MilPDS (Military Personnel Data System) pages.
AETC/A3FR notifies 558 FTS when quotas change.
1.7. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program (AGEP). Aircrew members who have
completed training through an AETC formal undergraduate or graduate flying training program
will be evaluated on the effectiveness of their previous training according to AETCI 36-2206,
Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program. Refer to AETCI 36-2206 for specific program
guidance. Direct feedback survey questions and comments to AETC/A3FR (DSN 487-9134) for
questions concerning the AGEP Web site access, contact AETC/A3IE (DSN 487-2045).
1.8. Student Graduations. Course Flight Chief verifies successful course completion and
provides each student with an AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training.
   1.8.1. Course Flight Chief must provide the registrar a graduation roster within 3 duty days
   from class graduation.

                                TRAINING MANAGEMENT

3.1. Training Records:
   3.1.1. Each student will have an electronic training record that includes grade sheets and
   other documentation as defined by the specific syllabus. Units may use, in whole or in part,
   electronic media (such as the TIMS) to fulfill this requirement.
   3.1.2. Student training records are for the exclusive use of the student’s instructors,
   supervisors and immediate chain of command. Additional procedures may be specified in
   unit supplements to this instruction.
      3.1.2.1. Secure training records (both paper and electronic) and Student Personnel
      Information Folders (SPIF) to prevent unauthorized access. Information affecting student
      training that is inappropriate for public access or sensitive in nature is documented in the
      SPIF. Use AF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling or AETC Form 173, Student
      Record of Academic/Nonacademic Counseling and Comments, to record counseling
      entries maintained in the personal information folder. Students may access only their
      own training record.
          3.1.2.1.1. SPIF. Documents or training records not associated with, or directly
          relevant to, formal course aircrew training and that are inappropriate for public access
          or sensitive will be maintained separately from the aircrew training record in a SPIF.
          The SPIF is protected according to the Privacy Act of 1974 and maintained in a
          secure location apart from aircrew training record documents. The SPIF, if required,
          is maintained by the squadron and disposed of according to Air Force RDS. If
          pertinent to follow-on location, the SPIF will be securely forwarded to next duty
          location.
      3.1.2.2. Record each academic and progress check training lesson in the training record.
   3.1.3. If electronic training records are not used, the following items will be included in the
   training record and annotated as applicable:
      3.1.3.1. Training record Discrepancy Log/Record of Training record Review (locally
      produced).
          3.1.3.1.1. AETC Form 173 or AF Form 174.
          3.1.3.1.2. Messages (ANG and AFRC, if applicable).
          3.1.3.1.3. AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary. Note: A memorandum
          for record or an AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record maintained within TIMS may
          be substituted for the AETC Form 101. If applicable, units prepare this form to
          record and monitor student deficiencies during the course of training. Keep the form
          in the student’s training folder. Documented military deficiencies (including
          unexcused tardiness or absences, traffic tickets, unaccompanied quarter’s inspection
          failures, fitness program, and dress and appearance violations per AFI 36-2903, Dress
          and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel) will be specified.

   3.1.4. Documentation. Grade sheets are used to document student training in the training
   record. Instructors provide grades for applicable mission events/tasks, give a concise
   summary of the student’s training, and ensure entries clarify any training action. In addition,
   documentation on AF Form 4293 is required for the following:
       3.1.4.1. Temporary medical disqualification (DNIF status). 558 FTS may substitute a
       scanned or electronic copy of the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying.

                                           Chapter 4

                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT


4.1. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP):
   4.1.1. Objective. To focus supervisory attention on a student’s training progress, specific
   deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP may also be used to monitor
   personal issues requiring supervisory attention. CAP is intended as a short-term program. A
   student requiring an extended period of increased supervision or repeated placement on CAP
   based on performance should be considered for elimination. Note: CAP does not apply to
   courses of 7 training days or less.
   4.1.2. Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) Responsibilities. The SQ/CC administers CAP.
   Note: CAP administration may be delegated to the SQ/DO, flight commander (FLT/CC), or
   designated supervisor, but the SQ/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility.
   4.1.3. Categories. CAP is divided into the following categories:
      4.1.3.1. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance.
      4.1.3.2. Military. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
      4.1.3.3. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
   4.1.4. CAP Procedures:
      4.1.4.1. Placement. The SQ/CC or approved delegate (Flight Chief) places the student
      on CAP when substandard performance, personal issues or lost training requires close
      monitoring of individual progress. The Flight Chief will counsel students placed on
      CAP. Initial counseling will address the reason for CAP placement, CAP objectives,
      student training plan, instructor continuity, and CAP removal goals. Additional
      counseling is conducted at the discretion of the Flight Chief but is required if the student
      fails to meet CAP removal goals.
      4.1.4.2. CAP Unit Activities. While students are on CAP the IS will:
          4.1.4.2.1. Tailor training to address the student’s particular situation within the limits
          of the syllabus.
          4.1.4.2.2. Closely monitor instructor continuity.
          4.1.4.2.3. Not compromise proficiency standards to permit CAP students to progress
          in training.
          4.1.4.2.4. Appropriately update and document into the students training folder and
          intermediate goals and CAP removal goals.
          4.1.4.2.5. Brief squadron leadership weekly on a student’s progress. This briefing
          should include the student’s strong and weak areas and CAP removal criteria.
      4.1.4.3. Maintain documentation of all counseling in the student’s training record. Note:
      Document sessions concerning sensitive personal problems on AF Form 174, or AETC
AETCI36-2205V14 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                13


       Form 173 and retain in a separate student personal information folder (SPIF) maintained
       by the supervisor. See Paragraph 3.1.2.1
       4.1.4.4. CAP Removal. The same unit SQ/CC will approve removal from CAP when the
       student meets CAP removal goals, demonstrates sustained normal progress, or resolves
       personal issues. This authority will not be delegated. Removal should not be strictly
       event/task/sortie/lesson based, particularly when individual weak areas can carry over
       into the next phase or module. Immediate supervisors will counsel students when they
       are removed from CAP.
4.2. Commander’s Review (CR) Process. Students who fail two academic tests or progress
checks within the same unit of instruction or three combined tests during the normal flow of the
syllabus will be entered into the CR process, as follows:
   4.2.1. Initiating Authority (IA). The course Flight Chief is the IA. The IA:
       4.2.1.1. Notifies the student in writing of consideration for elimination.
       4.2.1.2. Briefs the student on the complete CR process.
       4.2.1.3. Removes the student from training, if necessary.
       4.2.1.4. Completes AETC Form 125A, Record of Administrative Training Action,
       Section I, annotating the reasons for removal and any recommendations for follow-on
       training (if applicable).
       4.2.1.5. Forwards the completed AETC Form 125A with the student’s memorandum,
       training records, and any attachments to the reviewing authority (RA). For detachments,
       this process may be done electronically or by fax to expedite processing, but the original
       (paper) copies must be forwarded to the 12 OSS/OSR for disposition.
   4.2.2. Reviewing Authority (RA). The SQ/CC is the RA. The RA:
       4.2.2.1. Reviews the AETC Form 125A and, as necessary, the student’s training records.
       When warranted, the RA interviews the student and the IA. The RA recommends
       elimination or retention in training.
       4.2.2.2. If the student is an AFRC/ANG member, the RA will forward the AETC Form
       125A and, as necessary, the student’s training records to AFRC/A1KE/A3TB/A3TT and
       AETC/A3H or NGB/A1MA/A3OC and AETC/A3G for coordination.
   4.2.3. Approving Authority (AA). The OG/CC is the AA. The AA:
       4.2.3.1. Eliminates or reinstates the student.
       4.2.3.2. Completes Section III of AETC Form 125A and annotates any additional
       recommendations of follow-on training for the student.
       4.2.3.3. Ensures a student eliminated from training is immediately returned to their
       permanent unit.
   4.2.4. Elimination Messages. Once final determination is made by the AA, 12 OSS/OSR
   notifies appropriate agencies by message of all elimination actions.
       4.2.4.1. Depending on the student’s status, addressees for elimination messages include
       the following:
