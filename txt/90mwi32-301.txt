1. Excavation. The term excavation is defined as any operation in which earth, rock or other
materials on or below the ground is moved or otherwise displaced by means of hand tools, power
tools, power equipment, explosives or other means, and includes grading, trenching, digging,
ditching, drilling, auguring, tunneling, boring, plowing-in, pulling-in, ripping, scraping and cable
or pipe installing.
2. Focal Points.
2.1. Base Civil Engineer Customer Service Unit, 90 CES/CEOSC, Building 318, 773-3175, is
the focal point for processing all base and associated missile sites AF IMT 103, 19940801, V3,
Base Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request (90 CES/CEOSC Overprint). (See Figure 1.)

2.3. Combined underground location service (Wyoming One-Call) is the coordination focal
point for commercial utility and off-base commercial telephone companies. All Wyoming One-
Call requests will be made by the Base Civil Engineer’s Customer Service section. Individuals
and contractors must not call Wyoming One-Call for locates (with the exception of associated
missile sites, see 3.1.1.).
3. Procedures.
3.1. Excavators must identify dig area with white paint or flags prior to submitting dig requests.
All requests for digging on F. E. Warren AFB and the associated missile sites will be submitted
to the Base Civil Engineer’s Customer Service section.
3.1.1. At associated missile sites, it is the sole responsibility of the inspector/requester to contact
local utility companies and arrange a meeting at the excavation site with the locator to verify the
exact location of utilities.
3.2. Coordinating AF IMT 103 Overprint (OP): (See Figure 2). The Base Civil Engineer’s
Customer Service section will contact all required base agencies for coordination and call
Wyoming One-Call for the requester. Wyoming One-Call in-turn notifies the proper off-base
agencies.

3.4.1. Each agency with utilities in the area of excavation, after marking the area, will annotate
on the AF IMT 103 OP, “marked” and sign the form, completing their requirement for the dig
permit.

appropriate block for that agency.
3.5. Once all agencies have reviewed the AF IMT 103 OP and made the appropriate annotations,

the requester the form is ready for pick up at Building 318.
3.5.1. When signed by 90 CES/CEOSC personnel, the form is valid for 14 calendar days and
excavation may begin.
3.5.2. Original signed AF IMT 103 OP or a copy of the signed original must remain on site at all
times during excavation.

markings have been maintained.
3.8. Normal processing time for routine requests is 10 to 14 duty days.

telecommunications, heating and air conditioning or security alarm systems and situations which
would result in imminent or catastrophic damage to facilities and/or persons.

moving equipment.
Note: If utility is not found within 24 inches of locate marks, immediately notify 90 CES for
shop/contractor assistance on locating/identifying lines.
5.2.1. If excavation is required within 24 inches horizontally of any marking, the excavation
should be performed using hand tools or vacuum excavation with extreme care and without
damaging the marked utility.
5.2.2. If, during the course of excavation, a utility has been exposed, it is the excavator’s
responsibility to support these utilities. The excavator also must be certain the utilities have not
been struck or damaged in any capacity, including being pulled or “kinked”. If damage of any
kind is discovered, or if a utility is contacted, it is the excavator’s responsibility to directly
and immediately notify the Base Civil Engineer’s Customer Service section (773-3175).
5.3. Any excavation attempted without a proper approved digging permit may subject excavator
