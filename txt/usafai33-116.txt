     personnel must use to manage any and all changes made to the configuration of USAFA IT
     services and components.
     2.2. This instruction provides a formal method for request, evaluation, scheduling,
     implementing and testing of modifications to USAFA IT environment. It allows recording
     and tracking of changes from request through implementation.
3. Process and Function Descriptions.
     3.1. USAFA IT Service Request Process.
USAFAI33-116 17 MAY 2011                                                                  3


     3.1.1. USAFA IT service request process provides an integrated approach that will be
     used by all users to request and receive services.
     3.1.2. This process provides a roadmap that depicts interaction between different
     Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) processes as a service request goes
     from idea to implementation.
     3.1.3. IT Service Request Process steps (see Attachment 5).
        3.1.3.1. User determines a need or requirement for IT service and submits a service
        request via automated Service Desk Management System (SDMS) (ex. Remedy).
        The user enters the desired service, mission criticality (critical, essential,
        enhancement), need by date and mission need at a minimum.
        3.1.3.2. SDMS routes request to user’s Computer Requirements Officer (CRO) for
        review and approval.
            3.1.3.2.1. CRO will obtain organizational commander or equivalent approval for
            all mission critical requirements prior to submission.
        3.1.3.3. After required organization approval(s), IT request will be routed to the
        Change Manager to review and process.
        3.1.3.4. Change Manager and IT Service Portfolio Manager work together to
        recommend the appropriate Service Owner/Project Manager (SO/PM) to manage
        request.
        3.1.3.5. USAFA/A6 and/or 10 CS assign SO/PM.
        3.1.3.6. SO/PM works with user/requestor to fulfill user requirements.
            3.1.3.6.1. SO/PM works with Change Manager and IT Service Portfolio Manager
            to compare requirements with the Service Portfolio and confirm user requirements
            cannot be met by existing service or pending new service.
            3.1.3.6.2. Requests that can be met by existing service are handled via the
            Request Fulfillment process (see USAFAI 33-119, Information Technology
            Service Operations Management).
            3.1.3.6.3. Requests that cannot be met by an existing service become a Request
            For Change (RFC) and are handled via the Change Management Process.
        3.1.3.7. SO/PM works with user/requestor to build requirements section of Service
        Design Package (SDP) (see Attachment 1, SDP Template).
        3.1.3.8. SO/PM works with appropriate parties (e.g., technical solution developer,
        Information Assurance personnel, Financial Management, etc.) to build SDP (see
        Attachment 4).
            3.1.3.8.1. SO/PM consults 10 CS and/or USAFA/A6 to determine if resources
            (time, people, money, equipment) needed to fulfill the request exceed those
            available.
            3.1.3.8.2. SO/PM consults Change Manager to determine level of detail and
            content required of SDP. At a minimum, SDP needs to include complete user
4                                                             USAFAI33-116 17 MAY 2011


             requirements, risk assessment, proposed schedule, test plan, implementation plan
             and roll back plan.
             3.1.3.8.3. SO/PM consults Service Level Manager (see USAFAI 33-101) to
             determine if existing Service Level Standards (SLSs) or Service Level
             Agreements (SLAs) need to be modified, or if new SLS/SLA needs to be created.
         3.1.3.9. Change Manager determines if request needs to go through Configuration
         Control Board (CCB). If so, SO/PM submits completed SDP and RFC to CCB.
             3.1.3.9.1. CCB validates SDP. Recommendation is made regarding technical
             aspects of request.
         3.1.3.10. SO/PM submits RFC and SDP to CAB.
         3.1.3.11. CAB approves/disapproves RFC.
         3.1.3.12. IT Service Portfolio Manager updates USAFA IT Service Portfolio.
         3.1.3.13. USAFA/A6 and/or 10 CS allocate resources for request.
         3.1.3.14. Change Manager updates change schedule.
         3.1.3.15. SO/PM coordinates development, testing and implementation of request.
         3.1.3.16. Service Catalog Manager updates Service Catalog if change affects existing
         service or creates new service (see USAFAI 33-101).
         3.1.3.17. Configuration Manager updates Change Management Database (CMDB)
         (see USAFAI 33-115).
         3.1.3.18. Change Manager reviews and closes request record.
    3.2. USAFA IT Change Management.
      3.2.1. Change Manager is single focal point for authorizing IT changes, which will
      minimize the probability of conflicting change events and the potential disruption to the
      USAFA IT Enterprise.
      3.2.2. A Change is defined as any alteration, variation, or modification to the USAFA IT
      Enterprise, any IT system, component of any system, or Configuration Item (CI) or their
      associated peripherals and operation of the same.
         3.2.2.1. Configuration Items (CIs) are any components that need to be managed in
         order to deliver an IT Service. CIs are under the control of Configuration
         Management and Change Management (see USAFAI 33-115).
      3.2.3. Users submit RFC through Service Desk to Change Manager (see USAFAI 33-
      119) (see Attachment 3, RFC Template).
         3.2.3.1. RFCs are verified by organizational CRO. Mission Critical RFCs must be
         further verified by organizational commander or equivalent.
         3.2.3.2. RFCs are categorized by mission impact by submitter in conjunction with
         CRO (Mission Critical, Mission Essential, Mission Enhancement).
      3.2.4. RFCs are prioritized based on a standardized prioritization model by Change
      Manager (e.g., Immediate/Emergency, Urgent, Medium and Low).
USAFAI33-116 17 MAY 2011                                                                   5


     3.2.5. Change Management shall        be   coordinated   with   Service   Configuration
     Management (see USAFAI 33-115).
     3.2.6. When an RFC is submitted in response to an incident or problem record, the RFC
     will reference and retain incident or problem record information in order to provide
     traceability.
     3.2.7. Configuration Manager coordinates performance, impact and risk assessments for
     all changes.
     3.2.8. Change Manager coordinates production and distribution of a change schedule and
     Authorized Service Interruptions (ASI); information is provided to the USAFA
     Communications Focal Point (CFP) to ensure end users are proactively notified and
     informed of planned outages and impacts.
     3.2.9. Change Manager ensures that critical events in the USAFA Mission (e.g., finals,
     in-processing, etc.) are identified/tracked and system changes are limited or held in
     abeyance during these times (IT Change Freeze Periods).
     3.2.10. Change Manager ensures approved changes are executed as planned.
     3.2.11. Whenever changes are implemented, Service Owner/Project Manager and
     Configuration Manager ensure associated system and user documentation and procedures
     are updated accordingly.
     3.2.12. USAFA IT Change Management will implement three Change Models.
        3.2.12.1. Normal Change Model (see Attachment 6, Normal Change Model).
            3.2.12.1.1. This is the full model for changes that must go through assessment,
            review and authorization by the CAB prior to implementation.
            3.2.12.1.2. Normal Change Model follows a seven-step process (see Attachment
            6, Normal Change Model).
               3.2.12.1.2.1. Record RFC – An RFC is submitted by an initiator. Information
               for requested change is captured within a change record. The RFC is
               categorized and prioritized by Change Manager.
               3.2.12.1.2.2. Review RFC – Change Manager reviews RFC for content,
               identifying completed, related or potentially duplicate RFCs.
               3.2.12.1.2.3. Assess and Evaluate RFC – Change Advisory Board (CAB)
               performs impact assessment (risks, resources, responsibility and relationship
               to other changes) considering potential impact on services of failed changes
               and their effect on service assets and configurations. See Risk Management
               Guide for DOD Acquisition August 2006 for more information.
               3.2.12.1.2.4. Authorize Change – Formal authorization is obtained for each
               change from the CAB.
               3.2.12.1.2.5. Plan and Coordinate Change – Change Implementer (Service
               Owner/Project Manager (SO/PM) tasked with implementing change)
               coordinates development, testing, release, deployment and transition plans and
               procedures for the change. Implementation of change is annotated within the
6                                                      USAFAI33-116 17 MAY 2011


          change schedule.
          3.2.12.1.2.6. Implement Change – Change Manager ensures change is
          implemented as scheduled and performs oversight to ensure that all changes
          are thoroughly tested and back out procedures are made available by the
          applicable SO/PM.
          3.2.12.1.2.7. Review and Close Change Record – Change Manager reviews
          implementation results and closes RFC record.
    3.2.12.2. Preapproved Change Model.
       3.2.12.2.1. The Preapproved Change Model is for pre-authorized, repetitive, low-
       risk, well-tested changes.
       3.2.12.2.2. Preapproved changes do not go through CAB review and approval
       process.
       3.2.12.2.3. Preapproved Change Model follows a four-step process.
          3.2.12.2.3.1. Record RFC – RFC is submitted by user. Information for the
          requested change is recorded in RFC. The RFC is classified and prioritized by
          Change Manager.
          3.2.12.2.3.2. Review the RFC – Change Manager reviews the RFC for
          content, identifying completed, related, or potentially duplicate RFCs.
          Change Manager verifies RFC meets requirements of a Preapproved Change.
          If it fails to meet Preapproved Change requirements, it is submitted to Normal
          Change process.
          3.2.12.2.3.3. Implement Change – Change Manager ensures change is
          implemented as scheduled and performs oversight to ensure that all changes
          are thoroughly tested and back out procedures are made available by the
          applicable SO/PM.
          3.2.12.2.3.4. Review and Close Change Record – Change Manager reviews
          implementation results and closes RFC record.
       3.2.12.2.4. Change Manager maintains the Preapproved Change List as part of
       USAFA IT Service Catalog (see USAFAI 33-101).
       3.2.12.2.5. Only USAFA IT CAB can add a Normal Change to Preapproved
       Change List.
    3.2.12.3. Emergency Change Model.
       3.2.12.3.1. Emergency Change Model is only used when a change must be
       implemented to prevent USAFA mission impact and time does not allow using
       the Normal Change Model.
       3.2.12.3.2. Emergency Changes are approved by the Emergency Change
       Advisory Board (ECAB).
       3.2.12.3.3. Emergency Change Model follows a six-step process.
          3.2.12.3.3.1. Record RFC – RFC is submitted by user. Information for the
USAFAI33-116 17 MAY 2011                                                               7


               requested change is recorded in the RFC.       The RFC is classified and
               prioritized by Change Manager.
               3.2.12.3.3.2. Verification – Change Manager verifies that an RFC meets the
               criteria for an Emergency Change and convenes the ECAB. This meeting can
               be conducted virtually to expedite the process.
               3.2.12.3.3.3. Assessment – ECAB assesses the RFC for impact, urgency and
               resources. If the RFC does not meet the requirements of an Emergency
               Change it is submitted to the Normal Change Process.
               3.2.12.3.3.4. Coordination – Change Implementer plans and coordinates
               change with appropriate groups. The Emergency Change is added to the
               change schedule.
               3.2.12.3.3.5. Implementation – Change Implementer implements the change
               and provides oversight to ensure it is executed as scheduled.
               3.2.12.3.3.6. Review and Close – Change Manager reviews implementation
               results and closes RFC record.
  3.3. Configuration Control Board (CCB).
     3.3.1. CCB reviews all Service Design Packages (SDP) (see Attachment 4, SDP
     Template) for new or modified IT services and makes recommendations to CAB.
     3.3.2. CCB does not approve/disapprove SDPs; it reviews and develops
     recommendations. CCB makes recommendations based on technical feasibility, impact
     and risk associated with a change. Recommendations are recorded in RFC record and
     CCB meeting minutes. Service Configuration Manager ensures CCB minutes are
     recorded and maintained in accordance with AF Electronic Records Management (ERM)
     standards contained in AFMAN 33-363.
     3.3.3. An incomplete/inaccurate SDP is returned to Service Owner/Project Manager for
     corrections.
     3.3.4. CCB is chaired and facilitated by USAFA Service Configuration Manager.
     3.3.5. CCB Membership includes: IT Service Configuration Manager (10 CS, Chair);
     USAFA Information Assurance Manager (USAFA/A6); USAFA Enterprise Architect
     (USAFA/A6); IT Operations Manager (10 CS/SCO); IT Network Manager (10 CS); 10
     CS Plans (10 CS/SCX); IT Service Portfolio Manager (USAFA/A6); IT Service Level
     Manager (10 CS); IT Service Catalog Manager (10 CS); ME Computer Requirements
     Officers (CROs) (non-voting); Service Owner/Project Manager submitting SDP (non-
     voting); and others as required.
     3.3.6. CCB meets at least monthly.
        3.3.6.1. USAFA/A6, 10 CS/CL, or any member of CCB may request that the Service
        Configuration Manager schedule an out-of-cycle meeting to meet USAFA needs as
        appropriate.
  3.4. Change Advisory Board (CAB) and Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB).
8                                                            USAFAI33-116 17 MAY 2011


       3.4.1. CAB advises Change Manager in assessment, prioritization and scheduling of IT
       changes.
       3.4.2. CAB approves/disapproves all normal RFCs.
       3.4.3. Change Manager chairs CAB and has veto authority on all board decisions.
