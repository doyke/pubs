             MOVEMENT OF CLASSIFIED AND SENSITIVE MATERIAL

4.1. Scope. This chapter applies to 354 LRS distribution personnel whose duties involve
receiving, processing, handling, and transportation of classified and sensitive material.
4.2. Procedures.
   4.2.1. Classified Receipt Listing. The Vehicle Operations Control Center (VOCC) will
   request a copy of the classified receipt listing from the Materiel Management Flight to
   identify personnel authorized to receive, handle, and transport classified and sensitive assets.
   4.2.2. Prior to dispatching an operator to move classified materials/assets, the dispatcher
   will:
      4.2.2.1. Ensure the operator is identified on the classified receipt listing to handle
      classified materials.
      4.2.2.2. Brief the operator regarding classified and sensitive movement in accordance
      with this wing instruction.
      4.2.2.3. Ensure the operator has an updated classified receipt listing prior to dispatching
      the operator for a classified movement.
   4.2.3. Operators will:
      4.2.3.1. Check all documentation to verify the classification of the asset/material prior to
      handling the item.
      4.2.3.2. Ensure paperwork is properly marked in accordance with the classification of the
      item.
      4.2.3.3. Assume full responsibility for the security of the classified asset and must
      maintain positive control upon pickup. At no time will the operator leave the item
      unattended or out of sight.
      4.2.3.4. Make phone contact with the customer prior to proceeding to the drop off point
      with the package to ensure receiving availability.
      4.2.3.5. Carry the classified receipt listing at all times during the delivery run.
      4.2.3.6. Ensure assets are delivered to the correct organization as identified by the
      originator.

      authorized to sign/receive classified materials.
      4.2.3.8. Contact the VOCC immediately if the receiver is not on the classified receipt
      listing or the authority to receive the material cannot be verified. At no time will the
      operator leave the package with other than the designated receiver, unless instructed to do
      so by the originator or the VOCC. In either case, the new receiver’s authority to receive
      receipt for the material will also be verified using the classified receipt listing.
