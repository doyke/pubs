1. RESPONSIBILITY: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraphs 10.2.1) The Maintenance Group
Commander (MXG/CC) is the OPR for the development of wing procedures for control and
management of tools/equipment used on the flight-line and aircraft/aerospace equipment
maintenance industrial areas. The Squadron Maintenance Officer or Maintenance Superintendent
is responsible for management of the CTK program within the squadron. Squadron Supervision,
or their equivalent, is primarily responsible for the control and issue of tools and tool kits.
2. INVENTORY PROCEDURES: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.2.1.2 & 10.4.1.2). If an
automated system is not available (such as a deployed location), sections may use the AF Form
1297, a MAJCOM, or locally approved form for accountability and control of CTKs, equipment,
and tools. A beginning and end of shift (BOS/EOS) inventory of all CTKs will be accomplished
and documented using TCMax. (AFRC Form 177 if TCMax is inoperative). This is simply to
ensure all CTKs are accounted for. CTKs will be inventoried for content prior to being signed
out. All CTKs will be inventoried prior to leaving any job site and again before being signed in.
The person annotating the “IN” block is not the same as the one annotating the “OUT” block. If
the CTK is dispatched for an extended period of time (to the ISO dock or TDY for example) then
an AFRC Form 177 will accompany the CTK for sign-in and sign-out requirements.
     2.1. In situations when only one person is assigned to the shift or work center, a second party
     or on duty supervisor will perform an inventory of the tool kit and sign in the CTK NLT the
     end of shift.
3. WARRANTED TOOLS: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.2.1.3) All sections that possess
warranted tools will contact the appropriate local vendor (Snap-On, Grainger, etc.) for
replacement of broken or damaged tools. Warranted tools may be replaced from spare tool
stock; however, the warranted tool should be replaced by the appropriate vendor as soon as
possible. Contacting of the vendor will be coordinated through the appropriate Flight Chief or
equivalent. Note - All requests for purchasing of tools will be forwarded through the appropriate
Flight Chief to the Maintenance Superintendent for approval prior to the procurement of any
tool.
4. CONSUMABLE TOOLS/ITEMS: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.2.1.4, 10.3.1, 10.3.5,
10.3.6.3, & 10.3.6.5) Expendable hand tools (apex bits, drill bits, wire bundles, etc.) may be
placed in CTKs. If placed in the CTK they will be identified with the CTK EID, be shadowed,
and reflect the quantity of the bits and pieces. Consumable items (safety wire, solder, etc.) may
be placed in CTKs. If placed in the CTK, they will be identified with the CTK EID, and be
identified on the MIL as consumable. The CTK Custodian will be responsible for control of
these items. If a tool is broken, the technician will provide the broken tool to the CTK Custodian
to secure a replacement. If a replacement is not immediately available annotate the
missing/removed tool log.
5. PROCEDURES FOR TRANSFER OF CTKs AT THE JOBSITE: (Ref. AFI 21-101,
paragraph 10.2.1.5) If CTKs are transferred at the job site the AFRC Form 177 will be
documented at the job site. The person assuming control of the CTK will inventory the CTK
with the person relinquishing control. The oncoming technician will then document the “IN”
box of the AFRC Form 177 (effectively signing the CTK in) and then document the “OUT” box
(assuming control). TCMax will be updated to reflect the transfer as soon possible.
6. PROCEDURES FOR LOST TOOLS: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.2.1.6 & 10.8)
94AWI21-121 10 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  3


   6.1. In the event an item or tool is lost, personnel will report the missing item IAW AFI 21-
   101 if not found within 30 minutes.
   6.2. Any tools found on an aircraft and not marked as part of the CTK program (i.e. no
   markings) will be turned in to the Quality Assurance office (94 MXG/MXQ). MXQ will
   conduct an investigation to determine ownership of the tool and contact the MXG/CC, who
   will decide if further action is necessary. In addition, the Squadron Maintenance Officer and
   the Maintenance Superintendent will be notified. The Expediter/Pro Super, or equivalent,
   will be notified immediately of a lost tool and the initial search will begin thereafter.
   6.3. If a tool/item is discovered missing after an affected aircraft has taxied, but before
   takeoff, the individual making the discovery will immediately notify the Maintenance
   Operations Center (MOC). The MOC notifies the Command Post, Pro Super, Expediter or
   work center supervisor, Quality Assurance, and the senior ART on duty of the missing
   tool/item. The Command Post will instruct the aircrew to return to the parking spot so that a
   search for the lost tool/item may be conducted in accordance with IAW paragraph 6
   6.4. If a tool/item is discovered missing after an affected aircraft taken off, the individual
   making the discovery will immediately notify the MOC. The MOC will immediately relay
   all pertinent information regarding the lost tool/item to the Command Post who will then pass
   the information on to the Aircraft Commander. The Aircraft Commander will make the
   decision, based on the information given, whether or not to immediately land the aircraft so
   that a search for the lost tool/item may be conducted IAW paragraph 6. Additionally, the
   MOC will notify the Pro Super, Expediter or work center supervisor, Quality Assurance, and
   the senior ART on duty.
7. CTK AND TOOL IDENTIFICATION: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.2.1.7 & 10.5)
CTK designations will be as follows per this maintenance operating instruction: All sections
must mark their tools with the standard nine-digit Equipment Identification Designation (EID)
consisting of numbers and letters of which the first four characters will be a unique World-wide
Identification code (WWID). 94th Maintenance first two letters will be R9 followed by the two
letter shop code, the last five can be any combination of letters and numbers i.e. (ISO tool box
EID may be R9PDCTK01)
   7.1. Aircraft Maintenance Squadron: R9FL
   7.2. Accessories Flight: R9EN (Elec/Env Shop), R9HY (Hydraulic Shop), and R9FS (Fuel
   System Shop)

8. INDIVIDUAL EQUIPMENT/PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE): (Ref.
AFI 21-101 Para 10.2.1.8) Personal protective equipment such as headsets, ear defenders, face
shields, etc., issued to an individual may be maintained in personal lockers or tool rooms. As a
minimum, these items are marked with a TCMax number and initial issue tracked in TCMax. In
addition, PPE must be inventoried annually and the inventory will be documented in TCMax.
9. RAG CONTROL: (Ref. AFI 21-101 Para 10.2.1.9) Special control is required to prevent
rags from becoming FOD. All mechanics that require rags for the performance of their jobs both
in shop/dispatch will ensure they take only the estimated amount required for the job. They will
return all rags to the correct containers clean/dirty (as necessary) in their own work centers at the
completion of the job. Clean or soiled rags will not be permitted to lie in dispatch vehicles
where they may become lost and contribute to FOD. Rags will be tracked using TCMax.
10. PROCEDURES TO LIMIT NUMBER OF PERSONNEL AUTHORIZED TO
PROCURE TOOLS: (Ref. AFI 21-101 Para 10.2.1.10) See paragraph 3 of this Instruction.
11. LOCALLY            MANUFACTURED              OR       DEVELOPED            TOOLS         AND
EQUIPMENT: (Ref. AFI 21-101, paragraph 10.6) The 94 MXG Quality Assurance section
will coordinate all requests for approval and use of locally manufactured or developed tools and
equipment that will be used on aerospace equipment per the above reference. Users will review
items and requirements biennially (every two years) for applicability and current configuration.
12. CONTROL OF TOOLS BY CONTRACTORS: (Ref. AFI 21-101, Para 10.2.1.12)
Depot teams, factory representatives, contract field teams, and contractors supporting aircraft
maintenance functions will use procedures for tool control in accordance with their government
contract. If tool control is not covered in the contract then, as a minimum, tools will be etched or
marked in some way to identify the mechanic who owns the tools. In addition, long-term
contractors will be required to have all tools shadowed to highlight missing tools and make it
easier to accomplish required inventories. For the purposes of this instruction, “long term” is
defined as a contractor supporting aircraft maintenance functions for over 180 continuous days.
For all depot teams, factory representatives, and contract field teams, the team chief is
responsible for inventory of tools and inventory documentation at the end of each work shift.
Lost tools will be reported to a QA representative if the tool is not immediately recovered.
13. PROCEDURES FOR SHARED CTK/DECENTRALIZED: (Ref. AFI 21-101 Para
10.2.1.13)
     13.1. When a tool room is shared by two or more work centers, the tools will be sectioned
     off accordingly and easily identifiable as to the owning work center by the location and EID.
     13.2. For decentralized CTKs, the key will be signed out in TCMax at the owning work
     center and an AFRC Form 177 will be documented at the decentralized location. The person
     signing the CTK “out” on the AFRC Form 177 will not be the same as the person signing
     CTK “in”. A second party or on duty supervisor will perform an inspection of the tool kit
     NLT the end of shift and document the AFRC Form 177. The key will then be returned to
     the owning work center and signed back in using TCMax.
     13.3. While at home station, the aircraft CTK will be treated the same as any other CTK to
     include inventory control procedures (i.e. beginning/end of shift inventory, etc.).
94AWI21-121 10 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 5


14. CONTROL OF CRASH RECOVERY TOOLS: (Ref. AFI 21-101, Para 10.2.1.14)
Crash recovery tools will be treated as a separate CTK under the custodial control of the Crash
Recovery Team Chief or his designated representative. All regular CTK procedures will be
followed to include shadowing and etching of tools, as well as inventory and control procedures.
15. SECOND PARTY OR SUPERVISOR INSPECTION: (Ref. AFI 21-101 Para
10.2.1.15) See paragraph 2 of this Instruction.
16. PROCEDURES FOR CONTROLLED ACCESS TO TOOL ROOMS: (Ref. AFI 21-
101 Para 10.7) All tool rooms must be capable of being locked and afford protective measures
such as monitoring, 24-hour coverage, or controlled key access. When all CTKs are not capable
of being secured in the tool room, the NCOIC will designate a process to prevent unauthorized
use or access to tools and equipment.
17. PROCEDURES TO CONTROL AIRCREW TOOLS AND LIFE SUPPORT KITS
DISPATCHABLE TO THE FLIGHT LINE: (Ref. AFI 21-101 Para 10.2.1.17)
Tool Control for Aircrew Tools and Life Support Kits will be managed IAW AFI 11-301V1 and
AFRC Sup 1 to AFI 11-301.
18. FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE (FOD) PREVENTION: (Ref. AFI 21-101 Para
14.19.2.8) All dispatchable CTKs will have a FOD container attached for use during aircraft
maintenance. These FOD containers will be emptied at the end of the job, prior to returning the
CTK to the storage area. The individual signing the CTK back in to TCMax will ensure the FOD
containers are empty.
19. LAMINATED WARNING TAGS: (Ref. T.O. 00-20-1-AFRCSUP1 Para 5.7.3.16.5.1.3)
All 94 MXG laminated warning tags shall be tracked in TCMax and controlled using normal tool
control procedures.
   19.1. Work centers must notify the Quality Assurance office when changes are made to their
   laminated warning tags (i.e. add or delete tags).
