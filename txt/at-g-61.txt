                                       INTRODUCTION


This training exercise guide has been developed to train the Air Traffic Controller in basic
weather observations (METAR) and Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) decoding. Use this
guide to enhance on-the-job training for all Air Traffic Control personnel. AFPAM 11-238,
Aircrew Quick Reference to the METAR/TAF Codes, is the “textbook” for this training. The
AFPAM 11-238 is available electronically from the AF Publications web site. It is an excellent
job aid and should be made available for daily use.


                             STUDY THIS GUIDE CAREFULLY


OBJECTIVE

Upon completion of this guide, you will have gained the knowledge necessary to complete the
METAR and TAF decoding exercises.

INSTRUCTIONS

This guide is divided into two chapters.

The first part, chapter 1 explains METAR observations and how to read, understand, and
disseminate those which are vital to Air Traffic Controllers and the flying community. At the
end of this chapter is a METAR observations quiz that will assist the trainer and trainee to
determine overall knowledge of observations.

The second part, chapter 2 explains TAFs. Just as above, this guide will explain how to read and
disseminate the TAF as required. This training guide will assist the trainer by providing a final
testing in decoding TAFs.

The AFPAM 11-238 and this guide touch only on the sections of the forecast and observations of
interest to the aircrew and the Air Traffic Controller. The other parts of the forecast and
observations that are only of interest to those in the weather field are not covered in these
training materials.

Trainer:

Provide the AFPAM to the trainee for use in training and for daily use.

As the trainee goes through training, point out important parts that are of primary interest to your
local situation.




                                                 6
Allow the trainee to spend time working the practice exercises in this guide. In addition, have
them use the AFPAM to look at real world forecast and observations. Show the trainee what the
observed or forecasted weather looks like as well as what the observations says.

After the trainee has completed the exercises, review all areas of the METAR or TAF section
prior to giving them the final decoding exercise. Answers for each exercise are located after
each particular exercise.

Trainee:

You will be given the opportunity to practice each section of decoding an observation or TAF.

You are the eyes and ears of all routine weather information passed to aircrews. Take this
training serious and learn how to properly and efficiently decode the weather information you
will be passing to aircrews. The pilot is interested in what is happening or forecasted to occur at
the point of takeoff or landing. Learn this information so you can give the best information
possible.

                         CHAPTER 1. METAR OBSERVATIONS


A METAR Observation is a concise statement of the current meteorological conditions at an
airport or other observing site. Each country is allowed to make modifications or exceptions to
the code for use in each particular country. The METAR code, as described here, is the one used
in the United States.

METAR refers to a scheduled observation taken between 55-59 minutes past the hour, which is
also referred to as an hourly observation.

SPECI refers to unscheduled observations taken between 00-54 minutes past the hour as long as
the predefined criterion has been met.

Weather coding explanations are found in a number of places as well as the pamphlet AFPAM
11-238, Aircrew Quick Reference METAR/TAF Codes, which accompanies this training guide.

                       VISIBILITY, RVR, WEATHER PRACTICE


INSTRUCTIONS: Decode the following observed items. Write the visibility and weather
on the line below each report. Example: 3 statute miles with an RVR on runway 10 of 6000
feet. The weather is light rain and fog.

The temperature conversion chart is on page 64.


  1. 1/2SM MIFG



  2. 5SM R17L/P6000FT –SHRA



  3. 3/4SM +TSRAGR



  4. 1/2SM R30/2600FT –SNBLSN



  5. 5SM HZFU



  6. 7SM VCSH



  7. BKN000 ¾ R35L/1000FT BLSN          (in remarks: BLSN BKN000)



  8. 3SM BR SCT250




                                          13
               VISIBILITY, RVR, WEATHER PRACTICE ANSWERS


1.   1/2SM MIFG (Visibility is ½ mile in shallow fog)

The METAR equivalent of ground fog is shallow fog. To report fog rather than mist (BR)
visibility must be less than 5/8 statute mile. However, the combination of the descriptor
shallow (MI) and the phenomena mist (BR) is not authorized so whenever shallow fog (fog) is
present it will be reported as MIFG.

2. 5SM R17L/P6000FT –SHRA (Visibility is 5 miles, RWY 17 left RVR more than 6000
feet, light rainshowers.)

When the criteria exists, RVR is encoded in the body of the report between the visibility and
weather phenomena. A solidus,"/", divides the runway and the distance. FT is added to the
end to show unit of measure. "P" is entered before the value if the value is more than the
maximum reading. When precipitation is present, the intensity is always indicated and a
descriptor is used if applicable. The intensity is entered first, so light rainshowers is being
reported.

3. 3/4SM +TSRAGR (Visibility is ¾ mile, thunderstorm with heavy rainshowers and hail
≥1/4 inch) or 3/4SM +TSRAGS (Visibility is ¾ mile, thunderstorm with heavy rainshowers
and hail <1/4 inch)

Intensity is always encoded first followed by the descriptor. Only one descriptor can be used
with each group, so when thunderstorms and showers are both occurring, thunderstorms will
always be the descriptor. The size of the hailstones determines whether GR or GS is encoded.
Since the size of hailstones is not known, both possible examples are shown. If GR is used,
the size of the hailstones will be shown in remarks.

4. 1/2SM R30/2600FT –SNBLSN (Visibility ½ mile, RWY 30 RVR 2600 feet, light snow
and blowing snow)

When the criteria exists, RVR is encoded in the body of the report between the visibility and
weather phenomena. A solidus,"/", divides the runway and the distance. FT is added to the
end to show unit of measure. When precipitation and obscurations are occurring at the same
time, they are entered in order of predominance was no indication of predominance.

5.   5SM HZFU (Visibility 5 miles haze and smoke)

In this case, both types of reports enter obscurations in order of predominance. The only
difference is the contraction.

6. 7SM VCSH (Visibility 7 miles, showers in the vicinity or between 5 and 10 miles from
the airfield -AFMAN 15-111 para 3.3.7.1.)




                                             14
Since the showers (phenomena) are not occurring at the observation point at the time of
observation VCSH is encoded in the weather section. SH and TS are the only descriptors that
can be used in conjunction with the VC qualifier. When either is used with VC, it replaces
the intensity and the type of precipitation is not entered.

7.   BKN000 3/4SM R35L/1000FT BLSN (in remarks: BLSN BKN000)

(Sky is partially obscured from 5/8 to 7/8 coverage, visibility is ¾ mile, RWY 35 left RVR is
1000 feet, blowing snow. In remarks, the blowing snow is obscuring the sky)

Even though 000 technically means "50 feet or less above the surface," it would be safe to
equate the broken sky condition. In this case, it is due to blowing snow. BKN is used as the
sky contraction indicating the sky is obscured 5/8 to 7/8. The remarks for this type of
situation is a repeat of the obscuring phenomena and the layer and layer height (BLSN
BKN000) to denote what is obscuring the sky.

8.   3SM BR SCT250

(Visibility is 3 miles mist or “fog”, 25 thousand scattered)

Because the visibility is restricted only 3 miles, the code BR is used to indicate the obscuring
phenomena. Remember, BR is used when the visibility is restricted >5/8 of a mile.

                          SKY CONDITIONS PRACTICE


INSTRUCTIONS: Decode the sky condition in the following reports. Write the plain
language conditions on the line below each condition. Example: Scattered at 5000 feet,
broken at 12000 feet.



  1. VV003



  2. SCT015 OVC045



  3. SKC



  4. BKN035TCU



  5. FEW020



  6. SCT030CB



  7. SCT040 BKN120 OVC200



  8. SCT250




                                         16
                      SKY CONDITION PRACTICE ANSWERS


1. VV003. Indicates an “indefinite ceiling 300.” VV indicates the vertical visibility or the
height you can see up into the obstruction is 300 feet, however vertical visibility is not
spoken.

2. SCT015 OVC045. The lowest layer is 1500 feet and the clouds at 4500 feet constitutes an
overcast layer or a ceiling.

3. SKC. The sky is clear.

4. BKN035TCU. The ceiling covers between 5/8 and 7/8 of the sky. Clouds at that level
include towering cumulus (TCU).

5. FEW020. Few indicate that at 2000 feet the sky is covered between 1/8 and 2/8.

6. SCT030CB. Scattered skies at 3000 feet and cumulonimbus are present.

7. SCT040 BKN120 OVC200. In plain language, at 4000 feet the clouds are scattered (3/8 to
4/8 coverage), broken at 12000 feet (5/8 to 7/8 coverage) the sky at this level is covered, and
overcast at 20000 feet (8/8 coverage).

8. SCT250. Sky is covered by 3/8 to 4/8 clouds at 25000 feet.

         TEMPERATURE, DEW POINT, ALTIMETER SETTING PRACTICE


INSTRUCTIONS: Decode the temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting in the following
observations. On the line below the observations, write using plain language temperature in
Celsius and then convert it to Fahrenheit, then write the dew point in Celsius and covert that to
Fahrenheit. Next write the altimeter setting. Use temperature conversion chart located on
page 58.
Example: Temperature 34°C, 93°F and Dew Point 30°C, 86°F, Altimeter 29.91.

1. KQTX 231950Z 00000KT 15SM SKC 31/17 A3013 RMK SLP202

The report is a special and is used for observations that must be taken between 00 and 54 minutes
after the hour. ICAO is KQTX and the report is on the 23rd at 1950Z. Winds are calm.
Visibility is 15 statute miles. The skies are clear. Temperature is 31°C, 87°F, and dew point is
17°C, 62°F. Altimeter setting is 30.13. Sea level pressure is 1020.2.

EXPLANATION OF FEATURES: The international code for location identifiers is used. The
date is included with the time in METAR reports and the date/time element ends with "Z" to
indicate coordinated universal time. Calm wind is encode by five zeroes ending in "KT." In the
US, visibility is reported in statute miles and ends in "SM." Overseas the visibility is reported in
meters, in 4 digits. Clear skies are encoded as SKC versus CLR, which is reserved for automated
stations. Temperature and dew point are reported in Celsius and separated by a "/," but the two
are a single element separated from the other elements by a space. The altimeter setting always
begins with an "A" followed by the four-digit reading in inches of mercury. METAR remarks
will always begin with "RMK" and will normally have at least one element, sea-level pressure.

8/520 9/54/

ICAO is KOKC, date is the 23rd and time is 1655Z. Winds are from 290° at 15 knots. Visibility
is 7 statute miles. Sky condition is ceiling, broken at 5000 feet, broken at 9000 feet, and overcast
at 12,000 feet. Temperature is 22°C, 71°F and the dew point is 15°C, 59°F. Altimeter setting is
29.85 and the sea level pressure is 1012.0.


3. KSSC 052250Z 24010KT 10SM VCSH SCT030 BKN100 34/27 A2986 RMK SLP121
8/170 9/340

The report is a special and is used for observations that must be taken between 00 and 54 minutes
after the hour. ICAO is KSSC, date is the 5th, the time is 2250Z. Winds are from 240° at 10
knots. Visibility is 10 statute miles and showers are occurring between 5 and 10SM from the
station, but not at the station. Sky coverage is scattered at 3000 feet, and ceiling, broken at
10,000 feet. Temperature is 34°C, 93°F and the dew point is 27°C, 80°F. Altimeter setting is
29.86 and the sea level pressure is 1012.1.

EXPLANATION OF OTHER FEATURES: Weather not at the station but between 5 and 10
miles from the station is considered to be "in the vicinity" and encoded in the body instead of in
remarks. When showers are reported as "in the vicinity" the type of precipitation is not included.
Weather occurring more than 10 miles from the station is reported in the remarks as DSNT.
Variable cloud layers are encoded in remarks the same in METAR as in SA. (See Table 3
ORDER OF REMARKS for the sequencing of the remarks).

SLP101 8/260 9/310

ICAO is KOFF, the date is the 19th and the time is 2155Z. The winds are from 130° at 10 knots.
The visibility is 12 statute miles. The sky is scattered at 3000 feet with tower cumulus present
and scattered at 8000 feet. Temperature is 34°C, 93°F and the dew point is 20°C, 68°F.
Altimeter setting is 29.82. TCU is reported from the southwest to the west.


EXPLANATION: When present, towering cumulus will be reported with the layer with which it
is associated. When it is also included in remarks, it indicates that the TCU is not at the station.
In this case, it is within 10 statute miles of the station.

5. SPECI KPIT 301935Z 22015G25KT 3/4SM R22L/2800FT +TSRA OVC010CB 18/17
A2992 RMK FRQ LTGICCCCG ALQDS TSB33 TS OHD MOV E

The report is a special and is used for observations that must be taken between 00 and 54 minutes
after the hour. ICAO is KPIT, date is the 30th, the time is 1935Z. Winds are from 220° at 15
knots with gust at 25 knots. Visibility is 3/4 statute miles. The runway visual range (RVR) for
runway 22L is 2800 feet. A thunderstorm is in progress with heavy rainshowers. The sky
condition is ceiling, overcast at 1000 feet and the cloud type is cumulonimbus. Temperature is
18°C, 64°F and the dew point is 17°C, 62°F. Altimeter setting is 29.92 and the sea level pressure
is not included in a SPECI. The station is reporting frequent lightning that is in cloud, cloud to
cloud, and cloud to ground. The thunderstorm began at 33 minutes after the hour. The
thunderstorm is overhead and moving east.

EXPLANATION: Special reports begin with SPECI and contain all the data that would be in an
hourly observation which includes the sea-level pressure and temperature/dew point. RVR is a
part of the body following visibility. “R” is the runway and “VR” is the visual range. "VR" is
separated from the runway by a "/", and "FT" is added to the end of the element. The intensity
symbol refers to the precipitation not the descriptor. Only one descriptor can be used with the
precipitation element so TS and SH cannot be entered together. TS implies a form of showery
activity. FRQ indicates frequent and OHD tells us the phenomena is overhead the station. The
beginning time, ending time, and the location and movement of the thunderstorm is entered in
the Automated, Manual, and Plain Language section of remarks. SLP is not reported in a SPECI.

6. KABI 081255Z 27008KT 3SM –SNRA BR SCT003 BKN007 OVC015 01/M01 A3004
RMK VIS N-E 2 SNB38 SLP139 8/72/ 9/35

ICAO is KABI, the date is the 8th and the time is 1255Z. The winds are from 270° at 08 knots.
The visibility is 3 statute miles, with light snow, rain, and mist. The sky is scattered at 300 feet,
ceiling broken at 700 feet, and overcast 1500 feet. Temperature is 1°C, 33°F and the dew point
is minus 1°C, 30°F. Altimeter setting is 30.04. Visibility is 2 statute miles from north to east.
Snow began at 38 minutes past the hour. The sea level pressure is 1013.9.




                                                 26
EXPLANATION: When precipitation and obscurations are both present, they are encoded in
order of predominance. The intensity symbol precedes the group, and is used only once,
referring to the first phenomena. Since the first phenomena are reported as light, the second can
be assumed light (or at least lighter). Obscuring phenomena is separated from the precipitation
group by a space. In this case, the station is IFR because of the 700 feet ceiling. Temperatures
and dew points below freezing on the Celsius scale are prefixed with "M". In remarks, sector
visibility is reported with the contraction is VIS.

7. KLAX 101650Z VRB03KT 2SM BR HZ SCT000 BKN250 24/23 A2987 RMK BR HZ
SCT000 SLP115 8/008 9/304

The report is a special and is used for observations that must be taken between 00 and 54 minutes
after the hour. ICAO is KLAX, date is the 10th at 1650Z. The winds are variable at 3 knots.
Visibility is 2 statute miles in mist (fog) and haze. The sky is partially obscured as reported in
the section SCT000. The sky condition is ceiling broken at 25,000. The temperature is 24°C,
75°F and the dew point is 23°C, 73°F. Altimeter setting is 29.87. Mist (fog) and haze is
partially obscuring the sky. Sea level pressure is 1011.5.

EXPLANATION: When wind is 6 knots or less, the observer has the option to encode "VRB" or
the average direction. BR is used to encode the obstruction to vision rather than FG since
visibility is 5/8 or more. When more than one obscuration is present they are encoded together
with a space in between and the predominant obstruction entered first. Partial obscuration is
indicated by a layer contraction followed by 000. The amount of obscuration is determined by
the layer contraction. In this case, SCT is encoded because the amount of coverage was from 3/8
to 4/8 coverage. The obstruction to vision and the layer coverage is also entered in remarks.

NE20RAE30SGB35 SLP142 8/02/ 9/08

The report is a special and is used for observations that must be taken between 00 and 54 minutes
after the hour. ICAO is KALO, date is the 23rd at 1053Z. Winds are from 010 at 18 knots with
gust at 24 knots. Wind direction is varying from 330 to 070 degrees. Visibility is 2 statute miles
with light snow grains and mist (fog). Sky condition is ceiling overcast at 1000 feet.
Temperature and dew points are 1°C, 33°F. Altimeter setting is 29.92. In remarks, snow ended
at 1020Z, rain ended at 1030Z, snow grains began at 1035Z. Sea level pressure is 1014.2.

EXPLANATION: There is no way to indicate that an hourly observation meets special criteria.
All hourly observations will begin with METAR. Variable wind direction is indicated in the
body of the report instead of remarks. Remarks such as PCPN VRY LGT will not appear in
METAR reports unless the observer determines the phenomena to be significant.

9. SPECI KDFW 102315Z 06002KT 1 1/4SM R17L/Ml000FT –DZ FG VV003 06/06 A2969


This is a special observation taken at KDFW on the 10th at 2315Z. The winds are from 060 at 2
knots. The visibility is 1¼ statute miles with an RVR on runway 17L of less than 1000 feet.


                                               27
Light drizzle and fog is giving an indefinite ceiling of 300 feet. Temperature and dew point are
both 6°C, 42°F and the altimeter setting is 29.69.

EXPLANATION: When the criteria exists, RVR is entered in the body of an observation.
When RVR is greater than or less than the specified maximum or minimum values, a "P" or "M"
precedes the value respectively. When precipitation and obscurations are both present, they are
encoded in order of predominance. Precipitation and obscurations are separated by a space.
When visibility is less than 5/8 statute mile, FG is used instead of BR. Indefinite ceilings are
reported as vertical visibility (VV).

10. SPECI KCYS 231815Z 29008KT 1SM R09/P6000FT -TSRASN BKN007 OVC025CB
02/M02 A2995 RMK OCNL LTGICCG W TSB01 TS W MOV E

Special observation from KCYS, on the 23rd at 1815Z. The winds are from 290° at 8 knots.
Visibility is 1 statute mile with an RVR of 6000+ feet on runway 09. A thunderstorm is in
progress with light rain and snow. The ceiling is broken at 700 feet and overcast at 2500 feet. A
cumulonimbus is present at 2500 feet. The temperature is 2°C, 35°F and the dew point is -2°C,
28°F. Altimeter setting is 29.95. There is occasional lightning in cloud and cloud to ground
west. The thunderstorm began at 1801Z and is west of the station moving east.

EXPLANATION: When RVR is greater than or less than the specified maximum or minimum
values, a "P" or "M" precedes the value respectively. The intensity symbol refers to the first
precipitation not the descriptor and is used only once. Since the precipitation is encoded in order
of predominance, any items that follow are considered to be of less intensity then that preceding
it. Since a thunderstorm is reported, CB is encoded with the layer with which it is associated.
(Lightning is to the west, less than 1 flash per minute).

                                      CHAPTER 2. TAF

1. A Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) is a concise statement of the expected meteorological
conditions at an airport during a specified period (usually 24 hours). Each country is allowed to
make modifications or exceptions to the code for use in each particular country. The TAF code,
as described here, is the one used in the United States.

2. TAFs use the same weather code found in METAR weather reports. Detailed explanations of
weather coding are found in a number of places as well as the pamphlet AFPAM 11-238,
Aircrew Quick Reference METAR/TAF Codes, which accompanies this training guide.

3. The U.S. has no requirement to forecast temperatures in an aerodrome forecast, however a
minimum/maximum temperature is included in each forecast. The NWS will continue to
forecast icing and turbulence in AIRMETs and SIGMETS. An icing and turbulence decoding
charts are on page 65.
