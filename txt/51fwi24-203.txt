                                 CLASSIFIED SHIPMENTS

3.1. Scope. This chapter applies to all personnel involved with the processing, packaging, and
shipment of classified, controlled, NWRM, and sensitive assets.
3.2. Procedures.
   3.2.1. All units/personnel that offer classified material for shipment will ensure assets are
   properly identified on the shipping documents (DD Form 1348-1A and/or DD Form 1149).
   This will include the applicable CIIC/SRC code and must be marked with the words identify
   the degree of classification. NOTE: “TOP SECRET” shipments are not authorized to be
   processed through Cargo Movement section.
   3.2.2. Packing and Crating will:
       3.2.2.1. Establish delivery receipt times with the shipper. Classified shipments will be
       received and processed between 0800-1100 hours Mon-Fri.
       3.2.2.2. Designate qualified personnel to receipt for classified material.
       3.2.2.3. Initiate and use AF Form 4387 for processing classified material IAW AFI 24-
       203, Para 5.1.7.
       3.2.2.4. Ensure all classified shipments are safeguarded during the receiving, packing,
       and handling process. Shipments will be handled, packed, processed and then logged
       into the classified storage area in Building 635, Room 147 (vault) as necessary.
       Classified shipments will not be left unattended/unprotected. All classified shipments not
       in the vault are eyes-on until the shipment leaves this location.
       3.2.2.5. Ensure the DD Form 1348-1A and/or DD Form 1149, has the applicable
       CIIC/SRC and is marked with the degree of classification.
       3.2.2.6. Use Enterprise Solution Supply (ESS)/Asset Management System (AMS)
       electronic signature as required. Notify the section supervisor if a discrepancy is detected
       which cannot be resolved on-the-spot. Provide hand-to-hand receipt control IAW AFI
       24-203, Para 5.1.3.
       3.2.2.7. Ensure each asset is enclosed in two opaque sealed containers or similar
       wrapping. If the classified material is an internal component of an item of equipment, the
       outside shell or body of the item may be considered to be a sufficient enclosure if it does
       not reveal classified information. Specialized shipping containers including closed cargo
       transporters may also be considered the outer wrapping or cover.
       3.2.2.8. Ensure all previous markings on exterior shipping container are obliterated. No
       new markings on the exterior container will contain any information indicating the piece
       is of a classified nature, e.g. security classification marking or Transportation Protective
       Service (TPS) required. However, when a shipment goes by military airlift, DD Form
       1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification, must show the TPS required in Block 6.
       See DTR, Part II, Ch 205, Par I.2, for 1387-2 preparation and distribution. Note:
       Maintenance Technical Orders (T.O.’s) may require a nomenclature marking on exterior.

     affixed with a water resistant label adhesive or PPP-T-60 waterproof, pressure sensitive
     tape. PPP-T-60 tape will be placed over the entire surface of the label.
     3.2.2.12. Ensure DD Form 1348-1A/DD Form 1149 shipment planning worksheet is
     complete and accurate.
  3.2.3. Outbound Surface Freight will:
     3.2.3.1. Initiate and use AF Form 4387 for processing classified material IAW AFI 24-
     203, Para 5.1.7.
     3.2.3.2. Match DD Forms 1149/DD Forms 1348-1A against shipment to verify proper
     labeling.
     3.2.3.3. Prepare the shipping documentation using proper tenders, routing instruction
     notes and Transportation Facility Guide instructions.
     3.2.3.4. Provide hand-to-hand receipt control for classified, sensitive, and controlled
     shipments. The DD Form 1907 may be used for all receipt transactions. The TO may
     use the DD Form 1907 for internal control as a hand-to-hand receipt of classified or
     sensitive items. Equivalent carrier-furnished forms may be used as described in the DTR,
     Part II. The air/truck manifest may be used for military shipments if they adequately
     control the materiel being transferred.
     3.2.3.5. Prepare and forward a REPSHIP to consignee after the shipment departs per
     DTR 4500.9-R, Chapter 205, Para. L. If a fax or e-mail cannot be transmitted, a
     telephone REPSHIP will be accomplished with the consignee. This will be documented
     with name of person talked to, DSN number called, date and time called.
     3.2.3.6. If Consignee does not acknowledge receipt of REPSHIP within 24 hours,
     Outbound Freight will initiate a Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR). If Consignee
     does not acknowledge receipt of cargo within 24 hours of RDD, Outbound Freight will
     initiate tracer action. Security officers will be notified and tracer action will be initiated
     at origin and destination when notified shipment is overdue at destination.

     In-checkers must handle all items delivered via truck (i.e. Kunsan Vehicle Operators) as
     classified material. An indication that a small parcel package may be classified is by the
     receipt of a REPSHIP for that item or the absence of a packing envelope on the outside of
     the container. The driver will provide a DD Form 1907 for all other classified shipments.
     3.2.4.2. Only personnel that are cleared and listed on the Classified Receipt Listing are
     authorized to receipt and/or process small package carrier deliveries. Packages will be
     constantly monitored or stored in the classified vault located in Bldg 824/Receiving
51FWI24-203 15 MARCH 2013                                                                11


     Section. Upon identification of a classified asset, Inbound Receiving personnel will
     initiate and use the AF Form 4388.
     3.2.4.3. Classified cargo may be turned over to the consignee after verifying they are
     authorized to receive the asset based on the classification. Additionally, the customer
     must sign the DD Form 1907 to show the change of custody.

4.1. Scope. This chapter applies to all Distribution personnel whose duties involve receiving,
processing, handling and transportation of classified material.
4.2. Procedures.
   4.2.1. Classified Receipt Listing. The Vehicle Operations Element will work with the
   Materiel Management Flight (MMF) to ensure the Classified Receipt Listing identifies only
   those vehicle operators (2T1s) authorized to receive, handle, and transport classified assets.
   The MMF will be notified within 24 hours or the next duty day when a vehicle operator’s
   clearance eligibility and/or access level is downgraded or changed (loss of clearance, change
   in name, etc.) as designated by the unit commander or proper authority (e.g., Security Forces
   Squadron or Unit Security Manager).
   4.2.2. Vehicle Operations Classified Receipt Listing Certification. The Vehicle Operations
   Element will produce a memorandum listing the names of assigned personnel authorized to
   receive, handle, and transport classified assets. This listing will include the names of
   personnel on the MMF Classified Receipt Listing but will also contain the following
   information:
       4.2.2.1. A statement certifying and listing the names of all personnel on the list have
       received annual Information Security training, date of training and DEROS.
       4.2.2.2. A statement certifying all personnel have read this wing instruction and AFI 24-

                                          Chapter 5

                      DEMURRAGE AND DETENTION CHARGES

5.1. Scope. The chapter outlines the responsibilities and procedures for maintenance and
operation of the Demurrage Charge and Detention program at Osan Air Base. This instruction
applies to all units assigned to 51 FW.
5.2. Responsibilities. Distribution Flight is responsible for railhead operations and control of
seavans at Osan Air Base. Organizations (consignee) receiving shipments too large to physically
process through base supply are responsible for ensuring that:
   5.2.1. Seavans and railcars are offloaded in timely manner.
   5.2.2. Cargo is removed from the railhead as soon as possible.
5.3. Concepts.
   5.3.1. After the Korean railcars are spotted in an offloading area designated by 51
   LRS/LGRDDC representative, six hours are allowed for off loading before demurrage
   charges begin. This charge can often be avoided and actual costs minimized by pre-planning.
   U.S. Army railcars are not subject to demurrage, but are in short supply and require the same
   timely handling as Korean National Railway railcars.
   5.3.2. When seavans are offered to the consignee, unloading must be completed within 72
   hours of delivery date or detention charges will begin to accrue.
   5.3.3. In circumstances where railcars or seavans are received by the consignee under
   demurrage/detention or the consignee has less than the allotted time to offload cargo, 51
   LRS/LGRDDC will notify the consignee of demurrage/detention charges.
5.4. Procedures.
   5.4.1. 51 LRS/LGRDDC will notify the consignee of arrival time of trains/seavans and an
   off load area will be jointly determined at that time by the consignee and 51 LRS/LGRDDC.
   5.4.2. 51 LRS/LGRDDC representative will escort the train/seavan carrier to the
   predetermined offloading area upon cargo arrival.
   5.4.3. Consignee is responsible for cargo offloading. When railcars/seavans cannot be
   unloaded in the allotted time (6 hours for railcars, 72 hours for seavans), the consignee must
   request an extension from 51 LRS/LGRDDC. Any further extension must be coordinated
   through the 51 MSG/CC.
   5.4.4. 51 LRS, 51 CES, and/or 51 AMXS/51 MXS may be tasked to loan material handling
   equipment (MHE) to organizations that do not possess MHE. Receiving organizations are
   responsible for satisfying requirements for off load and will provide or arrange for qualified
   operators/drivers.
   5.4.5. Cargo will not be stored at the railhead under any conditions. Temporary storage not
   to exceed 24 hours after unloading must be coordinated with 51 LRS/LGRDDC. If
   temporary storage is required the consignee will receipt for the cargo immediately upon
   unloading and is responsible for its security thereafter.
51FWI24-203 15 MARCH 2013                                                                     15


5.5. After Offloading. It is the responsibility of the consignee to remove and dispose of all
dunnage from the empty railcars/seavans. Reusable cargo securing devices such as cables,
turnbuckles, cable clamps and chains will be delivered by the consignee to 51 LRS/LGRDDC
(the offload work area must be cleared of all debris).
   5.5.1. Location of operations:
       5.5.1.1. Trucks: Load/download operations will be at Building 635 or Building 824.
       5.5.1.2. Movement routes.
          5.5.1.2.1. Primary Entry. The primary entry to the base for delivery trucks is the
          Morin Gate. In the event the gate is closed during normal duty hours, an alternate
          entry for the base will be designated by 51 SFS. 51 LRS/LGRDDC will escort
          commercial vehicles to/from the area in which they are loaded/unloaded.
          5.5.1.2.2. Vehicle Inspection. The Morin Gate is designated as the base’s vehicle
          inspection station. An alternate vehicle inspection area will be established by 51 SFS
          in the event the Morin Gate is closed.
          5.5.1.2.3. Suspect or Suspicious Vehicle Holding Area. Suspect or suspicious
          vehicles will be directed where to report by 51 SFS personnel until cleared. If vehicle
          is suspect or suspicious, contact Security Forces at 784-5515.

       each unit. (Attachment 2).
       8.1.1.5. Convene a reusable container working group meeting annually or as required.
       The working group will consist of representatives from the major base shipping activities
       who initiate over three shipments through 51 LRS/LGRDDC each year (or generate
       container replacement requests for stored items), i.e., supply, maintenance, fighter
       squadrons, and some tenant organizations. The objective of this working group will be to
       minimize unnecessary expenditures of Department of Defense (DoD) funds necessary to
       replace containers.
       8.1.1.6. Provide staff assistance and training to units upon request from the unit
       commander or unit container monitor.
       8.1.1.7. Monitor all reusable containers on the base for redistribution to units that need
       them, eliminating the need to buy reusable containers unnecessarily.
       8.1.1.8. Provide recommendations for the proper disposition of excess reusable
       containers and associated materials.
       8.1.1.9. Process and monitor fund recoupment for replacement containers through
       finance.
8.2. Unit Responsibilities (for units that utilize more than three SPI shipments, or generate
container replacement requests for stored items, i. e., WRM assets) will ensure the
following:
   8.2.1. Appoint a primary and alternate Unit Reusable Container Monitor (units may have
   multiple alternates appointed) to represent the unit on all matters pertaining to the base
   Reusable Container Program. The unit program monitor must be in the grade of E-5 or
   above.
   8.2.2. Forward an updated reusable container monitor appointment letter, signed by the unit
   commander, to 51 LRS/LGRDDC within ten days of any changes.
   8.2.3. Ensure that all cargo received is in the proper container or have this discrepancy
   annotated on the issue document and maintained with the property.
51FWI24-203 15 MARCH 2013                                                                      19


   8.2.4. Ensure all cargo turned in to 51LRS/LGRM or 51 LRS/LGRDDC is in the proper
   container or has an AF Form 451 (original plus two copies) attached with the paperwork for
   the item. See Attachment 3 for directions on completing the form. UCM’s are the only
   personnel authorized to sign AF Form 451.
   8.2.5. Identify and maintain an active reusable container storage area. Excess containers
   obtained through initial issue may be redistributed to other organizations that need them to
   preclude buying/building containers unnecessarily.
   8.2.6. Report packaging improvements to the base Reusable Container Monitor that will
   increase the efficiency of the Reusable Container Program.
   8.2.7. Protect all containers and packaging materials to prevent deterioration during storage.
   8.2.8. Provide adequate facilities, equipment, and materials to maintain containers for reuse.
   8.2.9. Train unit personnel on the importance of reusing containers and packaging materials
   and document training.
   8.2.10. Attend Base Container Monitor directed reusable container program meetings and
   training sessions.
   8.2.11. Train (document training) and appoint unit container monitors on use and preparation
   of AF Form 451s (Attachment 3).
   8.2.12. Monitor and establish effective metrics to account for and control reusable containers
   and materials.
8.3. Procedures.
   8.3.1. 51 LRS.
      8.3.1.1. Receiving will make sure that items received are not separated from their
      respective containers. If an item is received without its proper container a ROD/SDR
      will be accomplished and maintained with the property.
      8.3.1.2. Storage and Issue will ensure the original container remains with the issued item.
      When property requiring a SPI is issued without the SPI container, supply will annotate
      the accompanying DD Form 1348-1A, to indicate whether or not the property was issued
      in a reusable container. The using agency will retain the annotated DD Form 1348-1A,
      and ROD/SDR if applicable, to validate future turn-in shipments of reparable assets
      without the proper container.
      8.3.1.3. Flight Service Center will not accept an item for turn in that needs a reusable
      container unless the item is accompanied by an AF Form 451 or proof that the item was
      issued to the unit without the correct container. Proof is a copy of the DD Form 1348-
      1A, or ROD/SDR if applicable, signed and stamped when the item was originally issued.
      If an item was issued without a container, base supply personnel will initiate the AF Form
      451.
      8.3.1.4. When an item is received in a container that is contractor packed, every effort
      should be made to return the item, or its authorized substitute, in the original container.
      Do not obliterate any markings on that container or any other container (i.e., ID,
      serviceable tag, packaging labels, etc.).
20                                                          51FWI24-203 15 MARCH 2013


  8.3.2. Other Units will:
     8.3.2.1. Make sure the item is in the required container on receipt of an asset from base
     supply. Items received will stay in their containers until such time as required for bench
     stock or inspection.
     8.3.2.2. Make sure the change-out reparable is immediately put in the same container for
     turn-in when an asset is removed from the container and put in use. If the item is
     removed and the container is not immediately reused, it will be stored in an appropriate
     storage area. Ensure all internal blocking, bracing and cushioning materials are placed in
     the container.
