SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision clarifies when lunch cannot be taken and types of schedules with and without a
lunch period. It requires commander approval for any other FWS schedules not identified in the
instruction. It aligned the AWI with the language in the AFRCI.
1. Objective. Alternative Work Schedule (AWS) enables managers, supervisors, and
employees to meet or exceed mission requirements, program effectiveness, and personal goals
through the increased flexibility available in AWS programs. The goal of AWS programs is to
provide top quality support for our customers while allowing employees an opportunity to
enhance their quality of work life.
2. Conditions and Regulatory Restrictions.
     2.1. The head of the agency or designee will schedule the work of their employees to
     accomplish the mission of the agency. The head of the agency will schedule an employee’s
     regularly scheduled administrative workweek so that it corresponds with the employee’s
     actual work requirements. The agency/organizational unit as a whole will remain open for
     business five days per workweek. Within these parameters, the 439 AW basic workweek is
     established as a 40-hour workweek, scheduled on five days, Monday through Friday. The
     basic nonovertime workday (the working hours in each day in the basic workweek are the
     same, not on AWS), may not exceed eight hours, (breaks in working hours of more than one
     hour may not be scheduled in a basic workday). The administrative hours of the base will be
     0730-1615 throughout the year, including a 45 minute lunch period. The basic workweek for
     an uncommon tour of duty or AWS may include Saturday and/or Sunday. Wing and Group
     Commanders (Operations, Maintenance, and Mission Support) will be responsible for
     developing and documenting AWS within their respective groups, and must ensure adequate
     section/office coverage, as well as provide for customer service, during the 439 AW
     administrative hours of the base.
     2.2. Adjustments to tours of duty may not be made for the personal convenience of
     individual employees, except those attending school as provided in AFI 36-807, paragraph
     4.1.
     2.3. All full-time employees must take an unpaid/nonwork meal period. Employees must
     take a minimum 30-minute meal period. The meal period is usually at a time midway
     between the beginning and end of the work schedule. The supervisor will establish the meal
     period for each employee. The meal period on any work schedule will not be taken at the
     beginning or end of the workday in order to shorten the duty day, nor will the meal period be
     skipped in order to shorten the length of the duty day. The meal period cannot be combined
     with rest periods. When an unpaid meal period is scheduled, the employee may leave their
     place of employment for the established period of time or may be required to be on call or
     restricted to the premises. Exceptions to the meal period are as provided.
        2.3.1. When a meal is consumed during a long duration flight as defined in Air Force
        Reserve Command Instruction (AFRCI) 36-803, paragraph 7.2.2.1., or a long distance
        flight as defined in AFRCI 36-803, paragraph 8.1., an on-the-job meal period, not to
        exceed 20 minutes may be authorized, if time to take a meal break on the ground is not
        possible. The requirement to take a meal period cannot be waived on the basis of an
        aircrew member flying an Additional Flying Training Period (AFTP), Additional Ground
439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 3


     Training Period (AGTP), short civilian training flight that occurs during the midday
     timeframe, or active duty military flights. On such instances, the meal timeframe must be
     identified.
     2.3.2. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in a 24-hour period and an
     overlapping of shifts to permit time off for a meal is not possible, supervisors may
     authorize an on-the-job meal period of 20 minutes or less. A memorandum with the
     reason for the on-the-job meal period will be filed with the AW Form 6. All other
     requests for 20 minute on-the-job meal period will be submitted through the civilian
     personnel office to the Wing/Group commander for approval. Approved requests will be
     filed with the AW Form 6. On-the-job meal periods require that:
         2.3.2.1. The employees spend their on-the-job meal period at or near their work
         stations; and the time covered by the 20-minute on-the-job meal period is
         compensable. If times are set aside for eating then the time is not considered hours of
         work and the time is noncompensable unless it is shown that substantial official
         duties were performed during this period.
     2.3.3. Temporary and part-time employees who work less than six hours in a day may
     not be required to observe a meal period. Any other exceptions will be submitted through
     civilian personnel to the Wing/Group Commander.
  2.4. Management/Supervisors may restrict an employee’s choice of days off, if it would
  adversely impact the section’s mission accomplishment.
  2.5. Management/Supervisors may withdraw or alter an AWS, to meet organizational
  mission requirements or due to employee abuse. Maximum possible advance notice will be
  given to employee.
     2.5.1. Employees who abuse AWS privileges may be removed from their schedule and
     may be subject to disciplinary action as appropriate.
  2.6. Management/Supervisors may exempt from the AWS any employee or groups of
  employees and/or restrict an employee’s choice of arrival times if the participation in the
  program has had or is anticipated to:
     2.6.1. Have an adverse impact on the accomplishment of the mission;
     2.6.2. Incur additional cost;
     2.6.3. Disrupt an office’s functions;
     2.6.4. Be detrimental to employee health and or safety; or
     2.6.5. Be detrimental to organization’s security. Nothing in the AWS program represents
     nor is intended as a relinquishment of any management right according to law and
     regulatory guidance.
  2.7. Exclusion. Sections operating two or more shifts may be excluded from AWS. The
  Wing/ Group Commander will make the determination. Due to the nature of certain duties
  and responsibilities, the organizations specifically precluded from participating in the AWS
  are as follows:
     2.7.1. 439th Mission Support Group/Fire Emergency Services (439 MSG/CEF);
 4                                                        439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013


        2.7.2. 439th Security Forces Squadron (439 SFS) Flights A, B, C; and
        2.7.3. Part-time and temporary employees. Note: Temporary employees with an 80-hour
        biweekly work schedule may be authorized to work the 5/4/9 CWS. All other exceptions
        will be submitted through civilian personnel to the wing/group commander for approval.
     2.8. Organizations participating in an AWS program must establish a time accounting
     method that provides the supervisor with affirmative or personal knowledge of each
     employee’s entitlement to pay. When a supervisor cannot certify from personal knowledge
     the entitlement to pay for an employee on a flexible work schedule, one of the following time
     accounting options may be used:
        2.8.1. Work Report system: A report generally covering a biweekly pay period and
        record of the time allotted to various projects or activities with a portion set aside to
        record arrival and departure times, as well as any other exceptions to the normal
        workday.
        2.8.2. Sign-in/sign-out sheets: A log that the employee enters his/her name and the time
        of arrival, departure and other exceptions to the normal workday.
        2.8.3. Automatic Time Recording Equipment: Time clock, electro-mechanical time
        accumulating devices, etc.

     4.1. Fixed tour of duty (not on AWS), is a tour of duty in which an employee has a basic
     work requirement of eight hours each day, Monday through Friday, with an unpaid meal
     period of not less than 30 minutes or not more than 60 minutes, 40 hours each week.
     Example: Hours are from 0730-1615 hours with lunch between 1130- 1215 hours. There is
     no flexing of start time and credit hours cannot be earned on a work schedule designated as a
     fixed schedule.
        4.1.1. Straight tour of duty (not on AWS), is a tour of duty in which an employee has a
        basic work requirement of eight hours each day, 40 hours each week with an on-the-job
        meal period as outlined in paragraph 2.3.2.
     4.2. AWS.
        4.2.1. Flexitour is a work schedule in which an employee has a basic work requirement
        of 8 hours each day, 40 hours each week. The employee selects a starting time within the
        flexible hours of 0600-0900 hours, within 15-minute increments, and the stopping time
        will be within the flexible hours of 1500-1800 hours, within 15-minute increments, and
        the employee continues to adhere to these times. Core hours are between 0900-1500
        hours. The meal time band is between 1100-1300 hours. Meal periods may vary from 30
        minutes to one hour. Example: Employee starts duty day at 0830 hours with a 30-minute
        meal period, from 1230-1300 hours. Employee will finish their workday at 1700 hours.
        Credit hours may be earned and used under this schedule. Credit hours cannot be earned
        for a missed meal period. Since there is no flexibility in start/stop time, once schedule is
        established, all deviations in start/stop times and absences during core hours must be
        accounted for by using credit hours, compensatory time-off, or leave. Duty time, leave
        used, credit hours earned/taken, etc., will be annotated on the AFRC Form 270.
        Employees may change their schedule for the beginning of a subsequent pay period by
        submitting a 439 AW Form 6 to their supervisor for approval by the last Wednesday of
        the preceding pay period.
            4.2.1.1. Sections with a second shift. Employee selects a starting time within the
            flexible hours of 1400 – 1700 hours, within 15-minute increments and the stopping
            time will be within the flexible hours of 2300 – 0200 hours, within 15-minute
            increments, and the employee continues to adhere to these times. Core hours are
            between 1700-2300 hours. The meal time band is between 1900-2100 hours. Meal
            periods may vary from 30 minutes to one hour.
            4.2.1.2. Sections with a third shift. Employee selects a starting time within the
            flexible hours of 2200 – 0100 hours, within 15-minute increments and the stopping
            time will be within the flexible hours of 0700-1000 hours, within 15-minute
            increments, and the employee continues to adhere to these times. Core hours are
            between 0100 – 0700 hours. The meal time band is between 0300 – 0500 hours. Meal
            periods may vary from 30 minutes to on-hour.
439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               7


     4.2.2. Gliding is a flexible work schedule in which an employee has a basic work
     requirement of 8 hours each day, 40 hours each week. The employee selects a starting
     time within the flexible hours of 0600-0900 hours, within 15-minute increments, and the
     stopping time will be within the flexible hours of 1500-1800 hours, within 15 - minute
     increments. Core hours are between 0900-1500 hours. The meal time band is between
     1100-1300 hours. Meal periods may vary from 30 minutes to one hour. Example: An
     employee selects a schedule start time of 0800 hours with a 30-minute meal period. The
     stop time will be 1630 hours. Once the schedule is set, the employee may vary the arrival
     time, i.e. glide. An employee may be permitted to glide in increments, up to a maximum
     of 120 minutes on either side of the selected arrival time. (Exceptions; employees who
     begin work at 0600 hours may glide after 0600 hours, but not before 0600 hours.
     Employees who begin work at the end of the morning flexible period of 0900 hours may
     glide before 0900 hours, but not after 0900 hours.) Example 1: An employee selects a
     schedule of 0800–1630 hours, with a 30-minute meal period. The employee is permitted
     to glide in l5-minute increments on either side of 0800 hours. If the employee begins as
     early as 0745 hours, that becomes the employee's starting time for that day and that
     quarter hour counts toward the completion of the 8-hour day. The employee would
     complete the workday at 1615 hours. Conversely, an employee arriving at 0810 hours,
     begins the day at that time, is not considered tardy, and completes the workday at 1640
     hours. However, the basic schedule is 0800 hours and under normal circumstances the
     employee would usually adhere to that schedule. Example 2: An employee selects a
     schedule of 0600–1500 hours, with a 60-minute meal period. The employee is permitted
     to glide up to 120 minutes after 0600 hours, but not before 0600 hours. Therefore the
     employee could begin work at 0800 hours and the stop time would be 1700 hours.
     Gliding of the arrival time must be approved in advance by the supervisor. Unexpected
     gliding must be requested as soon as possible after the beginning of the absence. Credit
     hours may be earned and used under this schedule. Credit hours cannot be earned for a
     missed meal period. All absences during core hours must be accounted for by using
     credit hours, compensatory time-off, or leave. Duty time, leave used, credit hours
     earned/taken, etc., will be annotated on the AFRC Form 270. Employees may change
     their schedule for the beginning of a subsequent pay period by submitting a 439 AW
     Form 6, to their supervisor for approval by the last Wednesday of the preceding pay
     period.
        4.2.2.1. Sections with second shift. Employee selects a starting time within the
        flexible hours of 1400-1700 hours, within 15-minute increments and the stopping
        time will be within the flexible hours of 2300-0200 hours, within 15-minute
        increments. Core hours are between 1700-2300 hours. The meal time band is
        between 1900-2100 hours. Meal periods may vary from 30minutes to one hour.
        Once selected, the arrival time may vary.       An employee is allowed 15-minute
        increments, up to a maximum of 120 minutes, flexibility on either side of the selected
        arrival time. (Exceptions: Employees who begin work at 1400 hours may flex after
        1400 hours, but not before 1400 hours.) Employees who begin work at the end of the
        flexible period of 1700 hours may flex before 1700 hours, but not after 1700 hours.)
        4.2.2.2. Sections with a third shift. Employee selects a starting time within the
        flexible hours of 2200-0100 hours, within 15-minute increments and the stopping
8                                                    439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013


       time within the flexible hours of 0700-1000 hours, within 15-minute increments, and
       the employee continues to adhere to these times. Core hours are between 0100-0700
       hours. The meal time band is between 0300-0500 hours. Meal periods may vary
       from 30 minutes to one hour. Once selected, the arrival time may vary. An employee
       is allowed fifteen-minute increments up to a maximum of 120 minutes flexibility on
       either side of the selected arrival time. (Exception: Employees who begin work at
       2200 hours may flex after 2200 hours, but not before 2200 hours. Employees who
       begin work at the end of the flexible period of 0100 hours may flex before 0100
       hours, but not after 0100 hours.)
    4.2.3. Maxiflex is a flexible work schedule in which an employee has a basic work
    requirement of 80 hours per pay period. Employee may choose how many hours they
    work each workday and/or workweek, as long as employee is present during the core
    work hours and works or accounts for their whereabouts, by leave, credit hours,
    compensatory time, etc., to meet the 80 hours over a two-week period. The Commander
    of the organizations authorized to have a maxiflex schedule will establish the flexible
    time bands for the start and end of the workday and core hours if any. Core hours can be
    scheduled on less than 10 days in the pay period and includes the meal time band. Meal
    periods may vary from 30 minutes to one hour. Credit hours may be earned and used
    under this schedule. Credit hours can be earned after working eight hours in a day, 40
    hours in a week, or 80 hours in a biweekly pay period. Duty time, leave used, credit
    hours earned/taken, etc., will be annotated on the AFRC Form 270.
       4.2.3.1. Because of the flight schedules and unexpected changes which make it
       difficult to have a fixed schedule; maxiflex will be limited to pilots, loadmasters, and
       flight engineers on current flying status. The Wing Commander and the Operations
       Group Commander are the only ones authorized to approve maxiflex schedules for
       these employees. Individuals on maxiflex must have an AW Form 6 approving
       maxiflex and must set up their AFRC Form 270 with start and stop times, workdays,
       and a meal start and stop time for a total of 80 hours in a pay period. Individuals not
       on current flying status will be expected to maintain that schedule and may flex the
       arrival time and workday/work hours with approval from their supervisor. If known
       in advance, changes in the maxiflex schedule should be submitted for approval prior
       to the beginning of the pay period. The AFRC Form 270 can be used for this
       purpose. Unexpected changes should be submitted as soon as possible, but no later
       than two hours if after the beginning of the work day. All other employees are
       excluded from maxiflex. Exceptions can be submitted to the Wing/Group
       Commander for approval. Work schedule change form with commander’s approval
       will be filed in the T&A folder. This instruction does not supersede any provisions
       contained in AFI 36-807, AFRC Sup 1, and aircrew members are required to comply
       with all applicable provisions.
    4.2.4. CWS is a fixed schedule in which an employee has a basic work requirement of 80
    hours per pay period in fewer than 10 full workdays in a biweekly period. The only
    compressed schedules authorized are the 5/4/9 schedule (eight 9-hour days, one 8-hour
    day, and one scheduled day off (SDO) in a pay period) and 4/10 schedule (four 10-hour
    days and one scheduled day off (SDO) each week of a pay period). Hours must be fixed
    between 0630-1800 hours. Sections with more than one shift (day, swings, mids) in
439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  9


      operation may select a start time for the day shift of no earlier than 0600 hours. Earlier
      start time for mission reasons must be submitted to the Wing/Group Commander for
      approval. The SDO must be fixed and the meal period must be fixed but can range from
      30 minutes to one hour. There are no flexible times in a compressed schedule. Flexible
      work schedules and CWS cannot be combined. There is no authority for credit hours
      under a CWS. Because of the nature of work and in consideration of the mission and
      safety, request for the 4/10 schedule must be submitted to the Wing/Group Commander
      for final approval. AW Form 6 will be filed in the T&A folder.
   4.3. Changes to Work Schedule.
      4.3.1. All employees to include part time and temporary employees are required to have
      a 439 AW Form 6 annotated with their work schedule. Changes in work schedule will
      be submitted to the supervisor. The 439 AW Form 6 must be used for this purpose.
      Approved work schedules will be submitted to the timekeeper by the Wednesday before
      the end of the previous pay period when changes occur and a copy forwarded to 439
      MSG/Civilian Personnel (DPCE). The 439 AW Form 6 will be maintained in the T&A
      folder. The work schedule will remain in effect unless a change is submitted and
      approved. Work schedule changes must be mission-driven and not done to avoid taking
      leave.
      4.3.2. Disapproval of the employee’s program participation or schedule by the supervisor
      or second level supervisor/organizational head may be elevated to the Wing/Group
      commander for final decision. The Wing Commander is the final authority for
      employees directly under the wing.
      4.3.3. Civilian tour of duty will not be adjusted to avoid taking proper leave for personal
      convenience when performing military duties. (An example of an inappropriate schedule
      change would be an employee’s request to change from a regular 8-hour, 5-day-a-week
      tour of duty to a CWS or, conversely, to perform military duty with no intention of ever
      working the schedule in a civilian status.)
   4.4. Request for AWS tour of duty other than those indentified under paragraph 4.2 must be
   submitted through the group CC and civilian personnel to the Wing Commander for
   approval.
5. Credit Hours.
   5.1. Credit hours are hours that an employee elects to work in excess of the basic work
   requirement under flexitour, gliding, or maxiflex schedule. Credit hours are not authorized
   for employees on the fixed tour of duty or compressed work schedule. Approval of credit
   hours must be based on the needs of the mission. Work requirements must exist for credit
   hours to be worked. Employees must submit a premium pay request to work credit hours to
   the supervisor through ATAAPS. Credit hours may not be earned prior to supervisory
   approval. Credit hours earned must be annotated in ATAAPS and on the AFRC Form 270
   and the remarks column of the AFRC Form 270 must be annotated. The remark in the drop
   down menu on the AFRC Form 270 may be used for this purpose. Hard copy premium pay
   request for credit hours is not required for filing with the AFRC Form 270.
      5.1.1. Credit hours may be earned any time within the administrative workweek. Credit
      hours cannot be earned for a missed lunch period.
 10                                                     439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013


       5.1.2. Credit hours may be earned prior to the beginning of the workday. Credit hours
       must be earned before they can be used. Employees can earn credit hours and use these
       hours in the same day, provided the hours for which they have earned the credit occurred
       prior to the hours requested. Credit hours may be used during a subsequent day, week, or
       pay period. Credit hours may be earned and used in not less than one-quarter hour
       increments. All credit hours earned and taken must be accounted for in the same manner
       as other types of leave and are applied in the same way as annual leave or comp time, so
       as to satisfy the daily hour-per-day basic work requirement.
       5.1.3. Only one credit hour is earned for each hour of voluntary work in excess of the
       basic work requirement. Credit hours are distinguished from overtime hours in that they
       are not officially ordered.
       5.1.4. There is no limit to the amount of credit hours that an employee may earn during a
       pay period; however, only 24 credit hours may be carried into the next pay period.
       Therefore, credit hours earned in excess of 24 must be used during the pay period in
       which earned or forfeited. Carry-over credit hours are retained indefinitely until used.
       Supervisors may limit the number of credit hours accumulated during the pay period.
       Employees will schedule the use of credit hours, like any other authorized leave, in
       advance. Final approval for use of credit hours is up to the supervisor and based on
       mission needs.
       5.1.5. An employee who converts from FWS to CWS or to the fixed tour of duty with a
       credit hour accumulation, or separates from service with accumulated credit hours will be
       paid at his/her current rate of pay. A maximum of 24 credit hours is payable at the
       employee’s current rate of pay. Accumulated credit hours over 24 will be lost.
       5.1.6. Credit hours may not be regularly scheduled on a daily basis in order to have a set
       day off each week, i.e., earn two hours each day, Monday through Thursday, in order to
       have each Friday off. (The fulfillment of an employee’s basic work requirements in less
       than 10 days during the biweekly pay period constitutes a CWS, not a flexitour schedule,
       and credit hours are not authorized on a CWS.)
       5.1.7. Credit hours will be logged on the AFRC Form 270 and recorded in ATAAPS. In
       addition to logging earned and used credit hours on the AFRC Form 270, the request to
       use credit hours will be submitted through ATAAPS. The requirement to submit a hard
       copy OPM Form 71 may be waived by the supervisor.
       5.1.8. Credit hours cannot be earned for TDY travel or while attending training. These
       events are not considered voluntary in nature and therefore do not meet the definition of
       credit hours.
6. Holiday Pay. A full-time employee on CWS relieved from working on a day designated as a
holiday (or an in lieu of holiday) is entitled to be paid for the number of hours they would
normally have been scheduled to work that day. A full-time employee on flexible schedule is
entitled to their rate of basic pay on that day for a maximum of 8 hours.
7. AFRC Timecard Worksheet. AFRC Form 270 will be filed as part of the employee’s T&A
folder.
439AWI36-802 25 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    11


   7.1. The employee, supervisor or timekeeper will maintain the AFRC Form 270. If the
   employee maintains the form, the employee will complete the AFRC Form 270 at the end of
   each pay period and provide the AFRC Form 270 to their supervisor for certification. If the
   supervisor or timekeeper maintains the AFRC Form 270 for the employee, the
   employee will confirm the entries. After the initial set up of the AFRC Form 270, only
   variances on a day during the pay period need to be annotated/changed. The supervisor may
   waive the signing of the AFRC Form 270 by the employee. Supervisor and timekeeper are
   not required to sign the AFRC Form 270.
8. Temporary Duty (TDY). When an employee covered by CWS or FWS is TDY for school,
conferences, etc., the employee will be required to follow a traditional fixed schedule (eight
hours a day, 40 hours a week) during pay periods of the TDY unless the temporary work site is
on a CWS or FWS. Hours will correspond to the hours of the TDY location. Exception: Based
on mission requirements, the 439th Operations Group Commander will determine if converting
from AWS to fixed schedule for aircrew members on a TDY flying mission is appropriate and
based on the flying schedule. For aircrew members on long distance flights, changes that occur
by crossing the International Date Line are to be ignored for the purpose of documenting travel
time. Duty times while TDY will be recorded on the AFRC Form 270 (timecard) using a 24-hour
basis in the hours of the time zone of the TDY location in order to calculate night differential and
premium pay. If changes in duty status occur during the tour, the AFRC Form 4 must be
completed and will be reviewed and certified by the aircraft commander. Home station and TDY
location dates and times will be used on the AFRC Form 4.
   8.1. When an employee covered by CWS or FWS is scheduled for school, conferences, etc.,
   at home station, the employee will be required to follow a traditional fixed schedule (eight
   hours a day, 40 hours a week) during pay periods of the event unless the event has a CWS or
   FWS as the schedule. If released from the event prior to completing the hours in the
   workday, employee will report to their duty section to complete their work day.
9. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA) are work arrangements in which an
employee regularly performs officially assigned duties at home or other worksites
geographically convenient to the residence of the employee. It is a way of getting work done
from a different location. The agency may offer AWA to employees and employees may request
AWA. All AWA’s require a DD Form 2946, Department of Defense Telework Agreement.
Agreements must be sent to the wing commander through the group commander and civilian
personnel for final approval. The AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet will be used to route the
agreement. The DD Form 2946 and AF Form 1768 will be filed with the timecard.
