                 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA)
  The Freedom of Information Act Program (DoDR 5400.7) allows the general public, including foreign citizens, military
  and civilian personnel acting as private citizens, to request records electronically or in writing from the Federal
  Government. Some records are released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and may
  therefore reflect deletion of some information in accordance with FOIA's nine statutory exemptions or two law
  enforcement record exclusions that can be found on Defense Link and the U.S. Air Force FOIA site. Currently, the law
  allows 20 working days to process a FOIA request upon receipt of the request in the FOIA office.

                                       WHO CAN SUBMIT A FOIA REQUEST?
     Members of the public, including foreign citizens, military and civilian personnel acting as private citizens,
     organizations and businesses, and individual members of the Congress for themselves or constituents, may
     request records in writing. It is important to remember that the Freedom of Information Act applies only to
     federal agencies. It does not create a right of access to records held by Congress, the courts, state or local
     government agencies, or by private businesses or individuals. Each state has its own public access laws that
     should by consulted for access to state and local records.

                          Per DoDR 5400.7/Air Force Supplement (24 June 2002):
     *Air Force-affiliated requesters, to include military and civilian employees, should not use
     government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage, telephones, or official mail channels to make
     FOIA requests.
                                      WHERE TO SUBMIT A FOIA REQUEST?
     FOIA requests for the 6th Air Mobility Wing, MacDill AFB, can be submitted online or in writing and include a
     title or reasonable description of the desired records and a statement on willingness to pay fees for search,
