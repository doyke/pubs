                                            PREFACE

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a
clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan,
manage, and control training within the career field.

     2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.

       2.1.1. Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.

       2.1.2. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and
       responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.

       2.1.3. Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge,
       education, experience, training, and other).

       2.1.4. Section D indicates resource constraints (examples are funds, manpower,
       equipment, and facilities).

       2.1.5. Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

     2.2. Part II includes the following:

       2.2.1. Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks,
       and technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC)-
       conducted training, wartime course, core tasks and correspondence course requirements.

       2.2.2. Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will
       use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements.

       2.2.3. Section C identifies available support materials. Air Force Qualification Training
       Packages (AFQTPs) and CerTest to support both Upgrade Training (UGT) and
       qualification training.

       2.2.4. Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine
       resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional
       courses, and exportable courses.


                                                4
       2.2.5. Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use
       to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.

       2.2.6. Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required
       for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training.

       2.2.7. Unit level supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct
       training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable us
to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.

instructional modules comprised of sharable content objectives in an Internet/Intranet
environment

Advanced Training (AT). A formal courses which provides individuals who are qualified in
one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to
enhance their expertise in the career field. Training is for selected career Airmen at the
advanced level of the AFS.

Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM). An individual on the Air Staff charged with the
responsibility for overseeing all training and career field management aspects of an Air Force
specialty or group of specialties.

Air Force Job Qualification Standard/Command Job Qualification Standard
(AFJQS/CJQS). A comprehensive task list that describes a particular job type or duty position.
Used by supervisors to document task qualifications. The tasks on the AFJQS/CJQS are
common to all persons serving in the described duty position.

Air Force Qualification Training Package (AFQTP). An instructional package designed for
use at the unit to qualify, or aid qualification, in a duty position or program, or on a piece of
equipment. AFQTPs identify the Air Force’s standardized method for performing the task. The
AFQTP may be printed (paper-based), computer-based, or another audiovisual media.

Air Force Training Record (AFTR). Web-based relational database used to track personnel’s
upgrade training requirements. (AFTR replaced COVER Train).

Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR). Facilities, equipment, and basic
infrastructure to support the bed down of deployed forces and aircraft at austere locations; a
critical capability to fielding expeditionary aerospace forces. Resources include tents, field
kitchens, latrine systems, shop equipment, electrical and power systems, runway systems aircraft
shelter, and water systems needed to sustain operations.

Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). A comprehensive, multipurpose
document encapsulating the entire spectrum of education and training for a career field. It
outlines a logical growth plan that includes training resources and is designed to make career
field training identifiable, to eliminate duplication, and to ensure training is budget defensible.

position by the supervisor or work center.

Diamond Tasks (). Diamond tasks are extremely important to the career field. Diamond tasks
are the same as core tasks with one exception--equipment shortfalls at most locations have
created problems with the actual hands-on certification of these tasks. In instances where
required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the task’s AFQTP and passing
the corresponding CerTest is all that is required for upgrade training. Document the AFQTP
documentation record once the AFQTP/CerTest is completed. Document the STS only if hands-
on certification was accomplished. Hands-on certification must be accomplished at the first
opportunity when equipment is available.

                         SECTION A – GENERAL INFORMATION

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field
Managers (AFCFMs), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training
managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career
field training program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in the AFS should receive
in order to develop and progress throughout their careers. The plan identifies initial skills,
upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.

     1.1. Initial skills training. This is the AFS-specific training an individual receives upon
     entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.
     Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.

     1.2. Upgrade training. This identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification
     requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-,
     7-, and 9-skill levels.

     1.3. Qualification training. This is actual hands-on task performance training designed to
     qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and
     after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills and
     knowledge required to do the job.

     1.4. Advanced training. This is formal course that provides individuals who are qualified
     in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills and
     knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field. Training is for selected career
     airmen at the advanced level of the AFS.

     1.5. Proficiency training. This is additional training, either in-residence, or exportable
     advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their
     skills and knowledge beyond the minimum requirements for upgrade.

2. The CFETP has several purposes:

     2.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field
     training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate
     point in an individual’s career.

     2.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty
     and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

     2.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and
     training delivery methods.




                                                 10
     2.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired
     career field training process.

3. Uses. MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training
programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

     3.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and
     exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in
     Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM, Air Force Civil Engineer
     Support Agency Training Division (HQ AFCESA/CEOOF) to develop acquisition
     strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

     3.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
     upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identify requirements that can be satisfied by OJT,
     resident training, contract training, CerTest, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed
     training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan.

     3.3. Unit Education and Training managers and supervisors must ensure each individual
     completes the mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental
     requirements) for the upgrade training specified in this plan.

     3.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this
     plan. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

4. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.
MAJCOM representatives and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure
currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

7. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Pest Management career field.
The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.
The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a
disjointed approach to training. The following decisions were made at the career field
Utilization & Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Sheppard AFB, TX in Nov 2005.

     7.1. Initial Skills Training. The initial skill course was reviewed for content. Additions,
     deletions, and modifications were made to the course. Wartime training tasks were
     identified. Additional contingency training was also identified.

     7.2. Five-Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Existing CDCs were reviewed and
     will be updated to ensure only current material remains and new technology information is
     added.

     7.3. Seven-Level Upgrade Training Requirements. 7-level training requirements were
     reviewed. A new AFSC specific course has been approved for Pest Management
     personnel. The Operational Entomology course must be completed for the award of 7-
     level, effective 01 Sept 05.

     7.4. Proficiency Training.

           7.4.1. The purpose of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum
           upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.

           7.4.2. MAJCOMs must develop a continuation training program that ensures
           individuals in the Pest Management career field receive the necessary training at the
           appropriate point in their careers.

           7.4.3. The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training
           requirements.

     7.5. Supplemental Training. Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and the Training Committee
     reviewed supplemental training courses for technical accuracy and identified training that
     was no longer required. They revalidated the remaining courses as necessary to fully
     support career progression in the AFS.

     7.6. CerTest. The CerTest program is utilized to support transition training and meet DoD
     certification requirements. It is also used to present AFQTP tests and supplement the
     evaluation of OJT.

8. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs. Airmen are
automatically enrolled in the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) when awarded their
primary AFSC. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associates Degree in Applied
Sciences. In addition to its associates degree program, CCAF offers the following:

     8.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification
     training (consisting of the Basic Instructor Course and teaching internship) CCAF
     instructors who posses an associates degree or higher may be nominated by their school
     commander/commandant for certification as an occupational instructor.

     8.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill
     certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The college uses a
     competency-based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency
     levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager).
     All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

                                 CE Badge Heraldry

The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to represent the engineering
profession, in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents the essence of
engineering: applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends. To Air
Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment)
that meshes with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable
the Air Force to perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool historically used
by engineers in designing and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and
compass together symbolize all the diverse specialties within the Air Force Civil
Engineers. Finally, the wings help to portray the fundamental linkage between the
engineering and aviation components; and that the built environment is the foundation
supporting Air Force mission and people.

                                            PART II

                   SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the Pest
Management Apprentice course, with classes beginning 16 Jan 08, and graduating 04 Mar 08.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201v5, this STS:

     2.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common
     tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TRs) necessary for airmen to perform duties
     in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.

     2.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by
     an asterisk (*). As a minimum, trainees must complete all core and critical tasks for
     skill-level upgrade.

          2.2.1. All tasks in the 3 level column are considered wartime tasks. In response to a
          wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined
          training environment.

          2.2.2. Tasks identified by a diamond () in Column 2 are considered contingency
          tasks and are extremely important to the career field. Equipment shortfalls at most
          locations however, have created problems with the actual hands-on certification of
          these tasks. In instances where required equipment is not available for instruction,
          completion of the task’s AFQTP and passing the corresponding CerTest is all that is
          required for upgrade training. Document the AFQTP documentation record once the
          AFQTP/CerTest is completed. Document the STS only if hands-on certification was
          accomplished. Hands-on certification must be accomplished at the first opportunity
          when equipment is available.

     2.3. Provides certification for OJT. Columns 3 is used to record completion of task and
     knowledge training requirements. The CE CFM’s approved automated training record
     AFTR (Air Force Training Record) must be used to document technician qualifications.
     Task certification of core and critical tasks requires a training completion date and initials
     of the trainee, trainer, and certifier. All non-core tasks require training completion dates
     and initials of the trainee and trainer only.

     2.4. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Columns 4A, B,
     and C show the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of
     training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the initial skills
     training course, correspondence course, and read-ahead material. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC
     listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.

     2.5. Qualitative requirements. Attachment 1, the Proficiency Code Key is used to
     indicate the training level and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs.


                                                32
2.6. Becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623,
Individual Training Record, and used IAW AFI 36-2201v3. When used as a JQS, the
following requirements apply:

     2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.

          2.6.1.1. Identify current duty position requirements by circling the
          subparagraph number or letter next to the task statement. Also, all core (*) and
          diamond () tasks should be circled. Document task completion by annotating
          columns 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. NOTE: All entries shall be made in pencil.

          2.6.1.2. Enter the start date of the AFQTP on the AFQTP documentation
          record. Once completed, enter the completion date. When hands-on
          training is started and completed annotate the STS accordingly.

          2.6.1.3. Transcribing to a new CFETP. Transcribing to a new CFETP is an
          administration function, not a re-evaluation of training. Therefore, supervisor
          and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of training. Transcribe
          within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of published date of revised CFETP. Upon
          completion of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe:

               2.6.1.3.1. Use the new CFTEP to identify past and current training
               requirements and to transcribe qualifications from previous CFETP.

               2.6.1.3.2. For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty
               position, circle the number next to the task statement and enter the current
               date in the completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and
               the current task certifier or trainer initials in the trainer column.

               2.6.1.3.3. For tasks previously certified but not required in the current
               duty position (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification
               dates (no initials). If the task later becomes required in the duty position,
               recertify using current dates and initials.

               2.6.1.3.4. Annotate the AF Form 623a, (“I certify the information
               contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated
               XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated
               by the supervisor and trainee).

          2.6.1.4. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the
          supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career
          knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201 V3, Air Force Training Program on Job Training
          Administration and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory
          items specified with the Enlisted Classification Directory.

                 2.6.1.5. De-Certification and Re-Certification. When an airman is found to
                 be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall erase previous certification and
                 enter airman into QT. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A,
                 OJT Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for de-certification. The
                 individual is re-certified using the normal certification process.

           2.6.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. “Go”
           means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local
           requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. This equates to
           a “3c” in the proficiency code key. AFQTPs, shall be used to identify Air Force
           standardized procedures. Local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and use of
           procedures shall be applied accordingly.

     2.7. The STS also serves as a development guide for promotion tests used in the Weighted
     Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in
     their career fields develop Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the USAF Occupational
     Measurement Squadron. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged
     by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.
     Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual
     responsibilities are in Chapter 14 of AFI 36-2606, United States Air Force Reenlistment,
     Retention, and NCO Status Programs. WAPS is not applicable to ANG/AFRC personnel.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.

                       (This section used when developing lesson plans)

4. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

     4.1. Written Test (W). Used to sample each knowledge objective and the
     knowledge components of performance objectives.

     4.2. Performance Test (P). Used under specified conditions in a formal testing mode to
     measure student accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching-learning
     activity has been completed.

     4.3. Progress Checks (PC). Administered by the instructor during classroom or laboratory
     instruction time to assess the student’s accomplishment of knowledge or performance
     objectives.

5. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance
measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.
Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be
required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means
the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task
(partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

7. Course Objective List. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of
Instruction.

     7.1. Initial Skills Course. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be
     obtained by written request to 366 TRS/TRR, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB, TX

8. AFQTPS.

    8.1. Air Force Qualification Training Packages. An instructional package designed for
    trainees to qualify on core or diamond tasks. AFQTP’s are the standardized method for
    performing the task. The AFQTP may be printed (paper-based), computer-based, or in
    other audiovisual media. See the AFCESA web pages for up-to-date AFQTPs at:
    HQ AFCESA/CEOOF portal website

    8.2. CerTest

     8.2.1. CerTest, a computer-based evaluation program ensures skilled craftsmen are
     available to meet the Air Force’s changing needs. It enhances OJT and QT training by
     testing and evaluating an individual's knowledge of the principles and procedures in
     each specialty.

         8.2.1.1. CerTest contains tests used to evaluate task knowledge received through
         different media such as: paper products, videotapes, and computer–based programs.

         8.2.1.2. The CerTest program contains mandatory tests, required for upgrade. All
         diamond () coded tasks on the STS have a corresponding mandatory CerTest.

         8.2.1.3. CerTest is also a powerful training management tool. It can be used to find
         the strengths and weaknesses in an individual's training and experience. CerTest
         automatically records and updates all test results. The training manager can copy
         records to a disk so that an individual can bring current, accurate training
         information to a new unit; thereby helping the gaining supervisor evaluate the
         trainee's knowledge and experience.

    8.3. CerTest also enables unit personnel to develop site-specific tests. These custom-made
    tests standardize testing on tasks unique to a specific duty station and/or assignment. The
    program contains a graphics library that may be used along with a menu-driven test editor
    to develop these site-specific tests.

    8.4. CerTest also contains optional CDC pre-evaluation tools. Volume review exercises
    are available for progress checks after each volume is completed. After all volumes are
    completed in a set, the trainee may take the course review exercise before taking the final
    End of Course exam at the base training office. Commanders are encouraged to integrate
    these tools in their unit’s OJT program.

    8.5. CerTest is the CE platform for electronic CDC testing. Currently, all CE AFS's are
    allowed to use AFIADL’s CerTest on installations where Base Test Control Facilities
    (TCFs) are equipped. See your UETM for further information.

    8.6. The mandatory AFQTP CerTest are listed in each AFQTP, if required.

                         SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING

15. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and training
sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Prime BEEF forces will train to
meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges from
knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom (CAT 1), to task-oriented hands-on (CAT II)
training conducted in the field. These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in
AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force Program.

    15.1. Home Station Training (HST). HST is training that is conducted at the individual’s
    home station for contingency operations. The Civil Engineer CE Commander ensures
    training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct
    training as required. HST requirements fall into two categories, CAT I and CAT II.

           15.1.1. Category I (CAT-I) Training. Personnel assigned to base level CE units will
           receive initial and refresher training in all CAT I topics as shown in AFI 10-210,
           Chapter 4, Attachment 2. Units will use Readiness Training Packages, Qualification
           Training Packages, CD, web-based, videos, and AF CE standardized lesson plans to
           present the material. MAJCOMs may develop and require other training materials to
           accomplish knowledge-based training.

                   15.1.1.1. Prime BEEF Orientation/General Contingency. Upon assignment
                   to the unit, all CE military and emergency-essential civilian employees will be
                   trained on the unit’s Prime BEEF and Emergency Management missions. The
                   training will emphasize the individual’s role and how they fit into the program.
                   It includes an overview of CE Doctrine and explains the organization, training,
                   equipment, operating concepts, and contingency missions pertaining to the unit.

                   15.1.1.2. General Contingency Responsibilities (GCR) Web-based CBT.
                   Personnel receive annual credit for CAT I training through completion of
                   GCR/CBT. Use of this product has become critical in light of recent reductions
                   in technical Prime BEEF training and education. All airmen should complete
                   this course within 90 days upon arrival at their first duty station (6 months for
                   ARC members) and for annual recurring CAT I training requirements.
                   https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp?kc_ident=kc0005

           15.1.2. Category II (CAT-II) Training. CAT II training is primarily hands-on
           training as outlined in AFI 10-210, Chapter 4, Attachment 3. Units must make every
           effort to incorporate realism into their respective CAT II training programs. Field gear
           (to include primary weapons) will be used during training requirements such as,
           personal/work party security, convoy operations, defensive fighting positions, etc.




                                                 53
             15.1.2.1. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an
             integral part of any CAT II HST program. Lessons learned from operations
             such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught us the importance of maintaining a
             higher level of combat readiness. Although the inclusion of combat skills-
             focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high
             threat combat environment, the steps taken to enhance CAT II training will help
             elevate units to a readiness level capable of supporting safe and effective
             operations in low to medium risk combat environments.

             15.1.2.2. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime or
             contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique
             mission-essential equipment the Civil Engineers do not use in their day-to-day
             operations. Due to the cost and complexity, mission essential contingency
             equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found in CONUS.
             Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their
             CFEPT. AFI 10-210, Tables 4.1- 4.6 identifies minimum personnel to be
             trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and locations of training sites.
             Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air
             Force contingency operations.

      15.1.3. Category III (CAT III) Training. Team Training Venues

             15.1.3.1. Silver Flag Exercise Sites (CAT III). Silver Flag Exercise Sites are
             located at Tyndall AFB, FL; Ramstein AB, Germany; and Kadena AB, Japan
             and conduct CAT III training with their major focus on students being able to
             perform critical contingency tasks in a team environment. The training
             focuses on bare base beddown and sustainment operations using hands-on
             training with BEAR equipment in a realistic beddown environment. Where
             possible, combat skills training has been added to the curriculum to ensure
             realism and help fortify combat skills mentality amongst teams. All CE
             personnel who fill Unit Type Code (UTC) positions will receive team training
             at Silver Flag Exercise Sites with the exception of members on headquarters
             staff augmentation, pavement evaluation, and generator repair and
             maintenance UTCs.
