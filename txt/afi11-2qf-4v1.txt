1.4. Training. Training programs are designed to progress aircrews from Initial Qualification Training
(IQT), then to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify aircrews in a basic position and flying
   duties without regard to a unit’s mission.
   1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to upgrade aircrews to Mission Capable (MC) status.
   1.4.3. CT provides the training necessary to maintain aircrews proficiency in unit specific missions.
       1.4.3.1. Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary to carry out the unit’s
       assigned missions that are not required by every aircrew and consists of upgrade training such as
       Flight Lead, Instructor, Remote Controller upgrade, etc.

1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of proficiency consistent with
   flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against aircrew
   capabilities and safety. This instruction provides training guidelines and policies for use with opera-
   tional procedures specified in applicable flying/operations publications.
6                                                                     AFI11-2QFV1 1 OCTOBER 2003


    1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training programs
    when/where tasked by the HQ ACC/DO. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training program
    support to the HQ ACC/DO. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS.
    1.5.3. Training missions will be designed to achieve proficiency in unit-tasked roles and enhance mis-
    sion accomplishment and safety. It is imperative that full-scale aerial target (FSAT) pilots receive suf-
    ficient uncoupled, hands-on flying to achieve a high state of basic transition, instrument, and
    formation proficiency.
    1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
       1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to
       accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruc-
       tion to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor may be required.
       1.5.4.2. IPs and FL-qualified SQ supervisors may allow any pilot to lead limited portions of a
       mission if appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used to allow the pilot to practice
       events in which he is already qualified or to help determine if the pilot is ready for upgrade. In
       either case, the IP or SQ supervisor is responsible for the flight.
    1.5.5. Aircrew proficiency and competence varies and must be closely monitored at the unit level to
    ensure progression from basic skills to coupled flight. Unit commanders must ensure that training pro-
    grams consider local conditions and individual capabilities to maximize training continuity. Effective
    training is founded on aircrew confidence in basic skills such as transition, formation, and instru-
    ments. Training managers must ensure training programs include regular, recurring exposure to
    fighter flying fundamentals.
    1.5.6. Aircrews will not be required to accomplish ground and/or ancillary training except as required
    by this instruction or other Air Force policy directives.
    1.5.7. The aircrew training cycle is 12 months; 1 October through 30 September. Units will complete
    training requirements during the appropriate training cycle unless specifically exempted.

1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management: N/A.

1.7. Training Sortie Program Development: N/A.

1.8. Training Records and Reports:
    1.8.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
       1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.
       1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
       1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
       1.8.1.4. AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
       1.8.1.5. AFM 171-190V2, Sections A through K.
    1.8.2. Track the following information for all aircrews (as applicable):
       1.8.2.1. Ground training.
AFI11-2QFV1 1 OCTOBER 2003                                                                                  7


       1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishments of individual sorties and events cumulatively for the
       training cycle.
       1.8.2.3. Currencies.
   1.8.3. Units will fill in ARMS with either the date of the last FTU or USAFWS equivalent training
   accomplished or the unit mission certification date.

1.9. Armament Recording: N/A.

1.10. Aircrew Utilization Policy:
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure that aircrews (API-1/6s) fill authorized positions IAW unit manning
   documents and that crew status is properly designated. The overall objective is that aircrews perform
   flying related duties. Supervisors may assign aircrews to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/
   mishap board member, etc.) but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew
   tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.10.2. Duties required by various regulations that may be assigned to CAF API-1 aircrews are weap-
   ons and tactics officer, programmer, flying safety officer, SOF, mobility/contingency plans, training
   (except AFMS documentation), SQ Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer (SELO), squadron
   life support officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. In
   some instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, API-1s may be attached to the wing.
   API-1s will not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing aircrew API-1
   manning is 100 percent or better. CCs will ensure wing staff aircrews (API-3/6s) perform duties justi-
   fied in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.

1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.11.1. Inexperienced aircrews should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced aircrews.
   1.11.2. Priority for sortie allocation should be requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required
   to prepare for assigned projects/programs/taskings, IQT/MQT, instructor upgrade, and MC training
   requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions.

1.12. Waiver Authority:
   1.12.1. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver authority for require-
   ments of this volume is the group commander. This waiver is on a case by case basis considering the
   experience level of the individual aircrew.
   1.12.2. Units will submit a summary of all locally waived requirements. This report will be sent
   directly to ACC/DOT on or before 31 October of each year.

2.1. General: This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of aircrews into the QF-4 air-
craft. IQT will be conducted using the local upgrade transition/requalification training course outlines
specified in this instruction. Tailor ground training to individual background and experience; however,
use available phase manuals, texts, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs as supporting material to
the maximum extent possible.
    2.1.1. Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading crewmember to complete an aircraft
    qualification and instrument evaluation IAW AFI 11-2F/QF-4V2.
    2.1.2. Initial/requalification flight training for colonel selectees and above requires HQ ACC/DO
    approval.

2.2. Approval/Waiver for IQT:
    2.2.1. Waivers to the mission outline requirements must be submitted to 53 WEG/CC for approval.
    When requesting a waiver to mission outline, include the following:
       2.2.1.1. Summary of individual's flying experience.
       2.2.1.2. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.1.3. Exceptions requested, with rationale.

2.3. Prerequisites: Prerequisites will be IAW this volume and AFJI 10-220 (if appropriate).
    2.3.1. Military pilots entering training will have 1000 FP/MP/IP hours in either the F-4 or other high
    performance jet fighters. Pilots lacking high performance jet fighter time but who have flown the
    (A)T-38 as an instructor may be considered, subject to 53 WEG/CC approval.
    2.3.2. Civilian contractor aircrews entering training will meet the prerequisites and minimum qualifi-
    cations as contained in AFJI 10-220. In addition:
       2.3.2.1. Civilian contractor aircrews with no prior F-4 experience will meet the requirements for
       experienced aircrews (IAW paragraph 2.3.1. above).
       2.3.2.2. Civilian contractors will forward request for government training IAW procedures out-
       lined in AFJI 10-220.

2.4. Ground Training: The government flight representative (GFR) will direct contractor academic
instructors to develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission. Academic training
will be completed and documented in the aircrew's training folder prior to beginning flying training. Since
QF-4 simulators do not exist, cockpit familiarization and emergency procedures training will be accom-
plished in a cockpit procedures trainer or static aircraft.
AFI11-2QFV1 1 OCTOBER 2003                                                                               9


2.5. Flying Training:
   2.5.1. Complete training within 60 calendar days of the beginning of training. Failure to complete
   within the specified time requires notification to the 53 WEG/CC with aircrew name and rank, reason
   for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.5.2. Aircrews in IQT will fly under IP supervision (dual or chased) until completion of the qualifi-
   cation check ride. If the trainee is flying solo, he must remain in VMC conditions throughout the mis-
   sion. Dedicated formation sorties may be flown by MC QF-4 pilots in support of IQT formation
   missions if an IP occupies the trainee’s RCP. In this case, remaining VMC is not required.
   2.5.3. Fly TR-1 through TR-4 in sequence. TR-1 through TR-3 require a two-seat aircraft with an IP
   in the rear cockpit.
   2.5.4. TR-1 through TR-10 will be flown for pilots without previous experience in the F-4.
   2.5.5. For aircrews with previous F-4 experience, proficiency advancement may be authorized in
   writing by the unit CC. The following missions may be proficiency advanced during IQT: TR-2 Tran-
   sition, TR-6 Formation, TR-8 Formation and Aerobatics, and TR-9 Instruments.
   2.5.6. Dual Seat Aircraft. It is highly desirable to accomplish training with two-seat type aircraft for
   TR-7, 9 and 10. When using two-seat aircraft, touch-and-go landings may be practiced provided the
   IP is on board. However, if two-seat aircraft are not available the missions may be flown with the IP
   in a chase aircraft.
   2.5.7. Aircraft Configuration. Configuration for all transition and instrument upgrade sorties will be
   symmetrical.
   2.5.8. Night Requirements. Night IQT training is not required for QF-4 pilots. However, if night oper-
   ations are required, the pilot must have flown a precision approach within 30 days and a day landing
   within 21 days.
   2.5.9. IQT Syllabus Missions. (NOTE: All IQT training sorties without an IP in the student’s aircraft
   will be conducted under VMC).

                                MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General: This chapter outlines training requirements to upgrade an aircrew qualified in the unit air-
craft to MC status. A pilot is considered mission capable after completing SP-5, however he may not per-
form drone chase duties until completing DC-1 and DC-2 (unless DC-2 is proficiency advanced).
LASDT-1 is optional, based on local mission requirements.
     3.1.1. MQT training requirements in this section are for upgrading a QF-4 pilot to formation flight
     lead, drone chase and safety pilot for captive missions. The MQT program should be individually tai-
     lored based on the MQT student’s previous F-4 experience, total flying time, currency, documented
     performance and formal training.
     3.1.2. A minimum of 25 hours of F-4 flying time (from IQT entry) is required before beginning the
     safety pilot portion of MQT for pilots with no previous F-4 experience.
     3.1.3. During academic and flying training, special emphasis should be placed on remote-control sys-
     tems, coupled flight, AHC, transition to instruments, spatial disorientation, effects of task saturation,
     G onset, and conditions leading to/ effects of GLOC.
     3.1.4. MQT will be completed within 60 calendar days after the individual's completion of IQT (or
     from date of arrival on station if already F-4 current). Failure to complete within specified time inter-
     val requires notification to 53 WEG/CC with aircrew name and rank, reason for delay, planned
     actions, and estimated completion date.
     3.1.5. Upon completion of MQT, pilot may be certified flight lead qualified by the Squadron CC or a
     designated representative. This will be documented on the unit letter of X’s.

3.2. Ground Training: The GFR will direct contractor academic instructors to develop blocks of
instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission.

3.3. Flying Training:
     3.3.1. Supervision: IP supervision required unless specified otherwise.
     3.3.2. Sortie Requirements: DC-1, and SP-1 through SP-4 are mandatory unless pilot is a previous
     safety pilot. SP-5 is an AF Form 8 initial mission evaluation IAW AFI 11-2F/QF-4V2.
        3.3.2.1. SP-6 is required for all Holloman AFB FSAT pilots and for Tyndall-based pilots before
        flying at Holloman AFB as a safety pilot, unless they have flown at least two of the SP sorties at
        Holloman.
        3.3.2.2. DC-2 is optional if all events were accomplished on DC-1.
        3.3.2.3. Normal syllabus flow is SP-1 through SP-5, then DC-1 and DC-2 (if required). SP-2
        through SP-4 may be flown in any order.
        3.3.2.4. LASDT-1 is required before a pilot may fly LOWAT.

                                     CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General: This chapter outlines annual training requirements for QF-4 aircrews. Refer to Chapter 5,
Specialized Training, for additional program specifics. Civilian contractor pilots should refer to AFJI
10-220 for additional requirements. Aircrews must be qualified IAW AFI 11-2F/QF-4V2 and have com-
pleted MQT to be MC, and eligible to enter continuation training.

4.2. Ground Training: Ground training will be accomplished IAW Table 4.1.. Waiver authority for the
ground training specified is IAW the reference directive. This list is intended as a single source reference.
Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Ground training accomplished dur-
ing IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accom-
plished. The programs in Table 4.1. comprise ground training only. Chapter 5 contains specialized
programs with both flying and ground training requirements.
NOTE: Mobility Ground Training as well as Chemical Warfare Defense Training, Verification Training,
Weapons/Tactics Academics, and Intelligence Training do not apply due to the non-mobility status of air-
crews.
   4.2.1. Physiological Training. IAW AFI 11-403 and MAJCOM supplements.
   4.2.2. Instrument Refresher Course. IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course (IRC)
   Program, and MAJCOM supplements.
   4.2.3. Life Support. Includes egress, ejection, hanging harness, wet drill, personal survival equip-
   ment, and local survival IAW MAJCOM life support directives.
   4.2.4. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
       4.2.4.1. This training is not an evaluation but a review of abnormal/emergency procedures and
       aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One aircrew/controller should
       present a situation and another should discuss actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and
       carry it to a logical conclusion. Critical action procedures (if applicable) and squadron special
       interest items should be emphasized. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT
       training programs:
           4.2.4.1.1. SQ/CC or SQ/DO involvement in the selection of monthly SEPT topic.
           4.2.4.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using F-4 mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
           4.2.4.1.3. Discuss at least two EPs for each phase of flight during the SEPT session.
           4.2.4.1.4. Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or squadron supervisor to
           include min fuel and emergency divert training.
       4.2.4.2. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month. Failure to accomplish by the
       end of the month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
   4.2.5. US/Russia Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities. Initial and annual refresher train-
   ing for the prevention of Dangerous Military Activities will be conducted to ensure that all aircrews
   are familiar with the agreement and the implementing provisions contained in CJCS 2311.01. The
16                                                                 AFI11-2QFV1 1 OCTOBER 2003


     procedures for the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities between the U.S. and Russia are
     located in the Flight Information Handbook.

4.3. Mission Capable (MC) Requirements:
   4.3.1. All pilots will accomplish the minimum requirements as shown in Table 4.2. as applicable.
   Failure to accomplish these requirements will not affect MC status but will require additional training
   as determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.3.2. Pilots are not authorized to fly tactical events until having accomplished a checkout program
   tailored to the event, approved by the 53 WEG/CC. If appropriate, event minimums and currencies
   will be established and tracked as part of the checkout program.
   4.3.3. Pilot Proficiency (PP) sortie minimum requirements (single-ship or formation): AHC/aerobatic
   maneuvers or formation equivalent, TACAN penetration, 2x instrument approaches (lead), VFR pat-
   terns (weather permitting) and touch and go landings.

   paragraph 5.3.
   4.4.2. FS flying rates and requirements will be IAW AFPD 11-4 and AFI 11-401.

4.5. Currencies/Recurrencies:
   4.5.1. Currency. Table 4.3. defines currency requirements for all QF-4 aircrews. If a pilot loses a par-
   ticular currency, that sortie/event may not be performed except for regaining currency with the appro-
   priate level of supervision IAW Table 4.3.. Landing, and PP sortie currency expiration are
   “grounding” items until currency is regained.
   4.5.2. “Experienced” for QF-4 pilot currency purposes is defined as: IQT/MQT complete and: 500 F/
   QF-4 FP/MP/IP hours, or 1000 total hours plus 200 F/QF-4 hours, or 600 total hours plus 300 F/QF-4
   hours, or previously fighter experienced plus 100 QF-4 hours.

NOTES:
     1. Non-demanding sorties are instruments, PP, VFR navigation (at or above 1000 feet AGL).
       2. Recurrency supervision level is IP in the aircraft/chase, qualified and current in event.
       3. Pilots will not perform a night landing unless a day landing has been accomplished within 21
          days and a precision approach has been flown within 30 days.
       4. IP RCP landing recurrency requires current and qualified pilot in the FCP.
       5. LOWAT recurrency requires a LOWAT current and qualified IP/SQ Supervisor in the RCP or
          chase.
       6. Recurrency supervision level is a current and qualified IP/ SQ Supervisor in the RCP or in the
          element.
       7. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
       8. To regain currency, fly a drone chase event (takeoff and/or landing) with a current and quali-
          fied IP/SQ supervisor in the aircraft or in the element.
       9. To regain currency, fly a PP sortie IAW para 4.3.3. with a current/qualified IP/SQ supervisor
          in the RCP or in the element.

4.6. End of Cycle Requirements: Aircrews who fail to complete sortie and/or event requirements of
this instruction at the end of the training cycle will either meet PQI action IAW AFPD 11-4 and AFI
11-401, be regressed to MQT status, or be removed from flying status depending on the particular cur-
rency requirements and circumstances for non-currency. Refer to paragraph 4.7. to see if some of these
requirements can be prorated.

4.7. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements: At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorate
all training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, COT leaves, or non-flying TDY/exercises pre-
clude training for a portion of the training period. Normal annual leave will not be considered as
non-availability. Extended bad weather, which precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecu-
tive days may be considered as non-availability. The following guidelines apply:
AFI11-2QFV1 1 OCTOBER 2003                                                                             19


   4.7.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability and
   not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.7.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying in the training cycle. Use
   Table 4.4. to determine the number of months to be prorated based on the cumulative number of cal-
   endar days the aircrew was not available for flying during the training cycle.
   4.7.3. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower whole
   number; however, no requirement may be prorated below one.
   4.7.4. Newly assigned/converted aircrews and aircrews achieving MC after the 15th of the month are
   considered to be CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes.
   4.7.5. An aircrew’s last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided 1 month’s
   proration is not exceeded.

           IAW AFI 11-2F/QF-4V2 and unit requirements.

5.5. Instruments: During selected SEPT sessions (at the discretion of the unit), pilots will review lost
wingman procedures, recognition and recovery from spatial disorientation, proper instrument
cross-check, and transition from visual to instrument conditions. An instrument approach may only be
logged when the approach is flown successfully to pilot or published minimums.

5.6. Remote Controller Initial Qualification Training: Contractors will develop a training syllabus to
support training of remote controllers for the systems in which they will be qualified. The training sylla-
bus will be published in the Contractor Procedures and approved by the GFR IAW AFJI 10-220.
   5.6.1. Initial Qualification Training. To enter FCS/MCS controller training, one of the following is
   required:
       5.6.1.1. Qualified as a pilot in an FSAT (current or previously qualified).
       5.6.1.2. 500 hours flying time in high performance jet aircraft.
       5.6.1.3. Previously qualified as a FSAT remote controller.
   5.6.2. Approval Authority. The GFR is the approval authority for contractor personnel to enter into
   drone controller training. The GFR will sign the Certificate of Qualification as the Approving Official
   signifying government acceptance of the drone controller once the controller qualification evaluation
   is completed. A drone controller must be qualified and accepted by the government prior to control-
   ling a NULLO mission.
   5.6.3. Initial Qualification Training Events. As a minimum, training will include the following:
       5.6.3.1. Ground Phase. Complete syllabus ground school covering the aircraft, command teleme-
       try system, drone control systems (principles, operations, capabilities, communications, limita-
       tions), pre-mission profile planning, recording equipment, MCS equipment and interface.
       5.6.3.2. Flying Phase. Missions will encompass training on equipment preflight and checkout,
       takeoff, handover procedures, drone profile procedures, concentrated emergency procedures, and
       degraded systems training.
           5.6.3.2.1. FCS controllers (manned missions) will complete a minimum of 3 simulators, 3
           manned missions and 2 maintenance wiggles before certification as a manned FCS controller.
           5.6.3.2.2. FCS controllers (NULLO missions) will complete 10 training missions as controller
           of a manned FSAT aircraft and a minimum of 2 NULLO pre-mission/destruct checks/bomb
           loads before certification as a NULLO FCS controller.
           5.6.3.2.3. FCS controllers, not proficient/qualified within 20 training missions or failing to
           pass the flight check, will be evaluated by the GFR and a contractor representative for removal
           or continuation.
           5.6.3.2.4. MCS controllers will complete a minimum of 2 remote controlled takeoffs and 45
           remote-controlled landings before certification.
24                                                                    AFI11-2QFV1 1 OCTOBER 2003


            5.6.3.2.5. MCS controllers, not proficient/qualified within 150 remote-controlled landings or
            failing to pass the flight check, will be evaluated by the GFR and a contractor representative
            for removal from or continuation in training status.
        5.6.3.3. Evaluation. Complete an emergency procedures examination and remote-control evalua-
        tion flight check that includes realistic drone profile procedures and a realistic evaluation of con-
        troller reaction to emergency conditions. A designated controller evaluator will conduct the
        evaluation flight check. Annual qualification and emergency procedures examinations are
        required of all remote controllers.

5.7. Remote Controller Continuation Training:
     5.7.1. Ground Training. Ground training accomplished during controller IQT may be credited toward
     CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
     5.7.2. Remote Control Situational Emergency Procedures Training. SEPT will be completed monthly
     IAW paragraph 4.2.1.
     5.7.3. CRM for controllers will be completed biennially IAW paragraph 4.2.6.
     5.7.4. Remote Controller Flight Training. The following remote control minimum requirements are to
     be accomplished annually:
     5.7.5. Controllers delinquent in any of the annual requirements will accomplish corrective measures
     as directed by the FSAT operations manager or GFR.
     5.7.6. Remote controllers whose currency lapses for more than 90 days will complete a minimum of
     five missions prior to being certified as requalified. If currency lapses for more than 180 days, IQT
     will be reaccomplished.
     5.7.7. The contractor will document all remote-controller training events accomplished in the same
     manner as AFJI 10-220 flying requirements.

NOTES:
     1. Landings may be touch-and-gos or full-stops.
      2. Recurrency for MCS controllers in preparation for a NULLO mission requires sufficient cap-
         tive FSAT touch-and-go landings to meet the three remote controlled landings in 15 days cur-
         rency requirement.
      3. FCS controllers may use simulators to fulfill this requirement.
      4. Recurrency for FCS controllers requires demonstration of proficiency in FCS profiles to the
         GFR or Contractor Flight Operations Supervisor.
