SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
corrects administrative and typographical errors throughout the text. This document changes all
references from Security Police to Security Forces with exception to those referring to the
Security Police Shield. This document includes the Security Forces general orders to represent
three basic orders all security personnel must follow in performace of their duties. Changes the
section responsible for evaulation of SF equipment to HQ AFSFC/SFXR and adds the term
Allowance Source Code (ASC) to the acquisition process. The document adds what is a standard
requirement for security forces vehicles to include equipment to be contained within the vehicle.
This includes video systems contained within SF vehicles, which must be approved by
MAJCOM SFs. Additionally, the Installation SJA must coordinate in writing, on the use,
presentation, securing and disposition of recorded data obtained by video system. This
document also expands on the definition and responsibilities of guardmount and installation
entry control. This document identifies the requirement for each SF unit to establish a SF duty
officer program. That SF SNCOs and Officers will be appointed to perform post checks, observe
exercises, inspect equipment/ facilities, and provide feedback, in writing, to the commander on
unit readiness and areas of concern. This document expands on jurisdictional sources that
provided SF members jurisdiction, limitations and liability of the laws they are entrusted to
enforce. Information and the approval process is also included regarding the authority of
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                                                 3


deputization by state and local governments of uniformed law enforcement personnel under the
authority of the Air Force, including Security Forces, civilian police, and/or security guards.
This document includes Non-lethal weapon information and that the installation Chief of
Security Forces will ensure that Security Forces members armed with the handgun, as a primary
duty weapon will also carry at least one non-lethal weapon. Because of its effectiveness to and
ensure all tools are available to SF members the kneeling search is included as an authorized
search method for subjects unable to stand or for safety purposes. All references to the Air Force
Law Enforcement Terminal system were removed and replaced by the National Law
Enforcement Terminal System (NLETS) and National Crime Information Center (NCIC), which
are access systems to computerized law enforcement data. They allow the prompt exchange of
law enforcement information between Security Forces and other law enforcement officials. This
document also recommends the installation Chief of Security Forces authorize NCIC checks for
all visitors entering the installation and if NCIC is not used to screen visitors, the installation
Chief of Security Forces should implement a policy so that the screening is done based on set,
non-discriminatory criteria, similar to Installation Entry Point Checks. This document defines
responsibilities for high-risk incidents, including those of federal, state and local government and
the installation commander and installation Chief of Security Forces. This document
incorporated changes to the Security Forces After Action Report program and identifies
requirements when providing an after action report.

                                           Chapter 2

                            SECURITY FORCES PERSONNEL

2.1. Security Forces Code of Conduct. Here are general guidelines for SF performance:
   2.1.1. Exercising Authority. On-duty Security Forces and DAF civilian police and guards,
   are the visible representatives of the US Government, the Air Force, the installation
   commander, and the installation Chief of Security Forces. It is the duty of Security Forces to
   accept the authority entrusted to them and to use the authority impartially, firmly, and in a
   manner that commands respect from the public.
   2.1.2. Professional Demeanor. The enforcement of laws and regulations brings Security
   Forces and DAF civilian police and guards into direct contact with the public. Treat
   everyone in a dignified and respectful manner.
   2.1.3. Personal Appearance. Maintain a high standard of appearance IAW AFI 36-2903,
   Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel. Set the example for all to follow.
   2.1.4. Personal Attitudes. Perform duties in an impartial, just, friendly, and helpful manner.
   The Air Force does not tolerate discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin,
   or sex.
   2.1.5. Assistance to Others. Render assistance to the public. Promptly assist any injured
       or ill individuals.
   2.1.6. Attention to Duty. Remain mindful of duty commitments. Do not consume any form
   of intoxicant while on duty or within eight hours of a duty tour. Remain alert and vigilant on
   post at all times.
   2.1.7. Seeking Favors. Do not seek personal advantage through status as a Security Forces
   member. Don't try to gain favor or popularity by showing favoritism, overlooking violations,
   or otherwise failing to enforce the law. In addition, SF personnel cannot accept any
   advantage, gratuity, or reward for performing official duties.
   2.1.8. Punishment of Offenders. Security Forces have the authority only to apprehend or
   detain, based on probable cause, but not to punish offenders. Use discretion to correct,
   caution, or warn someone for minor violations of the law, but do not admonish or reprimand.
   2.1.9. Apprehension of Suspects. Protect the health and welfare of all apprehended suspects.
   Use force according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel. The
   USAF will not tolerate the intentional or negligent mistreatment of apprehended suspects.
   Do not use abusive, profane, or insulting language toward a suspect or show disregard for the
   suspect's valuables, personal property, or physical well being.
   2.1.10. Dealing with Intoxicated Persons. Security Forces will apprehend individuals that
   appear to be intoxicated. Make every effort to avoid verbal and physical confrontations.
   2.1.11. Off Duty Conduct. Security Forces must remain above reproach, including in their
   off-duty conduct.
   2.1.12. Protection of Privacy. Security Forces must protect private information. Do not
   discuss offenses or incidents, except in the line of duty.
 10                                            AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


2.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Security Forces duties and responsibilities vary greatly by
installation and post. Each installation Chief of Security Forces will define the duties and limits
of Security Forces posts, in local duty or post instructions. The three basic Security Forces
General Orders are always the same. They are:
   2.2.1. I will take charge of my post and protect personnel and property for which I am
   responsible until properly relieved.
   2.2.2. I will report all violations of orders I am entrusted to enforce and will call my superior
   in any case not covered by instructions.
   2.2.3. I will sound the alarm in case of disorder or emergency.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                         11


                                          Chapter 3

                    SECURITY FORCES DRESS AND EQUIPMENT

3.1. General Information. Security Forces must wear a distinctive uniform for quick
identification. Because Security Forces are constantly in the "public eye," they must set the
highest standard of dress and appearance. AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air
Force Personnel, contains guidance on proper wear of Security Forces uniforms.
3.2. The Security Police Shield. Only uniformed Security Forces members wear the Security
Police shield. Do not abuse this symbol of authority. AFI 31-206, Security Forces
Investigations Program, establishes procedures for display of the shield by Security Forces
investigators not in uniform. The following guidelines apply to the issue and wear of the
Security Police shield:
   3.2.1. Issue metallic shields IAW Table of Allowance (TA) 016, Table of Allowances for
   Special Purpose Clothing and Personal Equipment.
   3.2.2. The Security Police shield is considered a controlled item and will be safeguarded and
   monitored when issuing.
   3.2.3. Reissue serviceable shields.
   3.2.4. Wear the metallic shield only on the blue uniform combinations.
   3.2.5. Security Forces members who are retraining or separating from the service will turn-in
   their Security Forces shield to the installation Chief of Security Forces.
   3.2.6. The installation Chief of Security Forces may elect to present the shield to retiring
   Security Forces or the next of kin to Security Forces who die while on active duty.
   3.2.7. As the Air Force specialty most closely associated with the enforcement of good order
   and discipline on an installation, Security Forces Airmen and DAF civilian police and guards
   of all grades must set the example for others to follow on/off duty. The conduct of Security
   Forces members must be above reproach at all times. Should a member’s on- or off-duty
   conduct not conform to this standard and have the chain of command question the
   individual’s trustworthiness to execute the authorities vested in that individual, the
   commander may temporarily or permanently prohibit the member from wearing the Security
   Police shield and beret. Grounds for removal of the shield, beret, and Force Protection
   qualification badge include violations of the SF Code to include the (Chapter 2). This action
   is not punishment; however, it may be associated with administrative, non-judicial, or
   judicial action. NOTE: To permanently remove an Airman’s AF Specialty Code,
   commanders should refer to AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program, para 4.3.
3.3. Force Protection Function Badge. Chiefs of Security Forces may authorize persons in
their command to wear this badge. HAF/A7S may authorize appropriate persons to wear the
badge. Award this badge to military personnel who acquire certain skill levels and demonstrate
honorable service in the Security Forces career field. Award the badge according to AFI 36-
2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
 12                                         AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


   3.3.1. Allied nation, other US service, and other USAF personnel performing instructor or
   liaison duty with an Air Force Security Forces organization wear the qualification badge
   commensurate with time requirements listed in AFI 36-2903.
   3.3.2. Airmen assigned to the US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) or ANG are eligible for
   award of the qualification badge.
   3.3.3. Once approved, present the badge at an appropriate ceremony.
   3.3.4. The installation CSF may rescind the badge anytime the bearer loses their Security
   Forces AFSC for misconduct.
3.4. Resources and Equipment. HQ AFSFC/SFXR identifies and evaluates commercially
available and government-developed equipment necessary to support Service-wide needs for
Security Forces personnel. SFXR:
   3.4.1. Serves as the central point of contact for Security Forces logistics and requirements
   throughout the Air Force.
   3.4.2. Disseminates Security Forces equipment information, test reports, and material
   deficiencies.
   3.4.3. Monitors new and emerging technologies for Security Forces applications.
   3.4.4. Manages, monitors, or provides approval authority, as appropriate, for the following
   Allowance Source Code (ASC) dealing with Security Forces equipment:
      3.4.4.1. ASC 001 -- Master Equipment Management Index.
      3.4.4.2. ASC 002 -- Monthly Allowance Notice (Update).
      3.4.4.3. ASC 009 -- Small Computers and Equipment.
      3.4.4.4. ASC 012 -- Vehicles.
      3.4.4.5. ASC 016 -- Clothing.
      3.4.4.6. ASC 538 -- Security Forces Equipment (General) and Weapons.
      3.4.4.7. ASC 629 -- Audio Visual.
      3.4.4.8. ASC 660 -- Communications Equipment.
   3.4.5. SFXR conducts a semi-annual Air Force Security Forces Equipment Weapons
   Configuration Board (ECBW) to update equipment listings, provide a forum to work
   Security Forces-related equipment problems and issues, and work logistics detail issues with
   MAJCOM Security Forces staff representatives.
3.5. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Systems. The LMR system is the primary means of
communication used to control Security Forces operations. MAJCOMs determine requirements
for "secure voice" equipment (refer to AFI 31-101, Integrated Base Defense for further
information).
   3.5.1. Security Forces use standard practices to ensure the radio net operates smoothly
   during normal and emergency situations. Do not use slang language. Military radio
   transmissions must comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             13


   The Allied Communication Publication (ACP) 125 (F), dated 5 September 2001, prescribes
   procedures for Security Forces using two-way radios.
       3.5.1.1. The FCC regulates communications by wire and radio.                 Military radio
       transmissions are subject to FCC monitoring and regulation.
       3.5.1.2. FCC regulations prohibit:
          3.5.1.2.1. Use of profane or obscene language in wire or radio communication.
          3.5.1.2.2. Use of false or deceptive signals or communications unless otherwise
          directed for intelligence operations.
          3.5.1.2.3. Operation of an unlicensed station.
          3.5.1.2.4. Operation of a station by unauthorized personnel.
   3.5.2. Net Control Station. When three or more two-way radios use a single radio net
   (frequency), establish a net control station according to the local installation communications
   officer's direction.
   3.5.3. Commanders ensure a positive Communications Security (COMSEC) program exists
   for radio communications when they:
       3.5.3.1. Use standard response codes to identify the urgency of each radio dispatch. (See
       Attachment 3)
       3.5.3.2. Devise local duress or signal codes to indicate an emergency or duress situation
       when they do not wish to alert any unauthorized listeners.
       3.5.3.3. Decode data encryption system equipped radios before servicing.
       3.5.3.4. Decode vehicle radios before releasing the vehicle to any maintenance activity.
   3.5.4. Consider equipping the law enforcement desk with a two-way radio capable of
   communicating on the local civilian police emergency frequency. If a two-way radio is not
   available or practical, use a mutually agreed upon system that facilitates rapid emergency
   notification to civilian police like E-911. Negotiate for and fund such equipment at the
   installation level. Set up operating instructions according to local civilian police regulations.
   3.5.5. (Added-AFMC) In addition to complying with all applicable AF and local
   instructions governing communications devices, Security Forces units must receive approval
   of all radio and radio component purchases through HQ AFMC/A7SX prior to purchasing to
   ensure they meet all standards and are on the list of approved items.
3.6. Telephone Systems. Commercial and tactical telephone systems augment the LMR.
Connect all fixed Security Forces posts to the law enforcement desk, central security control,
Emergency Control Center (ECC), or Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) by dial or direct
telephone lines.
3.7. Vehicle Equipment. TAs and technical orders (TO) establish authorized equipment and
markings. As a minimum, equip permanently assigned non-tactical vehicles with the following
(exceptions may include posting/investigation vehicles):
   3.7.1. Warning Light System. Use a warning light system in the form of a magnetic or
   permanent mount-type single or multiple flashers, rotating, or strobe light system. Mount the
 14                                           AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


   system either on the vehicle roof, on a "roof bar," on the dashboard and rear window
   platform, or on the front bumper and the rear window platform. Do not mount lights inside
   the vehicle front grill.
   3.7.2. Siren System. Mount the siren in concert with a roof-mounted warning light system or
   under the vehicle hood.
   3.7.3. Public Address System. Use either a portable system ("bullhorn") or a permanent
   system. Mount the system in concert with a roof-mounted warning light bar system or under
   the vehicle's hood.
   3.7.4. Spotlight. Use either a portable spotlight (battery-operated or cigarette lighter plug-in
   type) or a permanently mounted spotlight. If a permanent-mount type is used, mount the
   spotlight on the vehicle roof, "roof bar," or on the driver's side door frame pillar.
   3.7.5. Land Mobile Radio. Use a permanently mounted multi-channel mobile or
   ―portamobile" radio. Install radios so the driver has easy access to all radio controls and
   microphones and so radio equipment does not interfere with safe vehicle operation.
   3.7.6. A general purpose first aid kit (FSN 6545-00-922-1200 or equivalent).
   3.7.7. Extinguisher – a 2 1/2 pound ABC rated dry chemical fire extinguisher.
   3.7.8. Bloodborne Pathogen Protective Kit (required in all Security Forces vehicles).
   Contents must include one-way respiratory cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mask,
   surgical gloves, eye protective goggles or glasses with side shields, surgical mask, and
   surgical gown. The installation Chief of Security Forces and installation medical officer
   determine other contents of the kit. Train those personnel determined to have occupational
   exposure to bloodborne pathogens to use kit contents. Attachment 4 contains the
   requirements for a Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan.
   3.7.9. Remove unit level equipment before turning in for maintenance.
3.8. SF Vehicle Identification Markings. Refer to TO 36-1-191 for guidance on marking
Security Forces vehicles.
3.9. Speedometer Calibration. Calibrate the speedometers of all traffic patrol vehicles at least
semiannually or sooner if local (city, county, state) laws are more stringent. Recalibrate the
vehicle's speedometer any time there are major maintenance repairs to a traffic patrol vehicle's
transmission, differential, speedometer, or after tire replacement.
   3.9.1. See local laws on how to calibrate speedometers.
   3.9.2. If local (city, county, state) law does not have any standards, develop local procedures
   and coordinate with SJA to ensure legal requirements are satisfied.
3.10. Vehicle and Vehicle Equipment Care. Before each tour of duty, inspect vehicles and
vehicle equipment for safety and maintenance deficiencies. Test all warning lights, sirens, public
address systems, spotlights, etc. Report deficiencies to the on-duty flight chief/commander. And
annotate all discrepancies and deficiencies on the AFTO Form 1800 assigned to that vehicle. If
the deficiency is a safety issue, do not operate the vehicle until the deficiency is repaired or
corrected. Vehicles should always present a clean appearance, weather permitting.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          15


3.11. Vehicle-Mounted Video Surveillance Systems. Units may use vehicle-mounted video
surveillance systems as a tool to enhance their law enforcement and public safety role. Carefully
evaluate the cost and the need before buying video systems. The following guidelines apply:
   3.11.1. MAJCOM SFs approve unit requests for video systems.
       3.11.1.1. Installation SJA must coordinate in writing, on the use, presentation, securing
       and disposition of recorded data. However, as a minimum, the vehicle-mounted video
       system will only be used when actively engaged in patrol activities (which includes
       traffic stops or any contact with a person, not on traffic accidents) and cannot be in use
       when the vehicle is parked and unattended in a non-enforcement function. Recorded data
       must be processed, maintained and documented in accordance with paragraph 7.11,
       Preserving Evidence.
       3.11.1.2. Vehicle-mounted video surveillance system recorded data must be
       stored/housed in a locked, tamper proof container with access only by the on duty flight
       sergeant or flight commander.
       3.11.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Security Forces units must receive approval of all video
       surveillance system purchases through HQ AFMC/A7SX prior to purchasing to ensure
       they meet all standards and are on the list of approved items.
   3.11.2. There is no centrally managed procurement program. Units must determine needs
   locally and procure the appropriate system that best meets their needs. Consult MAJCOM,
   state and local requirements for possible restrictions prior to procurement of any system.
   3.11.3. Follow standard supply acquisition procedures.

                             SECURITY FORCES ACTIVITIES

4.1. Security Forces Guardmount. Guardmount is an official military function conducted at
the start of the Security Forces shift. Use guardmount to determine the readiness of personnel, to
include their appearance and mental and physical condition. Use guardmount to conduct roll
call, announcements, security status briefing, weapons inspection, and post assignments.
Conduct open ranks inspections at least once per work cycle and annotate it in the Security
Forces blotter. Guardmount is also an appropriate opportunity for recognition of deserving
personnel.
4.2. Installation Entry Control. Controlling entry to the installation is a fundamental Security
Forces task. SF control entry to facilitate vehicle and pedestrian access in an orderly, safe, and
secure manner, and to provide controls to help protect the installation’s resources. Effective
entry control begins off the installation with coordination and planning with civil or host nation
law enforcement agencies. Entry control is a multi-disciplinary effort incorporating perimeter
controls, entry point design, screening, searches, sentry procedures, and consequence
management. Commanders at all levels are responsible to understand the integrated nature of
installation entry control and mitigate risks. All Airmen are responsible to do their part in
controlling authorized entry and preventing unauthorized entry to Air Force installations,
particularly as sponsors of base visitors.
   4.2.1. The installation entry controller is a symbol of the professionalism and readiness of an
   Air Force installation. Entry controllers represent the most senior authority on base --usually
   the installation commander. They are normally the first contact the public has with the Air
   Force installation, and serve as the Air Force's "ambassadors to the public." This
   professional SF image is also a key element in deterring criminals and terrorists from even
   approaching a gate.
   4.2.2. A professionally constructed gatehouse is essential, with supporting features such as
   lighting, traffic calming devices, final denial barriers, and protection from adverse weather.
   Safety and security for people transiting the gate must be inherent in its design. The entry
   point should also present an image, which reflects the pride of the installation’s mission and
   the professionalism of the Air Force. Staff the gatehouse with sharp, energetic, and
   courteous entry controllers.
   4.2.3. Installation entry controllers are a key line of defense. Installation entry points are
   where SF first contacts persons entering the installation. Among many other tasks, the
   installation gate is the prime spot for SF to stop: unwanted persons, weapons, and contraband
   from entering the installation; fleeing criminals and stolen property from exiting the
   installation; and unsafe, uninsured, and unlicensed vehicles and drivers from entering/exiting
   the installation (including drunk/drugged drivers).
4.3. Post Checks. Unit leadership and on duty supervisory personnel will conduct post checks
to ensure posted personnel remain alert and are knowledgeable of assigned duties and
responsibilities. Post checks also include inspection of Security Forces facilities, vehicles,
individual and post-related equipment. Post checks must be documented in the SF blotter.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            17


4.4. Post Visits. Post visits are a means for officials to visit on-duty Security Forces. These
officials include senior Security Forces representatives, Senior Wing/Base Leaders, First
Sergeants, chaplains, etc. Post visits can be used to verify the SF member’s job knowledge and
performance in their work environment, inspect facilities, take questions, ascertain the welfare of
personnel, and build their morale. Post visits should be conducted during both day and night
hours.
4.5. Post Reporting. Security Forces report the status of their post to the senior person
conducting the post check or visit.
4.6. Security Forces Duty Officer Program. SF Commanders will establish a SF duty officer
program. SF SNCOs and Officers will be appointed to perform post checks, observe exercises,
inspect equipment/ facilities, and provide feedback, in writing, to the commander on unit
readiness and areas of concern.

                                           Chapter 5

                    JURISDICTION, LIMITATIONS, AND LIABILITY

5.1. Jurisdiction. Military jurisdiction is the authority, capacity, power or right to apply the
law. This authority involves the right to charge a person with an offense, try him/her in a court
and make a final determination of his/her case through courts of appeal. The installation Staff
Judge Advocate is the focal point for determining Security Forces jurisdiction. Security Forces
members must know the jurisdictions on their installation.
   5.1.1. Security Forces are representatives of the US Government, the US Armed Forces, the
   installation commander, and the installation chief of Security Forces. The Manual for Court-
   Martial, Rules for Court-Martial (RCM), Rule 302(b)(1), gives the authority to apprehend
   individuals. Carry out this important duty in a fair, impartial and firm manner.
   5.1.2. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Article 136(b)(6), gives Security
   Forces the authority to administer oaths to witnesses and suspects, as necessary, in the
   performance of their duties.
5.2. Jurisdiction Sources. There are three sources of military jurisdiction.
   5.2.1. U.S. Constitution. The US Constitution established a system of fundamental laws and
   principles that prescribe the nature, function and limits of our government. Simply said,
   Security Forces powers are constitutionally founded. The specific provisions of the
   Constitution relating to military jurisdiction are found in the powers granted to Congress, in
   the authority vested in the President and in a provision of the Fifth Amendment. This
   jurisdiction is designed to operate outside of the federal court system. The efficient operation
   of military law requires a separate judicial system geared to the needs of the military.
       5.2.1.1. Article 1, Section 8, authorizes the US Congress to make rules for the
       government and regulation of the land and naval armed forces. Under this authority, the
       US Congress enacted the Articles of War and the Articles for the Government of the
       Navy. The UCMJ was later written for all branches of the US Armed Forces and
       replaced the early Articles.
       5.2.1.2. Article 2, Section 2, provides for the President of the United States to be
       Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces. Under this authority, the President issues
       executive orders affecting the US Armed Forces. The UCMJ, Article 36, further states
       the President of the United States can prescribe rules for court-martial procedure. By
       virtue of his/her authority under the Constitution and the UCMJ, the President of the
       United States, by Executive Order, has prescribed the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM).
   5.2.2. Federal Statutes. The second source of jurisdiction is US federal statutes – laws
   passed by the US Congress. Most of the statutes that directly affect the Air Force are
   compiled in Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.).
   5.2.3. International Law. The third source of jurisdiction is international law. Military
   jurisdiction derived from international law is difficult to precisely define. However, civilized
   nations have observed certain rules in their relationships with each other.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            19


       5.2.3.1. The sources of international law are customs, written agreements among nations
       and the writings of authorities. The Law of Armed Conflict is also included under
       international law (e.g., citizens of a foreign nation may be tried by military court-martial
       or commission for certain offenses during wartime).
       5.2.3.2. The Law of Armed Conflict is derived from agreements between nations in such
       international gatherings as The Hague and Geneva Convention’s. These conventions
       spell out the conduct of participants in warfare. The purpose of the law is to restore order
       and to protect both combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering. It
       defines the rights of prisoners-of-war, the sick and injured and civilians in occupied
       territories.
5.3. Jurisdiction Application. Jurisdiction applies to persons, places and offenses.
   5.3.1. Person. Article 2 of the UCMJ states exactly who is subject to military jurisdiction.
   Those personnel subject to military jurisdiction that Security Forces personnel are likely to
   come in contact with include:
       5.3.1.1. Members of the regular component of the Armed Forces.
       5.3.1.2. Cadets, aviation cadets and midshipmen.
       5.3.1.3. Members of the reserve components while on inactive training, but in the case of
       the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard, only when in federal service.
       5.3.1.4. Retired, regular component members of the military entitled to pay.
       5.3.1.5. Retired, reserve component members receiving military hospitalization.
       5.3.1.6. Members of the fleet reserve and the fleet marine reserve.
       5.3.1.7. Persons in Armed Forces custody serving a sentence imposed by court-martial.
       5.3.1.8. Prisoners of war in custody of the Armed Forces.
       5.3.1.9. In time of war, persons with or accompanying the Armed Forces in the field.
       However, this is only in time of war and subject to certain limitations.
       5.3.1.10. Members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Public
       Health Service, and other organizations, when assigned to and serving with the armed
       forces.
       5.3.1.11. Subject to any treaty or agreement which the United States is or may be a party
       to any accepted rule of international law, persons serving with, employed by, or
       accompanying the armed forces outside the United States and outside the Canal Zone, the
       Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
       5.3.1.12. Subject to any treaty or agreement which the United States is or may be a party
       to any accepted rule of international law, persons within an area leased by otherwise
       reserved or acquired for use of the United States which is under the control of the
       Secretary concerned and which is outside the United States and outside the Canal Zone,
       the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
 20                                            AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


   5.3.2. Place. Article 5 of the UCMJ states that the Code applies in all places, and there is no
   restriction on where the case may be heard. The military has jurisdiction to prosecute any
   offense committed on or off base.
   5.3.3. Offenses. The last element is that the offense be subject to court-martial jurisdiction.
   As Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 203 states, ―To the extent permitted by the Constitution,
   court-martial may try an offense under the code…‖ However, in determining whether
   subject-matter jurisdiction exists, it is necessary to look at the service member's status at the
   time the offense is committed. If the service member is lacking a military status at the time of
   the offense, there is no jurisdiction over that offense, regardless of whether the offense
   violates any UCMJ article.
5.4. Jurisdiction Types. Four types of jurisdiction apply to military installations and facilities.
   5.4.1. Exclusive Jurisdiction. The federal government has total or complete jurisdiction of
   offenses occurring on federal lands. Exclusive jurisdiction gives the federal government the
   exclusive right to prosecute offenses occurring therein. If persons commit an offense under
   the UCMJ, they are tried solely by the military, unless the crime also violates some other
   federal statute. Generally, the federal government will dispose of all cases involving military
   personnel for offenses committed in areas of federal exclusive jurisdiction. Civilians who
   commit offenses in areas of federal exclusive jurisdiction can be prosecuted and/or turned
   over to civilian federal authorities.
   5.4.2. Concurrent Jurisdiction. Both the federal and state governments have authority to
   enforce law on the installation. If there is a potential conflict regarding exercise of
   jurisdiction, SFS should consult their Staff Judge Advocate for guidance.
   5.4.3. Reciprocal (Partial) Jurisdiction. Both the federal and state governments have some
   authority, but neither has exclusive power. For example, a state may have retained criminal
   jurisdiction over an installation or part of an installation (housing areas, for example).
   5.4.4. Proprietary Jurisdiction. The military exercises the rights of a property owner only.
   The military does have criminal jurisdiction (UCMJ) over military personnel in these areas.
   The military exercises no criminal jurisdiction over the area with civilians. Examples include
   some housing areas and some recreational retreat areas.
   5.4.5. Martial Law. The term "martial law" means "the temporary military government of a
   civilian population." Declaring US federal martial law might require the US to exercise
   jurisdiction over the civilian population. In time of an emergency, military jurisdiction over
   the civilian population extends beyond the restoration of law and order. It provides relief and
   rehabilitation of the people, the resumption of industrial production, the re-establishment of
   the economy, and the protection of life and property.
5.5. Security Forces Authority. Rule 302 of the Manual for Courts-Martial and Article 7(b) of
the UCMJ give Security Forces authority to apprehend any person subject to trial by court-
martial if the Security Forces member is executing security/law enforcement duties. Security
Forces have four authorities: to detain, apprehend, report and correct.
   5.5.1. Detain. Detaining or detention is a term used for dealing with civilians or other
   personnel not subject to Article 2 of the UCMJ.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           21


   5.5.2. Apprehend. Apprehension is the equivalent of ―arrest‖ in civilian terminology. It
   means taking a person into custody. The same rules apply to detentions and apprehensions.
   For example, if a person on base wearing civilian clothes violates the UCMJ, and/or federal
   and state laws, detain and verify their status. If the detainee is a military member, and it is
   appropriate, apprehend.
   5.5.3. Report. Security Forces members’ responsibility to report includes a requirement to
   prepare or present an official detailed account of violations of the UCMJ to the proper
   authorities.
   5.5.4. Correct. Security Forces have the authority to correct, caution or warn offenders for
   minor infractions of laws and regulations. However, Security Forces have no authority to
   punish an offender, so they must use caution that their action does not constitute an
   admonition or reprimand.
   5.5.5. Federal Law. Security Forces also have the authority to enforce other aspects of
   federal law and U.S.C. not covered by the UCMJ. Examples which outline the installation
   commander’s responsibility for protecting personnel and property under their jurisdiction
   include:
       5.5.5.1. The Internal Security Act of 1950.
       5.5.5.2. Title 10 and Title 18, United States Code, Section 1382.
   5.5.6. Assimilative Crimes Act. Makes criminal and adopts state criminal laws for areas of
   exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction, provided federal criminal law, including the
   UCMJ, has not defined an applicable offense for the misconduct committed.
5.6. Probable Cause/Reasonable Grounds. Apprehend any suspect, subject to the UCMJ, for
whom there is probable cause to believe has committed a violation of the UCMJ. Base all
apprehensions and detentions on probable cause. Probable cause to apprehend exists when there
are reasonable grounds to believe that an offense has been or is being committed and that person
to be apprehended committed or is committing it.‖ Reasonable grounds mean that there is
reliable information that a reasonable, prudent person would rely on which makes it more likely
than not that something is true. Reasonable grounds are also a logical and rational evaluation of
the circumstances of an offense and of the suspect’s connection with the offense Security Forces
members can establish reasonable grounds through one of the following:
   5.6.1. The Security Forces member actually sees the person commit the crime.
   5.6.2. The Security Forces member gets the description of a person or vehicle from another
   Security Forces member. For example, if the Security Forces controller directs that a
   particular person be apprehended or detained for assault on another person, the Security
   Forces member now has reasonable grounds.
   5.6.3. The Security Forces member receives a statement by a reliable person. It is very hard
   to determine a person’s reliability. Security Forces members must use their judgment and/or
   past experience to determine the validity of this information. Be sure of sources before
   action is taken.
   5.6.4. A superior in the Security Forces member’s chain of command orders an
   apprehension. Remember, all NCOs, petty officers and commissioned officers have the
   authority to apprehend anyone violating any section of the UCMJ.
 22                                            AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


   5.6.5. Complainant or victim identifies the alleged perpetrator.
   5.6.6. There exists a preponderance of evidence/circumstances to indicate a crime has been
   committed and/or certain individual(s) were responsible or involved.
5.7. Posse Comitatus Act. The Congress of the United States enacted this law in 1878 to
restrict the use of the military to enforce civil law, Title 18, U.S.C., Section 1385. See also Title
10 U.S.C., Section 375.
   5.7.1. This act prevents military personnel from executing the laws of the states or the laws
   of the United States except when acting under the authority of the US Constitution, an Act of
   Congress, and under the direction of the President of the United States. Posse Comitatus
   governs the use of military personnel only within the Continental United States (CONUS).
   The Act does not apply to National Guard personnel performing in Title 32 status under the
   command of a State governor.
   5.7.2. This act does not prevent:
       5.7.2.1. Military authorities from taking action on incidents involving civilians when
       such action involves a specific military purpose.
       5.7.2.2. A military member acting in an unofficial capacity to make a citizen's arrest or
       to take other action to preserve the public peace.
       5.7.2.3. Security Forces from using force to stop a fleeing felon or suspected felon for
       the purpose of aiding civilian law enforcement.
       5.7.2.4. Actions in the performance of duties employed ―off-duty‖ as a security guard or
       police officer (i.e. SF members with second jobs).
5.8. Deputization of Air Force Law Enforcement Personnel by State and Local
Governments. The Secretary of the Air Force is the approval authority for the deputization by
state and local governments of uniformed law enforcement personnel under the authority of the
Air Force, including Security Forces, civilian police, and/or security guards.
   5.8.1. If state or local deputization is needed, the senior installation law enforcement official
   will prepare the request. The request will be based on the justification guidelines established
   in DoDI 5525.13, Limitation of Authority to Deputize DoD Uniformed Law Enforcement
   Personnel by State and Local Governments, and will include:
       5.8.1.1. The number of uniformed law enforcement personnel to be granted the authority
       and a certification that they have received the requisite training to affect the type of
       deputization.
       5.8.1.2. The time frame envisioned for the authority to be exercised. Blanket time
       authorizations will not be considered.
       5.8.1.3. The policies and procedures to prevent misuse of the authority to be employed
       by the requesting installation law enforcement official.
       5.8.1.4. A copy of the proposed memorandum of understanding with the state or local
       jurisdiction that will carry out the deputization, to include the signature of the appropriate
       official representing that state or local jurisdiction.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              23


   5.8.2. Requests for approval will follow the appropriate chain of command to the Secretary
   of the Air Force for approval. As a minimum, requests will be coordinated through the
   following:
       5.8.2.1. Installation Commander
       5.8.2.2. MAJCOM A7S Director
       5.8.2.3. HQ Air Force Security Forces Center
       5.8.2.4. HAF/A7S Director of Security Forces
       5.8.2.5. HAF/JA
       5.8.2.6. SAF/GC
       5.8.2.7. SAF/IG
   5.8.3. The Secretary of the Air Force will consider the request and return a decision through
   appropriate channels.
5.9. Off-duty employment as civilian police officers. Off-duty Security Forces enlisted
members may serve as members of a civilian police agency, either as a regular or reserve duty
police officer provided such service is in their personal capabilities, does not require the exercise
of military authority, and does not interfere with their military duties. Subject to the same
restrictions, commissioned officers may engage in similar off-duty employment, provided they
do not violate the ―civil office‖ restriction found in 10 U.S.C § 973. The restriction provides that
regular commissioned officers, and Guard, Reserve, or retired officers called to active duty for
more than 270 days, may not accept off-duty employment as a federal, state, or local civilian law
enforcement official in any position which qualifies as a ―civil office‖. Guidance on what
constitutes a civil office within the meaning of 10 U.S.C § 973 is contained in AFI 51-902,
Political Activities by Members of the U.S. Air Force. All off-duty employment of Security
Forces personnel (officer and enlisted) is subject to approval of their commander and must be
coordinated with the servicing legal office.
5.10. Support to the US Secret Service (USSS) and US Department of State (DOS). Refer
requests for assistance from other federal agencies to AFOSI. When appropriately tasked to
assist, Security Forces support the USSS in the protection of the President and Vice President of
the United States, major political candidates, and visiting foreign heads of state. When assigned
to such duty, Security Forces are subject to the overall supervision of the Director, USSS, or
Director of Diplomatic Security, as appropriate. If working under the support of AFOSI for
protective services, Security Forces work under the supervision of the AFOSI Protective Detail
Leader.
5.11. Personal Liability. Military and civilian courts may review acts performed by military
personnel for damages or in criminal proceedings.
5.12. Vehicle Operation. Each Chief of Security Forces must ensure Security Forces personnel
understand and follow vehicle operation guidelines in this section and in the USAF Model
Vehicle Operation Policy shown in Attachment 2. Chiefs of Security Forces may modify this
policy to reflect local laws or conditions. The primary concern in emergency driving situations
is the protection and safety of all citizens. Do not endanger the public. Nuclear and chemical
resource recovery operations are exempt from the provisions of this section.

                                           Chapter 6

                    APPREHENSION, DETENTION, AND CUSTODY

6.1. Apprehension on Military Installations. As described in Chapter 5, Security Forces may
apprehend any person subject to the UCMJ if probable cause to believe that an offense has been
or is being committed and that person to be apprehended committed or is committing it.
   6.1.1. Installation Chiefs of Security Forces, with the advice of the installation Staff Judge
   Advocate, will establish local procedures for handling civilian offenders.
   6.1.2. For minor offenses, release civilian offenders to their military sponsor. If they do not
   have a military sponsor, release them to a relative, friend or on their own recognizance.
   6.1.3. The installation commander or appointed magistrate authorizes apprehensions in
   private dwellings on or off base. Use AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in a Private
   Dwelling, to document this authority.
   6.1.4. Release military personnel to their First Sergeant, commander, and/or the designated
   person acting on behalf of the First Sergeant or commander. The individual will be released
   to an individual who is an E-7/MSgt or above and is at least one grade higher than the
   individual being receipted for. Exception: Individuals of any enlisted rank may be released
   to a First Sergeant.
6.2. Off Installation Patrols. Security Forces performing patrol duties off the installation have
the authority to apprehend military personnel.
   6.2.1. Develop policies and procedures for patrol activity conducted off installation in
   consultation with local civilian law enforcement officials and Staff Judge Advocate.
       6.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Security Forces commanders will develop written guidance
       for off-installation patrol activity, and coordinate it with the Staff Judge Advocate. The
       guidance should be shared with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies who
       may encounter off-installation Security Forces patrols.
   6.2.2. Overseas. The installation commander may authorize off installation patrols.
   Coordinate with the MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate before authorizing off installation
   patrols. Security Forces maintain the authority to apprehend military personnel on or off the
   installation in an overseas environment in accordance with SOFA or host nation agreements.
   The authority to detain civilians on a US military installation varies in each host nation.
   Bilateral agreements and directives must specify such limitations.
6.3. Custody. Custody is the restraint of free movement. An apprehension occurs when a
Security Forces member clearly notifies a suspect they are under apprehension. This notice
should be given orally or in writing, but it may be implied by the circumstances. Once
apprehended and in custody, the apprehending officer must control the movements of the
offender. Protect the health and welfare of all apprehended suspects.
6.4. Searches. Immediately upon apprehending a suspect and for officer safety, conduct a
search of the suspect for weapons or items of evidentiary value. This ensures the safety of the
Security Forces member and the apprehended individual. The apprehending Security Forces
person makes the decision to frisk (without handcuffs) or to search (handcuffed). Base this
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           25


decision on the situation at hand. The situation may also warrant a search of the area under the
suspect's control. (See Chapter 8 for detailed guidance on searches)
6.5. Rights Advisement. Advise suspects of their right against self-incrimination according to
the UCMJ, Article 31, for active duty military personnel, or the US Constitution, Fifth
Amendment, for civilian personnel. Use the AFVA 31-231, Advisement of Rights, for verbal
advisement (usually on-scene), or the AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/
Complainant, for written proof of rights advisement (usually prior to taking a written statement).
   6.5.1. Suspects on verified active orders (i.e. active ANG personnel while on active status,
   and AFR personnel while serving in an active Individual Mobilization Augmentee position)
   will be advised of their rights according to the UCMJ, Article 31. NOTE: Contact local SJA
   when duty status is in question.
6.6. Use of Force. Comply with AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel,
during apprehension and detention of suspects. Always use the minimum force necessary when
placing a suspect under apprehension. Use handcuffs, as an intermediate use of force, and
firearms only when specifically trained in their use. In addition, Security Forces must strictly
adhere to USAF standardized employment procedures.
   6.6.1. Handcuffs. The courts consider handcuffing a use of force; therefore, Security Forces
   must carefully analyze each situation to ensure they use the minimum level of force to
   protect themselves and others from injury. During an apprehension, Security Forces may
   apply handcuffs to ensure control of the apprehended individual during detention and search,
   at the apprehension site, and during transport. When applying handcuffs, Security Forces use
   a reasonable level of force to achieve control of a resisting detainee. Inform non-resisting
   detainees of the handcuffing procedure and give them the opportunity to cooperate. Use
   handcuffs as a precaution against an apprehended person who may become uncooperative or
   violent, to prevent escape, or to ensure personal safety.
   6.6.2. Non-Lethal Weapons. Non-lethal weapons are weapons or techniques that are
   designed and primarily employed to incapacitate personnel or materiel, while minimizing
   fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the
   environment. Non-lethal weapons provide a range of options to obtain subject compliance
   and achieve objectives short of employing deadly force. Unit Standard Operating Procedures
   (SOPs) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) may require adjustment to enable
   employment of non-lethal weapons and new equipment for the success of specific missions.
       6.6.2.1. The installation Chief of Security Forces will ensure that Security Forces
       members armed with the handgun, as a primary duty weapon will also carry at least one
       non-lethal weapon, consisting of the collapsible baton, OC pepper spray, electronic
       control device and/or any combination of these.
           6.6.2.1.1. Refer to AFMAN 31-222, Air Force Use of Force Manual, for approved
           non-lethal weapon types and required training for each.
           6.6.2.1.2. While overseas or deployed, comply with local SOFA and ROE mandated
           by the Installation commander.

      6.6.2.2. Police Baton and Riot Baton. The installation Chief of Security Forces, with
      consent of the installation commander, determines the need to carry the police baton and
      riot baton. Use of the PR-24 police baton is not authorized.
   6.6.3. Firearms. Security Forces routinely bear firearms in the performance of duties. AFI
   31-207 contains specific criteria for their authorization and use. When responding to an
   actual incident where a member can reasonably expect to meet an armed adversary, respond
   with firearms ready. Security Forces members must base any decision to chamber a round of
   ammunition in a firearm that’s not normally carried with a round chambered, or draw a pistol
   from the holster, on the circumstances being faced and the threat present. Use realistic and
   safe exercises to develop the sound judgment required in situations that may involve the use
   of deadly force. Supervisors and exercise participants must follow the safety considerations
   outlined in AFI 31-207.
6.7. Transporting Apprehended or Detained Persons. Search all persons in custody for
weapons before placing them in a Security Forces vehicle and transporting them.
   6.7.1. Vehicles must be searched prior to and following transport of persons in custody.
   Always use seatbelts.
   6.7.2. When transporting a suspect, notify the control center of the departure time and
   destination arrival time (along with odometer readings) for inclusion in the desk blotter.

                                           Chapter 7

                           SEARCH, SEIZURE, AND EVIDENCE

7.1. Search. A search is an examination of a person, property, or premise to uncover evidence
of a crime or criminal intent (e.g., stolen goods, burglary tools, weapons, etc). Security Forces
conduct searches of persons, property, or areas within jurisdictional limitations. Evidence
obtained in an illegal search is inadmissible at a court-martial or other legal proceedings.
7.2. Probable Cause Search. Probable cause or reasonable belief for a search are
circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe the person, property or evidence
sought is located in the place or on the person to be searched.
   7.2.1. The special court-martial convening authority at each installation may appoint a
   military magistrate to authorize probable-cause searches. Have the installation commander
   sign the appointment, and specify the installation over which the magistrate has authority.
   Security Forces will obtain the installation commander's (or appointed military magistrate's)
   permission to conduct a probable-cause search. Use AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and
   Seize, to document this action.
   7.2.2. Most searches require probable cause (reasonable belief) or consent to be valid. There
   are unique situations where Security Forces do not need probable cause such as when
   entering certain controlled or restricted areas.
   7.2.3. When justified, the manner and extent of the search are commensurate with the reason
   for the search.
   7.2.4. Normally, Security Forces do not conduct a probable cause search based solely on the
   statement of one individual. However, if there are reasons why that individual is particularly
   trustworthy or reliable, the search authority may authorize a search. A search authorization
   request for such searches must detail why they are considering the person trustworthy or
   reliable.
7.3. Search Incident to Apprehension. A search incident to an apprehension can be conducted
without obtaining search authority and may include the immediate area over which the
apprehended person exercises control. When conducting a search incident to an apprehension, it
should be conducted immediately.
7.4. Search with Consent. Security Forces may conduct a search based on consent of the
individual to search. If a person consents to a search of his or her property or person, Security
Forces do not need separate search authority. When obtaining consent to search, the individual
giving consent must give it freely and voluntarily. The law does not require the advisement of
Article 31 or Fifth Amendment rights to persons who voluntarily give permission for a search.
   7.4.1. Consent may be obtained orally or in writing. Use AF Form 1364, Consent for Search
   and Seizure, to obtain written consent to search.
   7.4.2. The law may require rights advisement before, during, or after requesting or receiving
   consent to a search, depending upon if and when the individual becomes a "suspect" and the
   particular investigative circumstances.
 28                                          AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


7.5. Search of and by the Opposite Sex. When searching members of the opposite sex or
premises occupied by members of the opposite sex is sensitive, take certain precautions and
carefully consider actions and use common sense.
   7.5.1. A search may be conducted of outer garments (e.g., jackets, coats, etc.) and hand
   carried items of a member of the opposite sex.
   7.5.2. Regardless of the sex of the person being searched, conduct frisks in the same manner.
   Security Forces or other military persons of the same sex conduct the frisk unless an urgent
   safety or security need exists. Two Security Forces must be present to witness a frisk
   conducted by the opposite sex.
   7.5.3. A search may be conducted of premises exclusively occupied by members of the
   opposite sex. However, Security Forces or military personnel of the same sex as the
   occupants of the premises should be present during the search.
   7.5.4. Do not conduct body searches of personnel of the opposite sex. If such searches are
   necessary, Security Forces or other military persons of the same sex as the person searched
   will conduct the search.
7.6. Personnel Searches. There are four types of personnel searches used within the Air Force.
In each case, the situation determines the type of search.
   7.6.1. Standing. Use the standing search primarily for suspects who do not appear
   dangerous or violent.
   7.6.2. Kneeling. Use the kneeling search when the suspect is a potential physical threat;
   when a standing search would not be effective because the suspect is significantly larger than
   the SF member; or if a suspect appears impaired and a standing search could jeopardize their
   safety.
   7.6.3. Prone. Use the prone search when a suspect is aggressive or so physically or mentally
   impaired that the standing or kneeling search could cause injury to the suspect. This search
   is ideal for multiple apprehensions and is the primary search used during "high risk"
   operations.
   7.6.4. Complete. Use the complete search, also known as the "strip search," only when
   placing a person into confinement or when ordered by appropriate authority. Health care
   providers should supervise complete searches.
7.7. Off-Installation Searches. Comply with local, state, and federal law if an off-installation
search of a person subject to the UCMJ or their property is necessary.
   7.7.1. The installation commander approves any requests for such searches.
   7.7.2. Seek the advice of the installation Staff Judge Advocate.
7.8. Searches Outside the United States, US Commonwealths, and US
Territories. Authority for conducting search and seizure operations outside US federal
jurisdiction varies according to geographic locations and US and host nation agreements.
Consult with the local Staff Judge Advocate.
7.9. Searches Conducted by Foreign Nationals. Command may not delegate the general
authority to order or to conduct searches to a foreign national. When making a lawful
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            29


apprehension, host-nation contract Security Forces may search the suspect's person, clothing
worn, and the property in the suspect's immediate possession. Host nation contract Security
Forces may also search a motor vehicle that a suspect was operating or riding in as a passenger.
Host-nation law or US and host-nation agreements govern other restrictions or authorizations.
7.10. Entry Point Inspections and Searches. Installation commanders may order Security
Forces to inspect all or a percentage of motor vehicles entering or leaving their installation (per
AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision). They may also authorize searches of
specific motor vehicles in the same manner as premise searches.
7.11. Preserving Evidence. Preserve all evidence found on a person or at the scene of an
offense for use at future judicial proceedings. Maintain the chain of custody.
   7.11.1. Record all circumstances surrounding the discovery of evidence (e.g., location of the
   discovery, date and time, witnesses present, etc). These notes provide facts for an incident
   report. Additionally, Security Forces may use these notes to testify in court. As a minimum,
   file a copy of the notes with the incident report. Retain original notes.
   7.11.2. Place initials, date and time on all evidence for later identification. Use care not to
   destroy the evidentiary value of the item through the careless marking of the item. Use
   envelopes, boxes, plastic bags, etc., to collect evidence. Exercise sound judgment to avoid
   damaging a valuable stolen item, which may eventually be returned to its owner.
   7.11.3. Security Forces units must maintain the capability to store evidence. See AFI 31-206
   for evidence storage guidelines.
   7.11.4. Maintain a complete "chain of custody" accounting of all personnel who handle
   evidence. Use AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, to preserve the chain of custody. In addition to
   the discovery location, mark the date, time, and initials of the Security Forces person who
   discovered the evidence. Make sure this form contains a complete description of the
   evidence and the signature of each person handling the evidence. Annotate the presence of
   any witnesses.
   7.11.5. Return all evidence items to their rightful owners upon final disposition of a case.
   Coordinate all releases of evidence with the Staff Judge Advocate.

                                          Chapter 8

NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TERMINAL SYSTEM (NLETS) AND NATIONAL
               CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

8.1. Program Definition. National Law Enforcement Terminal System (NLETS) and National
Crime Information Center (NCIC) are access systems to computerized civilian law enforcement
data. They allow the prompt exchange of law enforcement information between Security Forces
and other law enforcement officials.
8.2. Program Responsibilities. The following agencies and personnel are responsible for
various aspects of the NLETS/NCIC program:
   8.2.1. HQ AFOSI is the US Air Force executive agency for National Crime Information
   Center (NCIC) matters.
   8.2.2. MAJCOMs ensure US Air Force installations in the same state share systems, if
   practical, and fund system acquisition, installation, and support.
   8.2.3. The installation Chief of Security Forces establishes the need for an NLETS/NCIC
   terminal(s).
8.3. Acquiring and Installing NLETS/NCIC. Before acquiring                  and   installing   an
NLETS/NCIC at a base, the installation Chief of Security Forces:
   8.3.1. Contacts the host state system administrator and coordinates action required to
   become part of the state's system through a dedicated terminal.
   8.3.2. Determines the initial cost, to include procurement of power conditioning and
   continuation interfacing equipment (PCCIE).
   8.3.3. Determines recurring costs of terminal equipment.
   8.3.4. Receives PCCIE guidance from the base civil engineer.
   8.3.5. Coordinates local funding for servicing equipment with base agencies.
   8.3.6. Coordinates with the base contracting officer to develop a service agreement.
   8.3.7. Determines facility protection and environmental requirements to satisfy state
   requirements for terminal installation.
   8.3.8. Coordinates with the base civil engineer with the necessary building repairs or
   modification requirements to accommodate NLETS/NCIC.
   8.3.9. Coordinates with the base communications squadron to ensure necessary equipment
   and capabilities exist.
8.4. Training. The installation Chief of Security Forces:
   8.4.1. Coordinates and establishes training requirements for local operators with the state
   terminal authorities.
   8.4.2. Ensures the training meets state and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
   requirements.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           31


   8.4.3. Ensures training of selected persons in terminal operation.
   8.4.4. Ensures only trained and qualified persons operate the terminal.
   8.4.5. Ensures proper documentation of training records.
8.5. Providing System Protection. Restrict access to data to official use only. Users and
serviced agencies follow the state and NCIC guidance on policies, procedures, formats, and
codes required for entering records into the system. Users of the system can include but are not
limited to SF members, AF Civilian Police/AF Security Guards, and/or Security Contract Guard
personnel requiring an official need of the information.
8.6. Criminal History Data. Computerized Criminal History (CCH) and the National Crime
Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III) are federal systems of records and
controlled under the Privacy Act of 1974. Grant access to this data for valid law enforcement
purposes on a case-by-case basis.
   8.6.1. The installation Chief of Security Forces may authorize access to CCH and III on a
   case-by-case basis. Other than AFOSI, requests from outside the SF unit must be in writing,
   include the reason for the request, and be approved by the installation Chief of Security
   Forces. Disclose data according to AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program. Terminate operator
   access privileges for misuse of terminals.
       8.6.1.1. It is recommended the installation Chief of Security Forces authorize NCIC III
       checks for all visitors entering the installation.
           8.6.1.1.1. Although this is not a background check, it will provide feedback on
           whether the person is wanted by any federal agency, to include the national Terrorist
           Screening Center.
           8.6.1.1.2. If NCIC III is not used to screen all visitors, the installation Chief of
           Security Forces should implement a policy so that the screening is done based on set,
           non-discriminatory criteria, similar to Installation Entry Point Checks.
   8.6.2. Prohibit obtaining the CCH or NCIC III data from other sources except as authorized
   by the installation Chief of Security Forces.
   8.6.3. Keep all requests for CCH or NCIC III check data from outside the SF unit on file for
   validation purposes. If validation records do not correspond with access-approval files,
   conduct an inquiry to resolve the difference.
   8.6.4. A name/descriptor CCH or NCIC III may be used to screen contractors for work on an
   installation. Installation Chiefs of Security Forces must coordinate with their local state
   NCIC access providers for final permission to conduct such checks. When doing so, the
   following rules apply:
       8.6.4.1. Accomplish a fingerprint card and submit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
       8.6.4.2. Maintain documentation for two years at which time destruction of information
       is appropriate.
       8.6.4.3. Costs of background checks are borne by the organization contracting the
       service.

8.7. Validation System and Records Maintenance. Validate all entries into NCIC III, or State
Terminal System (STS). The FBI or STS sends records that require validation to the installation
Chief of Security Forces. The installation Chief of Security Forces establishes a validation
system that includes:
   8.7.1. Security Forces Desk Blotter (AF Form 53) entry or an Incident Report (AF Form
   3545A) that reflects a complaint and is prepared by the installation where the offense
   occurred, serving as source documents for entries.
   8.7.2. Use a folder for NLETS or NCIC-directed validation documents from each agency
   receiving or using NLETS or NCIC service to maintain a list of all system entries.
   8.7.3. The installation Chief of Security Forces must select a terminal agency coordinator
   (TAC) to supervise, train on, and control terminal operations. The TAC uses available
   documentation to validate entries into the system.
8.8. Agencies Receiving NLETS/NCIC Service. Agencies receiving NLETS/NCIC service
follow the written requirements and responsibilities provided by the terminal-owning agency.
Written requirements include training, physical protection, and validations.

                                            Chapter 9

                                   HIGH RISK SITUATIONS

9.1. Air Force Philosophy. Installation commanders have the authority and responsibility to
maintain law and order on their installations. In some situations, such as an active shooter,
Security Forces must take immediate action to neutralize the threat. In other situations, such as a
barricaded suspect, the best means of preventing loss of life and property may be to use available
resources to contain the situation until the situation can be resolved. As needed, develop
memoranda of agreement with local, state, federal agencies, and, for overseas installations, host
nation agencies, to be able to call for outside assistance when necessary.
9.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Resolution of high-risk incidents on federal property involves
many agencies and personnel. Installation plans should identify the role of key base agencies.
Plans must address the use of Security Forces to isolate, contain, and neutralize a terrorist, active
shooter, or hostage incident, with or without assistance. Contingency plans should address the
use of installation Security Forces, other military forces, and civilian and host nation resources.
Installations on foreign soil should coordinate plans with host nation and the State Department
(normally the Regional Security Officer of the US Embassy). In overseas situations, the status of
forces or other agreements and understandings may determine the use of host nation resources
instead of US forces.
   9.2.1. Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs. The SAF/PA provides public affairs
   guidance and authorizes local responses to news media inquiries for high-risk situations.
   9.2.2. HAF.      HAF/A7S and SAF/IGX develop policies and procedures for high-risk
   situations.
   9.2.3. Installation Commanders:
       9.2.3.1. Prepare contingency plans and provide for initial and immediate response to any
       incident occurring on the installation, including a capability to counter high-risk
       situations on their installations.
       9.2.3.2. Organize, train, and equip base units to implement the plans.
       9.2.3.3. Maintain responsibility for high-risk situations until appropriate authority directs
       otherwise.
       9.2.3.4. Determine the need for hostage negotiators and emergency service teams (EST).
       If deciding to establish and train Security Forces to perform in these roles, commanders
       must seek specialized training from the FBI, local law enforcement agencies, or other
       Services. (See Chapter 11)
       9.2.3.5. Determine the response time based on the local threat.
       9.2.3.6. Take immediate action to prevent loss of life (i.e. active shooter situation), to
       protect property and personnel, and restore order, if necessary before the appropriate
       civilian response force arrives. If the civilian authorities decline jurisdiction, the Air
       Force will act to resolve the incident. Refer to AFMAN 31-201, Volume 4, High-Risk
       Response, for additional information.
 34                                            AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


   9.2.4. The installation Chief of Security Forces is the primary advisor to the installation
   commander on hostage negotiations and EST employment.
   9.2.5. AFOSI Detachment. AFOSI is the lead Air Force agency responsible for criminal
   investigations on Air Force installations. The servicing AFOSI detachment is the Air Force
   liaison with all federal agencies on criminal investigations and will maintain close
   coordination with civil authorities to exchange information that could indicate a threat to
   individuals or property on a military installation. AFOSI also provides investigative support
   within its capabilities when needed.
   9.2.6. Local Law Enforcement. The role of state and local law enforcement agencies can be
   much more complicated. Each installation establishes unique alliances in the form of
   jurisdictional agreements. Commanders, Staff Judge Advocates, and Chiefs of Security
   Forces must become familiar with these local arrangements and comply with the negotiated
   policing protocols.
9.3. Lead Agency Concept. Public Law 93-366 and several National Security Directives
outline the management of US Government response to high-risk incidents on federal property or
terrorist incidents against US citizens, facilities, and/or interests. These publications identify a
lead agency for coordinating US Government actions to resolve both terrorist and high-risk
incidents. Specifically, lead agency designations include:
   9.3.1. The Department of State (DOS). The Department of State is the lead agency for U.S.
   government efforts to combat terrorism through use of ―soft power‖ (diplomacy/foreign aid-
   related) overseas.
   9.3.2. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is the principal Federal
   Department for domestic crisis management. Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of
   2002, the Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating Federal operations
   within the United States to prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major
   disasters, and other emergencies.
   9.3.3. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). DOJ is
   the lead agency for threats or acts of terrorism overseas and domestically. The Department
   of Justice assigns lead responsibility for operational response to the FBI.
       9.3.3.1. Within the operational response role, the FBI operates as the on-scene manager
       for the Federal Government. It is FBI policy that crisis management will involve only
       those Federal agencies requested by the FBI to provide expert guidance and/or assistance,
       as described in PDD-39, Domestic Deployment Guidelines (classified), and the FBI
       Weapon of Mass Destruction Incident Contingency Plan.
       9.3.3.2. The FBI is the lead US Government agency for investigating criminal acts
       committed against US Government offices and employees on US Government
       reservations, including military installations, or against US Government property. In
       addition, the FBI is the lead agency for investigation and prosecution of individuals
       alleged to have violated the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986
       by committing prohibited acts against Americans abroad. Thus, it is the FBI's
       responsibility to investigate incidents the installation commander declares "terrorist" in
       nature. AFOSI remains the Air Force liaison with the FBI and should be notified any
       time assistance from the FBI may be required.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                            35


   9.3.4. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA is the lead agency for
   consequence management within U.S. territory. FEMA retains authority and responsibility
   to act as the lead agency for consequence management throughout the Federal response. It is
   FEMA policy to use Federal Response Plan structures to coordinate all Federal assistance to
   state and local governments for consequence management.
   9.3.5. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The TSA is the lead agency for
   international terrorist incidents involving aircraft in flight. The TSA has exclusive
   responsibility for the direction of law enforcement activity during a hijacking involving in-
   flight aircraft within the US. The FBI has jurisdiction when the aircraft is not in flight. In
   this case, "flight" begins when support personnel close and secure the aircraft door, and the
   aircraft is no longer dependent on ground service. TSA has the lead for aircraft piracy within
   all the airspace in the United States and its territories. If the hijacking occurs overseas, the
   host nation, in conjunction with the DOS and DoD, manages intervention.
9.4. Off-Installation Incidents. The FBI is the lead federal agency for terrorist incidents
occurring off the military installation in the US. AFOSI maintains liaison with the FBI on
terrorist incidents occurring off military installations that may impact Air Force operations. DoD
Directive 5525.5, DoD Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Officials, greatly restricts
the use of military forces to enforce civil laws within the territory of the US.
   9.4.1. National Defense Area (NDA). The installation commander is ultimately responsible
   for the protection of military equipment, property, information, or personnel in the US and its
   territories. If they are at risk, off an installation, the installation commander may declare a
   National Defense Area to contain and secure the federal government resources.
   9.4.2. The Air Force may need to establish an NDA in such situations as when:
       9.4.2.1. Aircraft divert to civilian airports.
       9.4.2.2. An aircraft carrying nuclear weapons makes an emergency landing.
       9.4.2.3. It is necessary to temporarily stop the movement of an off-base nuclear weapons
       convoy.
       9.4.2.4. An aircraft crashes.
       9.4.2.5. Any other unplanned emergency occurs pertaining to military personnel or
       assets.

                                           Chapter 10

                          EMERGENCY SERVICE TEAMS (EST)

10.1. Requirements for EST. The formation of emergency service teams is an optional
program established at the discretion of the installation commander. The basic unit is a four-
person Security Forces team acting as a single tactical team or in conjunction with other teams
during high-risk operations. These include, but are not limited to, anti-sniper actions, barricaded
suspect neutralization, hostage rescue/negotiations, counterterrorist tactics, and special event
operations. The basic premise for the use of EST is that of a tactical team of highly motivated
and well-conditioned Security Forces. Specially trained and equipped to function as a team, EST
is more effectively and safely employed than a larger group of Security Forces members. The
USAF's primary objective in dealing with high-risk situations is to prevent or minimize the loss
of life or property by response, containment, negotiation, and yielding to the expertise and
unique training of civilian authorities like the FBI and TSA when possible.
10.2. Goals. Generally, the goals of any high-risk situation requiring EST employment should
include the release of hostages unharmed, protection of bystanders, prevention of injury to
responding forces, apprehension of suspects unharmed, and restoration of normal operations.
Tasks associated with initial response include crisis point and location identification, site
isolation, evacuation of nonessential personnel, establishment of an inner perimeter, and
conducting a reconnaissance and intelligence gathering mission.
10.3. Capability. Each installation should have the ability to contain potential hostage, sniper,
barricaded suspect situations, and acts of terrorism, and to provide a standby force to support
special events. If an installation commander desires a pre-selected and highly trained team,
assignment to these teams should be voluntary as units receive no additional manpower for this
activity. The volunteer nature of their members often determines the effectiveness and success
of specialized teams. While designed as stand-alone teams, ESTs must remain capable of
teaming up with other teams and elements as situations warrant. Team positions include:
   10.3.1. Team Leader. Responsible for primary direction of the operations and team control
   during deployment.
   10.3.2. Marksman. Provides selected firepower at an individual or location. For obvious
   reasons, this member should possess the sharpest shooting skills and highest level of
   concentration.
   10.3.3. Point Member. Guides the team's movement during search and clear operations.
   Acts as the reconnaissance component within the search element. Select a quick thinking
   individual who can maintain composure under stressful conditions.
   10.3.4. Defense Member. Provides close protection for the team during movement and
   deployment.
10.4. Assignment. Units with an EST should ensure that team training is a top priority.
Lessons learned from high-risk situations such as campus and workplace shootings and hostage
situations show that serious threats can strike without warning. If feasible, CSFs should consider
consolidating EST members on a similar daily working element, to promote teamwork and
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                        37


camaraderie. The more time members spend together, the more effective they will become as an
EST.
10.5. Emergency Medical Skills. Planning for a high-risk or tactical mission should include
medical care. Units establishing an EST should also establish a tactical emergency medical
support program.
10.6. Intelligence. Tactical operations and intelligence are interdependent. Develop and
nurture the capacity to gather tactical intelligence. Seek assistance and planning support from
the local AFOSI.
10.7. Interagency Cooperation. Meet regularly with counterparts from other federal agencies.
Conduct meetings at least annually with federal special operations leaders and command
personnel (BATF, FBI, US Marshals Service, and US Customs) to discuss tactical analysis and
contemporary procedures. Emphasize the necessity for interagency cooperation and training.
Periodically include guest speakers from civilian law enforcement teams so attendees can share
their experience and expertise.
10.8. Employment. Employ the EST as required to resolve situations where loss of life appears
imminent. Other considerations include:
   10.8.1. The installation maintains functional control of emergency service teams.       The
   installation commander or designated representative directs the decision to assault.
   10.8.2. Don’t use specialized teams in conjunction with civil disturbances and protest
   demonstrations, unless intelligence indicates the potential for violence.
   10.8.3. Consider using the EST during open house functions. Keep the EST out of sight
   until actually deployed.
10.9. Uniforms and Equipment. Procure the basic equipment authorized for EST through
supply channels. For standardization, the battle dress uniform (BDU) or Airman’s Battle
Uniform (ABU) is the accepted uniform. Use approved equipment listed in TA 538.
10.10. Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT). The principal method to resolve crisis situations is
through negotiation by the CNT. Hostage negotiation is not necessarily a Security Forces-
unique responsibility, but the CNT may include trained Security Forces. Seek local training for
negotiators.
   10.10.1. EST Relationship with the CNT. EST members do not participate in or influence
   negotiations. They may, however, pass information to the CNT regarding the hostage taker.
   When an EST is deployed, the CNT may assist by creating a diversion.
   10.10.2. Nonnegotiable Demands. Nonnegotiable demands include:
       10.10.2.1. Access or continued access to a nuclear weapon.
       10.10.2.2. Release of inmates.
       10.10.2.3. Weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
       10.10.2.4. Absolute promises of amnesty.
       10.10.2.5. Security Forces or AFOSI radios.
       10.10.2.6. Tactically significant information.
 38                                           AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


       10.10.2.7. The exchange of Security Forces, AFOSI, other law enforcement persons, or
       high-ranking officials for hostages. Because of the dangers involved, avoid the exchange
       of any hostages.
       10.10.2.8. Alcohol, narcotics, or other drugs are nonnegotiable unless the demand is
       reasonable or for the health of an injured or sick hostage.
10.11. Planning Considerations. Preplanning and coordination with other base agencies are
important to successful resolutions to situations. Preplanning actions include:
   10.11.1. Acquisition of base maps and high-risk structure floor plans.
   10.11.2. Coordination with AFOSI for technical surveillance and other services.
   10.11.3. Coordination with local FBI and law enforcement for special services.
   10.11.4. Coordination with base communications personnel for equipment.
   10.11.5. Coordination with the base civil engineer and civilian utility companies for control
   of utilities.
10.12. Initial EST Training. Installation commanders choosing to establish an EST must seek
initial training and certification for all team members. The Army's Special Reaction Team
Course, described below, is an excellent source for initial EST training either in residence or
through a Mobile Training Team (MTT). Installation commanders may also seek this type of
specialized training from the FBI or from local law enforcement.
   10.12.1. US Army Course. The Army's two-week Special Reaction Team (SRT) Course,
   7H-F17/830-F12 (Education & Training Course Announcement (ETCA) # L5AZA3P071
   0S2A), is offered numerous times annually at Ft Leonard Wood, Missouri. This course
   provides excellent training for teams designed to handle high-risk situations. Topics range
   from building entry and tactics to firearms training, trauma aid, operational planning, and
   physical conditioning. If units decide to use this course to train their emergency service
   teams, they must comply with Army fitness standards and provide funding for attendance by
   team members. The Army also teaches this course through the use of a MTT that travels to
   installations requesting such services. This may be the best option as these MTTs emphasize
   training designed specifically for the host installation. The installation provides all funding.
   10.12.2. Sustainment. The sophistication and perishable nature of EST skills require intense
   sustainment training. ETCA offers an SRT follow up course identified previously. This
   course ETCA #L5AZA3P071 0S4A, instructs SRT tactics and special threat operations to
   include combating terrorism, hostage situation management, instintive firearms training,
   surveillance and intelligence reporting, incident preplanning and independent selct weapon
   firing. In summation, following a basic training and certification program, each EST should
   train regularly to remain proficient. Suggested training topics include:
       10.12.2.1. Integration of hostage negotiations and EMS.
       10.12.2.2. Forward observer training--observation and recording skills; establishment of
       a command and control mechanism for forward observer/marksman; marksmanship
       skills.
       10.12.2.3. Intelligence operations to include management, analysis, and intelligence
       support of tactical operations.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           39


       10.12.2.4. Performance-oriented team leader/member skills.
       10.12.2.5. Physical fitness.
       10.12.2.6. Individual and small group training activities, to include periodic exercises to
       hone and evaluate preparedness.
10.13. Military Working Dog (MWD) Team Use. MWD teams are best employed inside the
inner perimeter providing overwatch to avenues of escape. If a suspect attempts to flee, the dog
should be used as minimum force to affect apprehension. Only use MWDs with an EST entry
team if they have practiced beforehand and the dog is familiar with and tolerable of all team
members. Dog teams can interfere with EST tactics, creating hazards. Evaluate the risks
associated with use of MWDs on an assault when there are hostages or multiple subjects. If risks
are greater than the benefit, do not use MWD teams. If an MWD team is used with the entry
team, the entry team will enter first and secure the immediate area prior to MWD team entry. In
this situation, the MWD handler should be EST trained and must remain to the rear of the entry
team.
10.14. Reporting Requirements. Initially report all incidents through OPREP-3 reporting
channels (See AFI 10-601). After the incident, the installation Chief of Security Forces provides
a Security Forces Lessons Learned report, IAW Chapter 13, on any actual employment of EST.
 40                                            AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


                                            Chapter 11

                                     CRIME PREVENTION

11.1. Definition. Crime prevention is a pattern of attitudes and behaviors directed both at
reducing the threat of crime and enhancing the sense of safety and security to improve the quality
of life in our society and help develop environments where crime cannot flourish.
   11.1.1. The Air Force Vision. The goal of the Air Force crime prevention program is to
   eliminate or minimize the opportunity and desire to engage in criminal activities. Prevention
   and elimination of crime are quality of life issues.
   11.1.2. Crime prevention is more than a single focus, law enforcement effort. Effective
   crime prevention requires interaction among commanders, staff, officers, NCOs, Airmen,
   civilian employees, and dependents.
11.2. Objectives. To have an effective program, clearly describe and widely publicize crime
prevention objectives, which include:
   11.2.1. Upgrade the protection of personnel and property by educating people to recognize
   and avoid situations in which they are likely to end up the victim of an assault or robbery.
   Encourage the installation to invest in better locks; stress the need for consistent use of
   existing locks and safeguards.
   11.2.2. Increase surveillance by encouraging residents and workers to challenge unidentified
   individuals in dormitory, housing, and work areas; establish neighborhood watch programs;
   encourage permanent marking of property.
   11.2.3. Achieve maximum involvement of the Air Force community and Security Forces in
   crime prevention activities.
   11.2.4. Crime prevention is everyone’s responsibility. All members of the base community
   must be convinced of the need to protect themselves, their neighborhoods, and work areas by
   supporting crime prevention goals.
11.3. Connection to Integrated Defense. The Air Force Crime Prevention Program, by design,
complements and works with AFI 31-101, Integrated Base Defense. Achieve the goals of both
programs through active participation of the total Air Force community.
11.4. Role of Security Forces. The role of Security Forces, though pivotal to crime prevention,
is that of an educational, technical, and supportive resource--an "enabler or catalyst" rather than a
"doer." The primary role of Security Forces law enforcement is that of installation entry control,
preventive patrol, armed response, detection, and investigative services. Security Forces also
provide equally important technical services such as physical security and resources protection.
Security Forces must achieve and maintain proficiency in prevention and resource protection
programs.
   11.4.1. Program Manager. The Crime Prevention Program is a function of Police Services in
   the S5 branch. The installation Chief of Security Forces selects an individual to manage
   resource protection and crime prevention functions. Installation Chief of Security Forces
   focuses resources based on the installation’s requirements. The NCOIC, Police Services
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                        41


  Branch, should attend course WCIP07A- Resource Protection/Crime Prevention Theory,
  Practice and Management, PDS Code 1F2.
  11.4.2. Considerations. Personnel selected for these positions should have top oral and
  written communication skills, have the flexibility to work with both young and mature
  groups, and be willing to work varied hours. Crime prevention specialists keep direct
  communication with law enforcement shifts, investigations, and reports and analysis, and
  should have access to operations and command leadership.
  11.4.3. Program Responsibilities. The following is a list of the types of crime prevention
  services the crime prevention program manager may choose to provide for the installation:
     11.4.3.1. Establish installation-wide crime prevention programs. This would include
     assessing needs, identifying problems, establishing objectives, coordinating training, and
     managing program implementation. It further includes providing continuing analysis,
     program revision, and community-wide crime prevention consultation services.
     11.4.3.2. Use crime statistics to examine crime patterns. Use analyzed data to determine
     strategies for employment of crime-risk management, as well short- and long-term crime
     prevention to fight local crime problems.
     11.4.3.3. Provide crime trend data to unit commanders, law enforcement, and other
     interested base agencies. Security Forces use this information to determine selective
     enforcement techniques and element-level crime prevention techniques.
     11.4.3.4. Develop and implement a media campaign to publicize the base crime
     prevention program, prevailing crime problems, and effective measures to counter these
     problems.
     11.4.3.5. Conduct speaking engagements to promote crime prevention goals. Use
     Commander's Calls, First Sergeant briefs, social activities, youth gatherings, spouses’
     club meetings, school visitations, etc.
     11.4.3.6. Participate in community projects that foster joint police and community
     efforts; for example, Operation Identification, neighborhood watch, crime stop, and crime
     hazard reporting. Determine the effectiveness of each program.
     11.4.3.7. Conduct citizen awareness programs that educate the military community on
     the crime risks they face. Emphasize specific problems and precautions to protect
     themselves and their property.
     11.4.3.8. Provide crime prevention statistics, rates and trend analysis to members of the
     Installation Defense Council (IDC). Implement programs identified by the IDC.
     11.4.3.9. Assist in formulating youth activity programs and selecting volunteers to act as
     youth leaders and advisors in youth programs.
     11.4.3.10. Conduct on-base residential, dormitory, and work area crime prevention
     surveys for occupants and organizations.
     11.4.3.11. Request and distribute crime prevention literature and forms to promote crime
     prevention programs.
 42                                           AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


       11.4.3.12. Maintain close liaison with civilian organizations and authorities on crime
       prevention programs. Where possible, set up joint programs to promote military and
       civilian community involvement and combat mutual crime problems. Participate in local,
       state, and federal crime prevention activities that benefit the military community.
       11.4.3.13. Encourage unit commanders to establish crime prevention programs within
       their unit and suggest they designate a focal point to coordinate program activities within
       the unit.
11.5. Basic Crime Prevention Programs. As a primary source of information on crime
patterns, Security Forces should provide guidance to the community on prevailing kinds of crime
and the specific mode of operation used by criminals. Each base has its own unique community
environment and crime prevention needs. Some successful programs help prevent the most
prevalent types of crime occurring on Air Force bases, including:
   11.5.1. Operation Crime Stop. An essential element of crime prevention is the prompt and
   accurate reporting of imminent crime situations or criminal acts. Some people will report
   their observations to police only when they know they can remain anonymous. Operation
   Crime Stop helps overcome reluctance to become involved with Security Forces by
   providing a single telephone line for crime reporting while allowing witnesses to remain
   anonymous. Crime Stop provides a safe way to report suspected or actual crimes
   anonymously. Anonymous crime reports can include school crimes, such as persistent
   bullying, domestic violence, suspicious activity, threatening acts or behavior, possession of
   weapons and or the use or sale of illegal drugs
       11.5.1.1. Units may install a dedicated Crime Stop telephone at the law enforcement
       desk, capable of receiving calls from both on and off base, with a single number
       dedicated to Crime Stop reporting. Advertise the purpose of the dedicated line and the
       ability to remain anonymous. Distribute Crime Stop reporting materials to other unit
       personnel and encourage their support of the program. Bases having access to either 911
       or Enhanced 911 (E911 provides automatic caller ID) Emergency Reporting Systems
       may elect to use that system instead.
       11.5.1.2. Log each Crime Stop call on an AF Form 53, Security Forces Desk Blotter.
       Begin each entry with "Crime Stop" to aid in statistical retrieval.
   11.5.2. Operation Identification. The Operation Identification program, referred to by the
   logo "OPID", is a crime resistance technique which individuals use to deter burglaries and
   larcenies. It also provides investigative leads that increase the chances of solving crimes.
       11.5.2.1. OPID encourages owners of high value or pilferable property to permanently
       mark their property with an identifying number. This gives a way to identify the property
       and to establish ownership. Use the Service prefix ―AF-‖ followed by the owner’s last
       name, plus last 4 digits of his/her social security number. Photograph property not easily
       marked like rings, watches, silverware, etc.
       11.5.2.2. Mark the property by engraving, etching, or by using fluorescent marking
       devices. Security Forces should maintain one or more electric engravers or other
       marking devices at the law enforcement desk for checkout by interested personnel.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           43


   11.5.3. Crime Hazard Identification Program. One goal of crime prevention is to identify,
   report, and eliminate as many crime hazards as possible, and thus reduce the opportunity for
   crime.
       11.5.3.1. Security Forces and base-level crime prevention program managers may solicit
       and issue Crime Hazard Reports to commanders and agency chiefs for corrective actions.
       11.5.3.2. Crime Hazard Reminder. Security Forces should leave crime hazard reminders
       when they discover insecure vehicles, office areas, equipment, or unattended property.
   11.5.4. Citizen Awareness Program. The thrust of this program is to educate the base
   community on crime prevention. Base newspapers and other media are good ways to get the
   word out on typical crimes, victims, and offenders. Additionally, the installation crime
   prevention program manager may brief all newly assigned personnel on the local crime
   program, with an emphasis on precautions to avoid becoming victims of crime.
   11.5.5. Military Working Dogs. MWDs are great deterrents to crime. Articles in the local
   news media announcing their presence and capabilities serve to increase public awareness
   and acceptance. Use caution when publishing precise details to avoid revealing law
   enforcement tactics or placing a handler and dog at risk for retaliation.
   11.5.6. Selective Enforcement. Selective enforcement focuses Security Forces manpower on
   local crime and incident problems. It is based on accurate analysis of the time, place, type,
   and frequency of incidents or violations. The crime prevention program manager tabulates
   information from complaints, and reports of offenses and vehicle accidents.
       11.5.6.1. A good analysis of this information will show the underlying conditions or
       behaviors that need to be corrected. In many instances, selective assignment of Security
       Forces may be an effective solution. Crime prevention program managers provide their
       analysis to the operations flight leadership for patrol activity consideration.
       11.5.6.2. Before applying selective enforcement to correct a traffic problem, the analysis
       should consider whether other solutions would be more effective. For example, analysis
       may show that the best way to cut accidents at a particular intersection is to trim
       shrubbery, install a larger stop sign, or repaint the pavement markings. Repeated reports
       of speeding may require speed enforcement, along with the deterrence of a marked
       Security Forces vehicle.
   11.5.7. Physical Protection Surveys. Security Forces units may establish a program to offer
   physical protection surveys to residents of base housing, dormitories, and to supervisors of
   activities not normally inspected or surveyed under the resource protection program. These
   surveys educate personnel about how to protect themselves and their property. The survey is
   a critical analysis of the physical protection of the facility. Coordinate surveys with AFOSI
   when done as part of the antiterrorism or Force Protection program. When feasible, the
   crime prevention program manager should consider using help from law enforcement
   specialists who normally patrol the area.
11.6. Situational Crime Prevention. Other sources of crime prevention information include:
   11.6.1. The Crime Prevention Coalition of America (CPCA). The CPCA is a nonpartisan
   group of national, state, and federal organizations united to promote citizen action to prevent
   crime. The USAF is one of the original members of this broad-based, interdisciplinary group
44                                         AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


  whose members represent youth development organizations, municipalities, health care
  providers, law enforcement, and federal and state organizations, to name a few.
  11.6.2. National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC). The NCPC is a nonprofit organization
  that acts as an advocate for crime prevention policies and programs throughout the nation.
  Its mission is to enable people to prevent crime and build safer communities. The National
  Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign is symbolized by the crime dog, McGruff, and the
  "Take a Bite Out of Crime" slogan. NCPC manages the day-to-day activities of the public
  service advertising campaign by providing the following services to coalition members:
     11.6.2.1. Develops materials, including posters, brochures, and books that help teach
     crime prevention skills to citizens of all ages.
     11.6.2.2. Provides information, referral services, and technical assistance to people
     trying to enhance a crime prevention effort.
     11.6.2.3. Conducts training in crime prevention skills and techniques.
     11.6.2.4. Establishes demonstration programs and practical research to find the most
     effective ways to prevent crime.
  11.6.3. NCPC granted authorization to the USAF to reproduce NCPC-copyrighted material.
  Security Forces may adopt elements of the national program to meet local needs. For further
  information, contact the National Crime Prevention Council, 2345 Crystal Drive, Suite 500,
  Arlington, VA, 22202, www.ncpc.org.

                                           Chapter 12

                         SECURITY FORCES LESSONS LEARNED

12.1. Purpose. The Security Forces After Action Report is a living document striving to
capture the experiences of significant events in the Security Forces career field. Its purpose is to
educate and train our forces. Training and operations planners and leaders at every level can use
the examples to focus and guide programs. Commanders and operations staffs can review them
with an eye toward local procedural policy, both written and unwritten. Leaders can use them
for motivation and training. Most importantly, Security Forces performing front line duty can
look inward and reflect on their actions in situations they may potentially face.
12.2. Types of Reports. After Action Reports focus on the worker-level to allow quick
application for exercises and operations.
   12.2.1. Lesson Learned. The Lesson Learned is the most common type of report. It is how a
   technique, procedure, or practical work-around to overcome a deficiency or shortcoming, or
   create a better way to accomplish a task.
   12.2.2. Issue Report. Issue Reports are similar to Lessons Learned in that they identify a
   shortcoming, deficiency, or problem, but they do not include a work-around or solution.
   Include the word "Issue" in the report title (example, "Issue - Spare Parts Kits for Deployed
   Assets Were Obsolete").
   12.2.3. Observation Report. Observation Reports document a technique or circumstance that
   significantly impacted an operation or training event and should be shared with the Air Force
   and joint community. Include the word "Observation" in the report title (example,
   "Observation – Unit-Designed Scheduling Template Reduced Deployed Workload").
   12.2.4. Summary Report. Summary Reports document operations and exercises including
   dates, locations, objectives, major participants, and limitations. A Summary Report may
   have several Lessons Learned/Issues/Observation reports within it. Submit reports within 30
   days of the conclusion of an exercise or operation.
12.3. Types of Actions. These are examples of actions that require an After Action Report
submission. This list is not all inclusive:
   12.3.1. Shooting Incidents. Any peacetime government firearms discharge meeting the
   reporting requirements outlined in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
   Personnel. Report all instances where Security Forces used deadly force in the performance
   of their duties.
   12.3.2. Security Incidents. This category includes serious security incidents, unlawful entry
   to aircraft, sabotage or attempted sabotage to AF aircraft, a breech of aircraft security, acts of
   vandalism directed at AF priority resources, hijacking or attempts, unauthorized entry into a
   launch facility, significant security incidents at AF-sponsored air shows, and damage to
   aircraft.
   12.3.3. Deployments (Actual/Exercise). Examples of Lessons Learned from previous
   deployments includes: Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM.
 46                                           AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


   12.3.4. Law Enforcement Incidents. Actual employment of EST, regardless of the outcome.
   Robberies or attempts, especially if they involve weapons, munitions, or large sums of
   money.
   12.3.5. Military Corrections Incidents. Inmate escapes and inmate disturbances or riots, and
   inmates that experience serious injury while in custody.
   12.3.6. Information/Industrial Security Incidents. Summaries of major espionage cases,
   independent research on insider threats, and substantiated cases of industrial
   espionage/sabotage.
   12.3.7. Terrorist Acts.    Terrorist attacks at an Air Force base or its resources,
   bombings/rocket attacks, and significant threats from known terrorist groups.
   12.3.8. Civil Disturbances. Protest activities or demonstrations at AF installations, military
   operations other than war (MOOTW), like peacekeeping operations that lead to civil unrest,
   migrant camp operations and disaster relief missions involving mass crowd violence or
   disorder.
   12.3.9. Military Working Dog (MWD) Incidents. All training aid losses, incidents in which
   MWDs are commanded to bite suspects, unprovoked or non-commanded bites on persons
   other than the MWD handler and any other lessons of value to other MWD handlers.
   12.3.10. CATM. Unusual training incidents like a M-240B "cook-off'" or explosion of blank
   rounds, unexpected ricochets, and accidental/negligent weapons discharges.
   12.3.11. Miscellaneous. This category provides an avenue for installation Chief of Security
   Forces to analyze and report any incident that may be of educational value for the Security
   Forces career field. Examples of the types of incidents previously reported in this section
   include domestic disturbance response; loss of a Security Forces weapon; base defense
   training accident; death of a Security Forces member; injury to a Security Forces member
   while making an apprehension; Security Forces response to a potential suicide; and use of
   electronic control devices.
   12.3.12. Incidents Resulting in Significant Loss of Security Forces manpower. Report all
   incidents such as, vehicle accidents, arrests, etc…where five or more Security Forces
   personnel are involved.
12.4. Reporting Requirements. Security Forces commanders analyze and report significant
incidents that occur during Security Forces operations to include, but not limited to, exercises,
special events, deployments and daily operations and will provide After Action Reports on
incidents listed in paragraph 13.3 above, using the Security Forces After Action Report Format
in Attachment 5 of this AFI.
   12.4.1. Provide the final report within 30 days of the conclusion of an exercise or operation
   or within 15 days after an incident via Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS).
       12.4.1.1. When a report is submitted to JLLIS it is electronically sent to the appropriate
       MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA for validation and simultaneously HQ AFSFC/SFOP receives
       a courtesy copy of the report.
       12.4.1.2. Once the MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA validates the report it is available to view
       via the JLLIS website.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                         47


   12.4.2. For Lessons Learned, Issues, and Observations that identify a problem requiring
   action at HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Air Staff agencies, AFSFC/SFOP will
   forward a Lessons Learned report to USAF/A9L not later than (NLT) 30 days following an
   exercise or operation.
   12.4.3. The MAJCOM/A7S will return validated reports to AFSFC/SFOP within 30 days of

         USAF SECURITY FORCES MODEL VEHICLE OPERATION POLICY

A2.1. Non-Emergency Operation of Security Forces Vehicle. Security Forces personnel will:
   A2.1.1. Comply with all installation and state laws when operating USAF-owned or leased
   vehicles.
   A2.1.2. Use seat belts when operating any vehicle.
   A2.1.3. Ensure their vehicles have sufficient gas and oil for their and relieving shift and
   proper inflation of tires.
   A2.1.4. Inspect their assigned vehicles prior to their shift for any damage or missing
   equipment, and inspect the rear seat area for contraband or evidence. Inspect the rear seat
   area before and after transporting any person.
   A2.1.5. Report all vehicle damage or missing equipment to a supervisor prior to placing the
   vehicle in service.
   A2.1.6. Keep vehicles clean and free of trash.
A2.2. Emergency Driving -- General (Non-Pursuit Situations). The primary concern in
emergency driving situations is protection of lives and the safety of all citizens and Security
Forces personnel. During emergency driving situations, Security Forces will operate their
vehicles with extreme caution. Driving under emergency conditions does not relieve the vehicle
operator from the duty to drive with due regard for safety of all persons, nor will these provisions
protect the driver from consequences of their disregard for safety of others.
   A2.2.1. Emergency Driving Defined. Emergency driving is operation of an authorized
   emergency vehicle (emergency lights and siren in operation) by Security Forces personnel in
   response to a life threatening situation or a violent crime in progress, using due regard for
   safety. Note: Drivers should not use their emergency flashers during emergency driving as
   it will make turn signals inoperative.
   A2.2.2. Emergency Driving Conditions. The decision to drive under emergency conditions
   rests with each individual, subject to supervisory oversight, based on the following
   conditions:
       A2.2.2.1. Consider factors such as driving abilities, traffic volume, time of day, and
       potential hazard or liability to themselves and the public.
       A2.2.2.2. Make emergency responses only when the call involves a life threatening
       situation or a violent crime in progress.
       A2.2.2.3. Have sufficient information to justify emergency driving.
       A2.2.2.4. Even when responding to a "patrolman needs assistance" type call, Security
       Forces must bear in mind that, while a rapid response is important, they must arrive at the
       scene safely.
   A2.2.3. Deciding to Make an Emergency Response. All personnel making an emergency
   response will immediately notify the desk sergeant of that action by using the term "Code
   Three." This indicates use of emergency lights and siren. The ranking individual on duty
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           55


   will override the vehicle operator's decision to make an emergency (Code Three) response if,
   in his/her judgment, it is not warranted or safe. Additionally:
       A2.2.3.1. Security Forces personnel will not operate a vehicle in emergency (Code
       Three) status if it is occupied by any passengers other than Security Forces. Exception: If
       Security Forces are transporting injured personnel to a medical facility, use sound
       judgment when determining to use an emergency (Code 3) response.
       A2.2.3.2. Security Forces vehicles without emergency lights and siren will not make
       emergency (Code Three) responses.
A2.3. Pursuit Driving. Pursuit driving is inherently dangerous and should be avoided except in
extreme situations. Examples of extreme situations include: Pursuing a vehicle with material
that is extremely dangerous to others, such as nuclear, biological, or chemical munitions or
components; and pursuing a vehicle whose occupant(s) are suspects in an incident in which
deadly force would be authorized. In situations where deadly force would not be authorized,
consider an alternative course of action, such as vehicle intercept, where Security Forces
strategically move their vehicles into a position to block or disable the suspect vehicle – by the
use of barrier systems or ―Stop Sticks‖ for example, without the use of high speed.
   A2.3.1. Safety. At no time will pursuit driving endanger the public, Security Forces
   involved in the pursuit, or Air Force resources. When engaged in a vehicle pursuit, Security
   Forces must weigh the need to immediately apprehend a suspect against the danger created
   by the pursuit. Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure public safety.
   A2.3.2. Responsibility. Responsibility for the decision to pursue an offender rests with each
   vehicle operator; however, on-duty Security Forces supervisors can, at anytime, order
   termination of any vehicle pursuit. Carefully evaluate each situation and consider the
   following factors:
       A2.3.2.1. Mission impact
       A2.3.2.2. Local policy.
       A2.3.2.3. The danger to the public.
       A2.3.2.4. The danger to self and fellow patrols.
       A2.3.2.5. Experience and training.
       A2.3.2.6. Weather and road conditions.
       A2.3.2.7. Time of day (e.g. is it rush hour? Has school just let out? Is it the middle of
       the night with deserted streets?).
       A2.3.2.8. Facilities located along the route (e.g., schools, hospital, shopping centers,
       etc.).
       A2.3.2.9. Type of violation--Even if use of use of deadly force prerequisites are met, this
       does not mean Security Forces may disregard the safety of the public, other Security
       Forces personnel, or self. Security Forces may be held responsible for injuries or deaths
       if they act with reckless disregard for the safety of others.
56                                           AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


     A2.3.2.10. Vehicle characteristics--use of emergency equipment is essential, so ensure
     vehicle operators turn on the siren and emergency lights. Use both throughout the
     pursuit. If vehicle is not equipped with emergency lights and siren, do not pursue.
     A2.3.2.11. The warning effect of the siren will decrease rapidly as pursuit speed
     increases.
     A2.3.2.12. Use no more than two marked emergency vehicles in the immediate pursuit.
     Other Security Forces vehicles will support the pursuit units without actively joining the
     pursuit. Security Forces should also be positioned to block a suspect vehicle from
     threatening priority resources.
     A2.3.2.13. Close installation gates to contain the suspect vehicle on base.
  A2.3.3. Radio and Driving Techniques. Use the radio sparingly and keep the frequency
  open for the desk sergeant and other units to assist. Where possible, use both hands on the
  steering wheel to maintain control. In the case of a two-person patrol, the rider conducts the
  radio communications. If two separate units are involved in the pursuit, the lead patrol
  concentrates on the suspect vehicle while the second patrol makes all radio transmissions
  concerning the pursuit. When transmitting, remain calm and speak clearly and coherently.
  Do not shout. When a pursuit begins, call the desk sergeant immediately and relay the
  following information:
     A2.3.3.1. Direction of travel.
     A2.3.3.2. Vehicle description and license number.
     A2.3.3.3. Number of occupants.
     A2.3.3.4. Exact reason for pursuit.
     A2.3.3.5. Traffic conditions and other details that will assist other patrols in the area.
  A2.3.4. Terminating a Pursuit. Security Forces must use good judgment throughout a
  pursuit and continuously evaluate whether to terminate the pursuit. End a pursuit when the
  risks to bystanders, other traffic, or the pursuing patrolman are unjustified. Supervisors are
  also responsible for monitoring the pursuit and must order its termination when the risk is not
  justifiable.

A3.1. Code 1 (Routine). When a call is not given a priority code, assume it is routine.
   A3.1.1. Respond by observing all traffic laws.
   A3.1.2. Never use emergency lights or siren for any routine call.
   A3.1.3. If circumstances are unknown to the dispatching agency, the response may be
   upgraded to Code 2 or Code 3, when reasonably justifiable.
A3.2. Code 2 (Urgent).
   A3.2.1. A call requiring an immediate response to a non-life-threatening emergency is
   normally assigned an "urgent" priority.

       response when answering non-life-threatening, crime-in-progress calls.
   A3.2.2. Check local, state, territorial, or host nation traffic codes for limitations on use of
   lights and siren (some traffic codes do not support Code 2 responses).
A3.3. Code 3 (Emergency). A call requiring an immediate response to a life-threatening
emergency or emergency involving Air Force priority resources is normally assigned an
"emergency" priority.
   A3.3.1. The use of emergency lights and siren is mandatory; however, use common sense
   when approaching the scene of the emergency.
   A3.3.2. If the emergency lights and siren put Security Forces, victims, or bystanders in peril,
   turn them off a safe distance from the scene.
A3.4. Code 4 (Request Wants and Warrants). Use this code to obtain a check for outstanding
wants and warrants on a person or vehicle. Immediately follow this transmission by listing:
   A3.4.1. Information about the person to be checked, or
   A3.4.2. Description and license plate number of the vehicle to be checked.

             BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS EXPOSURE CONTROL PLAN

A4.1. Blood-borne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan. Each Security Forces unit will
develop a blood-borne pathogen exposure control plan and make it readily available to all unit
members. Ensure the plan contains, as a minimum:
   A4.1.1. The exposure determination of personnel (those reasonably anticipated, as a result of
   performing their day-to-day duties, to have potential skin, eye, or mucous membrane contact
   with blood or other potentially infectious fluids or materials). This determination includes:
       A4.1.1.1. A list of all duty positions in which personnel in those positions are likely to be
       exposed to contaminated material.
       A4.1.1.2. A list of all tasks and procedures, or groups of closely-related tasks and
       procedures, in which exposure may occur, and performed by personnel who handle
       contaminated material.
   A4.1.2. The methods available to prevent contact with blood and other potentially infectious
   fluids or materials.
   A4.1.3. Procedures for those who reasonably believe they have contacted a potentially
   infectious fluid or material.
   A4.1.4. Procedures for placing warning labels on containers or plastic bags containing blood
   or other potentially infectious material. Labels must comply with Occupational Safety and
   Health Agency (OSHA) Standard 1910.1030.
   A4.1.5. Procedures for keeping records of all incidents and occupational exposures per
   OSHA Standard 1910.1030.
   A4.1.6. Procedures for evaluating circumstances surrounding exposure incidents.
A4.2. Plan Review and Updates. Review the exposure control plan at least annually. Update
the plan as necessary to reflect new or modified exposure determinations. Coordinate with local
medical liaison to ensure relevancy and accuracy.
A4.3. Training. Train Security Forces identified in the exposure determination in the use of
protective equipment and disposition of possibly contaminated materials. Qualified Security
Forces or hospital personnel may conduct this training.

                               Attachment 6 (Added-AFMC)
                               SECURITY FORCES FORMS

Note: This attachment is meant as a guide for filling out forms commonly used by Security
Forces. Units may develop local guidance that supersedes these suggested methods; however,
units may not supersede any requirements for collecting, reporting, or maintaining information
required by AFIs or AFMC Supplements which is often annotated on the forms below.
A6.1. (AFMC) AF Form 52, Evidence Tag. Use this form to record receipt or seizure of
evidence or other acquired property. Proper completion of the AF Form 52 ensures a proper
chain of custody of evidence for legal proceedings.
   A6.1.1. (AFMC) Use AF Form 52 to record evidential or acquired property transactions.
   Proper completion of this form ensures proper chain of custody of evidence for legal
   proceedings and provides an accurate record of acquired property. The form is two hard
   stock manila cards separated by a piece of carbon paper. The front sides of both copies are
   printed with the same information. The back side of the first copy contains the chain-of-
   custody and the back side of the second copy contains final disposition blocks. One AF
   Form 52 may be accomplished on each item or several items may be recorded on one form.
   Examples: One marijuana cigarette found on the back seat of an automobile would require
   one form, while four marijuana cigarettes found in the glove compartment of the same
   automobile could be placed in a single evidence bag and one form could be completed. The
   decision to use one form per item or to record several items per form is a decision based on
   the circumstances of the acquisition. To provide a record or receipt for the property, the
   property custodian uses permanently bound logbooks, one for evidence and the other for
   acquired property. The property custodian is usually an investigator in the investigations
   section. They will log the evidence or acquired property in when they receive it. This
   procedure will maintain the chain-of-custody. When property is returned to the owner or
   otherwise disposed of, the person receiving or destroying the property will sign the AF Form
   52, which will be retained in the security forces administration file. When used to record
   receipt of evidence or acquired property, the first copy of the form is affixed to the item and
   is used to include any future entries to ensure chain of custody.

       be 1 of 2 and on the second one, ―2 of 2.‖
       A6.1.2.3. (AFMC) Case File No.: Leave blank. It will be filled in by the property

     A6.5.3.5. (AFMC) Once they have acknowledged and understand their rights, they must
     make a selection in reference to wanting a lawyer or not and making a statement. The
     suspect makes their selection by initialing adjacent to the statement of their choice. A

  taking a statement from a Suspect/Witness/Complainant/Victim. A well-written statement
  answers the six basic questions; (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How). These basic
  questions may have to be answered several times throughout the statement. Also, a complete
  statement includes the entire sequence of events in detail. If the individual does not fully
  answer all the questions on their own, the security forces member may ask the individual to
  clarify a point and then have the answer written in the statement. An individual has the right
  to choose not to include information in their statement. Statements may also be typed by the
  security forces member. Once the security forces member reviews the statement and
  determines all pertinent information is addressed, close out the form. The security forces
  member is responsible for instructing the individual on how to complete the form. Have the

  they make an error, line through it (one line) and initial the error. Statements will be
  completed in ink. If additional space is needed, continue on bond paper. See Section VI on
  the form for instructions. This section is used to record the individual’s statement.
     A6.5.4.1. (AFMC) If the individual is unable to write for some reason (e.g.: hand
     broken, arthritis, etc) the security forces member may write the statement for the
     individual. The first line in the statement must indicate the statement was written for ―put
     in suspect/subjects name‖ by ―your name and rank.‖ Write exactly what they say.
     Regardless of who writes the statement, the subject/suspect is required to initial all
     corrections.
     A6.5.4.2. (AFMC) If the security forces member wishes to accomplish a question and
     answer statement, he/she will write the question, then the individual will write their
     answer. If the individual is unable to write the answer as specified above, the security
     forces member may write the answer as long as the statement is annotated as such. Upon
     completing the statement in this fashion, the individual will initial at the beginning and
     end of each question and answer.
     A6.5.4.3. (AFMC) Once the statement is completed, write ―///End of Statement///‖
     immediately after the last line of text. The individual will then initial at the beginning of

criminal intent, such as stolen goods, burglary tools, weapons or other evidence. A seizure is the
taking of such items by authorities for evidence at a courts-martial or trial. To ensure the search
and seizure is legal and any evidence found is admissible at a courts-martial, AF Form 1176 is
used to obtain authorization for a search and seizure. This form is prepared for the signature of
the commander having search authority over a specific area, property or person to be searched.
The commander may give verbal authority to search only after a probable cause briefing to
him/her is accomplished and the situation warrants immediate search. The commander must sign
the AF Form 1176 (Figure A6.11) as soon as possible after oral authorization. Once the form is
signed, the security forces retain and place it into the case file. Copies are made and forwarded
based on local requirements. A search authorization is not a search warrant. Search warrants are
an authority to search issued by civilian authorities only.
   A6.6.1. (AFMC) Requesting SF’s name and rank goes on the first line.
   A6.6.2. (AFMC) List offense(s) on the second line. A third line may be required if multiple
   charges exist.
   A6.6.3. (AFMC) The suspect’s name and rank is listed on the fourth line.
   A6.6.4. (AFMC) The location to be searched is listed on the fifth line. Be specific.
   A6.6.5. (AFMC) List exactly what is being sought on the sixth line. Be specific.
   A6.6.6. (AFMC) Read the paragraph and line out what does not apply to the specific
   situation.
   A6.6.7. (AFMC) After the paragraph put the requesting SF member’s name and rank.
   A6.6.8. (AFMC) Read and place an ―X‖ in the appropriate box and line through (person) or
   (premise) if one is not applicable.
   A6.6.9. (AFMC) The date authority is granted: Self-explanatory.
   A6.6.10. (AFMC) Date, time and location of granted authority: Self-explanatory.
   A6.6.11. (AFMC) Typed name, grade, organization and signature of authorizing official:
   Self-explanatory.
   A6.6.12. (AFMC) On the reverse side of the form, write or type a Probable Cause
   Statement outlining the reasons the security forces member believes potential evidence is at a
   particular place where search authority is desired. The statement should be written or typed
   on the back of the AF Form 1176 or on a sheet of bond paper prior to contacting the
   authorizing commander. The probable cause statement should be written/typed exactly as
   given to the commander. If the commander asks any further questions after being read the
   probable cause statement, the questions asked and the security force member’s response
   should be included. This may be used as evidence at a later court-martial to verify the
   probable cause for the commander issuing the authority to search (Figure A6.12).

A6.8. (AFMC) AF Form 1364, Consent for Search and Seizure. This form is used in the
same manner as the AF Form 1176, except the individual freely and voluntarily consents to a
search of their person, area under their control or personal possessions. Use this form to obtain
the consent in writing. Also, ensure the suspect and witnesses to the consent sign the appropriate
blocks on the form. When an AF Form 1364 is not available, document the consent on a plain
piece of paper as long as the individual signs it and it contains the time, date, persons and
place(s) to be searched. Ensure the person giving consent reads and fully understands that
anything found in the search can be used against them in a criminal trial or other judicial or
administrative proceedings. Inform the individual that if they do not consent to a search, the
security forces member cannot conduct a search without consent, authorization, warrant or other
authorization recognized by law. Prepare this form only in one copy and then retain it with the
case file (Figure A6.14).

A6.9. (AFMC) AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in Private Dwelling - Resident.
The MCM, Rule 302(e) requires written authority be obtained prior to apprehending a person in
a private dwelling. The AF Form 3226 is normally used to document receipt of this authority
(Figure A6.15)
   A6.9.1. (AFMC) The security forces personnel wanting this authority will complete the top
   portion of the AF Form 3226. The installation commander or appointed magistrate will sign
   the block reserved for the authorizing official. Rule 302(e) defines "dwelling" as single-
   family houses, duplexes and apartments. Private dwellings DO NOT include living areas in
   military dormitories, tents, field encampments, etc. The form is self-explanatory. Write a
   Probable Cause statement on the reverse side of the form detailing all information, giving
   facts and circumstances about the incident (Figure A6.12).
   A6.9.2. (AFMC) Prior written authority is not required if certain exigencies are present, i.e.,
   if evidence or a perceived threat exist which could cause damage, harm or loss of life or the
   destruction of evidence would occur if the search wasn’t conducted at that time, etc. In these
   cases, written authority should be obtained the duty day following the apprehension.
   A6.9.3. (AFMC) Prepare only one copy and retain it with the case file.

A6.10. (AFMC) AF Form 3545, Incident Report. Since the 1930s, the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) has been collecting crime data dealing with offenses and arrests from
county, state and Federal law enforcement agencies. In the late 70s, the law enforcement
community called for expanded use of the data and developed new guidelines for reporting crime
statistics. These guidelines were outlined in the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988,
which formed the basis of the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Since the
inception of NIBRS, two other Congressional Acts, the Victim’s Rights and Restitution Act of
1990 and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, also impacted the amount of data
collected. NIBRS requires law enforcement agencies, including the DoD, to report data to the
Department of Justice (DoJ) for inclusion in the FBI-maintained system. The DoD instituted the
Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS), in order to meet the requirements of
NIBRS. This is where the very lengthy and detailed AF Form 3545 comes into the picture. Use
the form as a worksheet while at the scene of an incident. This will ensure all the needed
information is obtained.
   A6.10.1. (AFMC) OVERVIEW: Although the form is primarily completed in the Security
   Forces Management Information System (SFMIS), it can be found in standalone electronic
   versions consisting of 6 types of pages. Multiples of the offender, victim, and property pages
   may be necessary to fully record the scope of the incident. For example there may be 3
   offenders and 3 victims. In order to document each individual’s information, the report
   writer needs 3-offender pages and 3 victim pages. To better understand the design of the
   form, below is a broad-brush overview of each page followed by block-by-block instructions
   on how to fill out the form. An understanding of the original form will also improve the
   quality of information entered into SFMIS.
       A6.10.1.1. (AFMC) Page 1, Incident and Offense Information: This page documents
       offense data, i.e. case number, time of incident, location, type of criminal activity, etc.
       A6.10.1.2. (AFMC) Page 2, Offender Information: This page documents offender
       information. There is only space for one offender. If more than one offender is involved
       in the incident, simply add a page and fill in the information.
       A6.10.1.3. (AFMC) Page 3 Victim, Witness, Complainant: This page documents the
       victim's, witness' or complainant's information. The majority of this page is designed for
       the victims, so if using it for a witness or complainant, do not fill in any of the victim
       blocks, just leave them blank.
       A6.10.1.4. (AFMC) Page 4: This page documents three different sections; property, SF
       members at incident and administrative disposition.
       A6.10.1.5. (AFMC) Page 5, Commander's Section: This page is for the offender's
       commander. If more than one offender, add additional pages with the offender and
       victim pages. The commander documents the action taken against the offender and
       forwards to the Reports and Analysis Section.
       A6.10.1.6. (AFMC) Page 6, Narrative: This page is used to document the narrative and
       any other portions of the form needed.

              a lawbreaker in the commission of a crime but is not present at the time of
              the crime.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.9.3. (AFMC) C=Conspiracy: An agreement between two or
              more persons to commit a crime.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.9.4. (AFMC) S=Solicit: To entice into illegal action.
             A6.10.1.6.4.1.10. (AFMC) Bias Motivation Codes: The object of this
             collection is to indicate whether the offender was motivated to commit the
             offense because of bias against a racial, religious, ethnic/national origin,
             sexual orientation or disability group (refer to bias motivation codes in
             Section II of the AF FM 3545). Because of the difficulty of ascertaining the
             offender’s subjective motivation, bias is to be reported only if investigation
             reveals sufficient objective facts to lead a reasonable and prudent person to
             conclude the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by bias.
             While no single fact may be conclusive, facts such as the following,
             particularly when combined are supportive of a finding of bias:
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.1. (AFMC) The offender and the victim were of different
              racial, religious, ethnic/national origin or sexual orientation groups or
              disability status.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.2. (AFMC) Bias-related       oral   comments,       written
              statements or gestures were made by the offender which indicate bias.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.3. (AFMC) Bias-related drawings, markings, symbols or
              graffiti were left at the crime scene.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.4. (AFMC) Certain objects, items or things that indicate
              bias were used or left behind, e.g., the offenders wore white sheets with
              hoods covering their faces.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.5. (AFMC) The victim is a member of a racial, religious,
              ethnic/national origin sexual orientation or disability group that is
              overwhelmingly outnumbered by members of another group in the
              neighborhood where the victim lives and the incident took place. This
              factor loses significance with the passage of time, i.e., it is most significant
              when the victim first moved into the neighborhood and becomes less and
              less significant as time passes without incident.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.6. (AFMC) The victim is visiting a neighborhood where
              previous hate crimes were committed against other members of his or her
              racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or disability group
              and where tensions remain high against the group.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.7. (AFMC) Several incidents have occurred in the same
              locality, at or about the same time and the victim are all of the same racial,
              religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or disability group.
              A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.8. (AFMC) A substantial portion of the community
              where the crime occurred perceives the incident was motivated by bias.
 88                                            AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


                     A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.9. (AFMC) The victim was engaged in activities
                     promoting his or her racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual
                     orientation or disability group, e.g., the victim, a member of the NAACP,
                     participated in gay rights demonstrations.
                     A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.10. (AFMC) The incident coincided with a holiday
                     relating to or a date of particular significance to a racial, religious,
                     ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or disability group, e.g., Martin
                     Luther King Day.
                     A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.11. (AFMC) The offender was previously involved in a
                     similar hate crime or is a member of a hate group.
                     A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.12. (AFMC) There were indications a hate group was
                     involved, e.g., a hate group claimed responsibility for the crime or was
                     active in the neighborhood.
                     A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.13. (AFMC) A historically established animosity exists
                     between the victim’s group and the offender’s group.
                     A6.10.1.6.4.1.10.14. (AFMC) The victim, although not a member of the
                     targeted racial, religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or
                     disability group, is a member of an advocacy group supporting the precepts
                     of the victim group. The aforementioned factors are not all-inclusive of the
                     types of objective facts which evidence biased motivation. Reporting
                     agencies must examine each case for facts that clearly evidence the
                     offender’s bias motivated him/her to commit the crime. Agencies must be
                     alert to misleading facts, e.g., the offender used an epithet to refer to the
                     victim’s race, but the offender and the victim were of the same race.
                     Agencies must be alert to evidence left by the offenders, which is meant to
                     give the false impression the incident was motivated by bias. Even if the
                     offender was mistaken in the belief the victim was a member of a racial,
                     religious, ethnic/national origin, sexual orientation or disability group, the
                     offense is still a hate crime as long as the offender was motivated by bias
                     against that group. For example, a middle-aged, non-gay man walking by a
                     bar frequented by gays was attacked by six teenagers who mistakenly
                     believed the victim had left the bar and was gay. Although the offenders
                     were wrong on both counts, the offense is a hate crime because it was
                     motivated by the offenders’ anti-gay bias.
EXAMPLE 1: While driving through a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood, a
black male stopped his car to repair a flat tire. A group of Mexican-American leaving a bar
across the street accosted the driver and attacked him with bottles and clubs. During the attack,
the offenders called the victim by a well-known and recognized epithet used against blacks and
told him blacks were not welcome in the neighborhood. This incident would be reported as anti-
black because blacks were not welcome in the neighborhood. This incident would be reported as
anti-black because the victim and offenders are of different races, the offenders used a racial
epithet and the facts reveal no other reason for the attack than the stated one, i.e., to keep blacks
out of the neighborhood.

EXAMPLE 2: A white juvenile male snatched a Jewish woman’s purse and in doing so,
knocked her down and called her by a well-known and recognized epithet used against Jews.
The offender’s identity is not known. Although the offender used an epithet for Jews, it is not
known whether he belongs to another religious group or whether his motive was anything more
than robbery. Because the facts are ambiguous, agencies should not report this incident as bias
motivated.
EXAMPLE 3: Overnight, unknown persons broke into a synagogue and destroyed several
religious objects. The perpetrators left a large swastika drawn on the door and wrote, ―Death to
Jews‖ on the wall. Although valuable items were present, none were stolen. Report this incident
as Anti-Jewish because the offender destroyed religious objects, left anti-Semitic words and
graffiti behind and theft did not appear to be the motive for the burglary.
EXAMPLE 4: A 29-year-old Chinese-American male was attacked by a 51-year-old white
male wielding a tire iron. The victim suffered severe lacerations and a broken arm. The incident
took place in a parking lot next to a bar. Investigation revealed the offender and victim had
previously exchanged racial insults in the bar, the offender having initiated the exchange by
calling the victim by a well known and recognized epithet used against the Japanese and
complaining the Japanese were taking away jobs from Americans. Anti-Asian/Pacific Islander
offense would be reported based on the difference in race of the victim and offender, the
exchange of racial insults and the absence of other reasons for attack.
EXAMPLE 5: An adult white male was approached by four white teenagers who requested
money for the bus. When he refused, one of the youths said to the others, ―Let’s teach this
(epithet for a gay person) a lesson.‖ The victim was punched in the face, knocked to the ground,
kicked several times and robbed of his wristwatch, ring and wallet. When he reported the crime,
the victim advised he did not know the offenders and he was not gay. The facts are ambiguous.
Although an epithet for a gay person was used by one of the offenders, the victim was not gay,
such epithets are sometimes used as general insults regardless of the target person’s sexual
orientation and in this case the offenders’ motivation appeared to be limited to obtaining money
from the victim. Therefore, the incident would not be designated bias motivated.
EXAMPLE 6: A small neighborhood bar frequented by gays burned down after being closed
for the night. Investigation revealed the fire was deliberately set. The fact that the bar was
frequented by gays may have been coincidental. Therefore, the incident is not reported as bias
motivated. Two weeks later, three white adult males were arrested on a tip from an informant.
They admitted burning down the bar, saying they did it to keep gays out of the neighborhood.
As a result, this incident should now be reported as a bias crime.
EXAMPLE 7: Six black men assaulted and seriously injured a white man and his Asian male
friend as they were walking through a residential neighborhood. Witnesses said the victims were
attacked because they were trespassing in a ―black‖ neighborhood. An Anti-Multi-Racial Group
bias incident should be reported because the victim and offenders were of different races and
witnesses reported the victims were attacked because they were not black.
EXAMPLE 8: Overnight, an auditorium, which was being used by representatives of several
religious denominations to hold an ecumenical conference, was vandalized by unknown subjects.
Extensive damage was caused and statements, such as ―There is but one true religion‖ and
―Down with the nonbelievers,‖ were spray painted onto the walls. An Anti-Multi-Religious

Group incident should be reported because the offenders clearly evidenced their hostility against
a group representing more than one religion.
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.11. (AFMC) Location/Address:          Enter the location and
                  address of the offense, i.e., Rm. 210, Bldg 100, Lackland AFB, TX 78236.
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.12. (AFMC) In U.S. (State or Possession): Enter "Yes" if the
                  offense occurred in US or its possessions.
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.13. (AFMC) Sector: Enter the sector of the installation the
                  offense occurred.
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.14. (AFMC) On Base: Enter ―Yes‖ if the offense occurred on
                  DoD or Coast Guard property.
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.15. (AFMC) Location of Offense:            Mark the appropriate
                  location. (Self-explanatory)
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.16. (AFMC) Type of Criminal Activity: Mark the appropriate
                  block. (More than one block may be marked)
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.17. (AFMC) All Illegal Entries: This data element is used
                  only if the offense is Burglary/B&E. It is for reporting whether "Force" or
                  "No Force" was used by the burglar(s) to enter the structure. A forced entry is
                  where force of any degree or a mechanical contrivance of any kind (including
                  a passkey or skeleton key), was used to unlawfully enter a building or other
                  structure. An unforced entry is one where the unlawful entry was achieved
                  without force through an unlocked door or window. If both forced and
                  unforced entries were involved in the crime, the entry should be reported as
                  having been accomplished through "Force."
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.18. (AFMC) Number of Premises Entered: This data element
                  is used only if the crime is Burglary/B&E and the "Hotel Rule" is applicable.
                  In such cases, the number (01-99) of structures (premises) entered is to be
                  reported. In the Summary Reporting System, the Hotel Rule is applied to only
                  temporary lodgings. It states: If a number of dwelling units under a single
                  manager are burglarized and the offenses are most likely to be reported to the
                  police by the manager rather than the individual tenants, the burglary should
                  be scored as one offense. The hotel rule may include military living quarters
                  with multiple dwelling units. For example, if 6 BEQs are entered at the same
                  time, it should be reported as one incident. The Hotel Rule has been expanded
                  to include rental storage facilities, i.e., "Mini-Storage" and "Self-Storage"
                  buildings. Therefore, this data element is to be used if the offense is
                  Burglary/B&E and either "Hotel/Motel/etc." or "Rental Storage Facility" is
                  entered into Location Type. The total number (up to 99) of individual rooms,
                  units, suites, storage compartments, etc., entered is to be reported in this data
                  element.
                  A6.10.1.6.4.1.19. (AFMC) Page number: Enter the report’s total number of
                  pages, i.e., 1 of 8, 1 of 6, etc. Page numbers will depend on the number of
                  offenders, victims, witnesses and length of narrative.

            A6.10.1.7.1.38. (AFMC) Type of Apprehension/Detention: Allowable codes
            are: On-View Arrest, Summons or Taken into Custody. This data element
            indicates the type of apprehension. On-View Arrest includes arrests when the
            offender is taken into custody without a warrant or previous incident report.
            Summoned/cited type is not taken into custody. Taken into custody arrest types
            are based on warrant and/or previously submitted incident report.

            the detention is DoD or another government agency. Any agency outside DoD is

        A6.10.1.8.1.1. (AFMC) Victims: Definition self-explanatory.
        A6.10.1.8.1.2. (AFMC) Witness: Defined as a person that witnessed the crime
        but was not victimized by it.
        A6.10.1.8.1.3. (AFMC) Complainants: Defined as a 3rd party person that didn’t
        witness the crime nor is a victim of the crime. For example, a victim of a crime
        asks an innocent bystander (complainant) to call 911. In this case, the
        complainant is merely reporting a crime they didn’t witness.
        A6.10.1.8.1.4. (AFMC) NOTE: A person may seem to fall into two categories
        when they report a crime if they are a victim. For example, a person calls and
        reports their car was stolen from the BX parking lot. It would appear they are a
        victim and complainant since they are reporting it stolen. Always categorize this
        type of person as a victim. Remember complainants are third party personnel that
        are not victims or witnesses.

       work phone. If victim, witness or complainant is a family member enter sponsor’s
       work phone.
       A6.10.1.8.17. (AFMC) Home phone: Enter the victim, witness or complainant’s

       A6.10.1.8.20. (AFMC) Type of Victim (VICTIM ONLY): Only one block can be

       gun at a teller and demanded and received money. The robber also pistol-whipped a
       customer who stood in his way as he made his escape from the bank. There were
       three victims; i.e., the bank, the teller and the pistol-whipped customer. Therefore,
       their codes should be entered into their respective Victim Segments. The victim type
       must agree with the offense information. For example, assault offenses should have
       Victim Type = ―I‖. Allowable codes are:
                     Individual         Government
                     Business
                     Financial          Religious Org

AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                        97


       A6.10.1.9.6. (AFMC) Ownership:       This data element describes whether the
       government or a private individual owns the property. (Refer to table 6, section V,
       AF FM 3545 for ownership codes.)
       A6.10.1.9.7. (AFMC) Value: Enter the total dollar value (up to $999,999,999) of
       the property which was burned (includes damage caused in fighting the fire),
       counterfeited, destroyed/damaged/vandalized, recovered, seized, stolen, etc., as a
       result of the incident. If the value is unknown, enter one dollar ($1.00) which means
       unknown; i.e., "1" = Unknown. The following guidelines should be used to report the
       value of property:
          A6.10.1.9.7.1. (AFMC) Use fair market value for articles subject to
          depreciation because of wear and tear, age or other factors that cause the value to
          decrease with use.
          A6.10.1.9.7.2. (AFMC) Use cost to the merchant (wholesale cost) of goods
          recovered, seized and stolen, dollar etc., from retail establishments, warehouses,
          etc. In other words, use the value representing the actual cash loss to the victim
          without any markup or profit added.
          A6.10.1.9.7.3. (AFMC) Use victim’s valuation of items such as jewelry,
          watches and other similar goods that decrease in value slightly or not at all with
          use or age.
          A6.10.1.9.7.4. (AFMC) Use replacement cost or actual cash cost to victim for
          new or almost new clothes, auto accessories, bicycles, etc.
          A6.10.1.9.7.5. (AFMC) When the victim obviously exaggerates the value of
          stolen/destroyed/damaged property for insurance or other purposes, common
          sense and good judgment will dictate a fair market value to be placed on the
          stolen items by law enforcement.
          A6.10.1.9.7.6. (AFMC) For government property, use fair market value for
          articles subject to depreciation. Use replacement cost for other types of property.
          A6.10.1.9.7.7. (AFMC) In most instances, accept the victim’s valuation. The
          theft of nonnegotiable instruments such as traveler’s checks, personal checks,
          money orders, stocks, bonds, food stamps, etc., should be scored but no value
          recorded. Again, ―hair-splitting‖ refinements are unnecessary. Negotiable
          instruments such as bonds payable to the bearer, etc., are valued at the current
          market price at the time of the theft, seizure, etc. Values should be rounded to the
          nearest whole dollar. Often the condition of the property is different at recovery
          than it was when stolen. The market value at the time of recovery should be used
          even though it is less than the value reported at the time of the theft. If the value
          has increased by the time the property is recovered, the recovery value should not
          exceed its value at the time it was stolen.
          A6.10.1.9.7.8. (AFMC) If drugs or narcotics were seized in a drug case, no
          value is to be entered into this data element, but the estimated quantity of the
          drugs/narcotics is to be reported. Therefore, when the offense is Drug/Narcotic
          violations, "Seized" was entered into Property Loss/etc, and "Drugs/ Narcotics"
98                                      AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010


        was entered into Property Description. No value is to be entered into this data
        element and Drug Code, Drug Quantity and Type Drug Measure are to be used
        instead. However, when drugs or narcotics are involved in other types of crime
        (e.g., they were stolen through burglary, robbery, theft, etc. or destroyed by arson)
        their value is to be entered into this data element and Drug Code, Drug Quantity
        and Type Drug Measure are blank.
     A6.10.1.9.8. (AFMC) Date recovered (YYYYMMDD): Enter the date the stolen
     property was recovered. Accordingly, this data element is used only if Recovered is
     entered into Data Element Type Property Loss/Etc. If there is more than one date of
     recovery for the same "Property Description," enter the earliest date. If the recovery
     date is unknown, enter the date of the report.
     A6.10.1.9.9. (AFMC) Date returned (YYYYMMDD): When previously stolen
     property is returned, the date of return is entered in this data element. Accordingly,
     this data element is used only if Recovered or Seized is entered into Data Element
     Property Loss/Etc.
     A6.10.1.9.10. (AFMC) Drug code: This data element is used to identify the types
     of drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. Refer to table 7, Section V, AF FM 3545
     for drug codes.
     A6.10.1.9.11. (AFMC) Drug quantity: This data element indicates the estimated
     quantity (up to 999,999,999) of drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. This data
     element is not used when drugs or narcotics were burned, stolen, etc., in connection
     with other offenses, such as Arson, Burglary/B&E, Larceny/Theft, etc.
     A6.10.1.9.12. (AFMC) Drug measurement: This data element indicates the type of
     measurement used in quantifying drugs or narcotics seized in a drug case. This data
     element is not used when drugs or narcotics were stolen, burned, etc. (Refer to table
     8, section V, AF FM 3545 for drug measurement codes).
     A6.10.1.9.13. (AFMC) SECTION          VI    SECURITY       FORCE      MEMBER        AT

        A6.10.1.9.15.5. (AFMC) Incident clearance reason code (S5R USE ONLY).
        This data element indicates why the incident was cleared. If the incident is not
        cleared by "Unfounded "or" Arrest", then the incident is considered to be
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          99


            exceptionally cleared. In a multiple-offense incident, the exceptional clearance of
            one offense clears the entire incident.         An incident cannot be cleared
            exceptionally if it was previously or at the same time cleared by an arrest; i.e., if
            an offender segment was or is being submitted. In order to clear an offense by
            exceptional means, the following four conditions must be met: (1) the
            investigation must have clearly and definitely established the identity of at least
            one offender; (2) sufficient probable cause must have been developed to support
            the arrest, charging and prosecution of the offender; (3) the exact location of the
            offender must be known so an arrest could be made; and (4) there must be a
            reason outside the control of law enforcement which prevents the arrest. If blank,
            this data element will be recorded to ―Not Applicable.‖
            A6.10.1.9.15.6. (AFMC) Exceptional clearance date YYYYMMDD (S5R USE
            ONLY): If an incident was cleared by exceptional means, enter the date when the
            incident was cleared. If Incident Clearance Reason contains the values A-E, this
            field is required. The clearance date cannot be earlier than the incident date.

         A6.13.31.1.1. (AFMC) Any action of violator which increased the hazard of the
         violation? If none, indicate so, i.e.: N/A, none, etc.
         A6.13.31.1.2. (AFMC) Write where the violation occurred and where the traffic
         stop took place?
         A6.13.31.1.3. (AFMC) Distance traveled during pursuit. If any, i.e. 5/10 of a mile
         or .5 miles.
         A6.13.31.1.4. (AFMC) Condition and attitude of the violator and any special
         instructions given to the violator. If there was a problem, document exactly what was
         said. If local policy dictates, record the facts on an AF Form 1168, then attach it to
         the white copy.
  A6.13.32. (AFMC) Witnesses: Write down the name of any witnesses to the violation.
  A6.13.33. (AFMC) Vehicle Defects: Self-explanatory.
  A6.13.34. (AFMC) The third copy (pink) is given to the violator or affixed to the vehicle if
  the vehicle is unattended. Complete the back of the pink copy before giving it to the violator.
  This gives the violator written reporting instructions. This must be done even if the violator
  has been given verbal instructions. Normally, the back of the pink copy is completed before
  the back of the yellow copy. This prevents the violator from being detained for an
  unnecessary amount of time. Use the following to help with filling out the back of the pink
  copy: (Figure A6.26)
      A6.13.34.1. (AFMC) Place an ―X‖ in all three of the boxes.
      A6.13.34.2. (AFMC) In the second block, write in the telephone number for the security
      forces control center in the space provided.
      A6.13.34.3. (AFMC) Write under special instructions: "Report this violation to your
      commander on your next duty day." Also, write any additional instructions the violator
      may have been given.
  A6.13.35. (AFMC) File the second (yellow) copy and give the third (pink) copy to the
  violator or place it on the windshield of the unattended vehicle. If there is inclement weather
  it may be a good idea to place the ticket in a plastic baggie.
  A6.13.36. (AFMC) The reverse side of the DD Form 1408 is used for transmittal of traffic
  violations through military channels. Ensure the violation indicated on the DD Form 1408 is
  in accordance with AFI 31-204 and all required information is carefully entered on the form.
  A6.13.37. (AFMC) Ensure the required information is annotated. If the ticket has
  administrative errors, it will be returned to S3O for correction. If the ticket needs to be
  voided, the issuing security forces member or DFC may do so. No other person has the
  authority to void a ticket.

A6.14. (AFMC) DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice.
   A6.14.1. (AFMC) This form is used when it is determined an offender will be prosecuted
   for a minor offense before a U.S. Magistrate under AFI 51-905, Use of US Magistrates for
   Trial of Misdemeanors Committed by Civilians. This violation notice is not to be issued to
   active duty military personnel in accordance with AFI 31-218(I), Motor Vehicle Traffic
   Supervision. If the nature of the offense indicates custody and arraignment of the accused is
   not appropriate, the security forces, civilian guard, police or game warden who are authorized
   to make an apprehension, arrest or to issue a violation notice or ticket, will issue this form.
   Before it is distributed, the specific address of the Clerk of the United States Court (Central
   Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address his/her communication will be
   stamped (or typed) in black ink, on the reverse of the violator’s copy (manila card stock) of
   the four-part form. The DD Form 1805 is accountable.
   A6.14.2. (AFMC) When completing the DD Form 1805, security forces personnel must
   take great care to assure each entry is legible and no entry is smudged on the chemically
   carbonized paper copies. Use the following to assist with filling out the form (Figure A6.27
   and Figure A6.28). NOTE: Required information for the violation notice may vary from
   installation to installation. Consult with the local SJA for further processing requirements.

       committed.
       A6.14.2.6. (AFMC) Block 6: Place of offense. Write the place where the violation
       occurred.
       A6.14.2.7. (AFMC) Block 7: Enter the offense committed. For example if the
       individual was speeding, the following would be written in the block ―Speeding 39 MPH
       in a 30 MPH zone.‖ Genesis radar #1922, seatbelt yes/no, insurance yes/no.
       A6.14.2.8. (AFMC) Blocks 8 through 29: Self-explanatory. The Defendant is the
       violator.
       A6.14.2.9. (AFMC) Block 30: Check item ―A‖ or ―B‖ in accordance with local
       guidance. If item ―B‖ is checked, enter the amount of the fine and the total due.
       A6.14.2.10. (AFMC) Blocks 31 through 33: Accomplish as required by local
       requirements and the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) .
       A6.14.2.11. (AFMC) Block 34: The violator’s signature is not an admission of guilt,
       but merely indicating receipt of the notice. The signature is mandatory. If the violator
       refuses to sign, then annotate the reason at the end of the probable cause statement.
AFI31-201_AFMCSUP_I 8 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                         115


     A6.14.2.12. (AFMC) Statement of Probable Cause: Provide a detailed account of the
     exact violation, as prescribed locally. Check the block which indicates the patrolman’s
     knowledge of the violation. Indicate the date that the notice was issued. The patrolman
     must sign the notice. All items on the reverse must be clear on both the white and pink
     copies of the notice.
  A6.14.3. (AFMC) After the notice is issued, the following disposition is mandatory:
     A6.14.3.1. (AFMC) The original copy (white) will be forwarded by the issuing security
     forces activity (S5R) to the Central Violations Bureau.
     A6.14.3.2. (AFMC) The second copy (pink) is maintained in S5R’s file.
     A6.14.3.3. (AFMC) The third copy (manila card stock) is given to the violator, or if it is
     a parking violation, it is placed on the vehicle. The violator is to insert the fine payment
     and mail the ticket/envelope to the Central Violations Bureau.
     A6.14.3.4. (AFMC) The violation notice will be voided only by one designated base
     official, the Defense Force Commander (DFC). This ensures the integrity of the ticket
     issuing process. The DFC is responsible to the United State Magistrate's Court and only
     voids violation notices in cases of honest mistaken identity of person or obvious legal
     error. All spoiled tickets will be disposed of according to the guidelines furnished by the
     court.
  A6.14.4. (AFMC) Ensure all required information is annotated. If the violation notice has
  administrative errors, it will be returned to the S3O.
