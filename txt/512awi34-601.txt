SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision changes the reservation process and abuse policies for lodging using the automated
system.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES.
   1.1. The 512 AW Commander oversees the Wing Lodging Program, conducts lodging
   newcomer briefings and delegates program responsibilities to the 512th Mission Support
   Group (512 MSG) Commander.
   1.2. The 512 MSG Commander administers this instruction and coordinates this program
   between 512 AW units and the 436th Force Support Squadron (FSS), designating the 512th
   Memorial Affairs Squadron (MAS) Air Reserve Technician (ART) as the 512 AW Lodging
2                                                           512AWI34-601 31 JANUARY 2011


    Representative. The 512 MSG Commander authorizes and mandates the use of the
    Automated Lodging Reservation System (ALRS) for all 512th members who require and are
    authorized lodging on designated Unit Training Assembly (UTA) periods.
    1.3. 512th Group Commanders consider up-channeling members’ requests for 50-mile
    commuting area waivers.
    1.4. 512th Squadron/Flight Commanders appoint Unit Lodging Monitors (ULMs), ensure
    new members receive the wing in-briefing on Lodging Policy and ALRS Program and notify
    the 512th Wing Lodging Representative of annual tour schedules or UTA changes.
    Commanders also approve or disapprove commuting area waivers and can take disciplinary
    action against unit members who abuse lodging privileges. In addition, commanders will
    verify the reason or cause for a “no-show” (a unit member who did not check into Lodging
    after making a confirmed reservation), or “walk-in” (a unit member who arrives at lodging
    office without a reservation).
       1.4.1. Squadron ULMs notify the 512th Wing Lodging Representative of any squadron
       level lodging requirement issues/concerns for their members and serve as unit POC on all
       lodging reservation issues. The ULM should be a full-time member of that unit and must
       report lodging problems to the 512th Wing Lodging Representatives. The ULM ensures
       members are fully briefed on the ALRS process and initial login procedures. ULMs are
       also required to provide the 512th Wing Lodging Representative the names of all new
       members requiring lodging, so they can be entered into the ALRS.
    1.5. The 512 MAS Commander provides trained Services section members to the Lodging
    Office on UTA weekends and on an as-needed basis.
    1.6. Wing Lodging Representative forwards reservation reports from the ALRS to the 436th
    Lodging Office and to the Contract Quarters reservations office in accordance with AFI 34-
    246. Air Force Lodging Program (more often if requested). The final changes will be
    presented to the Lodging Office prior to 1600 hours on the Friday before the UTA weekend.
    1.7. The 512th Wing Lodging Representative validates the no-show/no reservation list
    provided by the Contract Hotel management and the 436th Lodging Office and will provide a
    report to the respective units prior to the following UTA.
    1.8. All Unit Members coordinate changes in their lodging requirements through the ALRS
    and/or their ULMs. In addition, unit members must follow lodging procedures as directed.
    If unit members do not follow established guidelines, they will be listed as non-compliant
    and may lose their lodging privileges.
2. RESERVATIONS PROCESS.
    2.1. All unit members make lodging reservations for upcoming UTA duty periods by calling
    into the ALRS. Reservations may be made up to one year in advance, if inventory is
    available. It is the 512 AW/CC policy that reservations are made a minimum of 3 months in
    advance. Unit members requesting lodging for days other than established UTA weekends
    must arrange their lodging needs directly with the 436th Lodging Office, giving as much
    advance notice as possible. It is their responsibility to inform the Lodging Office if they are
    performing a UTA in concurrence or in conjunction with other dates. This will prevent the
    member from having to relocate to another room when their duty status changes.
512AWI34-601 31 JANUARY 2011                                                                3


  2.2. The ULMs will act as the focal point between the member and the 512th Wing Lodging
  Representative with regard to lodging issues and/or concerns.
  2.3. Unit members who need to review, change or make lodging reservations can do so via
  the ALRS at any time. Reservations and/or cancellations should be made as far in advance
  as possible. Any other lodging changes or requests involving non-UTA duty must be done
  through the 436th Lodging Office as far in advance as possible.
  2.4. The 512th Wing Lodging Representative will provide 436 FSS Lodging
  Office/Reservations with the changes in 2.3 (above) as they occur, up to 1400 hours on the
  Friday before the UTA.
  2.5. Unit members can make reservations up until 1400 hours on the Friday before the UTA
  by calling the ALRS; inventory permitting. (However, if the member waits until the week of
  the UTA to make their reservation, they assume the risk of having all local accommodations
  being full, and they may be sent to hotels of lower desirability or location). The ALRS
  system is designed to make reservations in advance through the entire Fiscal Year (FY); 512
  AW members have been briefed to make reservations in advance or they are non-compliant.
  If the member waits until Wednesday of the UTA Week to make the reservation, they will be
  listed as non-compliant with the Wing policy and their name will be provided to the
  Group/Squadron Commanders. Members may make changes or cancellations (deletions) up
  to 1400 hours of the day their scheduled to check in. After 1400 hours on the Friday of the
  UTA the member must contact the 436th Lodging Office to cancel/change existing
  reservations.
     2.5.1. The 512th Wing Lodging Representative will monitor all lodging inventory to
     ensure that unused rooms are released back to the 436th Lodging and Contracted Hotels
     in a timely manner. Most un-obligated inventory will be released on Tuesday of the UTA
     week. Reservation requests, adjustments and cancellations will be done through the
     ALRS until 1400 hours on Friday prior to the scheduled UTA. Final reports are
     forwarded to the 436 Lodging NLT 1600 on that Friday. The member will not contact
     436th Lodging directly to attempt to procure accommodations prior to 1400 hrs on the
     Friday of the UTA. The ALRS is the only source utilized to make UTA lodging
     reservations. Any deviation to requirement, (i.e. contacting the 436th lodging office to
     circumvent the system) could result in the member being required to pay for their own
     lodging accommodations.
     2.5.2. To make, change or cancel a reservation after 1400 hours Friday before a UTA,
     unit members must call the 436th Lodging Office. If they call the ALRS after 1400, they
     will be redirected to the Lodging Office for assistance.
     2.5.3. Unit members should, when speaking to a Lodging Office employee, record the
     name, rank, and duty title of that employee, as well as the date and time the contact was
     made.
  2.6. Unit members should check in after 1630 hours the Friday before a UTA weekend.
  Supervisors will not release members from duty to check in; members must be in an off-duty
  status when checking in. If not on UTA status, members must provide the Lodging Office
  with copies of applicable orders or an AF Form 40A (Record of Inactive Duty Training).

    2.7. It is the member’s responsibility to contact the Lodging Office if he or she will be
    arriving after midnight the day of scheduled check-in; otherwise, the reservation could be
    cancelled and the member listed as a no-show. Reservists who have reservations for both
    nights and do not check in on Friday before midnight (or call to confirm late check-in) will
    automatically be cancelled as of 0800 on Saturday morning. Member will be listed as a
    walk-in on Saturday and will receive whatever lodging accommodations are available (at
    their own expense). See paragraph 2.8.
    2.8. IAW AFI 34-246, A3.3.5.1 Air Reserve Component members are required to make
    advanced lodging reservations. Members who walk-in without making reservations may still
    utilize government quarters; however, the wing/unit of assignment will not pay for lodging of
    members who fail to comply with this directive.
    2.9. All lodging guests must physically check out at the Lodging Desk before 1100 hours on
    the morning after the last night of their stay. At check-out time, unit members will turn in
    their building/room keys, pay all applicable charges (including in-room snack, beverage,
    telephone and other charges) and vacate the room. (Unit members can, through the unit’s
    first sergeant, request a later checkout time). An extra day’s lodging fee will be charged for
    failure to vacate and check-out of a room by the required check-out time. Additional fees
    will be at the member’s expense and not paid by the wing.
       2.9.1. Unit members staying off-base in contract quarters are required to check-out at
       their hotel before the stated check-out time and pay all applicable room charges, if any.
    2.10. Unit members changing duty status while still lodging as guests, must notify the
    Lodging Desk before 1100 hours on the last day of that duty status. This includes paying all
    applicable charges and, if necessary, turning in room keys and vacating the room. To avoid
    this, members should verify length of stay, notify clerk of dual status and pay applicable
    charges at check-in. The most common duty status changes are those from UTA to active
    duty status, or vice-versa.
3. LODGING PRIVILEGES ABUSE.
    3.1. The 512 AW will not tolerate improper lodging use or abuse. Violations could result in
