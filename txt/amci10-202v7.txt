                                 ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. The DIRMOBFOR-Air is the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and/or Joint
   Forces Air Component Commander’s (JFACC) designated coordinating authority for air mobility
   with all commands and agencies both internal and external to the joint force. The DIRMOBFOR-Air
   is under the administrative control (ADCON) of the COMAFFOR. Exception: Unless fully mobilized,
   ADCON for ANG members is retained within the ANG (201 MSS). The DIRMOBFOR-Air is nor-
   mally a senior officer with an extensive background in air mobility operations and is familiar with the
   area of responsibility (AOR). The DIRMOBFOR-Air provides, on behalf of the COMAFFOR, guid-
   ance to the Air Mobility Division (AMD) on air mobility matters, but such guidance should be respon-
   sive to the timing and tempo of operations managed by the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC)
   director. The AOC AMD remains under the control of the AOC director who manages the execution
   of operations for the COMAFFOR. Per AFDD 2-6, Air Mobility Operations, the specific duties of the
   DIRMOBFOR-Air include:
      2.1.1.1. Coordinating the integration of intertheater air mobility capability provided by United
      States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM).
      2.1.1.2. In concert with the AOC Director, facilitating the tasking and effective and efficient
      employment of air mobility forces attached or assigned to the Joint Force Commander (JFC).
      2.1.1.3. Coordinating with the AOC director and AMD Chief to ensure that all air mobility oper-
      ations supporting the JFC are integrated into the air assessment, planning, and execution process,
      and deconflicted with other air operations.
      2.1.1.4. Coordinating with 618 TACC and 18 AF to ensure the joint force air mobility support
      requirements are met.
      2.1.1.5. Assisting in the integration and coordination of the multinational air mobility plan.
   2.1.2. The Deputy DIRMOBFOR-Air will take on the roles/responsibilities of the DIRMOBFOR-Air
   or as instructed by the DIRMOBFOR-Air.

                                               Chapter 3

                           NOMINATION AND SELECTION PROCESS

3.1. Director of Mobility Forces-Air Pre-designation.
    3.1.1. The DIRMOBFOR-Air’s pre-designation program allows USTRANSCOM to provide the most
    experienced and capable personnel to the theater as early as possible. It facilitates the DIRMOBFOR’s
    participation early in the planning process. This process also ensures USTRANSCOM and AMC have
    a living list of DIRMOBFOR-Air candidates for theater, contingency, natural disaster, or humanitar-
    ian relief operations. This list is maintained by HQ AMC/A3M and is updated as necessary.
    3.1.2. HQ AMC/A3M will be the Major Command (MAJCOM) staff point-of-entry for coordinating
    the DIRMOBFOR selection process. A1L will forward DIRMOBFOR-Air nominees to 18 AF
    through the MAJCOM staff process.
       3.1.2.1. All pre-designated DIRMOBFOR-Airs and deputies will have a Top Secret-SCI security
       clearance.
       3.1.2.2. Designated DIRMOBFOR-Air/Deputy DIRMOBFOR-Air selectees should be graduates
       of the DIRMOBFOR-Air Seminar and should be graduated or current wing commanders or vice
       commanders. This course is a formal USAF training course listed in the USAF Education and
       Training Course announcements (ETCA) PDS Code X0Q. The DIRMOBFOR-Air seminar pre-
       pares selected senior mobility officers to manage, monitor, and coordinate air mobility forces
       deploying in support of war, natural disasters, humanitarian assistance, contingency operations, or
       JCS/command specific exercises.

3.2. Contingency Selection Process. The nomination and selection process varies between contingency
and exercise operations. HQ AMC/A3M is responsible for ensuring this process is followed.
    3.2.1. DIRMOBFOR-Air Selection Process: (see Figure 3.1.)
       3.2.1.1. USTRANSCOM forwards DIRMOBFOR-Air request to HQ AMC/A3 for staffing.
       3.2.1.2. HQ AMC/A3M provides qualified list to HQ AMC/A1L. A1L checks availability of
       listed personnel and provides 18 AF/CC the finalized list of qualified and available DIRMOB-
       FOR-Air candidates for selection.
       3.2.1.3. 18 AF selection is forwarded to HQ AMC/CC for MAJCOM approval.
       3.2.1.4. Once approved by HQ AMC/CC, 18AF/CC will notify the selected DIRMOBFOR-Air
       candidate and will forward the nominee’s information to the theater commander for acceptance.
       An information copy will be sent by HQ AMC/A1L to TCDC, TCJ3, HQ AMC/A3, 618 TACC/
       CC, EMTF/CCs, and tasked unit.

3.3. Exercise Selection Process. This process is the same as for contingencies with the following addi-
tions:
    3.3.1. Requests for a DIRMOBFOR-Air should be received by HQ AMC/A3M not later than 150
    days prior to the first day of the month the deployment begins. The DIRMOBFOR-Air should be iden-
    tified 30 days prior to the first senior level planning or coordinating events. The selectee should be a
    graduate of the DIRMOBFOR-Air course or scheduled to attend prior to deployment.
    3.3.2. Once identified, the DIRMOBFOR-Air must select a support staff. This staff consists of a one
    airlift pilot, one tanker pilot, and two information management personnel. The Deputy DIRMOB-
    FOR-Air is part of the staff but is selected by the same means as the DIRMOBFOR-AIR. Liberal rank
    and Air Force specialty code (AFSC) substitutions are authorized as mission requirements dictate.
    Additionally, it may sometimes be beneficial to include an AMC security forces expert to address
    security concerns at mission support locations and to coordinate with Joint Task Force (JTF) Force
    Protection staff members. In such an instance, the DIRMOBFOR-Air may request staff augmentation
    through HQ AMC/A7S (Director of Security Forces). Early selection of both the DIRMOBFOR-Air
    and DIRMOBFOR-Air staff will facilitate the training and planning necessary for a successful opera-
    tion.

3.4. Tasking. The DIRMOBFOR-Air and staff are tasked in the Air Mobility Tasking (AMT) message
using unit type code (UTC) 9AAJE (see Attachment 2). The staff is usually tasked from resources within
the DIRMOBFOR-Air’s home unit; otherwise, the AMC functional manager sources the staff from other
units.
    3.4.1. Pre-deployed Orientation.
       3.4.1.1. Prior to operational deployment, the DIRMOBFOR-Air will normally attend a one day
       orientation at Scott AFB IL. The orientation includes USTRANSCOM, AMC, and 618 TACC
       functional area visits and briefings. If possible, the AMC visit should include a visit to the Threat
       Working Group (TWG) and attendance at a TWG principal meeting.
       3.4.1.2. The EMTFs possess experience with operations in their respective regions. DIRMOB-
       FOR-Air correspondence with the appropriate EMTF is highly encouraged during pre-deployment
       preparations.
       3.4.1.3. The DIRMOBFOR-Air may be required to visit theater HQ for orientation/briefing.
       3.4.1.4. The DIRMOBFOR-Air should review the HQ AMC/A3MC website (https://pri-
       vate.amc.af.mil/a3/a31/A31C/DIRMOBFOR%20-%20Main.htm) for the most current
       DIRMOBFOR-Air pre-deployment information and resources. The USAF EC website (https://
       www.amwc.af.mil/mob_ops/ops/dirmobfor/index.asp) is also available for the most current
       DIRMOBFOR-Air pre-deployment information and resources.

3.5. Post Deployment Actions.
    3.5.1. Within 14 days of redeployment, following a contingency or disaster/hurricane relief operation,
    the DIRMOBFOR-Air will contact HQ AMC/A3E and 18 AF/CV, to schedule an after-action debrief
    with HQ AMC/A3, 18 AF/CC and HQ AMC/CC. See HQ AMC/A3MC website for sample
    after-action report.

                                               TRAINING

4.1. USAF Expeditionary Center (USAF EC) Seminar.
    4.1.1. The USAF EC is responsible for conducting DIRMOBFOR-Air initial training. This course is
    a formal USAF training course listed in the ETCA (USAF Education and Training Course Announce-
    ments), PDS Code X0Q. The DIRMOBFOR-Air course prepares selected senior mobility officers to
    manage, monitor, and coordinate air mobility forces deploying in support of war, natural disasters,
    humanitarian assistance, contingency operations, or JCS/command specific exercises. The course
    emphasizes training with respect to a myriad of potential contingencies and teaches the students how
    to manage the demands placed on available air mobility resources. Lessons learned from former
    DIRMOBFOR-Airs and JFACCs provide baseline knowledge and help educate students using practi-
    cal applications. Candidates should be colonel (selects), colonels, and flag officers with a high degree
    of air mobility expertise. Typical candidates are active duty and Air Reserve Component (ARC) wing
    commanders, vice wing commanders, operations group commanders, and operations group deputy
    commanders.
    4.1.2. Candidates for the DIRMOBFOR-Air class should have a high potential for serving as a
    DIRMOBFOR-Air or Deputy DIRMOBFOR-Air. HQ AMC/A3M allocates class slots based on fore-
    casted requirements. Candidates may be submitted from AMC, Air Combat Command (ACC), Pacific
    Air Forces (PACAF), United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Central Air Forces (CENTAF),
    Southern Air Forces (SOUTHAF), HQ AFRC, and HQ ANG. All organizations may submit one pri-
    mary candidate and two alternates for each slot they are allocated. 30 days prior to class start date, HQ
    AMC/A3M reallocates vacant slots on an “as needed” basis.
    4.1.3. The seminar is normally conducted twice a year at the USAF EC, USTRANSCOM, and AMC.
       4.1.3.1. The training consists of a 3-day seminar emphasizing command and control (C2) lines,
       C2 concepts, communications systems, cross tell with past DIRMOBFORs, exchanging problems
       and solutions, an exercise scenario, and other topics of interest.
       4.1.3.2. DIRMOBFOR-Air candidates will, also, receive a series of briefings from the
       USTRANSCOM J3, HQ AMC/A3, 618 TACC/CC, 18 AF/CC as well as familiarization with the
       618 TACC and USTRANSCOM Deployment and Distribution Operations Center (DDOC).
    4.1.4. USAF EC will forward names of DIRMOBFOR-Air seminar graduates to HQ AMC/A3M for
    retention in a command nominee data base. The list includes name and date of attendance.
    4.1.5. Refer to the USAF EC website for current DIRMOBFOR-Air courseware: (https://
    www.amwc.af.mil/mob_ops/ops/dirmobfor/courseware.asp).

                                               Chapter 5

                        DISASTER/HURRICANE RELIEF OPERATIONS

5.1. General. DIRMOBFOR-Airs pre-designated or selected for disaster/hurricane relief operations
require additional training to handle the unique issues associated with these operations. His/her primary
objective is to ensure requests for Department of Defense (DoD) airlift support to relief operations are
expeditiously forwarded from the supported Combatant Commander to USTRANSCOM for sourcing
validation and scheduling. Secondly, the DIRMOBFOR-Air will be postured to satisfy the on-scene com-
mander’s relief requirements.

5.2. Training.
   5.2.1. In addition to the training requirements listed in Chapter 4, the following will be scheduled:
       5.2.1.1. Participation in regularly scheduled Defense Coordinating Officer (DCO) conferences.
       5.2.1.2. Attendance in the Defense Support of Civil Authorities course.
       5.2.1.3. Visit to the regional CONUS headquarters to establish a working relationship with the
       DoD liaison to FEMA.
       5.2.1.4. If possible, a visit to FEMA in Washington DC to meet with the FEMA Director and/or
       staff. This allows the DIRMOBFOR-Air to get a “macro level” view of agency expectations, the
       scope of an upcoming disaster, the strategy to cope with the disaster, and the FEMA director’s
       intent.

                        COMMAND AND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS

6.1. General.
     6.1.1. There are times when the DIRMOBFOR-Air and staff will deploy to austere locations where
     robust communications systems are not available or have not yet arrived. In these situations, the
     DIRMOBFOR-Air staff will deploy with a limited initial communications package specifically
     designed for the basic communications needs of the DIRMOBFOR-Air.
     6.1.2. Communications support typically consists of laptop computers, a color printer, scanner,
     Secure Telephone Equipment (STE), digital camera, Satellite Telephone, International Maritime Sat-
     ellite (INMARSAT) terminal, and an Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) satellite communications (SAT-
     COM) system.
     6.1.3. HQ AMC/A3M maintains two communications packages at Scott AFB IL. Appointed mem-
     bers of the DIRMOBFOR-Air staff will visit HQ AMC/A3M for one day of hands-on communica-
     tions equipment training.

6.2. Training. Appointed members of the DIRMOBFOR-Air staff will visit HQ AMC for initial
hands-on training of the communications package. Training will be approximately one day and accom-
plished by trained support personnel assigned to HQ AMC/A3M. Prior coordination with the HQ AMC/
A3MC branch chief is required to schedule all training.

6.3. Tasking. HQ AMC/A3M will task the DIRMOBFOR-Air support element via the AMT using the
9AAJF UTC. Both the equipment and support personnel will deploy using a USTRANSCOM Unit Line
Number (ULN) and are considered USTRANSCOM-assigned mobility forces supporting an 18AF-pro-
vided DIRMOBFOR-Air. These assets do not change operational control (CHOP) and will re-deploy once
the theater provides a permanent and robust communications capability. Communications package sup-
port personnel shall remain under the ADCON of the home station squadron commander and neither they
nor their equipment are eligible for “follow-on” tasking in support of non-DIRMOBFOR-Air require-
ments.

6.4. Deployment Duration. The communications package and support personnel shall only remain
deployed until the requirement for a DIRMOBFOR-Air is eliminated or a more robust communications
capability is installed. HQ AMC/A3M will coordinate all personnel rotation and equipment movement
actions with DIRMOBFOR-Air staff members to ensure seamless communications capability.
