1. General.
   1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary lists
   used during a Major Command (MAJCOM) conducted Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) to
   access unit compliance with established guidance. Items set forth in this C&SRL are based
   upon existing “by-law” requirements, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, Air Force
   (AF) and ANG guidance, NGB-JA, MAJCOM ANG assistants, and mission areas deemed
   critical by AF or ANG leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or

    performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude
    attainment of required capabilities of ANG Special Forces (SF) Units.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
    items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs)
    and the thirteen missions areas defined in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector
    General Activities. Lower tier Core and General Compliance Items may be stand alone or
    subordinate to a CCO. During the UCI, it is the expected intent of the MAJCOM Inspector
    General (IG) to inspect, at a minimum, 100 percent of the CCOs that apply to the inspected
    unit. However, the items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the Inspection
    / assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
    capabilities. Units should ensure validation of each compliance item with supporting
    documentation. Critical, core, and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item or area that represent “single-
       point failure” issues where non-compliance would result in direct mission impact or
       could very likely result in loss of life, serious injury, or significant potential for litigation.
       CCOs are shown in bold and identified as “CCO” under the item’s section number.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and
       is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed “critical.” Non-
       compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result
       in injury or possible litigation. CCIs are identified as “CCI” under the item’s section
       number.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
       successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result only in
       minimal impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or
       possible litigation. GCIs are identified as “GCI” under the item’s section number.
