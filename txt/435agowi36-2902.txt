                                             Chapter 1

                          MILITARY STANDARDS AND POLICIES

1.1. Commander’s Emphasis on Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Equal
Opportunity.
     1.1.1. The 435th Air Ground Operations Wing (435 AGOW) has a policy of zero tolerance
     for unlawful discrimination, to include sexual harassment. Airmen and civilians at all levels
     are expected to foster a healthy work environment that promotes teamwork and productivity.
     Every Airman and civilian government employee is expected to respect their fellow
     Airmen/civilian employees.
     1.1.2. Equal Opportunity is a right of all federal employees and applicants as stated in Title
     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. It is everyone's obligation to prevent
     discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, reprisal, and disability
     (mental and/or physical). The objective is to provide a work environment free of unlawful
     discrimination.
     1.1.3. Military members and civilians who have discrimination or equal opportunity
     concerns should contact the Equal Opportunity (EO) Office on Kapaun AS, Bldg 2787, at
     489-8534 or COMM 06371478534 for assistance.
     1.1.4. The 435 AGOW’s goal of maintaining a harassment-free environment for all
     employees also includes harassment based on sexual orientation. Leaders have a
     responsibility to take appropriate action to prevent and address harassment based on sexual
     orientation. Civilian violations of this policy may incur administrative action and military
     violations may be punishable under the UCMJ, and shall be addressed through command
     channels or the Inspector General.
1.2. Commander’s Emphasis on Safety.
     1.2.1. Safety is every Airman’s and civilian's responsibility. The Air Force cannot afford
     unnecessary loss of human life, productivity, or resources due to a preventable accident.
     1.2.2. Commanders are the unit’s primary safety officer. Leaders at all levels are expected
     to exemplify and enforce safety standards among their personnel to ensure mission success.
     The 435 AGOW Safety Office will assist units with safety programs and provide information
     concerning Air Force safety issues. The safety office is located in building 2202, Room 14,
     and can be reached at 480-3266, COMM 06371473266 or via e-mail at
     435.agow.safety@ramstein.af.mil.
1.3. Commander’s Emphasis on Responsible Alcohol Use.
     1.3.1. As professionals, we shall never compromise our ability to act in a professional
     manner or make intelligent decisions. Consuming alcohol, especially in large quantities,
     impairs our ability to do so.
     1.3.2. The majority of physical and sexual assaults are alcohol-related. The typical scenario
     involves a victim too intoxicated to act safely or wisely and/or a perpetrator too intoxicated
     to make an intelligent choice. While a victim’s intoxication level is no justification for being
435AGOWI36-2902 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     5


   assaulted, all members need to ensure they avoid putting themselves in harm’s way by
   drinking responsibly.
   1.3.3. Germany and Italy have very strict driving under the influence (DUI) laws and
   aggressive policing. In both countries, persons under 21 years of age are prohibited from
   driving with any alcohol in their system. Additionally, blood alcohol level over 0.05 grams
   alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood, if stopped while operating a vehicle, will result in a DWI
   or DUI. This includes being at the controls, even asleep, if the keys are readily accessible by
   the occupant as determined by the police. Police do not require probable cause to conduct a
   sobriety test and random stops are common. Alcohol consumption can lead to assignation of
   blame in the event of an auto accident. Issuing of a United States Army Europe (USAREUR)
   driver's license comes with implied consent for a blood alcohol test and failure to comply can
   lead to the immediate loss of driving privileges. I advise every Airman to refrain from
   drinking if he/she intends to drive, and have a plan and wingman if they intend to visit
   establishments where alcohol is served.
1.4. Commander’s Emphasis on Wingman Policy.
   1.4.1. It is widely recognized that most incidents involve a chain of events that could have
   been broken, preventing the incident.
   1.4.2. I expect all Airmen to be good wingmen, and help to break these chains, whether
   formally designated as one or not. Sometimes this means correcting another Airman who is
   taking unnecessary risks or acting in an unprofessional manner. It is everyone’s job to help
   create a culture of responsible choices and ensure we are living up to the Air Force's Core
   Values. Commanders will emphasize good wingman considerations and techniques.
   1.4.3. While I am emphasizing the Wingman concept, I do not expect you to use it as a
   crutch. Ultimately, each and every Airman is responsible for their own actions.
1.5. Commander’s Emphasis on Operations Security (OPSEC) Command Involvement.
   1.5.1. In accordance with AFI 10-701, Operations Security(OPSEC):
      1.5.1.1. Commanders need to ensure OPSEC is integrated into operational, support,
      exercise, and acquisition planning efforts to increase mission effectiveness. Commanders
      must determine the balance between OPSEC measures and operational needs.
      1.5.1.2. Commanders are required to consistently apply and integrate OPSEC into day-
      to-day and contingency operations.
   1.5.2. Commanders at all levels, in coordination with their OPSEC program managers or
   coordinators, will integrate an OPSEC brief into their Commander’s Calls at least once
   annually.
   1.5.3. All Airmen are responsible for being familiar with the wing-approved Critical
   Information List (Attachment 5). The 86th Airlift Wing’s (AW) Plans and Programs office is
   the point of contact for this list and can be reached at DSN 480-2966 or COMM
   06371472966.
   1.5.4. All 435 AGOW personnel will shred all produced documents (i.e., printed items,
   notes, etc) at the end of each duty day. To comply with this direction, units will use cross-cut
   shredders (not strip-cut) to remain in compliance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act
 6                                                           435AGOWI36-2902 19 JUNE 2013


     Program and DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program. Unit Security and Privacy Act
     Managers will provide additional information with regard to document protection and
     disposition, upon request.
1.6. Commander’s Emphasis on Evaluations and Decorations.
     1.6.1. Evaluations and decorations are a critical component of every Airman’s career and are
     a major factor when it comes to promotion and job opportunities. Supervisors are
     responsible for ensuring that evaluations and feedback for Airmen are completed in a timely
     fashion and decoration packages are submitted, completed, and made available to be
     presented prior to an Airman’s departure. Commanders are responsible for enforcing strict
     timelines to complete evaluations and decorations. The wing commander’s guidance is clear:
        1.6.1.1. The intent of decorations is to provide the opportunity for recognition prior to
        departure; “pin it where you win it.”
        1.6.1.2. Evaluations at the Group, and lower, will be completed no later than 30 days
        past the closeout date.
     1.6.2. Refer to the 435 AGOW Writing Guide for additional guidance on evaluations and
     decorations. Compliance with the evaluation and decoration suspenses identified in the
     writing guide is mandatory.
1.7. Commander’s Emphasis on Sponsorship and Base In-Processing.
     1.7.1. Newcomer sponsorship sets the tone for a new Airman’s arrival to a unit. Each
     squadron commander will ensure there is a sponsorship program in place, and that sponsors
     are appointed and trained in a timely manner to facilitate a smooth transition for our inbound
     Airmen. The Ramstein sponsorship guide can be found on the 435 AGOW SharePoint site
     in the 435 AGOW/CC Emphasis Items.
     1.7.2. Appointed sponsors should be from the inbound Airman’s workcenter and at least be a
     Senior Airman who has completed Airman Leadership School. Sponsors will:
        1.7.2.1. New sponsors will sign up for Sponsorship training with the Airman and Family
        Readiness Center NLT 3 duty days after being appointed.
        1.7.2.2. Initiate contact with the inbound Airman and forward any requested materials
        via email or via priority official mail.
        1.7.2.3. Make billeting arrangements and schedule unit-level in-processing appointment
        for the inbound Airman.
        1.7.2.4. Escort the inbound Airman to the Military Personnel RIP Line (or local CSS) the
        first duty day after arriving in Europe to schedule base-level in-processing appointments.
        1.7.2.5. Assist with obtaining USAREUR Drivers License and Vehicle Registration.
     1.7.3. Unit First Sergeants will ensure an active and robust Sponsorship Program is in place
     and will assist commanders and sponsors in meeting program objectives. First Sergeants will
     also assist sponsors in coordinating transportation for the inbound Airman and family from
     the airport to billeting.
435AGOWI36-2902 19 JUNE 2013                                                                    7


   1.7.4. Transition to Europe can be difficult for new arrivals. Communication is key to a
   successful wing and unit sponsorship program. Please refer any questions to your unit’s First
   Sergeant.
1.8. Commander’s Emphasis on Airmen's Dress and Appearance.
   1.8.1. All Airmen will adhere to standards of neatness, cleanliness, safety, and military
   image as outlined in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
   Airmen are reminded that Air Force members will not smoke, use smokeless tobacco
   products, drink or eat while walking in uniform or walk in uniform while using cell phones,
   radios, hands-free headsets unless required in the performance of official duties using a
   government issued device, or during an emergency.
   1.8.2. In many instances, major command and installation policies are in place to provide
   additional guidance on uniform wear. Airmen shall comply with United States Air Forces
   Europe (USAFE) and Air Force host installation policies addressing dress and appearance. The
   most current Air Force policies can be found at http://www.afpc.af.mil/dress/index.asp.
   1.8.3. 435 AGOW Airmen will not mix physical training (PT) uniforms with civilian
   clothes. Wear of the PT uniform will meet all requirements specified IAW AFI 36-2903.
   1.8.4. In accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2903, 6.1.10, the 435 AGOW/CC approves an
   exception permitting Airmen to wear the sage green fleece indoors within 435 AGOW
   facilities. However, Airmen are reminded when entering other facilities on Ramstein AB, or
   elsewhere, they are expected to comply with AFI 36-2903, or local supplements, as
   applicable.
   1.8.5. Airmen will wear a reflective belt, while on duty, during official hours of darkness,
   reduced visibility, and inclement weather. Airmen will wear the blue elastic belt with gray
   reflective stripe.
   1.8.6. It is important we uphold the highest standards of dress and appearance at all times. If
   you have uniform-related questions, please direct them to your First Sergeant.
1.9. Commander’s Emphasis on Health and Fitness.
   1.9.1. In our expeditionary Air Force, it is imperative that we are physically prepared to
   accomplish the mission at all times. Adopting a healthy, tobacco-free lifestyle with a sound
   physical fitness regimen and healthy eating habits helps ensure we are all prepared to tackle
   work and personal challenges head on. A healthy lifestyle will enhance mission readiness,
   lower stress levels, extend life expectancy, and improve physical fitness test scores.
   Commanders are encouraged to use local resources such as the Health and Wellness Center
   (HAWC) to coordinate tobacco cessation and healthy living classes. The Ramstein HAWC
   can be reached at DSN 480-4292. Geographically-Separated Units (GSU) are encouraged to
   utilize available programs from any supporting military installation.
   1.9.2. Each Airman is responsible for his or her physical fitness. Airmen will participate in
   unit-led physical training programs as required by the Unit Commander and in accordance
   with AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program. This physical training can be accomplished during
   normal duty hours or after duty hours as determined by the Unit Commander. Individuals on
   medical profiles will participate in physical training in accordance with profile parameters.
 8                                                           435AGOWI36-2902 19 JUNE 2013


     1.9.3. Commanders are encouraged to develop incentives for Airmen who score 95 or above
     on the physical fitness assessment. Incentives should be granted on the basis that the Airman
     completed all fitness assessment components.
     1.9.4. Airmen who score in the "Unsatisfactory" Category (<75 points) must complete the
     required classes as outlined in AFI 36-2905. Additionally, unit fitness programs, under the
     guidance of the Unit Commander and First Sergeant, will track physical training sessions for
     Airmen in the "Unsatisfactory" physical fitness category and will ensure a plan is in place to
     enable the Airman to pass the next fitness assessment.
     1.9.5. Civilians are encouraged to participate in a physical fitness program. The 86th
     Mission Support Squadron Civilian Personnel Flight can provide civilian fitness program
     information and can be reached at DSN 480-5850 or COMM 06371475850.
1.10. Commander’s Emphasis on Leave.
     1.10.1. Leave is a right of all military and civilian members and shall be used to the
     maximum extent possible within operational requirements. Lengthy respites from work can
     benefit everyone's physical and psychological fitness. Unit commanders will implement a
     leave program that encourages the use of leave and ensures that members do not lose leave
     due to an excess of accrued leave.
     1.10.2. Leave for Airmen normally begins and ends in the local area. In accordance with
     AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, paragraph 6.1.7, the local area is defined as the place
     where the member lives and from which he or she commutes to the duty station. Any leave
     taken in conjunction with TDY must be accounted for in the LeaveWeb program since the
     Defense Travel System (DTS) does not charge leave accordingly.
     1.10.3. Supervisors of civilians will approve civilian leave and absences on Office of
     Personnel and Management (OPM) Form 71. Supervisors will submit a copy of the OPM 71
     with the bi-weekly time and attendance sheets to the civilian timekeeper.
     1.10.4. Commanders will ensure they have a method to track leave on a daily basis in order
     to effectively recall personnel if needed.
     1.10.5. In accordance with AFI 36-3003, paragraph 8.4, regular and special pass periods will
     have no mileage restrictions. However, 435 AGOW military and emergency-essential
     civilian personnel must be able to report to work within 12 hours (or less if required by the
     Unit Commander).
     1.10.6. Force Protection Travel. Recent events have demonstrated an increased trend in the
     number and sophistication of terrorist attacks on American personnel. Terrorist methods
     include threats, bombing, kidnapping, hostage taking, hijacking, assassination, sabotage,
     arson, armed raids, attacks, and other actions intended to influence the population. Acts of
     terrorism occur routinely in some parts of the world and anyone can become a potential
     victim. Terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad serve as a reminder of the necessity
     to use personal protective measures.
     1.10.7. Department of Defense (DoD) policy requires that all DoD military and civilian
     personnel and supporting defense contractors receive an Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP)
     briefing before travel to certain countries. DoD personnel must review information available
     from the U.S. State Department (www.travel.state.gov), the Foreign Clearance Guide

   (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil) and Center for Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov/) prior to
   travel. DoD personnel will comply with all State Department and USAFE prohibitions on travel.
   1.10.8. 435 AGOW personnel assigned to the KMC will comply with the Ramstein Anti-
   terrorism guidelines in the 86 AW Integrated Defense Plan (IDP) 31-101, located in the reference
   library at https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/86AW/AT/Training/Forms/AllItems.aspx. The 86 AW
   AT/FP Office is the point of contact and can be reached at DSN 480-2115 or COMM
   06371472115. All 435 AGOW units that are geographically separated from the KMC will
   comply with local AT/FP requirements.
1.11. Commander’s Emphasis on BlackBerry and Cellular Devices Use.
   1.11.1. Blackberry and cellular devices are valuable tools that provide personnel in critical
   positions the necessary communications to accomplish the mission. In light of increased
   budget constraints, the wing continues to challenge units to reduce operational costs on the
   usage of these devices. Strictly limit Blackberry and cellular devices to only those critical
   positions necessary for mission accomplishment.
   1.11.2. Within the 435 AGOW, BlackBerry devices are authorized for personnel filling the
   following positions:     commanders, vice/deputy commanders, squadron and higher
   superintendents, and First Sergeants. Additional BlackBerry requirements beyond those
   specifically approved in this instruction will be submitted to the Group Commander for
   approval.     See attachment 2 for sample approval letter. The approval letter will be
   maintained in the group or squadron Telephone Control Officer (TCO) binder.
   1.11.3. Cellular devices are authorized for “on call” additional duty First Sergeants and
   mission critical personnel. These positions will be identified at squadron level and approved
   by the group commander within 30 days after the date of this instruction. Additional cellular
   devices will not be authorized after this date unless mission requirements change and final
   approval of the devices rests with the Group Commander. See attachment 2 for sample
   approval letter. The approval letter will be maintained in the group or squadron TCO binder.
   1.11.4. Group Commanders will review and revalidate BlackBerry and cellular device
   requirements every August. Not later than 1 September of each calendar year, Group
   Commanders will forward a list of positions approved for BlackBerry and cellular devices.
1.12. Commander’s Emphasis on Recognizing Outstanding Performers.
   1.12.1. The 435 AGOW is committed to recognizing our outstanding performers and
   considers it critical to improving morale and motivating all to strive for excellence. An
   effective recognition program requires a process that is fair and equitable.
   1.12.2. I encourage leadership at all levels to look for every opportunity to appropriately
   recognize outstanding performance. Recognition of outstanding performance is pivotal to
   fostering an atmosphere in which our Airmen and civilians know their hard efforts and
   outstanding performance are valued.
1.13. Commander’s Emphasis on Rewarding Wing Health and Performance
   1.13.1. The Airmen of the 435 AGOW make significant contributions to our challenging
   mission each day. The Commander’s Goal Day program provides a medium for tracking the
   health, safety, and readiness of our personnel. When the wing successfully meets the criteria

   located in Attachment 3, a Goal Day may be rewarded at the discretion of the 435
   AGOW/CC.
1.14. Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIRs) – see attachment 6.
