SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. Major
changes include: Requirements and procedures for hangaring of aircraft, additional USR
responsibilities.
1. Responsibilities:
     1.1. The 60 MXG/CC will ensure local operating procedures covering safety precautions for
     hangaring aircraft are coordinated with installation ground safety and fire department
     personnel.
     1.2. Quality Assurance (60 MXG/MXQA) will be the OPR for hangar door operating
     procedures. They will coordinate with Wing Safety, the Unit Safety Representative and Civil
     Engineering for outlining responsibilities and procedures for safe operation of hangar doors.
     1.3. 60 CES will provide status to the 60 MSG/CC, 60 MXG/CC, and 60 AMW/CC monthly
     on hangar door maintenance discrepancies, repair status, and get-well date of inoperable
     hangar door systems.
        1.3.1. CE will ensure hangar doors are on a 6 month preventative maintenance schedule.
     1.4. Hangar owning organizations are listed below:
        60 AMXS – 809, 818, 841, 842
        860 AMXS- 837
        60 MXS – 808, 810, 811, 843, 844, 845, 14
