THINGS TO REMEMBER
Protocol is an adherence to customs tempered with a touch of common sense,
good manners, and concern for others. (Attachment 1 contains a listing of
informative material about protocol.)
Paying attention to details, no matter how trivial they may seem at first glance,
can go a long way toward making a visit a first class affair. If you are in doubt
on any specific matter, contact your wing or base protocol office or the AETC
Protocol staff.


INVITATIONS
When possible, mail invitations to large events 4 weeks before the function.
Mail all other invitations at least 3 weeks before the event. Always mail
invitations to the business address. The recipient of an invitation should
respond within 2 days. This enables the host or hostess to make preliminary
arrangements and invite other guests if the recipient is unable to attend.
(Hopefully, the recipient won’t wait until the RSVP date.)
NOTE: A home address may be used when no business address is available.
When possible, suspense RSVPs at least 7 workdays before the event to allow
time for final preparations and confirming unknowns who have not responded.
See figures 1, 2, and 3 for sample invitations (including partially engraved and
handwritten invitations).

Engraved or Typeset Invitations. These are invitations to official events
(figure 1). If the invitation is for a military ceremony, such as a change of
command, promotion, or award ceremony, suggest you use the words
“cordially invite(s) you to attend” rather than “request(s) the pleasure of your
company.” To invite a high-ranking official to be the guest speaker at an
official social event, send the request about 3 months in advance. (It’s also a
AETCPAM 90-101        1 November 1995        3

good idea to call the guest speaker’s office and ask that the date be penciled in
on his or her calendar.) The request should be in letter format, suggest a
speaking topic, and give the local project officer’s name and telephone number.

Partially Engraved Invitations. Partially engraved cards are less expensive
and may be used for any occasion (figure 2). They are generally used by those
who entertain often and are correct for luncheons, receptions, or dinners. To
honor guests, use the phrases “In honor of _________” or “Honoring
_________.” The first phrase is used more often for prominent personalities;
the second for new arrivals. Use the conversational title (for example,
“Colonel” instead of “Lieutenant Colonel” and “General” instead of “Brigadier
General”).

AETCPAM 90-101           1 November 1995                                       5

Handwritten Invitations. Formal invitations do not have to be engraved. If the
host or hostess prefers and if the size of the party permits, the invitations may
be handwritten as illustrated in figure 3. Use the “conversational title” (for
example, “Colonel” instead of “Lieutenant Colonel” and “General” instead of
“Brigadier General”).




Figure 3. Handwritten Invitation.


A “To Remind” invitation is given to those who have already committed to an
event. It is the same as a regular invitation except it shows “To Remind” in the
bottom left corner instead of an RSVP date. It is a nice addition to the welcome
package for the distinguished visitor (DV), and it prompts him or her about
your social event.

FORMS OF ADDRESS ON ENVELOPES AND INVITATIONS
List the primary first on the envelope. Who is the primary? A person who
merits an invitation because he or she is a member of the staff, a civic leader,
etc.
For invitations, list the primary first, regardless of the spouse’s grade or gender.
Don’t be tempted to list the higher ranking individual first or to use the
traditional method of listing the male first. This is true for both handwritten
invitations and partially engraved ones. List each person with the appropriate
grade and title. Spell out the grade (except Dr, Mr, Miss, Mrs, and Ms).
EXCEPTIONS: Sometimes the primary prefers not to be listed with a grade
and title; he or she wants to be listed second, even though he or she may be the
primary invitee. If you know of this preference, you should accommodate the
individual’s wishes. For example, a female military member may prefer to be
listed as “and Mrs” (for example, “Captain and Mrs William G. Clark”) even
though she is the primary invitee or has a military grade of her own.
On the envelope, list the formal grade for each individual (“Second
Lieutenant,” “Lieutenant Colonel,” or “Brigadier General”). Some examples
are:
• Major General and Mrs John R. Doe (or)        Major General John R. Doe
                                        Commander, (name of organization)
                                                             and Mrs Doe
                                                         1 A Street Ste 01
                                             Randolph AFB TX 78150-4324
• Captain John A. and Lieutenant Mary E. Jones
• Lieutenant Colonel Susan E. and Mr John A. Smith
• Colonel John P. Davis, USAF (Retired)
NOTE: Do not use “USAF (Retired)” when you include the spouse. For
example, use “Colonel and Mrs John P. Davis.”


DEFINING DRESS REQUIREMENTS
The most common interpretation of dress requirements is provided below.
However, the area of the country and local custom often changes the usual
meaning. For example, casual in Washington DC means something different
than in San Antonio TX. When in doubt about proper dress, check with the
person or organization issuing the invitation.
Instead of using the terms casual, informal, or formal on invitations, consider
more descriptive terms such as sport shirt, coat and tie, business suit, service
dress, or mess dress. However:
AETCPAM 90-101           1 November 1995                                        7

• Casual attire means comfortably unrestricted. For men, this is a short or
  long-sleeved open-neck shirt and no tie. For ladies, any casual dress or
  slacks outfit is appropriate.
• Informal attire means coat and tie. Either a sport coat or a suit is appropriate
  for men; ladies have several options--a long or short dress or a pants suit.
• Business suit means a tie and conservative suit for men and a dressy, street-
  length or “Sunday” dress for the ladies.
• Semiformal attire for the military is the mess dress. Semiformal attire for
  civilian men is designated “black tie.” Ladies traditionally wear a cocktail
  dress, dressy pants suit, or fancy long dress.
• Formal dress is a black tail coat with a white vest. This is worn primarily in
  the Washington DC and State Department arena.
Occasionally, an officer’s spouse who is also military will ask if he or she has
the option to wear civilian attire instead of the uniform specified for military
personnel. The answer is no; the prescribed military uniform will be worn.
Therefore, if the mess dress is the prescribed military uniform, the military
spouse will wear the mess dress.


MONIES FOR SOCIAL EVENTS AND MEALS
Listed below are the three kinds of money to be used for social events and
meals. NOTE: Remember to figure in the following items (as desired): flowers
for dinner tables, meal for the guest speaker or guest of honor, wine or sherry
for toasting, wine during dinner, and after-dinner drinks.

Personal Funds. This money is collected from an individual. The amount is
usually indicated on the invitation below the “dress”:
    Business Suit
    Cost: $20.00/person
    Cash Bar [or Pay-as-you-go Bar]

Official Representation Funds (ORF). This money may be used to entertain
certain senior government officials, foreign dignitaries, members of Congress,
civic leaders, and the officials specified in AFI 65-603, Official Representation
Funds--Guidance and Procedures. Only certain designated AETC commanders
or officials are authorized to be hosts of these events. Only in very limited
circumstances may ORFs be used to pay for meals, refreshments, and other
incidentals for DoD personnel. In most cases, therefore, DoD personnel will
need to personally pay for their meals even if ORFs are used to pay for the
visiting dignitaries.

Special Morale and Welfare Monies. According to AFI 34-201, Use of
Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), these funds are usually limited to very light
8                                     AETCPAM 90-101            1 November 1995

refreshments in conjunction with a reception for visitors (if not covered under
AFI 65-603 monies) as well as amenities for conferences and briefings. See
these directives or the AETC Commanders Guide for a detailed list.
Many times, directives regarding protocol expenditures do not address all
situations in detail, but misuse or improper obligation of appropriated funds
may result in time-consuming ratification actions as well as embarrassment to
the command. Therefore, project officers must work closely with AETC
Protocol on these issues to ensure all financial issues are resolved before the
event.


DETERMINING PRECEDENCE AT OFFICIAL MILITARY
FUNCTIONS
Precedence is based primarily on grade and position. See attachment 2 for the
official order of precedence and attachment 3 for a guide for equivalent grades.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff outranks all other officers, followed
by the Chiefs of Staff (who are ranked by their date of appointment). They are
followed by active four stars (by date of rank), retired four stars, active three
stars, retired three stars, active two stars, etc. There are very few exceptions to
this. Two exceptions would be at the wing and command levels. Because of
their positions, the commander and vice commander of a wing should take
precedence over other colonels in the wing even though the other colonels may
be senior (by date of rank). Similarly, at major commands the directors and
chiefs of special staff take precedence over other staff officers of similar grade.
At official functions where participants are not all military, determining
precedence is more complicated. DoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP),
paragraph 43, gives guidance and can be obtained at your local base operations.
If you are unsure of the position of a guest, call the guest’s office and ascertain
which DV code is used for travel on a military aircraft. See attachment 2 for the
official order of precedence.
If your problem is to determine where the chief executive officer of Jones
Manufacturing fits in with a mayor and your staff, you won’t find the answer in
an official publication. The commander will have to subjectively assign a
precedence to civilians in your community. At AETC headquarters, corporate
chief executive officers are considered general-officer equivalents. Civic leaders
are usually seated alternately with the military.
If you have a large group of civilians in attendance, determine which guests are
the most important based on the purpose of the event. They can’t all sit at the
head table or in the front row. If there is logic to the way you determine the
seating, few will argue. In case of a tie, give the nod to the elected officials.
AETCPAM 90-101           1 November 1995                                       9

RECEIVING LINE PROCEDURES
For official Air Force functions, the accepted procedure follows the White
House Protocol of the principal preceding the spouse or guest through the line.
Receiving lines should consist of as few people as possible.
To welcome the new commander and spouse at a change of command, the line
may consist of the announcer (usually an aide or exec), the commander, and the
commander’s spouse. To welcome the new Officers Wives Club (OWC)
president, the line may consist of the announcer (who might be the OWC vice
president), then the outgoing president, followed by the new president.
To welcome the new OWC honorary president (the commander’s wife), the line
may consist of the announcer (in this case, perhaps the OWC president)
followed by the honorary vice president who will introduce the guest to the new
honorary president. However, the line could be limited to just the announcer
and the incoming president.
There is no iron-clad rule governing the formation and location of a receiving
line. You will have to make a case-by-case judgment, depending on the
circumstances. Make sure you set up the receiving line far enough from the
room entrance to prevent a “blockade” and to accommodate the waiting line
which will always develop. It is better for guests to wait in the room instead of
outside or in an entry hallway. Normally the primary is followed by his or her
spouse. Place a small table or stand behind the host or hostess for water or a
drink.
An announcer should be first in line to introduce the guests to the official host
or hostess who heads the line. Since the announcer is not a member of the
receiving line, he or she should lock hands behind his or her back in order to
not shake hands with guests. On some occasions, it is necessary to post a
protocol officer or “set-up” aide about 6 to 8 feet before the beginning of the
receiving line. This person will inform the guests that the primary guest goes
first and will give the announcer the primary guest’s first and last name and
title and his or her spouse’s (or guest’s) first and last name. To avoid
congestion during large affairs, a “pull-off” aide may be needed to direct guests
who have completed the line to other areas.


SEATING AT OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS
The primary determinant is date of rank (see exceptions in the paragraph titled
“Determining Precedence at Official Military Functions”) and any special
circumstances.
There are many possible seating plans shown in attachment 4 of this pamphlet,
but they don’t cover every option.
10                                    AETCPAM 90-101            1 November 1995

At mixed functions, the place of honor for the senior male guest is to the right
of the hostess. The place of honor for the senior female guest or the wife of a
male guest of honor is normally to the right of the host. (EXCEPTION: At a
table of eight when there is an equal number of couples, seat the number one
lady to the left of the host in order to have a true “boy-girl, boy-girl”
arrangement.)
At official functions, husbands and wives should be seated at the same table,
but not next to each other. On the other hand, engaged or unmarried couples
should sit together. At unofficial or social occasions (usually decided by the
host), spouses can be seated side by side.
Keep in mind, the place of honor is normally given to the senior guest (in terms
of precedence). For example, if you invite Brigadier General Smith from
XXXXX Air Force Base to be the guest speaker at your function and you also
invite Major General Jones, because of grade you should give Major General
Jones the place of honor, introduce him or her first, etc. An exception is when
the senior officer specifically agrees to defer to the junior (attachment 4).


HELPFUL HINTS REGARDING SEATING
At a large dinner, each table should have a host from the sponsoring
organization. Disperse the visiting guests and other staff members among all
the tables when possible.
At an informal gathering (such as a staff retirement party where there are no
visiting dignitaries) and if the host and hostess prefer, it is appropriate to seat
the husband and wife, as well as engaged or unmarried couples, next to each
other.
At installations where there are individuals from higher headquarters along
with tenant units, determine a seating order. This depends on the host, the
event, and whether the guest is a commander or vice commander, etc.
Seating for a military couple is determined by the principal military invitee.


PLACE CARDS
Place cards are necessary at official events. In addition, they are extremely
helpful at informal events where there is more than one table.
Place cards should be handwritten in black ink. (NOTE: Your graphics shop
may be able to help you by doing these place cards on a computer.)
Always spell out the courtesy title or grade and surname only. For example,
Lieutenant Colonel Thomas would be written as “Colonel Thomas,” Brigadier
AETCPAM 90-101           1 November 1995                                       11

General Smith as “General Smith”, and Master Sergeant Jones as “Sergeant
Jones.”
If more than one person is attending a specific function with the same grade
and last name, include the first initial to avoid confusion; for example, Colonel
C. Johnson and Colonel H. Johnson.
When a general officer is hosting an official function, use star place cards
denoting his or her grade (figure 4).
Ensure place cards for official functions always denote the grade of the host,
not the senior guest. Do not use star or organizational place cards for unofficial
functions.
If the host of an official function is not a general officer, use place cards with
the official organization emblem.
For large groups, some hosts may use place cards just for the head table, which
is less work. However, open seating for the remaining tables may increase
confusion and prevent the desired seating mix.
Place cards for chaplains may read “Chaplain (grade)” rather than just the
military grade.
In addition to putting place cards on the table, it is common practice to put a
number on each table and display an alphabetic seating chart and diagram of
the table arrangement during cocktails.


NAME TAGS
Use of name tags is optional, depending on the desires of the host and hostess.
Name tags primarily help the visiting guests remember the names and grades of
staff members and their spouses. They are normally worn on the right side to
facilitate reading during a handshake. Figure 5 shows two examples of name
tags.
There is no directive governing name tags or a standard way to prepare them.
Usually the abbreviated grade is first, then the “go by” (the name the person
usually goes by), and then the last name (Maj Gen John Smith). At a casual, in-
house affair, the host may prefer to use first and last names only (John Smith)
or to not use name tags at all. Whatever the approach, he or she should be
consistent.
Name tags have an additional purpose at an official dinner. Uncollected tags
highlight which guests have not arrived--a good thing to know before ringing
the dinner chimes.

Name tags are not normally worn with military uniforms. Exceptions are made
at the host’s discretion--usually at events with large numbers of civilian guests.
A chaplain’s name tag may read “Chap (grade),” “go-by,” and last name.


INTRODUCTIONS
Members of the head table are introduced first. One scenario might be in this
order: the master of ceremonies (MC) will introduce the host and then the
remainder of guests by grade/rank and position. Spouses are usually introduced
after each primary. After the head table, the MC will say “and honored guests”
or continue with introduction by grade/rank and position. It is desirable to have
as few introductions as possible. Another way to make introductions is by
category; for example, all wing personnel (by grade/rank and position), all
squadron personnel (by grade/rank and position), etc.
When introducing a DV’s spouse, use the lady’s title and surname only; for
example, “The First Lady, Mrs. Jones.” In a less formal setting, consider using
the spouse’s name first; for example, “Ladies (and Gentlemen), Mrs Jones, wife
of the Commander, Air Education and Training Command.” Secondly, if the
spouse agrees, use the first name in the introduction; for example, “Ladies (and
Gentlemen), Shirley Jones, wife of the . . .”.


HTOASTS
A toast is a gesture of honor proposed to a person, institution, sentiment, or the
like to whose health or in whose honor guests drink (such as the President of
the United States or the United States Air Force) prior to, during, or at the
conclusion of a meal. Air Force tradition has been to toast immediately
following the invocation. Excessive toasting can make for a long evening.
While other toasts may be appropriate, too many toasts can cause the evening to
run behind schedule and dampen the enthusiasm of the members of the mess.
Champagne or sherry are favorite beverages for toasting, but any wine is
appropriate. You would not offer a toast with a mixed drink or after-dinner
liqueur.
Do not drain a glass of champagne or wine. On the contrary, take only a sip or
two so there will be plenty of beverage left for other toasts. Even those who
don’t drink alcoholic beverages should at least raise a glass to their lips
(without sipping). Toasts to a person killed in action (KIA), missing in action
(MIA), or a prisoner of war (POW) should be made with water only. The toast
One More Roll was written and first proposed by our servicemen held captive
in North Vietnamese prisoner of war camps where only water was available for
toasting. See attachment 5 for selected toasts.
AETCPAM 90-101            1 November 1995                                        15

The person offering a toast (man or woman) should stand and raise the glass in
a salute while uttering the expression of good will and welcome for the guest of
honor. All military members and males should stand unless they are the
recipients of the toast. Nonmilitary females are not required to stand for a toast
unless it is to the President of the United States or the US flag or if the wife of
the host rises. Then common sense dictates that all females should follow suit.
The person receiving the toast remains seated while everyone else stands. After
everyone else sits down, he or she may rise, thank the person who toasted him
or her, and offer a toast in return. A woman may respond with a toast or she
may remain seated, smile at the person who toasted her, and raise her glass in a
gesture of “Thanks, and here’s to you.”


FORMAL DINNER PARTIES
The host should always escort the senior lady to the dining room first. The
hostess takes the left arm of the senior man and they enter last. (This is also a
nice touch for informal dinners.)


STAFF ATTENDANCE AT SOCIAL FUNCTIONS
Staff members are usually invited to functions to help the host and hostess
entertain the distinguished guests. Staff members should be encouraged to
arrive a few minutes early and mingle with the guests.


CEREMONIES AND PROTOCOL (INCLUDING FLAG ETIQUETTE)
As the US flag passes during a parade, civilians should stand, face the flag, and
place their right hand over their heart. When outside, military members in
uniform will render a salute. During the playing of the National Anthem (for
example, at Retreat), each person should face in the direction of the flag (if
visible) or toward the music if the flag is not visible.
When Ruffles and Flourishes and the National Anthem are played, all guests
should stand. Military members in uniform will render the hand salute. When
indoors, military members in uniform will stand at attention.
When foreign guests are in attendance at a function and national anthems are
played, the foreign anthems should be played in alphabetical order; the United
States anthem should be played LAST.
General officers who preside over a ceremony (retirement, promotion, awards,
etc.) should have their flag posted at a prominent point in the room. Only the
presiding officer’s flag will be displayed along with the US flag. (For example,
if a brigadier general is the retiring official, a one-star flag will be posted even
16                                    AETCPAM 90-101         1 November 1995

if a lieutenant general attends a retirement ceremony as a guest.) If a retired
general officer is the speaker or presiding official at an event, the hosting
organization may post the appropriate general’s flag, but it is not required. Do
not ask retired general officers to provide their own flags.
Q: Does the spouse of the retiring individual need to stand when the retiree
enters the room and the room is called to attention?
A: It is optional, but frequently spouses do stand.
Q: When should civilians stand at ceremonies?
A: All civilians (men and women) should stand during the playing of Ruffles
and Flourishes, the National Anthem, and the Air Force Song; during the
reading of promotion, retirement, and change of command orders; during
award presentations, and when the flag passes in review during a parade.
Q: How do you call the room to attention when the presiding official and the
retiree, for example, enter the room?
A: In accordance with AFPAM 36-2241, Volume 1, Promotion Fitness
Examination Study Guide, unless told otherwise, you should rise and stand at
attention when a senior official enters a room. If more than one person is
present, the person who first sees the officer calls the group to attention.
However, if there’s an officer already in the room who is equal to or has a
higher grade than the officer entering the room, do not call the room to
attention. There is no Air Force guidance that governs the announcement of an
official party entering a room. However, within Air Education and Training
Command (AETC), the common practice is as follows:
Example (Officiator and retiree or promotee entering ballroom at the Officers’
Club):
 “Ladies and Gentlemen, General John A. Doe, Jr., Commander, Air
 Education and Training Command, and Colonel Robert S. Smith.”
Example (Officiator and retiree or promotee entering the conference room in
the headquarters building):
 “Ladies and Gentlemen, The Commander.”

FLIGHT LINE ARRIVALS
As the plane pulls up, cars move into position. (See figure 6 for positions of
individuals and cars.) Once the plane comes to a stop, the cars move into
position and get ready to load. (If desired, cars may be positioned directly
behind each other instead of offset as shown in figure 6.)


AUTOMOBILE PLATES
Star plates should be placed on cars (two points down).
For special plates for designated individuals (for example, Secretary of the Air
Force or Chief of Staff), see AFR 900-3, Department of the Air Force Seal,
Organizational Emblems, Use and Display of Flags, Guidons, Streamers, and
Automobile and Aircraft Plates (projected to be AFI 36-2865).


CAR SEATING
The back right seat is the position of honor and is normally reserved for the
ranking individual (figure 7).

              THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF PRECEDENCE
Below is the official order of precedence from Service Etiquette. In the left
column are the DV codes from the DoD Flight Information Publication,
General Planning. A simple conversion system for translating DV codes into
general officer equivalents is to subtract the DV code from the base number 7.
For example, a DV code 5 equates to a two-star general (2) (7-5=2). If a
military member and a civilian have the same DV codes, the military has
precedence.
NOTE: Senior Executive Service (SES) Codes are pay levels; they do not
reflect DV status.

At some locations, there may be a number of allied officers present at a dining-
in/out. In this case, it is appropriate to collectively propose a toast to the heads of
state of all allied nations represented.
TOAST:             To The Allied Nations who are gathered with us here tonight,
                   they are Australia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the
                   United Kingdom. To The Heads of State
RESPONSE:          Hear! Hear!

After the head of each allied nation represented has been toasted, the senior allied
officer then proposes a toast.
TOAST:             To the President of the United States
RESPONSE:          To The President

If no allied nations are represented:
TOAST:             To Our Commander-in-Chief, the President of the United States
RESPONSE:          To The President

Following the president’s or senior allied officer’s toast, a toast to the Chief of Staff
of the Air Force is appropriate. Furthermore, a toast to the Chief of Staff of the
Army, Chief of Naval Operations, and Commandant of the Marine Corps is
appropriate if officers of that service are present. The senior ranking officer
representing a sister Service would then propose a toast to the Chief of Staff of the
Air Force. If this occurs, toast to Chief of Staff of the Air Force should be last.
TOAST:             To The Chief of Staff of the Air Force
RESPONSE:          To The Chief of Staff of the Air Force
AETCPAM 90-101            1 November 1995                                           41

TOAST:            “We toast our hearty comrades who have fallen from the skies
                  and were gently caught by God’s own hands to be with him on
                  high, To dwell among the soaring clouds they have known so
                  well before, From victory roll to tail chase, at heaven’s very door.
                  And as we fly among them, we’re sure to hear their plea, Take
                  care, my friend, watch your six, and do one more roll for me.” To
                  our fallen comrades killed in action, missing in action, or
                  prisoners of war!
RESPONSE:         Hear! Hear!

NOTE: This toast is appropriate if the POW-MIA flag or table is present. This
should always be the last toast and it should be made with water.

HInformal Toasts

Informal toasts are also an important part of the occasion. They should be humorous,
but in good taste. It may be advisable to “plant” some impromptu toasts to set the
tone of the evening.
For more information on toasts, refer to Service Etiquette (Third Edition, Naval
Institute Press), your installation protocol office, HQ USAF/CVAI, DSN 227-8706,
or individual allied officers for the proper terminology to be used in toasting their
heads of state.
