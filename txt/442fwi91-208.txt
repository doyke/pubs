3. Procedure.
   3.1. Preparation for lockout/tagout:
      3.1.1. Prior to initiating lockout/tagout, the authorized user will notify all affected
      employees and supervisors.
      3.1.2. Before an authorized employee turns off a machine or piece of equipment, the
      following steps must be taken.
          3.1.2.1. The authorized employee must review the machine-specific lockout/tagout
          guidelines for that machine or piece of equipment. The authorized employee must be
          knowledgeable of the types and magnitude of the energy, the hazards of the energy to
          be controlled, and the method or means by which it will be controlled.
          3.1.2.2. The authorized employee must survey, using the machine-specific guidelines
          for that machine or equipment, to locate and identify all isolating devices to be certain
          which switch(es), valve(s), or other isolating devices apply to the equipment to be
          locked or tagged out.
   3.2. Sequence of Lockout/Tagout:
      3.2.1. If the machine or equipment is operating, shut it down using normal operating
      controls.
      3.2.2. Operate the switch, valve, or other energy isolating device(s) so that the equipment
      or machine is isolated from its energy source(s).
      3.2.3. Note: Stored energy such as that in springs, elevated machinery parts, rotating fly
      wheels, hydraulic systems and air, gas, steam, or water pressure must be relieved or
      restrained by methods such as repositioning, blocking, bleeding down, or other
      acceptable methods.
      3.2.4. Lockout and tag the energy isolating device(s) with individual lock(s), tag(s), or
      other energy isolating tools (blocks, chains, etc.)
4                                                                442FWI91-208 14 JUNE 2013


       3.2.5. After ensuring that no personnel are exposed, operate the normal operating
       controls to ensure the equipment or machine will not operate.
       3.2.6. Caution: Return operating controls to the neutral or “OFF” position after
       completion of this test. Failure to do so may result in unexpected machine operation
       following restoration of energy after service is complete.
    3.3. Removing Lockout/Tagout and restoring machine or equipment to service
       3.3.1. Ensure that all servicing or maintenance is complete.
       3.3.2. Ensure that all tools, parts, mechanical locks (chocks, etc), and any like items are
       removed from the machine or equipment.
       3.3.3. Ensure that all guards, shrouds, and safety devices are properly installed and
       operational.
       3.3.4. Notify other personnel in the shop to safely withdraw from the machine area.
       Inspect to ensure the area is clear around the machine.
       3.3.5. Remove lockout and tagout devices. This step must be accomplished by the
       authorized employee who applied the lockout and tagout devices.
       3.3.6. Operate energy isolating devices to restore energy to the machine or equipment.
       3.3.7. Perform final inspection to ensure that machine or equipment is operational and
       safe for normal operation.
       3.3.8. Inform supervisor and affected personnel that the machine or equipment has been
       restored to normal operational status.
    3.4. Group Lockout/Tagout procedure
       3.4.1. When more than one worker will be required to perform servicing or maintenance
       on a machine or equipment that must be locked out, each person performing work must
       have a personal lock applied to the energy isolating devices.
       3.4.2. When a switch, valve, or other energy-isolating device cannot accept multiple
       locks or tags, one of the following must be observed:
           3.4.2.1. (Option I) A multiple lockout/tagout hasp must be used, or;
           3.4.2.2. (Option II) A single lock can be used to secure each energy isolating device
           when he key to that lock is stored in a lockbox or cabinet secured by a lock applied by
           each authorized user.
       3.4.3. In the event of a shift or personnel change when maintenance will continue by an
       authorized employee other than the one who applied the lockout/tagout, the original
       authorized employee is responsible for the orderly transfer of lockout/tagout devices.
       This transfer must be orderly and minimize exposure to other personnel. There should
       never be any period of time when there is no lockout/tagout device applied to energy
       isolating devices due to shift or personnel changes.
    3.5. Irregular Lockout/Tagout removal:
       3.5.1. Unless mission-essential circumstances warrant, only the authorized employee
       who applied the lockout/tagout device is authorized to remove it.
442FWI91-208 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       5


      3.5.2. This section outlines the steps, which must be taken when, for whatever reason, it
      is impossible to contact the authorized employee who applied the device(s), or due to an
      emergency situation, it is necessary to remove the device(s). Convenience is not a valid
      reason for invoking the provisions of irregular lockout/tagout removal.
      3.5.3. The only personnel authorized to remove lockout/tagout devices under
      circumstances outlined in the previous paragraph are the unit commander, flight chief, or
      supervisor of the authorized employee originally applying the lockout/tagout devices.
      3.5.4. Lockout/tagout devices may be removed after every effort has been made to
      contact the original authorized employee by following the steps outlined in section 3.3,
      Removing Lockout/Tagout and restoring machine or equipment to service. Cut the lock
      off.
      3.5.5. Inform original authorized employee prior to his/her next duty shift of the action
      taken and that the machine or equipment is no longer protected by lockout/tagout.
      3.5.6. Forward completed checklist (Attachment 2) and the unserviceable lock to the
      safety office by the end of the next workday.
4. Lockout/Tagout Program Provisions.

           commander, flight chief, supervisor, or safety office determines there are
           inadequacies in personnel knowledge or use of the energy control procedure.
       4.1.6. Lockout is the preferred method of energy isolation and control and provides the
       highest level of personnel protection. Tagouts may evoke a false sense of security and
       their meaning needs to be understood as part of the overall energy control program. If a
       tagout must be used as required by a particular situation, the following must be noted and
       included in authorized user and affected worker training.
           4.1.6.1. Tags are warning devices and do not provide physical restraint as locks do.
           4.1.6.2. When tags are attached to a machine or piece of equipment, the tag is not to
           be removed, bypassed, or ignored by personnel.

     4.3.2. This procedure does not apply to maintenance of equipment permanently attached,
     affixed, or contained in aircraft or ground vehicles.
     4.3.3. This procedure may apply in facility common areas, when unit personnel perform
     required tasks that expose them to unexpected energization or start-up of equipment or
     machines. Affected facility managers or supervisors must evaluate each circumstance
     under their control for applicability. Training requirements, group lockout/tagout
     provisions, and all steps in the lockout/tagout procedure must be strictly followed in these
     events.
     4.3.4. For maintenance, servicing, security, condemnation, or identification of hazards
     falling outside the scope of lockout/tagout, the Air Force mishap prevention tags (AF
     IMTs 979 Danger Tag, AF IMT980, Caution Tag, AF IMT981 Out of Order Tag, and
     AF IMT982) will be employed.
  4.4. Self-Inspection of Lockout/Tagout program
     4.4.1. The safety office will conduct regular inspections of lockout/tagout procedures.
     This will be performed to ensure that the procedures outlined in this program are
     followed by authorized lockout/tagout personnel.
     4.4.2. Within each flight, authorized lockout/tagout users will conduct annual reviews of
     other authorized lockout/tagout users, as determined by the flight chief.
         4.4.2.1. The flight chief will ensure all authorized lockout/tagout users are included
         in the process.
         4.4.2.2. Reviews will be conducted while a typical lockout/tagout procedure is
         actually performed by another authorized lockout/tagout employee.
         4.4.2.3. The designated evaluator will observe the lockout/tagout procedure from
         initial shutdown of the machinery or equipment until all safeguards are removed and
         the machinery or equipment is restored to service.
         4.4.2.4. The "Lockout/Tagout procedure checklist" (Attachment "1") will be
