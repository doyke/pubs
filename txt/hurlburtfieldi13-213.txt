                           PURPOSE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose.
   1.1.1. The Hurlburt Field Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is designed to create a safe and
   efficient airfield environment by ensuring all drivers have the most up-to-date training
   available. While the operation of motor vehicles is necessary on the airfield, they pose a
   marked risk to both aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and/or a disregard for
   established procedures are the primary sources of accidents, incidents, and personnel injury
   with motor vehicles on the airfield.
   1.1.2. The use of vehicles on the airfield will be limited to the minimum required to
   accomplish the mission. Only qualified personnel with assigned duties requiring them to
   drive on the airfield will be trained. Personnel driving on the airfield must be knowledgeable
   of, and comply with, this instruction.
1.2. 1st Special Operations Wing Commander Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. Ensure personnel and agencies support the ADP.
      1.2.1.1. May reinstate airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential
      duties following suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Authority may not be
      delegated.
      1.2.1.2. Approve publication of this Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
      1.2.1.3. Requests an AF Runway Safety Action Team (AFRSAT) through the Major
      Command (MAJCOM) if there are recurring problems with runway incursions. See AFI
      13-204, Volume 2, Airfield Operations Standardization and Evaluations for additional
      information.
      1.2.1.4. Reviews runway incursion incidents and corrective actions taken.
   1.2.2. 1st Special Operations Group Commander Responsibilities.
      1.2.2.1. Reviews Controlled Movement Violations (CMAVs) and corrective actions
      taken during the Airfield Operations Board (AOB).
      1.2.2.2. Implements and chairs a Runway Incursion Prevention Working Group
      (RIPWG) if there are more than two runway incursions within a six month period. Note:
      The RIPWG shall convene within 30 days after the second runway incursion.
      1.2.2.3. The RIPWG will include OSS/CC, AOF/CC, Airfield Manager (AFM), Deputy
      Airfield Manager (DAFM), Tower Chief Controller, Flight Safety, Unit Commanders
      and/or unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPMs), and other organizational
      leadership as determined locally. RIPWG shall take the following actions:
          1.2.2.3.1. Analyze each runway incursion and corrective actions taken.
          1.2.2.3.2. Evaluate the airfield driving operating procedures/standards and airfield
          configuration (to include signs/marking/lighting) to determine if corrective actions
          are needed.

    1.2.2.3.3. Develop strategies to prevent the reoccurrence of runway incursions.
    Examples include but are not limited to:
       1.2.2.3.3.1. Increase or improve local training or testing materials.
       1.2.2.3.3.2. Implement mandatory briefings to all airfield drivers, aircrew and Air
       Traffic Control (ATC) personnel, as applicable.
       1.2.2.3.3.3. Limit runway      crossings    and/or   limit   crossings   to   certain
       taxiways/road intersections.
       1.2.2.3.3.4. Increase penalty for CMAVs.
       1.2.2.3.3.5. Alter the shape and/or increase the size of the Controlled Movement
       Area (CMA).
       1.2.2.3.3.6. Determine if additional signage, markings, and lighting are needed in
       high-risk areas. Examples of additional signs, markings, and lighting include the
       following:
          1.2.2.3.3.6.1. Installing “Stop, Do Not Enter, Contact Air Traffic Control
          Tower” signs/markings at runway hold lines and roads leading to the runway.
          1.2.2.3.3.6.2. Increasing visibility of runway hold position markings by
          increasing the width of the yellow stripes from 6 to 12 inches.
          1.2.2.3.3.6.3. Painting runway hold position signs on pavement prior to the
          runway hold position markings (See FAA AC 150/5340-1).
          1.2.2.3.3.6.4. Painting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enhanced
          taxiway centerline marking prior to the runway hold position markings.

       2.1.1.3. Possess an AF Form 483 endorsed for airfield driving at Hurlburt Field.
   2.1.2. AM does not provide airfield escorts for personnel requiring access to the airfield. If
   escorts are required, the agency sponsoring the individuals or event is required to provide
   qualified escorts. Personnel acting as an escort must be authorized and certified to drive on
   the airfield in the duties they are about to perform (CMA or Non-CMA). Sponsoring unit
   (escort) must maintain positive control of all personnel working on or near the airfield and all
   persons within their group.
   2.1.3. Personnel driving on the airfield must complete airfield driver’s training or be
   escorted by a vehicle driver possessing a valid AF Form 483 prior to entry to the airfield.
   2.1.4. All training and documentation will be completed on the Airfield Driving database at
   https://private.amc.af.mil/ADTP.
2.2. Online Database Population. (Step 1).
   2.2.1. All personnel requiring Hurlburt Field airfield driving certification will upload their
   personal information into the Airfield Driving database.

   database. All personnel will complete electronic checklist IAW this ADI.
       2.3.1.1. All items must be completed prior to unit ADPM’s review/certification. If the
       trainee does not require access to the runway, the unit ADPM will need to annotate
       “Airfield” (A) as their restriction.
       2.3.1.2. Unit personnel who are not trained and certified to drive at night must have their
       AF Form 483 restricted to “Daytime Only” (D). If the individual later requires training,
       the unit ADPM will conduct training and revise the individual’s restrictions.
       2.3.1.3. Any restrictions imposed on a civilian license (e.g., glasses required) must be
       complied with while operating on the airfield.
   2.3.2. The qualified unit trainer is responsible for ensuring the trainee is trained on:
HURLBURTFIELDI13-213 14 AUGUST 2013                                                            17


     2.3.2.1. Classroom (HFI 13-213): All trainees must review HFI 13-213. Training must
     cover vehicle operating principles as well as local airfield layout. Ensure special attention

     procedures in this instruction before completing day and/or night airfield orientation
     training.
     2.3.2.2. Day Airfield Orientation Training (Orientation/Practical): At a minimum, the
     practical airfield drivers’ training involves taking individuals out on the airfield to show
     them how to get to and from their work areas. In addition to general procedures in this
     instruction, emphasis should be placed on vehicle operating procedures in the vicinity of
     aircraft and the airfield layout. Ensure markings used to define the boundaries of the
     CMA (markings and signs) are emphasized. Also, ensure proper radio phraseology is
     trained if getting CMA qualified. During day orientation previously experienced airfield
     drivers need to be shown the VFR/Instrument hold lines, airfield complexity/layout,
     CMAV trends, work routes, speed limits and any pertinent information concerning each
     unit.
     2.3.2.3. Night Airfield Orientation Training (Orientation/Practical): At a minimum,
     nighttime airfield orientation training must include practical driving on the airfield during

     verification. Note: This process can be administered if the ADLS website is not working
     properly.
     2.3.2.6. Light Gun recognition (CMA Only): During the practical night airfield
     orientation training, the trainer will request a light gun signal test with the ATC Tower to
     familiarize airfield drivers with light gun signal procedures. Non-CMA drivers complete
     this process during their CBT training.
     2.3.2.7. Airfield Map: Individual must know the location of the runway, taxiways,
     aprons, perimeter road, airfield access points, etc. The final certification will be given
     during Step 4 of the online airfield drivers training.

          performed and signed off by AM personnel online during initial training only.
          2.3.2.9.2. Access to the CMA will not be granted without a passing color vision test.
          Individuals that fail the color vision test can be issued a limited access (L) on their AF
          Form 483 and/or be referred to 1 SOMDG Optometry Clinic for further screening.
       2.3.2.10. AF Form 1313, Driving Record: ADPM will check driving record information
       located at 1 SOSFS prior to certification.
   2.3.3. To gain access onto Eglin AFB and Duke Field, individuals must complete training
   for those bases during Step 2. Extra training can be conducted through the Airfield Driving
   database or one-on-one training with the UADPM. Training includes:

   2.4.2. Unit ADPM or their alternate will administer airfield drivers’ pre-tests.
       2.4.2.1. Units that require CMA access will have 5 communication test questions
       populated into their unit test that will be automatic failures if missed. 100% is needed on
       the communication questions to pass this portion of the pre-test.
       2.4.2.2. Communication questions are in areas of basic communication principles,
       phonetic alphabet, Standard aviation phraseology, escort phraseology/rules, and
       simulation of radio communications between a vehicle operator and ATC Tower. (e.g,
       initial radio contact, crossing active runway, hold short instructions, etc.)
   2.4.3. All training requirements are to be accomplished before airfield certification can be
   granted. All documentation and dates of instruction/orientations will be completed within 30
   days of start date. Annual refresher will be conducted within 365 days of the previous CBT
   completion date, no later than the first day of the preceding month. Failure to complete
   annual refresher training will entail personnel incurring a violation IAW paragraph 5.4.3.6 of
   this instruction. Note: The AF Form 483 may be laminated. Personnel that are not able to
   complete refresher training due to deployment and/or TDY must complete it prior to driving
   on the airfield.
2.5. Airfield Driving Certification. (Step 4).
   2.5.1. Airfield Test Administration and Certification.
       2.5.1.1. AM, 1 SOSS/OSAB, will administer the final written test, map test and

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. Airfield Diagram (See Attachment 2).
3.2. Vehicle Operations.
   3.2.1. Using the airfield for convenience is prohibited. Do not use the airfield as a short cut
   when there are accessible roads off of the airfield.
   3.2.2. Runway crossings are restricted and limited to mission essential operations only. No
   vehicle will cross the runway when the perimeter road could be used. The perimeter road is
   designated as the primary means for all traffic to gain access to facilities on the North and
   South sides of the runway.
   3.2.3. No vehicle or pedestrian will enter the CMA without approval from the ATC Tower.
   3.2.4. All vehicles will stop prior to entering the airfield or crossing a taxiway and determine
   visually that the way is clear before proceeding. Aircraft have the right of way at all times.
   Vehicles will never overtake or pass a taxiing aircraft.
   3.2.5. With the exception of a Transient Alert “FOLLOW ME” vehicle, no vehicle will be
   driven into the path of a taxiing aircraft. Never drive a vehicle between a “FOLLOW ME”
   vehicle and an aircraft, a marshaller and an aircraft, or a fire truck, and an aircraft when the
   fire truck has its emergency lights on.
   3.2.6. When driving on the airfield, drivers will follow the basic rules of the road. Random
   travel on the airfield is not authorized. Vehicles traveling on taxiways and aprons will not
   drive on the center/taxi lines unless performing official duties.
   3.2.7. No vehicle will be driven within 50 feet of any fueling/refueling operation unless
   specifically authorized by a directive.
   3.2.8. Helicopters operate (hover and ground taxi) on taxiways. It is important that drivers
   “look up” as much as out when driving in helicopter operating areas. Drivers must be
   familiar with designated helicopter operating areas on Hurlburt Field.
   3.2.9. Any disabled vehicle on the airfield will be immediately reported to AM. When a
   vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every means will be
   used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum, the ground vehicle operator will:
      3.2.9.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
      3.2.9.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
      “All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
      Management, Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center”. State the nature of the
      problem and report your position on the airfield.
      3.2.9.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g. security forces, civil
      engineering, transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled
      vehicle off of the airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways,
      or runway.
 22                                           HURLBURTFIELDI13-213 14 AUGUST 2013


       3.2.9.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and
       continue attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
       3.2.9.5. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will
       immediately notify ATCT and AM by any means possible to coordinate expeditious
       removal of the disabled vehicle from the CMA.
          3.2.9.5.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended
          in the CMA.
          3.2.9.5.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
          safest way possible.
       3.2.9.6. The driver will establish contact with an applicable control center and the
       owning unit must coordinate vehicle removal.
3.3. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Procedures. All vehicles and personnel must obtain
ATC Tower permission prior to entering the CMA and maintain direct two-way radio
communications with the ATC Tower while in the CMA. After exiting the CMA, drivers will
inform the ATC Tower that they are off the CMA. When operating around the CMA, the vehicle
operator must verbally acknowledge all hold short instructions. See Table 4.2 for proper
radio terminology. See Attachment 2.4 for high potential or history of CMAVs.
   3.3.1. Hurlburt Field consists of two CMA areas (depicted in Attachment 2):
       3.3.1.1. Runway 18/36: The CMA is the paved surface of the runway and overruns, the
       paved surface between the taxiway hold lines and the runway, and the infield area within
       75’ of the east/west edges of runway (Attachment 2).
       3.3.1.2. Landing Lane 18H/36H: The landing lane CMA is the paved surface of the
       landing lane, the paved surface between the taxiway hold lines and the landing lane, and
       the infield/overrun within 75’ of the north and west paved landing lane edges.
       3.3.1.3. When the INST vehicle control lights are illuminated RED, any area on the
       runway side of the INST hold lines are considered part of the CMA (Figure 3.13.2).
Note: Personnel and vehicles operating in the controlled movement area require tower approval
and must maintain two-way radio contact with the tower at all times. Vehicles may not proceed
past the instrument hold line unless approved by the Tower.
       3.3.1.4. Non-CMA: All aircraft parking ramps, taxiways, and apron areas inside the
       airfield perimeter fence to include all access roads and perimeter road.
   3.3.2. Vehicle traffic on the CMAs must be kept to the absolute minimum required for
   mission support. Routine traffic not requiring CMA access (e.g. not on the CMA for an
   inspection, emergency, etc.) must utilize perimeter road. If vehicle crossing of a CMA is
   required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
   3.3.3. Vehicles operating in the CMA must be equipped with and use a rotating beacon
   and/or hazard/warning flashers. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have
   a permanent radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATC Tower. A hand-held
   radio should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the
   vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
HURLBURTFIELDI13-213 14 AUGUST 2013                                                         23


  3.3.4. CMA Communications and Radio Procedures/Communication.
     3.3.4.1. Before contacting Ground Control, operators will look in all directions to verify
     no aircraft are on final, ready for takeoff, or in the local traffic pattern.
     3.3.4.2. Personnel will contact the ATC Tower (call sign “Hurlburt Ground”) via the
     base land mobile radio Ramp Net and continuously monitor the Ramp Net while within
     the CMA.
     3.3.4.3. Based on traffic, Ground Control may not respond to requests when aircraft are
     within five miles of the airfield or ready for departure. Exceptions: Fire Department,
     Airfield Management, Barrier Maintenance, Supervisors of Flying, BASH teams, and
     Transient Alert.
     3.3.4.4. Vehicles will only use approved call signs as described in Attachment 4. AM
     may approve temporary call signs in coordination with the ATC Tower on a case-by-case
     basis. Note: Do not use a call sign that is also a part of ATC phraseology such as “Taxi”.
     3.3.4.5. Blanket clearance will not be approved by ATC.
     3.3.4.6. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single most
     important thought in communications with the ATC Tower is understanding. It is
     essential to acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the
     appropriate call sign.
     3.3.4.7. Brevity is important therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as
     possible. However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly
     carry out their control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what
     the controller wants them to do.
     3.3.4.8. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
     communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
     active runway.
     3.3.4.9. Radio Phraseology.
        3.3.4.9.1. Radio transmissions are monitored by AM and the ATC Tower at all times.
        Violating radio phraseology requirements can result in loss of driving privileges. See
        Table 4.2 for defined phraseology terms.
        3.3.4.9.2. All radio communications will be kept to the minimum required for
        mission accomplishment.
        3.3.4.9.3. The words “CLEAR”, “CLEARED” or “CLEARANCE” will never be
        used by vehicles or personnel on the radio. These words are reserved for
        communication between the ATC Tower and aircraft. Exception: Vehicle operators
        may reply “Loud and Clear” in response to an ATCT request for radio transmission
        quality or clarity.
        3.3.4.9.4. It is mandatory that all “HOLD SHORT” or “PROCEED” instructions
        issued by the ATC Tower are acknowledged and read back verbatim. A
        vehicle/pedestrian will not enter the CMA until instructions issued by the ATC Tower
        are read back. Vehicle operators and pedestrians must listen carefully and repeat ATC
        Tower instructions as they understand them. Note: If there is uncertainty or confusion

             about tower’s instructions, request tower to repeat or explain clearly. If additional
             instructions are unclear, exit the CMA immediately and advise tower when out of the
             CMA. Personnel must monitor the frequency once approved on the CMA.
             3.3.4.9.5. Always ensure radios are keyed prior to beginning the transmission to
             prevent parts of the communications being cut off. Also ensure that the radio mike
             does not have wind blowing into or across it while transmitting.
             3.3.4.9.6. Normal communication sequence:
                3.3.4.9.6.1. Call sign of station being called (who you are calling).
                3.3.4.9.6.2. Your call sign (who you are).

            3.3.4.9.8. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and
            allow time for correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has
            transmitted, or if you do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller

         to repeat it. Good communications only occur when each party knows and
         understands what the other is saying.
         3.3.4.9.9. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ATC
         Tower and other persons know that the message was received.
         3.3.4.9.10. Vehicle operators must always give aircraft and ATC Tower
         transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
  3.3.5. Procedures for Radio failure:
     3.3.5.1. In the event of radio failure the ATC Tower may need to recall personnel and
     vehicles to a safe distance from the runway or other movement area. If on the runway the
     ATC Tower will flash runway edge lights on and off. If that does not work the tower will
     use the light gun as a back-up measure. If these procedures do not work, the ATC Tower
     will notify AM for assistance. Personnel/vehicles should immediately exit the
     runway/movement area when instructed and remain off. Contact ATC Tower or AM
     immediately and advise off the runway and include any pertinent information that might
     affect safe runway operations. Report incident to AM immediately.
     3.3.5.2. If a vehicle operator experiences a radio failure while on a CMA, the operator
     will vacate the CMA at the nearest exit point and notify the ATC Tower or Airfield
     Management via land-line or cellular communications.
     3.3.5.3. If radio failure occurs and cellular communications are not available, after
     vacating the CMA the vehicle operator will turn the vehicle towards the ATC Tower and
     start flashing the vehicle headlights. Wait for the ATC Tower to signal via the light gun.
  3.3.6. Radio Techniques.
     3.3.6.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
     transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver
     causing the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
     3.3.6.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to
     say before you say it.
     3.3.6.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the
     “microphone button”, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is
     transmitted clearly. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
     3.3.6.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again.
     The controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different
     frequency, or scanning the runway to enable your request.
     3.3.6.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
     recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
     position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
     unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
     “hot mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
     problem.

      3.3.6.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and
      the ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio
      blind spots.
   3.3.7. Escorts will request permission to proceed by using their call sign, the term “plus,”
   and the number of vehicles to be escorted.
   3.3.8. During periods when airfield operations are suspended or the ATC Tower is not
   manned, only emergency vehicles responding to an emergency and aircraft tows are
   permitted to cross the runway. All other vehicles must utilize perimeter road.
3.4. Restricted and Controlled Areas.
   3.4.1. The Hurlburt Field airfield is a Controlled Area.
   3.4.2. Restricted Areas.
      3.4.2.1. All restricted area aircraft parking ramps are defined with a red line (Attachment
      2). The compass rose and the flare ramp become restricted areas when an aircraft
      requiring restricted access is placed on them. Restricted areas can also be found in some
      hangars and wash racks.
      3.4.2.2. Solid red lines painted on the pavement identify restricted areas. Only use
      authorized Entry Control Points ECP) to enter a restricted area. ECPs are identified by
      painted black boxes on the pavement, outlined by a red line, with white diagonal lines
      across the box (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1. Entry Control Point




   3.4.3. Airfield Entry Points have motorized gates for airfield security.
      3.4.3.1. All drivers operating motorized vehicles within the Controlled Area must be in
      possession of a valid Hurlburt Field certified AF Form 483 or be escorted by an airfield
      driving certified vehicle operator.
      3.4.3.2. Certification of airfield driving qualifications and possession of an AF Form 483
      constitutes permission to access and operate a vehicle within the Controlled Area.
      However, operators require an AF Form 1199D, USAF Restricted Area Badge for
      Restricted Area access.
