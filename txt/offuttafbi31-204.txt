2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
   2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on Offutt AFB is a privilege
   granted by the installation commander. Motor vehicle operators will comply with the laws
   and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation.
   Failure to comply with the laws and instructions can result in administrative action, punitive
   action or both.
   2.1.2. Persons who accept the privilege must:
      2.1.2.1. Lawfully be licensed to operate motor vehicles in appropriate classifications and
      not be under suspension or revocation in any State.
      2.1.2.2. Possess, while operating a motor vehicle, and produce on request by law
      enforcement personnel, the following:
          2.1.2.2.1. Proof of vehicle ownership, or State registration if required by the issuing
          State. All vehicles being operated on Offutt AFB will display license plates in
          accordance with the requirements of the state where the vehicle is licensed.
              2.1.2.2.1.1. Under the Service Members Civil Relief Act of 2003, military
              members may retain their original state of residency throughout their service,
              despite living in various states solely by reason of their military service. The Act,
              by implication, allows military members to register their vehicles in one of two
              places, either their state of residence or the state in which they are currently
              living. Military members stationed at Offutt AFB and living in Nebraska or Iowa
              have only two options for registering their vehicles, their state or Nebraska/Iowa
              as applicable.
          2.1.2.2.2. A valid State or international driver‘s license (with appropriate
          classifications, as applicable to the class vehicle to be operated) and a valid access
          credential (i.e. Common Access Card, AF Form 75, Visitor Pass) when on Offutt
          AFB .
              2.1.2.2.2.1. Acceptable identification media for escorted/unescorted entry to the
              installation is identified in the Installation Defense Plan. International driver‘s
              licenses are valid up to 30 days upon arrival at the installation, after which only
              valid state licenses are permitted. For a complete explanation of available license
              or permits, see Nebraska Statutes, Chapter 60, section 60-480. Operators‘
              Licenses: classification. A valid state operator‘s permit or international driver‘s
              license is required to operate any motor vehicle and must be in the physical
              possession of the operator.
              2.1.2.2.2.2. Security Forces may conduct a National Crime Information Center
              (NCIC) check to verify the status of an individual‘s driver‘s license. Individuals
              cited for driving without a valid state operator‘s permit must report to 55 SFS
              Reports and Analysis with a valid license within 72 hours. Failure to comply will

                result the citation being processed to the unit for command action.
                2.1.2.2.2.3. Persons who knowingly allow an unlicensed driver to operate a motor
                vehicle are subject to a one-year revocation of their installation driving privileges.
                2.1.2.2.2.4. If a person is driving on Offutt AFB with a learner‘s permit, the
                passenger in the vehicle must be twenty-one years of age and must also possess a
                valid operator‘s license.
            2.1.2.2.3. Valid proof of insurance. Proof of insurance consists of an insurance card,
            or other documents issued by the insurance company, that has a policy effective date
            and an expiration date. Vehicle operators must maintain the minimum levels of
            insurance required by Nebraska Motor Vehicle laws. Operating or allowing the
            operation of a motor vehicle not insured to the minimum requirements of the state of
            Nebraska will result in a 1-year revocation of the vehicle owner‘s installation driving
            privileges.
                2.1.2.2.3.1. Proof of Financial Responsibility/Evidence of Insurance.             An
                individual cited for failure to provide proof of financial responsibility or evidence
                of insurance must provide proof the next duty day (72 hours if cited during the
                weekend) after being cited for driving without insurance to the 55 SFS Reports
                and Analysis section. Failure to provide valid proof of insurance within the
                prescribed time frame will result in the initiation of a one year revocation of base
                driving privileges. Individual‘s driving without insurance at the time of the
                violation will have their base driving privileges revoked for a period of one year.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
     2.2.1. Defense forces will conduct random installation entry/exit vehicle checks (RIEVCs)
     as directed by the Installation Commander or delegated authority. The intent is to protect the
     security of the command and to protect government property. RIEVCs are not conducted
     merely to establish probable cause; inspections ensure the security, military fitness, and good
     order and discipline of the command, and may include an examination to locate and
     confiscate unlawful weapons and other contraband. The Installation Commander has
     delegated the authority to determine when, where and how to implement the checks to the 55
     MSG/CC. Specific procedures for RIEVCs are contained in the Installation Defense Plan.
     2.2.2. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
     POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it‘s necessary to enforce a
     traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential
tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to
accepting installation driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained,
apprehended, or cited for any impaired driving offense committed while driving or in physical
control of a motor vehicle on Offutt AFB.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges, drivers give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of
their POV if their POV is: 1) illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) interferes with traffic
operations; 3) creates a safety hazard; 4) is disabled by accident or incident; 5) left unattended in,
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   9


or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area; and 6) abandoned. Drivers also agree to
reimburse an authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should
a need arise to remove or impound their motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
Refer to Chapter 6 for specific information on vehicle towing and impoundment.
   2.4.1. Implied Consent warning signs are posted at each Installation Entry Control Point.
   2.4.2. An ―unreasonable period‖ is defined as a period of time in excess of 7 consecutive
   days. Abandoned is defined as any vehicle left parked for an unreasonable period, the
   vehicle owner is unknown and cannot be determined, or the vehicle displays an unsightly
   appearance (e.g., flat tires, broken windows, on working blocks, missing parts). In either
   case, the vehicle is subject to towing.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. The Installation Commander or
designee may suspend or revoke installation driving privileges for lawful reasons both related
and unrelated to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations.
   2.5.1. 55 MSG/CC (55 MSG/CD or 55 MSG/DD in the 55 MSG/CCs absence) is designated
   as the suspension/revocation authority for all traffic actions and violations to include
   restoration of driving privileges and granting of restricted driving privileges. The Installation
   Commander further designates the 55 MSG/CC (55 MSG/CD or 55 MSG/DD in the 55
   MSG/CCs absence) as the administrative hearing authority. The DFC is the point of contact
   for matters concerning traffic citation rebuttals and has the authority to void any issued
   citation.
   2.5.2. Suspensions.
       2.5.2.1. Driving privileges can be suspended for serious violations or when lesser
       measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The Installation Commander or
       designee may also suspend or revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually
       violates installation parking standards, or habitually violates other standards considered
       non-moving in nature.
       2.5.2.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw
       anyone's authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the
       installation.
       2.5.2.3. Installation GOV or POV driving privileges will be immediately suspended for
       any person involved in an intoxicated driving incident as the driver, operator, or
       individual in control of the vehicle, pending resolution of the intoxicated driving incident,
       which involves active duty military personnel, their family members, retired members of
       the military service, DoD civilian personnel and any other person with access to Offutt
       AFB. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving
       incident. The immediate suspension of all on base driving privileges will be in effect
       pending the resolution of the intoxicated driving incident by civilian legal authorities, by
       courts-martial, or non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ.
           2.5.2.3.1. Suspend driver‘s privileges pending resolution of the intoxicated driving
           incident under the circumstances outlined below:
               2.5.2.3.1.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to
               determine blood alcohol content (BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for
10                                                OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010


            alcohol or other drugs.
            2.5.2.3.1.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.08 percent by
            volume or higher. Offutt AFB assimilates the more stringent standard utilized by
            the State of Nebraska (i.e., 0.08 percent instead of 0.10 percent identified in AFI
            31-218(I)).
            2.5.2.3.1.3. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an
            intoxicated driving incident occurred.
     2.5.2.4. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.08, presume the person is impaired.
     Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person
     was under the influence of alcohol. 55 WG/JA will be contacted for guidance.
     2.5.2.5. All assigned personnel, to include active duty military, DoD civilians, civilian
     contractors, and dependants with access to Offutt AFB arrested off base for drunk or
     impaired driving incidents must report to Bldg 160/Security Forces HQ within 24 hours
     upon return to military control. Military control is defined as ―upon release from civil
     authorities after being arrested, detained or held in custody by civilian authorities.‖ First
     Sergeants (for enlisted personnel) or commanders (for officers) will ensure military
     members are escorted to Bldg 160/Security Forces HQ for issuance of a suspension letter:
         2.5.2.5.1. During non-duty hours: Report to Bldg 160/Security Forces HQ and
         contact the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) to be issued a notice of
         suspension of installation driving privileges. The ECC can be reached at 294-6110 or
         294-6119.
         2.5.2.5.2. During duty hours: Report to Bldg 160/Security Forces HQ and contact the
         55 SFS Reports and Analysis section to be issued a notice of suspension of
         installation driving privileges.
  2.5.3. Revocation.
     2.5.3.1. The Installation Commander or designee will immediately revoke driving
     privileges for a period of not less than two years in the following circumstances:
         2.5.3.1.1. In the event a vehicle operator refuses (for on- and off-base offenses) to
         submit to a chemical test of their breath, blood or urine for the presence of alcohol or
         drugs, the driver‘s 2-year revocation is effective immediately. If the vehicle operator
         is currently already under base suspension/ revocation the revocation will be added
         onto the existing base suspension/ revocation.
         2.5.3.1.2. A conviction, non-judicial punishment, or a military or civilian
         administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver‘s license for
         intoxicated driving. Official documentation is required as the basis for this type of
         revocation action.
         2.5.3.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the
         Installation Commander or designee determines immediate revocation of driving
         privileges is required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline on the
         installation.
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                               11


       2.5.3.2. Revocations under paragraphs 2.5.3.1.1. - 2.5.3.1.3. will normally be 2-years in
       duration; however, after the revocation has been in effect not less than one year, the
       individual whose driving privileges have been revoked may request permission to install
       and have monitored, at their own volition and expense, an ignition interlock device for
       the duration of the time their driving privileges would have been revoked. The
       Installation Commander or designee may, in their sole discretion, approve or disapprove
       such a request. For the request format use Attachment 9.
           2.5.3.2.1. The DFC will forward revocation, suspension, and driving records to
           gaining commanders and initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
           records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
           2.5.3.2.2. The Reports and Analysis section (55 SFS/S-5R), is responsible for
           administration of reports of moving traffic violations, suspensions, and revocations
           between military and state law enforcement authorities. Once command action is
           completed on each case file, the Security Forces Management Information System
           (SFMIS) (currently linked to MILPDS) will automatically transfer the individual
           history record to the gaining installations Reports and Analysis section. A hard copy
           of all active suspension/revocation case files are forwarded via certified mail to the
           gaining servicing security forces unit. Upon receipt of gaining individual history, 55
           SFS/S-5R will send an electronic copy of the history to the individual‘s gaining
           commander through the unit First Sergeant.
               2.5.3.2.2.1. If a newly assigned individual is identified as having a current
               suspension/ revocation, a request for a hard copy of the case file will be made to
               the previous servicing security forces unit and the person‘s information will be
               added to the base suspension/ revocation/barment/warrant (SRBW) list pending
               review by the 55 MSG/CC and 55 WG/JA.
               2.5.3.2.2.2. The Reports and Analysis section will staff the newly assigned
               individual‘s case history to the 55 MSG/CC through 55 WG/JA for a final
               decision. While Offutt AFB will honor revocations issued by other installation
               commanders regardless of service component affiliation, suspensions will be
               handled on a case-by-case basis (see paragraph 2.6., Reciprocal Procedures). The
               individual involved will be advised of the final 55 MSG/CC decision concerning
               the suspension/revocation through his/her first sergeant and will acknowledge
               receipt of the suspension/revocation (if applicable) in writing.
               2.5.3.2.2.3. 55 SFS/S-5R will add the suspension or revocation to the SRBW list.
               A current SRBW list is maintained in SFMIS and accessible on the web
               (https://sfmis.csd.disa.mil).
55 SFS/S-3 are responsible for posting a current SRBW listing at each installation entry control
point.
       2.5.3.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, the revocation period
       will be computed from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which
       full driving privileges were restored pending resolution of charges.
       2.5.3.4. Multiple suspensions will run consecutively unless otherwise determined by the
       revoking authority.

   2.5.4. Squadron commanders may recommend suspension/revocation of on-base driving
   privileges of a military member or civilian employee assigned to their unit to 55 MSG/CC
(55 MSG/CD or 55 MSG/DD in the 55 MSG/CCs absence).
2.6. Reciprocal Military Procedures.
   2.6.1. Offutt AFB will honor revocations issued by other installation commanders regardless
   of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassignment unless
   the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. The Installation
   Commander or designee may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis.
   Anyone with suspended or revocated privileges may petition the installation commander for
   partial or limited driving privileges.
2.7. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.7.1. Offutt AFB will honor revocations and suspensions issued by state driver-licensing
   authorities for suspension and revocation of driving privileges. Additionally, 55 SFS/S-5R
   will notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued when a person‘s
   installation driving privileges are revoked following final adjudication of an intoxicated
   driving offense or for refusal to submit to a BAC/BrAC test. The notification will include
   the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC level. Notification will be made via US
   Postal Service.
On receipt of written notice, the receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if
the violations or incidents occurred within its own jurisdiction.
   2.7.2. Personnel who receive a suspension or revocation of a State-issued driver‘s license
   will report to the 55 SFS/R-5R the next duty day to advise the Reports and Analysis
   technician of the suspension or revocation of State-issued driver‘s license.
       2.7.2.1. Personnel will acknowledge receipt of the suspension/revocation of their on-base
       driving privileges.
       2.7.2.2. Unit vehicle control officers/NCOs will ensure the individual‘s AF Form 2293,
       US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card is confiscated and forwarded
       to
55 LRS/LGRV.
2.8. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.8.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone‘s driving privileges, the person
   will be notified in writing on what action is being considered and the reason for it. This
   notice is coordinated with 55 WG/JA.
   2.8.2. Except for incidents outlined under paragraphs 2.5.2.3.1. and 2.5.3.1., do not suspend
   or revoke a person's driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made)
   and offered an administrative hearing. Only in unusual circumstances will verbal
   notifications be made. The Installation Commander or designee will authorize an immediate
   preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence for offenses outlined under paragraphs
   2.5.2.3.1. and 2.5.3.1. Such evidence can include witness statements, a military or civilian
   police report, chemical test results, refusal to complete chemical testing, video tapes, written
   statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                              13


     2.8.2.1. For active duty military personnel, a written notice of preliminary suspension
     will be sent to the individual‘s commander or First Sergeant. The individual will be
     directed by their commander or First Sergeant to report to the 55 SFS Reports and
     Analysis section (55 SFS/S-5R) to receipt for the Notice of Preliminary Suspension of
     Base Driving Privileges letter.
     2.8.2.2. Non-installation, non-DoD affiliated civilians will be presented the written
     Notice of Preliminary Suspension of Base Driving Privileges letter for intoxicated driving
     or any other situation deemed necessary by the Installation Commander or designee
     either in person (preferred) or by certified mail.
  2.8.3. The individual will be advised of the following when issued the Preliminary
  Suspension of Base Driving Privileges letter:
     2.8.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation.
     2.8.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or
     resolution of the incident (see Attachment 4, Request for Restoration of Base Driving

     individual acknowledges the ―Notice of Preliminary Suspension of Base Driving
     Privileges‖ letter. Administrative hearings are conducted by the 55 MSG/CC. The 55
     MSG/CC will use the "preponderance of the evidence" standard for making factual
     determinations in all administrative hearings. Requested hearings will normally take
     place within 30 days of the date of request.
         2.8.3.3.1. Military personnel may present evidence and witnesses and be represented
         by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel.
         2.8.3.3.2. DoD civilian employees may have a personal representative present at the
         administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.

     Installation Commander or designee makes a final decision.
     2.8.3.5. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
     the address shown in the letter.
  2.8.4. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period (5 duty days
  after the Notice of Preliminary Suspension of Base Driving Privileges letter is issued to the
  individual), the suspension or revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. The
  administrative due process for suspensions and revocations is located in Attachment 8,
  Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations of this supplement.
  2.8.5. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) the
  law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in
  physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) the
  person was lawfully cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) the person

   was asked to submit to a test for alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and
   was informed of the consequences for refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) the person
   refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath, or urine; failed to complete the test;
   submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of allowed blood alcohol content;
   results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation apprehension or in violation
   of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) the testing methods used were valid
   and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
   2.8.6. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.3.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation
   is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge. For all other
   convictions the length of the revocation must be determined by the appropriate authority.
   2.8.7. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
   Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
   driving privileges.
2.9. De-registration of POVs for Revocation/Suspension Action.
   2.9.1. De-registration is required for personnel with registered vehicles who have had their
   on-base driving privileges suspended or revoked (6 months or more).
   2.9.2. Will immediately (or next duty day) surrender all vehicle registration decals (DD
   Form 2220, DoD Registered Vehicle) and vehicle passes used to gain access to the
   installation to the 55 SFS Visitor Control Center (VCC) located in Bldg 478, just outside the
   USSTRATCOM Gate.

   decal number on the Notification of Preliminary Suspension of Base Driving Privileges letter
   and then sign stating the decal has been removed or transferred. Except as noted below,
   those who have lost their driving privileges will not be allowed to operate or store their
   vehicle on the installation unless specifically approved by the 55 MSG/CC. Those who lose
   their driving privileges and reside in installation housing may store their vehicle at their
   quarters. Those who have lost their installation driving privileges and reside in the dormitory

2.11. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.11.1. Commanders are responsible for referring military personnel involved in any
   intoxicated (drug or alcohol related) motor vehicle incident to Mental Health for evaluation.
   First sergeant‘s will ensure this referral is documented with the appropriate referral agency
   and documented for the 55 SFS/S-5R. This will normally be completed during the
   Command Action phase and documented on the AF Form 3545A, Incident Report, Section
   VIII- Commander‘s Action – Offender Identifier, which is then forwarded to 55 SFS/S-5R.
   2.11.2. Active duty Air Force, members of the Air Force Reserve Command and Air
   National Guard (when activated longer than 30 days) whose base driving privileges were
   suspended or revoked as a result of an alcohol related incident will receive a minimum of 6

   hours of awareness education before reinstatement of base driving privileges can be made in
   accordance with AFI 44-121, paragraph 3.6.3.2. Unit First Sergeants will ensure 55 SFS/S-
   5R is notified of the date the individual completed the 6 hour awareness education
   class/training and document the completion on Section VIII of the AF Form 3545A.
   2.11.3. When directed by the commander (IAW AFI 91-207, paragraph 4.7), military and
   Department of the Air Force (DAF) and Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) civilians will attend
   the Driver Improvement and Rehabilitation Course to improve driving habits and knowledge.
2.12. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding
determines lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not
amounting to intoxicated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
   2.12.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take or complete a lawfully
   requested chemical test to determine blood alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content
   (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
   2.12.2. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another
   preliminary suspension or revocation.
   2.12.3. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend
   or revoke driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.

2.13. Restricted Driving Privileges.
   2.13.1. The Installation Commander or designee may authorize restricted driving privileges
   to those whose authority to drive on military installations was suspended or revocated. The
   individual‘s civilian state driving credentials must still be valid.
   2.13.2. Without due cause, restricted driving privileges or reinstatement will not be given to
   any person whose civilian driver‘s license is under suspension or revocation by a State
   licensing authority.
       2.13.2.1. If absolutely necessary (and for on base privileges only), coordinate with 55
       WG/JA.
       2.13.2.2. This option applies only to areas where the Installation Commander exercises
       exclusive military jurisdiction.
       2.13.2.3. Requests will only be considered in there is extreme hardship and there are no
       other workable alternatives. Granting of limited privileges will not be used as an
       alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is the more appropriate
       action. The Installation Commander or designee will weigh the potential liability
       inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state license is allowed to
       operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropriate
       when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of
       performing their military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.
   2.13.3. All requests for restricted driving privileges must be in writing in accordance with
   Attachment 5, Restricted Driving Privileges Request. Submit the request to 55 SFS/S-5R for
   processing.

      2.13.3.1. Upon receiving a request for restricted driving privileges, 55 SFS/S-5R will
      ensure the person‘s civilian state driving credentials are valid prior to the request being
      sent to the installation commander or designee for a decision. This will primarily be
      accomplished using the NCIC system.
      2.13.3.2. If approved, the restricted individual will be notified by letter and subsequently
      issued an appropriate credential identifying the restricted driving privilege. The
      individual must have the letter and credential in their possession when operating a vehicle
      and must present the items upon request.
2.14. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.14.1. The suspension or revocation period will be increased by two years if an individual is
   discovered driving while their driver‘s license or installation driving privileges are under
   suspension or revocation. Any restricted driving privileges previously granted are
   immediately revoked.
   2.14.2. The Unit or Installation Commander may also take administrative or disciplinary
   action.

                             TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning.
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision.
   Traffic supervision includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
   motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations
   together with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also
   important. To be successful, education and communication with the general public is vital.
   4.1.2. Traffic circulation plans provide for the safest and most efficient use of primary and
   secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circulation control. The
   base traffic engineer, Defense Force Commander (DFC), safety officer, and other members
   of the base traffic control plan committee develop the traffic circulation plan. The base
   traffic control plan committee will include representatives from the 55 SFS Installation
   Security Section
(55 SFS/S-3I) and Reports and Analysis (55 SFS/S-5R). 55 SFS/S-3I will provide advice on the
impact to current security plans and assist with traffic control studies; 55 SFS/S-5R will provide
accident/incident data for evaluation. As a minimum, the base traffic plan should consider the
following:
       4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
       4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include
       measures for special events and adverse road conditions.
       4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated
       traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
       4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
       4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
       4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation, if feasible.
       4.1.2.7. The installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic
       engineer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This
       is normally a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should
       have an infrastructure planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow
   patterns, and points of congestion. The DFC and traffic engineer usually conduct
   coordinated traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major
   and minor routes, locations for traffic control devices, and special conditions requiring
   engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The chief of airfield management will provide program oversight for flight line
   vehicle operations IAW AFI 13-213, Airfield Management.
4.2. Installation Traffic Code. In accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive
5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations and 18 U.S.C. § 13, The

     Bldg 500 parking lots 1, 2, 4, the visitor area of lot 6, and the street parking on Apollo
     Rd, Minuteman Dr, and Mercury Rd. Parking information for these areas should be
     directed to USSTRATCOM Command Security (USSTRATCOM/J050).
     4.8.3.2. The Installation Parking Board approves and assigns all reserved parking spaces
     for assigned personnel, visitors, government vehicles, handicapped personnel, or any
     other unit-determined purpose. Attachment 6 lists automatic allocations as well as an
     example request to be considered by the board. Submit requests for additional parking
     spaces with justification in writing to 55 MSG/CD (Installation Parking Board) for
     approval. The establishment of extended reserved parking by individuals and/or units
     without the approval of the Installation Parking Board is prohibited.
     4.8.3.3. Annual Revalidation. Automatic allocations need not be revalidated. All others
     must be revalidated each year, not later than 1 March. Revalidation letters must include
     justification and a map identifying the locations of the spaces. Reserved parking spaces
     not revalidated annually will be eliminated and marked out.
     4.8.3.4. Permanently mounted signs, freestanding signs, curb plate, or pavement marking
     may designate reserved parking spaces. Reserved parking spaces are reserved 24 hours a
     day, every day. These signs will not hinder any snow removal process. The management
     and maintenance of these devices, including marking, is the responsibility of 55 CES.
     4.8.3.5. Parking spaces will not be reserved for the purpose of car pooling.
  4.8.4. Parking Wardens. Offutt AFB uses parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and
  cite parking violators, especially within off-street parking facilities. The parking warden
  program is designed to ensure safe and adequate parking is available in support of the
  installation mission. Enforcement of the regulatory guidance is the key to meeting the needs
  of this program. The 55 MSG/CD is the overall authority for this program.
     4.8.4.1. Unit commanders are responsible for managing a facility's parking plan by
     overseeing the actions of the parking lot wardens. Parking wardens enforce the
     regulatory guidance for their associated parking lots. Parking wardens are given the
     authority to enforce the parking requirements as outlined in this instruction. This
     authority includes, but is not limited to, citing vehicles parked in reserved parking slots,
     double parked, parked on hash lines, on the grass, or any place other than a designated
     parking area. This authority is extended only to areas of the installation that are
     associated with their organization or areas of responsibility.
     4.8.4.2. Each facility may select personnel to act as facility parking wardens. These
     personnel will be designated in writing by the commander of the unit, to which the
     facility is assigned. The letter should specify a minimum of one primary and alternate in
     the grade of E-5 or above, or the civilian grade of GS-6 or above. Those selected as
     parking wardens will contact 55 SFS/S-5R to schedule training. Training will be
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                              31


       provided by 55 SFS/S-4T. Personnel are not authorized to write tickets until this training
       is completed.
       4.8.4.3. After training is complete, a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket book
       will be issued to the parking warden. A copy of the appointment letter will be maintained
       on file with the 55 SFS/S-5R.
       4.8.4.4. The main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces
       member and one issued by a parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the
       pink copy that directs the violator to contact the parking monitor who issued the ticket
       instead of SFAR/S-5R. It is important that parking monitors include how or where they
       can be reached by the violators.
          4.8.4.4.1. When contacted by the violator, the parking monitor will fill in any
          missing data in sections 1-10 of the DD Form 1408. Tickets that are incomplete or
          were written by personnel not designated as parking monitors will not be processed
          and will be returned to the unit.
          4.8.4.4.2. Once the violator makes contact with the parking monitor and the parking
          monitor determines the citation will stand, the citation will be forwarded to 55 SFS/S-
          5R. Citation received more than 10 days after the date they were written will not be
          processed.
4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Offutt AFB uses the DD Dorm 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket for traffic
   violations.
   4.9.2. Security Forces personnel assigned to 55 SFS and parking wardens meeting the
   requirements above are authorized to issue DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Tickets.
   Parking wardens will be trained by the 55 SFS/S-4T section. 55 SFS personnel will be
   trained in accordance with Career Field Training and Education Plan. Training will be
   annotated in the individual‘s training record.
   4.9.3. Security Forces Reports and Analysis section will process requests for tickets,
   accident, incident and other related documents created by the 55 SFS as Privacy Act requests.
   Responses to requests for information contained in approved systems of records must be
   processed using the guidelines shown in AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program. If the time
   parameters cannot be met, 55th Security Forces Reports and Analysis section will provide the
   requester with a written statement identifying when the record will be made available. If
   partial or total denial of the requested document will be rendered, the Report and Analysis
   section will inform the requester that Freedom of Information Act Request will be necessary
   in order to receive release consideration for the requested documents. Request will be
   processed using a system access worksheet available from the Reports and Analysis section

   in examining, interpreting, and recording results of field sobriety tests. Document all driving
   while intoxicated offenses using AF Form 3545, Incident Report.
   4.10.2. If a Security Forces member reasonably concludes that the individual driving or in
   control of a vehicle is impaired, field sobriety tests should be conducted on the individual.
   Perform standard Air Force field sobriety tests, which consist of the one leg stand, the walk
   and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Only qualified personnel will conduct field
   sobriety tests and that qualification must be documented on the individual‘s training record.
      4.10.2.1. If an individual suspected of DWI/DUI refuses to perform the standardized Air
      Force field sobriety tests, their refusal and security force observations will be annotated
      on the DD Form 1920.
   4.10.3. Security Forces can use Portable Breath Testers (PBT) to aid in the establishment of
   probable cause. In order to use the PBT, users must have been trained by the Nebraska

      4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.08, presume the person is impaired.
      Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person
      was under the influence of alcohol. 55 WG/JA will be contacted for guidance.
      4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.08 or more, or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs,
      the person is considered to have been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend
      driving privileges immediately in accordance with paragraph 2.5.2.3.1.
4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
   4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction under the following

      4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the DFC upon
      death of any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction,
      medical authorities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or
      mishap. Conduct tests for the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the
      blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as soon as possible and where practical within eight hours
      of death. Include the test results in the medical reports.
      4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath
      sample from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

   4.13.1. The suspect will be asked to consent to a chemical test of bodily fluids or breathe in
   accordance with the Implied Consent Policy, as defined in paragraph 2.3. The individual
   does not have the right to have an attorney present before deciding if they will or will not
   take the test.
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                                35


   4.13.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
       4.13.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a
       motor vehicle on the installation.
       4.13.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.13.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that
       failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breathe
       may result in revocation of on-base driving privileges.
   4.13.3. Also advise the driver that the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
   consent provisions of this instruction can be used as evidence in courts-martial, non-judicial
   proceedings under Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.13.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
   or any medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may
   refuse a blood extraction without penalty, but will be offered a breath or urine test, or both.
   Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a medical doctor.
   4.13.5. Erhling Bergquist Clinic will perform extraction of urine and blood. During non-
   duty hours, on-call personnel will be notified and respond to conduct the extraction.
   4.13.6. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a breath test, do not
   administer a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.
4.14. Chemical Testing Devices. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved
NHTSA conforming products list published in the Federal Register. Ensure only qualified
personnel administer breath tests. Personnel will be trained by the Nebraska Department of
Motor Vehicles and will receive a Class B Permit. Permits for qualified personnel will be
maintained by 55 SFS/S-3I. If blood or urine testing will be conducted, ensure qualified medical
personnel obtain the samples and conduct the tests.
4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped,
   apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor
   vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated.
   Rule 312(d), Military Rules of Evidence, and regulatory rules concerning requesting and
   granting authorizations for searches govern the extraction of body fluids in furtherance of
   other kinds of investigations.
   4.15.2. If an individual refuses to submit to a breath test, further actions will be coordinated
   through 55 WG/JA. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search
   and seizure authorizations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical
   testing, and who subsequently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test, may be forced to
   submit to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. Probable cause must exist to believe the
   individual was driving or was in control of a vehicle while under the influence of an
   intoxicant.
   4.15.3. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the following procedures: 1) A search
   authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate obtained pursuant to Rule
 36                                                  OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010


   315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction; 2) A
   search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear indication
   that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay
   necessary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the
   evidence sought; and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the
   servicing staff judge advocate and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official
   fail because of the unavailability of the appropriate commander or military magistrate.
       4.15.3.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves
       unsuccessful (due to non-availability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered
       by Rule 315(d), Military Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an
       individual located in the facility at the time an authorization is sought.
           4.15.3.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the
           medical facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff
           judge advocate.
           4.15.3.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule
           315(d) need not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person
           can perform the extraction.
           4.15.3.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
           individual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.4. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary
   purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions
   defining medical care. Only qualified medical personnel administer extractions and use only
   reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure. Assistance to overcome an individual‘s
   resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law enforcement personnel or unit
   personnel acting under orders from the member‘s commanding officer or designee. Do not
   use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
       4.15.4.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical
       attention. Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions
       when other medical treatment is required.
4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests by Implied Consent can request additional testing. These
   tests are paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base
   hospital or research laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in
   a military or civilian court of law, they must ensure the state approves the test and test
   method. The individual should complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the
   resulting documents.
   4.16.2. Additional testing is the sole responsibility of the individual.
4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. 55 SFS will, to the fullest extent possible, share and
exchange traffic activities and data with civil authorities. The 55 SFS will develop local unit
procedures for receiving, processing, and securing traffic reports and related incident reports
from local police agencies.

   include minor traffic citations).
   4.17.2. Security Forces will notify an individual‘s Unit Commander or First Sergeant when
   notified by civilian police that a military member was detained or arrested. If the incident is
   due to an intoxicated driving incident, Security Forces will inform them a Preliminary
   Suspension of Base Driving Privileges memo must be served to the person within 12 hours
   from notification of release from custody. The Unit Commander/First Sergeant will ensure
   the person is escorted to Bldg 160/SFHQ and contact Emergency Communications Center
   (ECC), via extension 294-6110 or 294-6119 so the letter can be served.
      4.17.2.1. Security Forces will accomplish a blotter entry about the arrest and issue the
      Notice of Preliminary Suspension of Base Driving Privileges memo.
      4.17.2.2. Once notified by their respective Unit Commander or First Sergeant, unit
      vehicle control officers/NCOs will ensure the individual‘s AF Form 2293, US Air Force
      Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card is confiscated and forwarded to 55
      LRS/LGRV.

5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative
device to impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a
disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to
interfere in any way with the exercise of the installation commander‘s prerogative to issue,
suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate installation driving privileges.
   5.2.1. The following administrative penalties, as a minimum, will be imposed on drivers
   who are cited for speeding 10 mph – 15 mph over base housing posted speed limits:

       5.2.1.1. The first offense will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the
       individual‘s traffic history being assessed points in accordance with Table 5.2.
       5.2.1.2. The second offense within 12 months will result in a 30-day suspension of base
       driving privileges and the individual‘s traffic history being assessed points in accordance
       with Table 5.2.
       5.2.1.3. The third offense within 12 months will result in a 6-month suspension of base
       driving privileges and the individual‘s base traffic history being assessed points in
       accordance with Table 5.2.
       5.2.1.4. Citations issued to personnel for exceeding the base housing posted speed limit
       by 16 mph or more will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
   5.2.2. The following administrative penalties will be imposed on vehicle operators if they or
   their passengers fail to use seat belts or other restraints while moving:
       5.2.2.1. The first offense will result in the issuance of a 7-day driving suspension and the
       individual‘s traffic history being assessed points in accordance with Table 5.2.

       with Table 5.2.
       5.2.2.3. Subsequent offenses within 12 months will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein
are mandatory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on
and off the installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel
operating GOVs and POVs on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and
all other individuals subject to this instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an
individual submits a rebuttal, assess points according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to
individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court, or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of
pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the point system for non-moving
violations.

 NOTES:
 1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the
 offense having the greater value.
 2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant
 fails to correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace
 period on a ―Fix-It‖ ticket).
 3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier,
 booster seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points
 when no restraint system of any kind is used.


5.4. Point System Procedures.
   5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 will serve as a basis
   for determining point assessment, except in cases where a AF Form 3545A is accomplished
   and a DD Form 1408 not issued (i.e., intoxicated driving, driving on revocation, etc.). In
   cases where an AF Form 3545A is used, points will be assessed based upon the offense.
   5.4.2. The following driver improvement measures will be utilized, as appropriate:
       5.4.2.1. Notification will be made to individuals and their respective First Sergeant when
       the individual acquires 10 traffic points within a 12 month period. This will facilitate a
       counseling or driver improvement interview by the First Sergeant or Unit Commander, if
       needed. Notification will be made in writing, either by e-mail or US mail.
       5.4.2.2. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief,
       appears to have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on
       driving ability.
       5.4.2.3. Attendance at a driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill,
       awareness, or attitude, such as a driver improvement and rehabilitation course as outlined
       in AFI 91-207, USAF Traffic Safety Program.
       5.4.2.4. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation,
       counseling, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all
       cases in which alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation,
       incident, or accident.
   5.4.3. The Installation Commander or designee may suspend or revoke driving privileges as
   provided by this instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are
   accomplished.
   5.4.4. If a person accumulates 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months or 18 traffic
   points within 24 consecutive months, the individual‘s driving privileges will be revoked for
   one year.
   5.4.5. The Installation Commander has established additional suspension and revocation
   periods in Table 4.8. for parking violations.
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  43


   5.4.6. When a driver is apprehended/detained (on- or off-base) for DWI/DUI or refusing to
   submit to a test to determine the extent of intoxication, a Notification of Preliminary
   Suspension of Base Driving Privileges memo will be issued to the driver for a period of two
   years. If detained for DWI/DUI on-base, the vehicle will be secured at the scene and the
   keys seized via AF Form 52, Evidence Tag. Security Force members may move the vehicle
   to a safe location if it poses a safety hazard. The vehicle will not be released to the individual
   until the person is no longer under the influence of drugs or alcohol or gives consent to
   release the vehicle to another individual.
   5.4.7. Reinstatement of driving privileges, upon termination of the suspension or revocation,
   is automatic. However, if the revocation was the result of an alcohol-related incident, the
   Unit Commander must ensure the individual successfully completes a driver improvement
   and rehabilitation course, such as outlined in AFI 91-207, USAF Traffic Safety Program prior
   to reinstatement. The Unit Commander/First Sergeant will ensure proof of course
   completion is forwarded to the Reports and Analysis section (55 SFS/S-5R).
   5.4.8. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for
   24 consecutive months, except:
       5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations will remain for three
       years.
       5.4.8.2. Non-mandatory suspensions or revocations will remain for five years.
       5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations will remain for seven years.
5.5. Disposition of Driving Records.
   5.5.1. The Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) (currently linked to
   MILPDS) will automatically transfer the individual history record to the gaining installations
   Reports and Analysis section (Air Force only).              A hard copy of all active
   suspension/revocation case files are forwarded via certified mail to the gaining servicing
   security forces unit or law enforcement servicing unit (other Services). Additionally, for
   other Services, a printed SFMIS report describing an individual‘s driving record will be
   generated and mailed to the gaining law enforcement servicing unit. Associate units will
   provide 55 SFS/S-5R a monthly listing of personnel (other Services; non-Air Force) selected
   for retirement, separation and PCS. The monthly listing will provide the gaining unit and
   location for personnel selected for PCS.
   5.5.2. The 55 SFS/S-5R will coordinate a staff summary package from the 55 SFS/CC to
55 WG/JA for a legal review for personnel gained to the installation who have an active
suspension/revocation of base driving privileges from another installation. The legal review and
staff summary package will be provided to the 55 MSG/CC for determination of continuing the
existing suspension or revocation.
       5.5.2.1. 55 SFS/S-5R will notify the gaining Unit Commander/First Sergeant of the 55
       MSG/CC decision and, if necessary, obtain the individuals signature on the Notice of
       Revocation of Base Driving Privileges letter issued by the 55 MSG/CC. The letter will
       contain the effective dates from his/her original suspension/revocation.

           TOWING AND IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. Privately Owned Vehicles on Offutt AFB are subject to towing and impoundment
if it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or convenience, is involved in criminal
activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or abandoned.
   6.1.1. The Security Forces Investigations section (55 SFS/S-2I) is the focal point for
   coordination and tracking of all towed and/or impounded vehicles at Offutt AFB. If a vehicle
   must be towed, 55 SFS/S-2I will be contacted at 294-6813 prior to it being towed or
   impounded. The on-duty Security Forces flight chief or higher authority must approve all
   towing or impound actions.
   6.1.2. When possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed.
   If reasonably feasible, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first
   have permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle.
   However in such cases, the security forces (or towing contractor) are not responsible for
   safeguarding the vehicle.
6.2. Standards for Impoundment. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following
conditions exist:
   6.2.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
       6.2.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the
       orderly flow of traffic.
       6.2.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a
       fire lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or
       creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
       6.2.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
       6.2.1.4. In a ―tow-away‖ zone that is so marked with signs.
   6.2.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
       6.2.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner
       fail.
       6.2.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
       6.2.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
       6.2.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore
       unable (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
       6.2.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public
       roadways.
       6.2.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or
       physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or
       safekeeping.
OFFUTTAFBI31-204 20 OCTOBER 2010                                                              45


      6.2.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.
          6.2.2.7.1. Vehicles may be considered abandoned if they are not moved for seven
          consecutive days, are non-operational, eyesores, or are not displaying a valid state
          registration.
6.3. Towing and Storage.
   6.3.1. The installation utilizes a wrecker service for official government sanctioned towing
   and temporary impoundment of vehicles from Offutt AFB. The 55 SFS is the authorized
   representative for Offutt AFB when removal and storage of a privately owned vehicle is
   required within the jurisdiction of Offutt AFB.
   6.3.2. All fees and charges associated with the tow and storage of the vehicle are assessed
   against the vehicle owner.
   6.3.3. In the unlikely event the vehicle removal and storage is erroneous, the wrecker service
   will return the vehicle to the owner, at no cost to the owner or the U.S. Government.
   6.3.4. The impoundment area is located off the installation in a DFC-approved secure area
   belonging to the wrecker service.
   6.3.5. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or
   involvement in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice on POVs
      considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
      the security forces blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the
      vehicle. Have the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted
      wrecker service is used, complete a DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal
      Authorization.
          6.4.1.2.1. Security Forces on-duty flights will make all attempts and exhaust all
          resources to contact the owner prior to towing.
              6.4.1.2.1.1. If the owner is contacted, direct him/her to move the vehicle (or
              properly register it); forward the DD Form 2504 to Security Forces Investigations.
              6.4.1.2.1.2. If attempts to contact the owner fail, forward the DD Form 2504 to
              Security Forces Investigations for processing after the three days. Security Forces
              Investigations will assume the investigation to determine ownership.
      6.4.1.3. Security Forces Investigations is responsible for having vehicles towed when the
      vehicle is not moved within the allotted time. Prior to removing the vehicle, 55 SFS/S-2I
      completes the DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report, as a record of action taken.
      The DD Form 2506 will be used to conduct an inventory listing of personal property
      within the vehicle.

          6.4.1.3.1. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping. Locking the
          vehicle with positive key control satisfies this requirement.
          6.4.1.3.2. Security Forces Investigations will forward DD Form 2507, Notice of
          Vehicle Impoundment, by certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the
          vehicle to advise the owner of the impoundment action and request information
          concerning the owner‘s intentions concerning the vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
       6.4.2.1. Vehicles will be kept in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary
       purposes. Release recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for
       evidentiary purposes, or to the law enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as
       appropriate.
       6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request
       the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff
       such requests through 55 WG/JA and the DFC. When appropriate, comply and support
       such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if
       civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period.
       6.4.2.3. Security Forces Investigations will maintain responsibility for the transfer or
       release of stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity. Additionally, 55 SFS/S-
       2I will search any POV in conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity
       using search and seizure procedures.
6.5. Disposition of Vehicles after Impoundment.
   6.5.1. When a vehicle is impounded for evidentiary or law enforcement purposes (held on
   Offutt AFB), hold it for as long as necessary. Unless directed otherwise by competent
   authority, release vehicles and property when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated
   above. 55 SFS/S-2I will review Title 10, USC 2575, Disposition of Unclaimed Property, and
   DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing Manual, (when DRMO is used)

                         RESERVED PARKING ALLOCATIONS

NOTE: Parking spaces will be reserved in minimal numbers by one of two means--automatic or
by request.
A6.1. Automatic allocations will be based primarily on duty positions; however, handicapped,
alert, and GOV parking will also fall into this category. Once initially validated by the
Installation Parking Board, these spaces will be permanently assigned. These allocations consist
of:
   A6.1.1. Squadron or Group Commanders (includes vice, deputy in commander absence)
   A6.1.2. First Sergeants
   A6.1.3. Squadron Operations Officer/Civilian Equivalent.
   A6.1.4. Admin (one per command element; commander determines who uses the slot)
   A6.1.5. Squadron Commander Equivalent Staff Positions (Major Staff Agency heads, (e.g.,
   JA, HC), heads of large divisions (e.g., AFGWC/SY/DO).
   A6.1.6. Command Chief Master Sergeant
   A6.1.7. Handicapped/Alert Vehicles/Government Vehicles
A6.2. By request allocations will be based on the following criteria. These require initial and
annual validation by the Installation Parking Board. By request allocations consist of:
   A6.2.1. Special Needs (physically impaired employee, etc.)
   A6.2.2. Customer Parking
   A6.2.3. Mission Requirements--POVs (extensive justification required; must be in a high
   density parking area, supported by a validated mission need.)
A6.3. The following is an example format to be followed for requesting automatic and by
request allocations.
A6.4. Memorandum for Reserved Parking Allocations

     e. 55 MSS Admin
     f. Handicapped -- 3 (in place already)
     g. Government Vehicle -- l


BY REQUEST ALLOCATIONS:


       a. Customer -- 53 (2-hour) Justification: This is a high-density area where parking is at a
premium. A significant number of the installation's customer service functions are contained in
Bldg C, which generates a high volume of customer traffic. Parking surveys for Jan and Feb
indicate over half of our customers still have a parking problem; even with current 2-hour
parking available (see Attachment 3). We need to retain the 53 2-hour parking spaces (see
Attachment 4) to maintain the status quo for our customers. We are not requesting additional
customer spaces at this time until the parking impact of PC-III activation and other management
initiatives can be determined.


      b. Special Needs: We have one civilian assigned who is physically handicapped. Rather
than have him park in a handicapped spot, which would limit accessibility for our handicapped
customers, we are requesting a reserved parking spot. This individual does not require an
oversized parking space.


     c. Attachment: Map showing requested slots and preferred locations, as appropriate. (Note:
Reserved parking locations will not necessarily be the most convenient slots to entrances. Plan
accordingly to place some GOVs, etc., away from entrances and customer/handicapped at
optimum locations.)
