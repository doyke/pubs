SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The series
number was changed from 31 (Security) to 51 (Law) due to the transfer of the OPR from 81
MDOS/SGOHF to 81 TRW/JA. The most significant change is elimination of the Juvenile
Diversion Panel and implementation of a Juvenile Misconduct Hearing (JMH). These revisions
are made in order to accomplish a more effective use of limited resources and dispose of each
case in a more efficient and timely manner.
1. Authority. The Installation Commander (81 TRW/CC) is charged with the responsibility of
considering whether other forms of disposition are adequate and appropriate for cases involving
minor violations of federal law, including assimilated state criminal law, before referring the
offender for trial before a US magistrate judge, as directed by Air Force Instruction 51-905, Use
of Magistrate Judges for Trial of Misdemeanors Committed by Civilians, paragraph 1.1.2. To
achieve this goal, the Installation Commander hereby delegates to the 81st Mission Support
Group Commander (81 MSG/CC) the authority to take all command actions in juvenile cases,
except barment. At the 81 MSG/CC’s discretion, he/she may further delegate his/her authority to
the 81st Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (81 MSG/CD).
2. Purpose. The Juvenile Diversion Program (JDP) is designed to determine the underlying
reason for the misconduct, promote personal acceptance of responsibilities and consequences for
actions, and to deter or preclude future misconduct through behavior modification. The JDP
intends to accomplish its objectives through prompt administrative action, reducing the time
between infractions and corrective action.
3. Jurisdiction. This instruction applies to all juveniles who commit criminal offenses on
Keesler AFB, and/or military family housing areas, and who are dependents of either active duty,
Reserve, Guard, or retired military members.
4. Responsibilities.
     4.1. The 81st Security Forces Squadron (81 SFS) will:
        4.1.1. Issue a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice, for any
        driving offenses committed by juveniles occurring on Keesler Air Force Base and family
        housing. The DD Form 1805 for driving offenses by juveniles will be processed with all
        other DD Forms 1805 issued to adults.
        4.1.2. Issue a Keesler AFB Form 51, Juvenile Citation (Attachment 2), for all other
        juvenile misconduct and attach any statements, reports of investigations, or other relevant
        material to the Keesler AFB Form 51 as enclosures.
        4.1.3. Send a copy of the Keesler AFB Form 51 with enclosures to the Magistrate Court
        Attorney at the 81st Training Wing Staff Judge Advocate’s office as soon as possible.
     4.2. The 81st Training Wing Staff Judge Advocate (TRW/JA) will:
        4.2.1. Monitor the 81 SFS blotters for juvenile misconduct.
        4.2.2. Promptly review Keesler AFB Form 51s and forward them with legal
        recommendations as to disposition to 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee.
KEESLERAFBI51-901 14 September 2007                                                          3


      4.2.3. Appoint a representative (JAG or paralegal) to serve as legal advisor to 81
      MSG/CC or his/her designee for the disposition of each case.
      4.2.4. In the event the JDP is utilized, 81 TRW/JA will maintain records IAW applicable
      guidance.
   4.3. Family Advocacy will act as a consulting body to the JDP. The expertise of family
   systems and clinical interventions may help the 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee in making
   final recommendations on cases disposed of through the JDP. If maltreatment or abuse is
   suspected, a referral will be made to Family Advocacy to address those separate issues.
   4.4. The 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will:
      4.4.1. Evaluate each juvenile misconduct case within his/her jurisdiction and determine
      whether disposition of the case through the JDP is appropriate.
            4.4.1.1. If JDP is deemed not the appropriate forum for resolution, the case may be
            referred to the Harrison County Youth Court for disposition.
            4.4.1.2. Juveniles accused of misconduct are not required to accept an offer to
            dispose of their case through the JDP; however, the juvenile’s case may still be
            referred to Harrison County Youth Court. See paragraph 8.
      4.4.2. If the decision to dispose of a juvenile’s case through the JDP is accepted, the
      juvenile and his or her sponsor will sign a Juvenile Diversion Program Participation
      Agreement. 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will then conduct a Juvenile Misconduct
      Hearing        (JMH). In conducting a JMH, the 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will
      balance the interests of the juvenile and those of Keesler Air Force Base when taking
      appropriate command action, as outlined in paragraph 6. The goal is to rehabilitate the
      offender and deter or preclude future misconduct. In all cases, except barment,
      81 MSG/CC or his/her designee shall take the action directly.
      4.4.3. Prior to recommending barment, 81 MSG/CC or his or her designee will first
      coordinate with 81 TRW/JA for a legal review before forwarding the matter to 81
      TRW/CC for final decision on the barment action.
5. Forum.
   5.1. 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will personally direct the JMH. The alleged juvenile
   offender and his/her sponsor must attend the hearing. A legal advisor, Family Advocacy
   representative, Chaplain representative, Security Forces representative and/or other
   representatives shall attend the JMH upon request by the 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee.
   5.2. JMH will proceed as follows:
      5.2.1. 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will present the allegations of misconduct as
      outlined in reports, such as a Keesler AFB Form 51.
      5.2.2. The alleged offender will have an opportunity to make a brief presentation.
      5.2.3. 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will then determine if the alleged offender
      committed the offense.
 4                                                   KEESLERAFBI51-901 14 September 2007


        5.2.3.1 If 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee determines that the evidence does not support
        that the alleged juvenile offender actually committed the misconduct, the juvenile shall
        be acquitted.
        5.2.3.2 If 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee determines based on a preponderance of the
        evidence that the juvenile committed the alleged misconduct, 81 MSG/CC or his/her
        designee will take appropriate action, as outlined in paragraph 6. Before recommending
        barment, 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee will advise the juvenile offender and his or her
        sponsor in writing that a recommendation to bar the juvenile offender from Keesler AFB
        will be made to 81 TRW/CC.
        5.2.4. If acquitted of the allegations, the offender and his or her sponsor will be presented
        with a memorandum of notice of acquittal. If the 81 MSG/CC or his/her designee finds
        that the juvenile committed the offense(s), the offender and his or her sponsor will be
        presented with a memorandum of action. The memorandum of action will be
        acknowledged in writing by the juvenile and his or her sponsor who will each be
        provided with a copy.
6. Case Disposition. 81 MSG/CC disposes of a juvenile misconduct case by taking appropriate
action. Any action can be taken separately or in conjunction with another action. No provision
of this instruction prevents taking any other administrative or judicial action pursuant to federal,
state, or local statute, Air Force instruction, Keesler AFB instruction, regulation, or local
ordinance.
     6.1. Appropriate command action includes, but is not limited to, the following:
        6.1.1. Taking no action.
        6.1.2. Administering an oral counseling.
        6.1.3. Identifying conditions contributing to juvenile problems and referring the family

     exposed to hazardous environments, consumption of alcoholic beverages, or where they are
     exposed to adult offenders, or to areas where their influence might have a negative impact
     upon other children/youth.
