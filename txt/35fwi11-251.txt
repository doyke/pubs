2. Quiet Period/Airfield Closure Procedures
     2.1. Scope.
        2.1.1. This chapter provides guidance and establishes procedures for requesting and
        implementing a quiet period and/or airfield closure for the following areas:
            2.1.1.1. The entire airfield.
            2.1.1.2. Main Base (including Risner Circle).
            2.1.1.3. The south ramp, including the static display hangars (hangars 949 and 911).
            2.1.1.4. The north ramp.
        2.1.2. These procedures apply to all maintenance and operational activities at Misawa
        AB. They are implemented as outlined in paragraph 2.3.2 for Distinguished Visitor (DV)
        arrivals/departures or when directed by the 35 FW Commander for change of command
        ceremonies, retirements, or other special activities or ceremonies.
            2.1.2.1. Requests are due to 35 OSS/OSOS not later than 30 days prior to the date of
            the requested quiet period unless specified otherwise in this instruction.
     2.2. General.
        2.2.1. Definitions.
            2.2.1.1. Event Areas. A quiet hour period will be classified as affecting one of four
            locations on the installation: Entire Airfield, Main Base, or the North/South Ramp. If
            in doubt, personnel should choose the most restrictive location and obtain further
            guidance from Airfield Management Operations personnel at 226-3110.
               2.2.1.1.1. Entire Airfield. The entire airfield will be closed and remain all quiet
               for the entire period. No takeoffs or landings are permitted, except for aircraft
               involved in aerial demonstrations, or if the quiet period category modifies the
               closure as shown in paragraph 2.3.3. All aircraft engines, AGE, and similar noisy
               equipment must be shut down for the designated time period. Vehicles that
               produce a low noise level may continue to operate on ramps and taxiways, but not
35FWI11-251 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                    3


            in the immediate vicinity of the event (except for emergency vehicles and those
            vehicles required to transport passengers and participants to and from the area).
            This category will mainly be used for high-visibility events such as Wing Change
            of Command, Distinguished Visitor visits, most aerial demonstrations, etc. Note:
            An aircraft with an in-flight emergency will always be permitted to land. In this
            case, the SOF and/or ATC will follow standard procedures regarding landing,
            taxiing, parking, etc., commensurate with the emergency.
            2.2.1.1.2. Main Base. Field operations limited, but remain in effect. No multiple
            approaches. Taxi operations and idle engine runs are allowed on either ramp.
            Vehicles that produce a low noise level may continue to operate on ramps and
            taxiways, but not in the immediate vicinity of the ceremony (except for
            emergency vehicles and those vehicles required to transport passengers and
            participants to and from the area). This category will mainly be used for events
            taking place at Risner Circle or anywhere on main base. Please specify either the
            JASDF area or US area of the installation.
            2.2.1.1.3. North Ramp Event: No aircraft movement, taxi operations or
            engine/equipment runs except for EOR operations or in support of an aerial
            demonstration. Taxi from Runway 10/28 to squadron/transient parking is allowed
            provided the desired parking area or route to parking is not located near the event
            site. No restrictions on south ramp. Please specify either the JASDF area or US
            area of the installation.
        2.2.1.1.4. South Ramp Event: No aircraft movement, taxi operations or
        engine/equipment runs except for EOR operations or in support of an aerial
        demonstration. Taxi from Runway 10/28 to squadron/transient parking is allowed
        provided the desired parking area or route to parking is not located near the event site.
        No restrictions on north ramp. Please specify either the JASDF area or US area of the
        installation.
     2.2.2. Event Types.
        2.2.2.1. Aerial Demonstrations. Participating aircraft may be either military or
        civilian aircraft and could consist of either a single or a multiple aircraft
        demonstration. The field will be closed starting 5 minutes prior to takeoff time and
        last until either 30 minutes or such time as determined by the 35 OG/CC or his
        representative. Note: If the demo is delayed and the aerial demonstration/field closure
        is projected to last longer than 30 minutes, the senior officer attending the demo must
        notify the SOF, who will then coordinate with the 35 OG, ATC, Airfield Management
        Operations, and the Command Post to keep the airfield closed until the demo is
        completed.
        2.2.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV). DV arrivals and departures may require that a
        quiet period is established in a specific area so that greeting or farewell ceremonies
        can be accomplished. Field closures and quiet periods will normally start 5 minutes
        prior to beginning of the ceremonies/activities and terminate 30 minutes later.
        Requests for a longer quiet period/field closure must be submitted in writing through
        35 OSS/OSC to the 35 OG/CC not less than 2 weeks prior to the event. Short notice
        request will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
4                                                           35FWI11-251 4 NOVEMBER 2010


           2.2.2.3. Special Visits and Ceremonies. Special visits and ceremonies are normally
           sponsored by HQ PACAF and should be coordinated as far in advance as possible
           (especially those requiring a static display or F-16 Demo), but not less than 30 days
           before the event. Every effort should be made to minimize the impact on 35 FW,
           Navy, and JASDF flying operations to include consideration for the daily flying
           window, deployments/redeployments, and training and down days. Quiet periods will
           normally start 5 minutes prior to the beginning of the ceremonies/activities and
           terminate 30 minutes later or as deemed by the 35 OG/CC.
           2.2.2.4. Retirement Ceremonies. The airfield will not be closed, nor will quiet
           periods be established, for retirement ceremonies, except if the retiree is in the grade
           of O-7 or above or if the ceremony is hosted by the 35 FW/CC, 5 AF/CC, or PACAF.
           In these cases, the presiding officer or their designated representative will request the
           appropriate quiet period.
           2.2.2.5. Change of Command (COC) Ceremonies. To minimize the impact on flying
           operations, COCs requesting a quiet period should only be scheduled after 1400 local
           on Fridays or outside the normal flying window Monday through Thursday (0830-
           1700 during day flying weeks, 1200-2200 during night flying weeks). Quiet periods
           will not be requested for longer than 45 minutes unless the commander is in the grade
           of O-7 or above, or the ceremony is hosted by the 35 FW/CC, 5 AF/CC, or PACAF.
    2.2.3. Restrictions.
       2.2.3.1. No Take-offs. Take-offs are not permitted at any time during the quiet period,
       exceptions to the restrictions are specified in 2.2.4.
       2.2.3.2. No Landing. Landings are not permitted any time during the quiet period;
       exceptions to the restriction are specified in 2.2.4.
       2.2.3.3. No Engine runs (specify North/South Ramp). Engine runs are not permitted at
       any time during the quiet period in the specified location, exceptions are noted in 2.2.4.
       2.2.3.4. No Aircraft Taxi (specify Alpha/Bravo Taxiway). Aircraft are not permitted to
       taxi on the specified taxiway during the quiet period. All aircraft movements on other
       taxiways remain unrestricted. Exceptions are specified in 2.3.4.
       2.2.3.5. No APU operations. APU operations are not permitted at any time during the
       quiet period in the specified location, exceptions are noted in 2.3.4.
       2.2.4. Exceptions. NOTE: Exceptions to quiet periods will always take precedence and
       supersede any restriction placed on the quiet period.
       2.2.4.1. Emergency Aircraft. An aircraft with an in-flight emergency will always be
       permitted to land. In this case, the SOF and/or ATC will follow standard procedures
       regarding landing, taxiing, parking, etc., commensurate with the emergency.
       2.2.4.2. Straight-in, Full Stop Landing. Aircraft will land via a straight-in approach and
       must hold at the End of Runway (EOR) until cleared to taxi to parking by the SOF or the
       35 OG/CC. Note: An aircraft with an in-flight emergency will always be permitted to
       land. In this case, the SOF and or ATC will follow standard procedures regarding
       landing, taxiing, parking, etc., commensurate with the emergency.
35FWI11-251 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                5


         2.2.4.3. Alert or Hot Scramble Operations. USN P-3 and JASDF hot scramble
         operations will always take precedence over any imposed quiet period.
     2.2.4.4. JAL Operations. JAL flights operations are permitted to maintain scheduled,
     uninterrupted operation regardless of any locally imposed quiet period restriction.
  2.3. Responsibilities. Agencies desiring a quiet hour period will submit requests to 35
  OSS/OSOS at least 30 days prior to the event. Requests submitted inside the 30-day window
  will require 35 OG/CC or delegated approval authority as long as the ceremony does not
  interfere with flying operations.
     2.3.1. Requests to change or modify the quiet hour window once submitted must be
     made no later than 14 duty days prior to the event. Inside of 14 days requires 35 OG/CC
     or delegated approval authority as to minimize the impact to flying operations.
     2.3.2. Airfield Management Operations and 35 OSS/OSOS will publish quiet
     periods/field closures as directed by the 35 OG/CC.
  2.4. Procedures. The 35 FW/CC delegates authority to the 35 OG/CC for implementation
  and execution of all quiet periods/field closures in accordance with this instruction.
     2.4.1. Request, Coordination, and Approval. All requests will be submitted by the
     respective OPR to the 35 OG/CC through 35 OSS/OSOS at least 30 days in advance of
     the event. The OPR for the ceremony should contact 35 OSS/OSOS via phone (226-
     3841/9134), Fax (226-9146), or e-mail (35oss.currentops@misawa.af.mil) to provide
     all required information. Events for which HQ PACAF Public Affairs or Protocol are the
     OPR, should first be coordinated with the respective offices in the 35 FW prior to being
     submitted to 35 OSS/OSOS. Once approved by the 35 OG/CC, 35 OSS/OSOS will be
     responsible for notifying the OPR and the Airfield Manager (Airfield Management
     Operations). Misawa Airfield Management Operations will then notify the following
     agencies of any field closures and /or quiet periods, giving as much advance notice as
     possible:
         2.4.1.1. Air Traffic Control Tower.
         2.4.1.2. Command Post.
         2.4.1.3. Security Forces.
         2.4.1.4. Fire Department.
         2.4.1.5. Transient Alert.
         2.4.1.6. U.S Navy tenant units.
         2.4.1.7. JASDF HQ
         2.4.1.8. 13 FS
         2.4.1.9. 14 FS
         2.4.1.10. 610th ACF
         2.4.1.11. 35 FW Public Affairs
         2.4.1.12. 35 FW Protocol.
 6                                                            35FWI11-251 4 NOVEMBER 2010


           2.4.1.13. HQ PACAF Protocol (as required).
           2.4.1.14. PACAF (as required).
        2.4.2. Execution. During field closures, all aircraft activity within Misawaâ€™s airspace will
        cease. If required, the SOF will coordinate with the 35 OG/CC or his designated
        representative to delay the start of field closures/quiet periods to allow for DV
        arrivals/departures to allow aircraft that have already taxied to takeoff, or to account for
        any other unanticipated occurrence. When quiet periods are imposed upon a portion of
        the airfield (i.e.; north or south ramp only), ATC will route aircraft to best avoid the quiet
        area. If any event is concluded is less than the allotted time, the senior officer responsible
        for the event should contact Airfield Management Operations (226-3110) and /or
        Command Post personnel (226-9899) to allow the field to be reopened.
        2.4.3. Safety. No procedure in this instruction will limit the exercise of good judgment
        on situations involving flying or ground safety.
