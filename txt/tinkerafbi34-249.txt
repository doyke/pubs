  3.5. The ages indicated in the attachment are minimum ages. When using the guidelines,
  parents must assess their child’s maturity to determine whether or not a child may be left
  unattended. Children who do not consistently demonstrate age-appropriate behavior should
  not be given the same degree of self-management responsibilities as those who do.
  Appropriate child welfare notifications will be made in situations where appropriate officials
  determine unattended children are too immature for self-care.
  3.6. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in a Family Advocacy referral for child
  neglect along with a civilian court citation for civilians and possible charges under the
  Uniform Code of Military Justice for military members.
  3.7. If unsure whether a child is mature enough to be alone, parents may consult Family
  Advocacy Program staff or the Airman and Family Services Flight.

                                        CHILD AND YOUTH SUPERVISION GUIDELINES
A2.1. The following policies were approved by the 72 ABW/CC. The ages specified are indicated minimum ages and are based on
the child's ability to demonstrate age-appropriate behavior. Children who do not consistently demonstrate age-appropriate behavior
should not be given the same degree of self-management responsibilities. This policy will be used as a factor in assessing the
reasonableness of a parent's decision or action should there be a complaint or other event concerning child supervision. Direct
questions regarding this policy to the Family Advocacy Officer at 825-6604, the Airman and Family Services Flight Chief at 734-5894
or after normal duty hours the Law Enforcement desk at 747-3737.
