This instruction implements, AFI 63-1001, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program, and Technical
Order (T.O.) 1C-130-101, Implementation of C-130 Series Aircraft Usage Report. It establishes
procedures for compliance with the Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). This
publication applies to all Maintenance Group (MXG) and Operations Group (OG) personnel
assigned at Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF)
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF 847 directly to the 910
MXG/MXQ at Youngstown ARS, OH. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed entirely.
1. General Information.
   1.1. Maintenance reporting is necessary to determine frequency of inspections on aircraft.
   Repairs that are installed on primary structure can change standard inspection requirements
   or necessitate new inspections in order to insure the safety of the aircraft. Usage reporting
   from the OG is used to establish the inspection intervals for the aircraft, determine the service
   life of major components and the schedule of aircraft retirements. The replacement of the
   center and outer wings are predicted from this data.

     1.2. The C-130 ASIP is managed by the C-130 System Program Office, WR-ALC/LBRA.
     This office analyzes data provided by unit Operations and Maintenance functions using a
     web based program called Automated Inspection, Repair, Corrosion and Aircraft tracking
     (AIRCAT). Operations personnel input aircraft usage data using the Usage Data Input (UDI)
     segment and Maintenance personnel utilize the Inspection, Corrosion And Repair Recording
     (ICARR) segment for documenting required ASIP inspections, aircraft structural repairs and
     reports of damage to aircraft structures. A major function of the United States Air Force
     (USAF)-AIRCAT system is to provide data to generate the ASIP report. This report is used
     to make decisions regarding modifications, acquisition, reassignment and retirement of the
     Air Force C-130 aircraft.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Quality Assurance (QA) chief will monitor the ASIP program and perform
     quarterly inspections to ensure compliance and operational inputs into the AIRCAT system.
     2.2. The ASIP project Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) for Maintenance reporting will be
     a member of the Fabrication Flight and will ensure accurate and timely reporting in
     accordance with applicable technical data.
     2.3. The ASIP project NCO for Operations will be a member of the 773rd Airlift Squadron
     & 757th Airlift Squadron Flight Engineer sections and they will ensure the aircraft usage is
     reported in a timely manner in accordance with 1C-130-101, page 2 paragraph 3 and review
     reporting rates to ensure compliance.
3. Maintenance Group Reporting Requirements.
     3.1. The Maintenance actions that require reporting will be identified in the specific work
     cards, T.O. or Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO). For example Isochronal (ISO)
     work cards, T.O. 1C-130A-3, Structural Repair Instructions & T.O. 1C-13A-36, Non-
     Destructive Inspection Procedures. A current copy of all work cards requiring Inspection,
     Corrosion and Repair Reporting (ICARR) inputs will be in the Maintenance Group ASIP
     monitor’s binder.
     3.2. Any Maintenance actions that are reported in ICARR as a defect that requires a repair
     action, the repair action must also be reported in ICARR in accordance with T.O. C-130A-
     23, System Peculiar Corrosion Control, chapter 1 , section IX. At deployed locations, data
     may be entered on a laptop or notebook computer with AIRCAT/ICARR loaded on them.
     Data may be uploaded to ICARR at deployed location if connectivity is available, or upon
     return to home station.
     3.3. The project NCO for maintenance will report completion of ICARR inputs to the ISO
     dock chief during the post dock briefing commensurate with the conclusion of each aircraft
     ISO inspection
     3.4. A training syllabus will be developed by the project NCO so that consistent training can
     be conducted by user sections. This syllabus will be in the ASIP monitor’s binder.
     3.5. A list of authorized users (MXG only) will be maintained in the ASIP monitor’s binder.
910AWI63-1001 13 JULY 2010                                                                   3


   3.6. Plans & Scheduling will review and schedule in the ISO package all Non-Destructive
   Inspection (NDI) requirements and will identify them as ASIP requirements from the 1C-
   130A-6, “Aircraft Scheduled Inspection and Aircraft Maintenance Instructions” and
   associated ISO work cards in accordance with AFI 21-101 para. 14.6.7.
4. Operations Group Reporting Requirements.
   4.1. For all 910th Airlift Wing (910 AW) aircraft, the flight engineer must document a C-
   130 E/H Series Flight Data worksheet that is located in the mission folder to record each
   flight during debrief. Once completed, the worksheet will be returned to the mission folder
   and the flight engineer will subsequently forward the worksheet to the designated Operations
   Group ASIP representative or the command post for input into the AIRCAT system. The
   worksheet may be discarded 90 days after the data has been entered into the system.
   4.2. Data will be entered into the AIRCAT database by operations personnel using the Usage
   Database Input (UDI) software after the completion of each mission. Alternatively, data may
   be entered on a laptop or notebook computer with the alternative mobile UDI software, and
   then downloaded to the AIRCAT server upon return to home station.
