 2                                         AFI11-418_HOLLOMANAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012


1.2.1. (Added) For the purposes of this regulation, during AFRC periods, the Reserve Group
Commander or equivalent deputy will assume OG/CC responsibilities.
      3.2.1. (Added) The flying unit will schedule the stand-by duty officer (SDO) anytime
      the SOF and Operations Supervisor (OPS SUP) are not qualified in an aircraft that is
      flying local sorties. For example, if the SOF and OPS SUP are F-22 qualified only, then
      there will be a T-38 qualified SDO scheduled and available during the T-38 flying
      window. Any unit flying locally at Holloman AFB will have a qualified OPS SUP
      available during their specific MDS flying period.
      3.2.2. (Added) A squadron supervisor will be available in the squadron during all
      Functional Check Flights (FCF) flights.
          4.1.1.1. (Added) The OPS SUP program will be administered by each flying unit.
          Unit Stan/Eval will ensure OPS SUP compliance with AFI11-418.
          4.1.1.2. (Added) Designated OPS SUPs will review all publications listed in
          Attachment 5 prior to performing OPS SUP duties. Designated OPS SUPs will be
          identified on the squadron ―Letter of X’s‖.
          4.1.2.1. (Added) When the 49th Operations Group Commander (49 OG/CC) or 44th
          Fighter Group Commander (44 FG/CC) will not be immediately available, he will
          appoint an acting OG/CC for flying operations. During acting OG/CC changeover,
          the new acting OG/CC will ensure the Command Post and SOF are notified of the
          changeover with current location and phone number. The 49th Wing (49 WG) flying
          coversheet will reflect scheduled acting OG/CC.
          4.1.3.1. (Added) Tenant unit Letters Of Agreement (LOA) concerning SOF
          responsibilities will be maintained at 49 OG/OGV, in SOF binders in the tower, and
          on the SOF sharepoint (https://holloman.eim.acc.af.mil/49 OG/SOF/default.aspx).
          Tenant units will have a squadron supervisor who will ensure the SOF is informed of
          their current location/phone number. The SOF will notify the tenant unit’s squadron
          supervisor of any abnormalities involving tenant aircraft as soon as conditions permit.
          The 49 OG SOF will work together with the tenant unit squadron supervisors to
          effectively handle any tenant unit aircraft emergencies. Tenant unit SOF participation
          in the 49 OG SOF program is at the discretion of the 49 OG/CC and the tenant unit’s
          Operation Group Commander.
          4.1.3.2. (Added) All TDY units flying at Holloman AFB will have a squadron
          supervisor who is readily available to assist their aircraft experiencing an in-flight
          emergency (IFE). The 49th Operations Wing Scheduling (49 OSS/OSOS), will print
          on the front page of the daily schedule the type of aircraft that are TDY at Holloman
          AFB and the unit’s scheduled squadron supervisor with phone number. The host unit
          is responsible for ensuring 49 OSS/OSOS receives all required TDY unit contact
          information. Local area in-briefs will include the requirement for an OPS SUP to be
          in place not later than 30 minutes prior to their unit's first takeoff.
      4.1.5. (Added) Transient aircraft who arrive/depart outside the local flying window may
      request SOF support. This request will be coordinated in advance and the acting OG/CC
      will determine availability of 49 WG personnel to assist on a case-by-case basis.
AFI11-418_HOLLOMANAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012                                                             3


        4.3.4.1. (Added) The first SOF each day will ensure the airfield inspection was
        completed prior to the start of local flying. Due to the unique operations at
        Holloman, the airfield inspection may be complete before a SOF is required. If it was
        not accomplished, the SOF will perform the airfield inspection or coordinate with
        Airfield Management. Items to investigate (as conditions permit) include: condition
        of runways and main taxiways, any potential foreign object debris (FOD) hazards,
        barrier condition, lighting, signs, hot pit locations, and general airfield is suitable for
        safe flying operations.
        4.3.8.1. (Added) SOFs will stay abreast of all local flying to ensure they are
        prepared to handle any contingency. The SOF must be familiar with the local flying
        schedule (including TDY detachments flying out of Holloman AFB, drone launches,
        DEMOs, distinguished visitors, exercises, etc.). SOFs must monitor airfield and local
        area weather conditions, airspace schedule and changes, alternate airfield status,
        Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS), bird watch conditions, and airfield equipment.
        4.3.9.1. (Added) The SOF will work in conjunction with the tower watch supervisor
        to the max extent possible for coordination of runway changes and barrier
        configurations.
        4.3.10.1. (Added) The SOF will electronically complete a Holloman AFB SOF
        Daily Report (Attachment 7) for each flying day. The electronic HAFB Daily
        Report     can      be    found     on    the     49     OG      SOF     sharepoint
        (https://holloman.eim.acc.af.mil/49     OG/SOF/default.aspx)      and    will    be
        saved/uploaded at the end of each day. SOFs will ensure all program and equipment
        deficiencies are documented on the bottom of the report and inform the SOF program
        manager. SOFs will work with Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM)
        personnel to log the accomplishment of SOF tours and upgrades.
     4.3.12. (Added) SOFs will sign off the Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Squadron
     Operations Read Files (ORF), and SOF read files prior to assuming SOF duties.
        4.4.3.1. (Added) Each squadron OPS SUP will ensure that appropriate checklists
        and phone contact lists are immediately available at the OPS SUP duty location. For
        periods when there is no SOF on duty, the OPS SUP will ensure that the acting
        OG/CC is notified for incidents involving Holloman AFB and tenant unit aircraft.
        4.4.4.1. (Added) The SDO must have access to appropriate checklists and be in the
        flying squadron or available via phone or radio to immediately respond to aircraft
        specific questions.
     4.5.4. (Added) Squadron supervisors and the SOF must have two-way communication
     at all times due to the close integration of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) and manned
     aircraft in the same airspace. Due to the unique requirements of RPAs (i.e.—frequency
     deconfliction, last six altitude stacks, etc.) the 49 OSS/OSOS will post the primary RPA
     OPS SUP of the day on the coversheet of the daily schedule for overall RPA decision
     inputs.
     4.5.5. (Added) Squadron supervisors and the SOF have the authority to place aircraft on
     weather hold. OPS SUPs who place aircraft on weather hold will notify the SOF and
     OG/CC immediately.

       5.1.1.1. (Added) When time permits, pilots with emergencies will contact the SOF.
       The pilot in command of an aircraft experiencing an in-flight emergency may elect to
       use a Single Frequency Approach (SFA) frequency. This frequency is for use by IFE
       aircraft only. The watch supervisor will ensure the frequency is included in a
       notification message transmitted on the primary crash alerting system. The Base
       Operations Dispatcher will relay the frequency when the secondary crash alerting
       system is activated. In the event there are multiple emergencies, each emergency
       aircraft will be assigned its own discrete frequency, if required. Once communication
       is established on the assigned frequency, emergency aircraft will remain on their
       discrete frequency until the emergency is terminated.
       5.1.5.1. (Added) Ensure aircraft that experience an IFE for engine, hydraulic, hot
       brakes, or electrical problems are checked by the fire department after landing and
       that the Fire Chief releases them prior to the aircraft returning to the parking ramp.
    5.1.9. (Added) The Flight Surgeon's Office (FSO) will respond to the following
    emergency situations with an ambulance and a crew of one flight surgeon and two
    medical technicians:
       5.1.9.1. (Added) Suspected or confirmed in-flight or ground fire.
       5.1.9.2. (Added) Planned arrested landing.
       5.1.9.3. (Added) Physiological incident in flight.
       5.1.9.4. (Added) Flight control problem.
       5.1.9.5. (Added) Unsafe gear indication (when within five minutes of estimated
       time of arrival).
       5.1.9.6. (Added) Dual engine anomaly on dual engine aircraft, or any engine
       problem on a single engine aircraft.
       5.1.9.7. (Added) Known aircraft structure damage.
       5.1.9.8. (Added) F-16 emergency power unit firing (or possible hydrazine
       exposure).
       5.1.9.9. (Added) Any incident where potential for aircraft damage and/or pilot
       injury exists, or as requested by the SOF or fire chief.
    5.1.10. (Added) If a SOF is not on duty, the control tower watch supervisor and airfield
    operations personnel will coordinate airfield assistance for emergency aircraft. The
    watch supervisor will call to advise the acting OG/CC of the emergency as soon as the
    situation permits.
    5.1.11. (Added) The SOF will contact the acting OG/CC via telephone, hand-held radio,
    or cellular telephone as soon as practical after a declared aircraft emergency. Notifying
    the acting OG/CC shall not take priority over managing the emergency situation. When
    able, the SOF will give the acting OG/CC as much information as time permits, and will
    outline the game plan for handling the emergency.
    5.1.12. (Added) If an IFE is declared, confirm the tower watch supervisor is aware of
    the IFE, the crash net is activated, and the situation is broadcast on Guard frequency
AFI11-418_HOLLOMANAFBSUP 4 JUNE 2012                                                         5


     ("IFE in progress, expect…."). Emergency response vehicles have priority over taxiing
     aircraft. Caution must be used due to RPAs not having peripheral vision of oncoming
     emergency response vehicles.
     5.1.13. (Added) During arrested landings, if the nature of the emergency permits, the
     pilot may be directed to remain in the cockpit to ride the brakes to clear the runway.
     Ensure transient pilots are advised if this situation arises. When an approach-end barrier
     engagement is anticipated on Runway 22, ensure ground controller directs aircraft
     holding in arming area Echo to taxi south on Taxiway E and hold clear of Runway 22.
     5.1.14. (Added) When the SOF is informed that an Air Mobility Command (AMC)
     aircraft is inbound to Holloman AFB with an airborne emergency, the SOF will pass all
     available information to the Command Post and OG/CC.
     5.1.15. (Added) In conjunction with the tower watch supervisor, determine if visitors
     should be directed to leave the tower to minimize distractions during an IFE.
     5.1.16. (Added) If live weapons or hung ordnance are involved, pass number and type
     to emergency personnel and refer to HAFB 11-250, Airfield Operations and Base Flying
     Procedures, for further instruction to include parking locations.
        6.2.3.1. (Added) The opening SOF will complete the opening checklist procedures,
        including the airfield inspection if not already accomplished by Airfield Management
        and remain on duty until the last aircraft is shut down.
        6.2.3.2. (Added) When a SOF is not required (per AFI 11-418 Table 1) for a period
        of at least 1 hour, the SOF may leave the tower. The SOF will keep a land mobile
        radio (LMR) on hand and inform both the acting OG/CC and Command Post prior to
        leaving the tower. The SOF will then be required to adhere to 6.2.3.1. when returning
        to the SOF duty location. If a SOF changeover is scheduled to occur during the
        flying break, ensure that a handoff of the LMR and an appropriate changeover
        briefing occurs.
     6.2.4. (Added) 49 OSS/OSOS will develop a wing SOF schedule during the weekly
     scheduling meetings and include it in the weekly products for the wing. SOF duty
     periods will be scheduled IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and will not normally
     be scheduled for a period in the primary duty location greater than six hours in any 24-
     hour period. 49 OSS/OSOS will annotate opening and closing SOF times in the daily
     schedule.
     6.2.5. (Added) SOF changeover will normally consist of a face-to-face briefing and
     complete all items in the changeover checklist. If unable to face-to-face brief, phone
     debrief is acceptable if all changeover checklist items are accomplished.
            6.3.2.1.1. (Added) The alternate SOF location for Holloman AFB is the SOF
            vehicle on the airfield.
     6.3.4. (Added) The OG/CC may waive the SOF duty location on a case-by-case basis.
            6.4.1.1.1. (Added) The SOF will monitor primary UHF channel, SFA, and UHF
            Guard at all times until an IFE dictates otherwise. Communications problems will
            be reported to tower supervisor, radio maintenance, Communications Squadron,
            and 49 OG/OGV.

    6.4.3.1. (Added) The SOF vehicle will be kept at Airfield Management or the
    Control Tower and is primarily used to accomplish SOF duties such as the daily
    airfield inspection and responding to emergencies. The SOF vehicle keys and LMR
    will be kept inside the key box at Airfield Management or the 1st floor of the tower.
    Prior to using the vehicle, the SOF will sign off the vehicle log (once per day), have a
    flightline driver’s license, and have two-way communication (UHF or LMR) with
    tower. Other organizations may borrow the SOF vehicle on a case by case basis, with
    SOF permission, if it does not interfere with SOF duties. The borrower must be able
    to return the SOF vehicle immediately when called by the SOF, in no case to exceed
    10 minutes. If there is a problem with the vehicle or its contents, contact 49
    OG/OGV.
    6.4.6.1. (Added) The SOF position in the tower will be maintained by 49 OG/OGV
    and will include as a minimum:

        6.4.7.2. (Added) If the SOF vehicle or an alternate location becomes the operating
        location due to a tower evacuation, the SOF will take the required Dash 1s for all
        manned aircraft (TO 1 F-22A-1, GAF T.O. 1F-PA200(IDS) -1, and TO 1 T/AT-38 -
        1) currently flying. RPA Dash 1s are available to aircrew in the GCS. All local MDS
        checklists are prepositioned in the SOF truck.
     6.4.8. (Added) The LMR batteries should remain in the charger only until charged.
     Once charged or when the batteries are attached to the radio, LMRs should be removed
     from the charger to decrease potential damage. SOFs should take care not to dump the
     secure radio keys by ensuring they turn off the radio prior to replacing a drained battery.
     Removing the battery with the radio on or not changing batteries quickly (within 20 sec)
     with the radio off will cause the radio to lose its secure keys. If the secure key is lost,
     contact the Command Post (572-7575) to re-key the radio.
        6.6.1.1. (Added) All 49 WG SOFs are also qualified as instructor SOFs if
        previously qualified SOF at the completion of their initial SOF upgrade. First time
        SOFs will be instructor SOFs after completing 10 SOF tours. SOF qualifications will
        be noted on each squadron ―Letter of X’s‖.
        6.6.6.1. (Added) Upgrading SOFs will complete the SOF Upgrade Checklist
        (Attachment 6) prior to beginning SOF training. The initial SOF training
        requirements are listed in Attachment 5. Upgrading SOFs will complete and return
        the SOF Training Checklist to 49 OG/OGV prior to assuming SOF duties.
        6.7.3.1. (Added) To ensure noncurrent SOFs receive requalification credit, both the
        noncurrent and the current SOF will sign in on the SOF Daily Report. The upgrading
        SOF will be listed in the remarks section, and both SOFs will log a SOF event with
        their respective SARM shop.
        6.8.2.1. (Added) Attendance of a semi-annual SOF meeting fulfills the requirement
        for annual continuation training and the OG/CC briefing. If unable to attend the SOF
