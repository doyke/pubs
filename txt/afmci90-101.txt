                                                                                            Pages: 7

This instruction implements policy in AFPD 90-1, Policy Formulation. Use this instruction in conjunc-
tion with AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications, and AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill.
This instruction outlines procedures for tracking, preparing and processing suspenses, official memoran-
dums, electronic coordination, messages, electronic staff summary sheets (eSSS) and staff summary
sheets (SSS). It applies to the HQ AFMC staff, Centers, and associate units, and includes policies and
procedures unique to the AFMC Command Section. This publication does not apply to Air National
Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units. See Attachment 1 for glossary of refer-
ences and supporting information. See Attachment 2 for HQ AFMC Directorate-level authorization and
delegation. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are main-
tained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records,
and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https:/
/afrims.amc.af.mil/.


1. General Guidance.
   1.1. The Command’s standard for suspense processing is 100 percent on time. Quality and good staff
   work should not be sacrificed for timeliness. Our goal is to provide leadership, both internal and
   external to AFMC, with the best information to make sound decisions in a responsive manner. Every
   effort should be made to electronically staff and coordinate all correspondence within AFMC. The
   maximum use of electronic coordination will reduce the paper consumption within AFMC and
   increase the speed and efficiency of staff coordination. This instruction is designed to cover the over-
   arching staffing process. Detailed guidance can be located in the AFMC Command Action Officer’s
   (AO) Guide. A link to the AO Guide can be found on the AFMC Home Page.
   1.2. Some packages will be required in hardcopy format. Examples of hard copy packages include:
   classified, award letters, legal paperwork, documents requiring hard signatures, etc. Hard copy pack-
   ages will follow the approved format and coordination guidance prescribed in the AO Guide.
2                                                                           AFMCI90-101 2 JUNE 2006


    1.3. All response formats will be completed using templates detailed in the Action Officer’s Guide.

2. Key Players and Responsibilities.
    2.1. HQ AFMC/CS:
       2.1.1. HQ AFMC/CS will assign all Command taskings that require AFMC CC/CV/CA approval
       and process to the appropriate HQ directorate for accountability. CS has the final authority for
       completeness of all taskings prior to AFMC CC/CV/CA approval.
       2.1.2. AO Guide. HQ AFMC/CS will maintain and update the AFMC AO Guide. The AO Guide
       will have detailed information regarding the tasking process and required templates to assist
       AFMC action officers.
       2.1.3. Action Officer Training. HQ AFMC/CS will provide quarterly action officer training for
       HQ AFMC action officers. The training will include the tasking process and required templates.
       2.1.4. AFMC Tasking Automated Information System Training. HQ AFMC/CS will provide
       quarterly training on the AFMC Tasking Automated Information System.
    2.2. HQ AFMC Directorates (A and Special Staffs):
       2.2.1. All taskings within the Command will be assigned to a HQ directorate as OPR (there may
       be exceptions for specific taskings involving AFMC Air Base Wings). In instances where the sus-
       pense requires addressing at a lower level, the directorate still retains overall ownership until com-
       pletion. Directorates shall assign a primary and alternate suspense tracking monitor. Directors,
       deputies or their designated representatives will review and forward completed suspense packages
       to HQ AFMC/CS upon completion of the final quality check.
           2.2.1.1. HQ AFMC directorates are authorized to approve/sign items listed in Attachment 2
           of this instruction.
           2.2.1.2. HQ AFMC directorates are authorized to create responses or task other organizations
           as needed.
       2.2.2. Managers and action officers at all levels will become familiar with the AFMC tasking pro-
       cess.
    2.3. Centers and Equivalent-Level Organizations:
       2.3.1. Task suspenses to the appropriate level to ensure accurate completion of the task.
    2.4. Action Officer (AO). At all levels the AO is the person, whether military, Air Force Civilian or
    contractor, acting in the capacity to provide an answer or information. The AO is responsible for
    adherence to the format, grammar and policies delineated in the AO Guide.
       2.4.1. HQ AFMC AOs will complete the prescribed AO training within the first 4 months of
       being assigned to HQ AFMC. Upon arriving, new personnel will be prompted via the HQ in-pro-
       cessing checklist to sign up for the training. HQ AFMC/CS will ensure all required individuals
       receive training.
       2.4.2. HQ AFMC AOs will establish a user account with the approved suspense system upon
       completion of AO training. Note: AFMC Command policy is to use one system to track taskings
       as determined by HQ AFMC/CS.
AFMCI90-101 2 JUNE 2006                                                                                   3


      2.4.3. The OPR owns the package from start to finish and needs to know the status of the package
      and its whereabouts at all times. The AO is responsible for tracking the package until such time as
      the final message, memorandum, etc., is signed and transmitted. The office that transmits the final
      package will courtesy copy the AO to ensure the suspense is closed.

3. Suspense Tasking Process:
   3.1. Standard Process. All AFMC organizations will follow the AFMC tasking process as described
   in the AFMC AO Guide.
   3.2. Suspense Initiation. Command standard is to task all suspenses through the AFMC organiza-
   tional workflow email accounts. HQ AFMC directorates will task other organizations as offices of
   coordinating responsibility (OCR) using official organizational workflow accounts. The HQ AFMC
   AO is authorized to concurrently courtesy copy organizational accounts at lower levels if known. For
   example: If the HQ AFMC AO routinely works with a specific Center Wing/Group/Squadron on an
   issue, this allows them to provide a preemptive heads-up directly to that office while keeping the sus-
   pense tracking offices updated at the same time. All AFMC organizations will use a standardized
   electronic mailbox down to the division/squadron level. AFMC organizations may use a standardized
   electronic mailbox at lower levels if practical. A detailed list of all organizational mailboxes can be
   found in the AFMC AO Guide. The following examples are meant to standardize the organizational
   electronic mailboxes:
Example Listing on Global Address List                       Org Level
AFMC Workflow                                                Command
AFMC/A3 Workflow                                             HQ AFMC Directorate
ESC Workflow                                                 Center
88 ABW Workflow                                              Wing
88 MSG Workflow                                              Group
88 SVS Workflow                                              Squadron
   3.3. Suspense Tracking. Suspense tracking will be in accordance with the approved system as delin-
   eated in the AO Guide.
   3.4. Changing Suspense Dates. Upon receipt of the suspense, the AO will determine as soon as pos-
   sible if the suspense date is realistic and attainable. If the AO determines the suspense date is unreal-
   istic or unattainable, they will fill in the approved extension template as listed in the AO Guide and
   route it to their suspense tracking office for proper submission.
   3.5. Suspense Coordination. The AO is responsible for ensuring all coordination is accomplished
   before final submission of package. Organizations may opt out of coordination to speed up the pro-
   cess; however, the directorate or Center ultimately decides what level of coordination is required. The
   lowest level possible should take action in order to streamline the process (Deputy/Vice vs. Com-
   mander/Director). Every effort should be made to reduce redundant format reviews on response pack-
   ages. There should be one chief editor at each HQ AFMC Directorate and Center reviewing the
   packages prior to submission.

    3.6. Responses Requiring Rework. Responses returned for rework will have additional guidance
    for the OPR in order to satisfy the requirements of the suspense prior to resubmission. Specific staff-
    ing and rules of engagement will be described in the AO Guide.

4. Correspondence Distribution.
    4.1. Once a package is completed, HQ AFMC/CSE will determine if the Command Section or the
    OPR will distribute. If the Command Section or HQ AFMC/CSE distributes, a courtesy copy will be
    provided to the OPR.

5. Special Handling and Process Requirements.
    5.1. Classified Information:
       5.1.1. Secret/Collateral. Secret/Collateral packages will be hand carried with appropriate cover
       sheets to the Command Section and processed through HQ AFMC/CSE. Packages will be appro-
       priately marked with proper classifications, security markings and downgrading instructions.
       Packages will have an attached classified cover sheet on the front and back.
       5.1.2. Special Access Required (SAR)/Top Secret. SAR and Top Secret packages will be staffed/
       coordinated through appropriate offices as required and allowed on a “need to know” basis. These
       packages may be exempt from processing through HQ AFMC/CSE due to the security require-
       ments. Determination of exemption will be made by the security manager of the OPR. However,
       every attempt will be made by the AO and office of origination to follow the same format as
       described in this instruction.
NOTE: Only unclassified information will be entered into the HQ AFMC Tasking automated informa-
tion system.
    5.2. Receiving classified (Secret/Collateral). Personnel authorized to pick up classified packages
    for their directorate or agency must be designated in writing to do so by their security manager. Their
    security manager is required to ensure all appointment letters on file with HQ AFMC/CSE are updated
    as required.
