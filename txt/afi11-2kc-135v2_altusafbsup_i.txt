AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Procedures, and MAJCOM supplement and AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management.
1.8. Evaluations. This instruction establishes standardized instrument (INSTM), qualification
(QUAL), mission (MSN), SPOT, and instructor (INSTR) evaluation criteria. It also establishes
the areas/subareas necessary for the successful completion of evaluations, and which required
areas/subareas will be considered critical and/or non-critical.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish combined evaluations whenever practical. Crew
Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated on all evaluations. KC-135 aircrew
members will complete the following evaluations (except SPOT evaluations), at 17-month
frequency according to AFI 11-202V2, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Units
collocated with a simulator facility will conduct pilot INSTM and QUAL flight evaluations in
the simulator. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for conducting INSTM/QUAL evaluations in
the aircraft due to simulator availability. Forward approved waivers to AMC/A3VK through
AFRC/A3V and NGB/A3O. In addition, document waivers in standardization and evaluation
board (SEB) minutes. Units without co-located simulators may elect to send crews to simulator
locations to perform INSTM/QUAL evaluations.
     1.9.1. Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation. All KC-135 pilots and navigators will successfully
     complete a periodic instrument evaluation including an open-book, written instrument
     examination and an instrument simulator or flight evaluation.
     1.9.2. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation. All KC-135 crewmembers will successfully
     complete a periodic qualification evaluation including the requisite open-book, closed-book
     and Boldface written examinations, emergency procedures evaluation (EPE), publications
     check, and a simulator or flight evaluation.
     1.9.3. Mission (MSN) Evaluations. The KC-135 primary mission is tanker air to air
     refueling. See crew position chapters for additional mission evaluations. All KC-135
     crewmembers will complete a mission evaluation as required in AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and
     MAJCOM SUP. Except as noted in the following crew position chapters, all crewmembers
     will be evaluated in designated areas/subareas required in the performance of a single
     operational or training sortie to successfully complete the MSN evaluation.
AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012                                                       7


     1.9.3.1. All primary crewmembers must be mission qualified in each specific mission
     prior to performing any maneuvers associated with that mission (example: A receiver air
     to air refueling qualified aircraft commander will not perform any receiver air to air
     refueling if the other primary pilot does not have a receiver air to air refueling mission
     qualification). Exception: Crewmembers not qualified in the specific mission may
     perform maneuvers under the supervision of a mission qualified instructor. Refer to AFI
     11-2KC-135 Volume 3 to determine whether instructor supervision is required to be
     direct or indirect for the specific maneuver.
  1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in the KC-135,
  crewmembers will successfully complete an initial instructor qualification course and
  evaluation. Subsequently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on
  their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. Individuals may accomplish a QUAL,
  INSTM, or MSN evaluation in conjunction with initial INSTR evaluation if all required
  items of the respective evaluation are accomplished. Refer to the specific aircrew chapter for
  requirements.
  1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy the
  requirements of a periodic (e.g., INSTM, QUAL, MSN) evaluation. SPOT evaluations have
  no specific requisites or requirements unless specified in this AFI or MAJCOM/Unit
  supplement. See AFI 11-202V2 for options to convert a SPOT evaluation to meet
  requirements of a periodic evaluation.
  1.9.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). See AFI 11-202V2 and the following:
  Evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and system knowledge during MSN
  evaluations. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
  INSTM/QUAL eval) but the combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover
  required areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation. Refer to the
  specific aircrew chapter for requirements and the following:
     1.9.6.1. Units will develop EPE program requirements (topics, special interests, etc.) and
     publish in unit supplements. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the
     examinee’s level of training, qualification (e.g. initial, line, instructor, evaluator) or as
     specified in AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM Supplement. Units may utilize EPs
     demonstrated during simulator evaluations to fulfill this requirement.
     1.9.6.1. (ALTUSAFB) At a minimum, the Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)
     will test the examinees knowledge of aircraft systems particularly with respect to
     emergency procedures. The emergency scenario will be tailored to the experience level
     of the examinee. Scenario based evaluations will focus on emergency procedures found
     in section III of TO 1C-135-(K)R(II)-1, and may contain topics currently listed as Special
     Interest Items. Emergency procedure evaluations in the simulator will be conducted per
     provided simulator guides.
     1.9.6.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
     examinee must be able to recite all Boldface items from memory and provide the initial
     actions of selected emergency procedures that would not allow time for reference.
     1.9.6.3. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
     supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
 8                                         AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012


        Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
        Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
        successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-
        202V2.
     1.9.7. Evaluation Prefixes/Unique MSN Suffixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes
     for AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, and AF Form 942, Record of
     Evaluation. Utilize ―Cargo‖ or ―ARR‖ (air refueling receiver) parenthetical (e.g. MSN
     (Cargo) or MSN (ARR)) to distinguish unique MSN evaluations in the flight phase section of
     the AF Form 8 and AF Form 942. The first entry of the AF Form 8, Examiners Remarks, A.
     Mission Description will describe the circumstances for any required evaluation prefix or
     unique mission suffix.
     1.9.8. Multiple Qualification/Difference Evaluations. When multiple aircraft qualifications
     are to be maintained, follow guidance in AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM
     Supplement as applicable. The KC-135 community uses the phrase ―difference‖ to describe
     training of one or more areas to meet certification requirements in the same series aircraft in
     the same MDS (e.g. Pacer CRAG Block 30 to Block 40, MPRS, T-Model difference
     certification).
     1.9.9. Manual Gear Extension and Manual Flap Lowering. Mandatory on all navigator and
     boom operator initial qualification and initial instructor boom/navigator evaluations. Flap
     lowering may be accomplished in-flight or on the ground. Optional item for all other
     evaluations.
1.10. Grading Policies.
     1.10.1. Use the grading criteria in this instruction in conjunction with AFI 11-202V2 to
     grade areas/subareas accomplished during an evaluation.
     1.10.2. When in-flight or simulator evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area
     may be verbally evaluated. Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required
     areas/subareas via flight, simulator or static training tools before resorting to this provision,
     to include scheduling an evaluation completion sortie/simulator. When a verbal evaluation is
     used, the evaluator will identify the area or items within the area that were verbally evaluated
     on AF Form 8 as an examiner remark (following the mission description).
        1.10.2.1. For pilots only, if the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for
        performance of a maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the
        upper and lower limits of that range.
        1.10.2.2. Flight examiners will use sound judgment in the application of the grading
        criteria in this instruction to determine the final grade.
1.11. Grading System. Refer to AFI 11-202V2.
1.12. Conduct of Evaluations.
     1.12.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
     of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
     the examinee in each graded area/subarea.
AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012                                                        9


       1.12.1.1. Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily
       trained, recommended for upgrade evaluation, or who render their
       effectiveness/performance reports.
       1.12.1.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any
       crew position/seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s
       performance. As a last resort, evaluator pilots may conduct evaluations when scheduled
       as primary aircrew members and in this case will perform all duties required of that
       position (e.g., mandatory advisory calls, etc.).
   1.12.2. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance
   criteria during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.
       1.12.2.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
       1.12.2.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and
       this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall grade. The flight
       examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique, the flight
       examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area/subarea
       grades assigned, and any additional training required.
       1.12.2.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
       additional training requirements and restrictions, whether critical or non-critical.
       Normally, additional training should not be accomplished on the same flight.
       EXCEPTION: Additional training on the same flight is allowed when, in the evaluator’s
       judgment, unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities (e.g., thunderstorm
       avoidance, crosswind landings) exist. This option requires utmost flight examiner
       discretion and judicious application. When used, the examinee must be informed of
       when the additional training begins and ends.
       1.12.2.4. When evaluations are less than Q-1 performance, the flight examiner will
       debrief the examinee and examinee’s commander (supervisor).
   1.12.3. A certified simulator/training device will be used to accomplish additional training
   and re-checks when available and when criteria to be graded can be realistically
   accomplished in the device.
   1.12.4. The flight examiner who administered the original evaluation will not administer the
   recheck, unless there is no other option available to ensure timely completion of evaluation.
1.13. Unsatisfactory Performance – Evaluator Responsibilities. Refer to AFI 11-202V2.
1.14. Use of AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally OGV) will
overprint AF Form 3862/PEX version, using the examples at Attachment 2, Attachment 3, or
Attachment 4, to use as an evaluation worksheet. Copy each title, area number and text (in the
order illustrated) to the appropriate blocks. Units may add special interest items and/or local
evaluation requirements. Use the worksheet to ensure all required areas are evaluated. File the
examiner-signed worksheet or draft copy of the AF Form 8 in the aircrew member’s Flight
Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evaluation as a temporary record of the
evaluation results. Maintain until the finished AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, then discard.

   1.14.1. Trends. Record performance data for tracking aircrew trends. Performance
   information is required only for major areas; units may optionally record information for sub-
   areas (example: a full flap landing followed by a touch-and-go can be recorded under the
   major area of ―Landings‖ or can optionally be recorded under both ―Normal Landing (50
   Flap)‖ and ―Touch-and-Go‖).
1.14. (ALTUSAFB) Use of AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. AF Form 3862
is available via authorized Stan/Eval database software (PEX or GTIMS). 54 ARS/DOV may
maintain squadron generated overprints, but will ensure these documents maintain each title, area
number and text in the order illustrated on Attachments 2, 3 & 4 of AFI11-2KC-135V2.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. For all initial and RQ evaluations, testing requirements are
prerequisites. For all other evaluations, testing requirements are requisites. See specific testing
requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the following:
   1.15.1. Secure Question Bank (SQB). Each unit will maintain a SQB from which Open
   Book and Instructor Open Book exams will be derived. The unit SQB may be a single
   question bank (containing all questions for all crewmembers) or may be separate question
   banks (separate question banks for each crew position, mission, and/or aircraft type; there
   may also be classified and unclassified SQBs). As a minimum, SQB questions will be drawn
   from appropriate information contained in FCIF Volumes I, II, III, and IV (per AFI 11-202
   Volume 2); however, questions may come from any source deemed pertinent to the operation
   of unit aircraft and performance of the assigned mission.
   1.15.2. Open Book Exam (Open Book). The open book examination will consist of a
   minimum of 40 questions from the SQB.
   1.15.2. (ALTUSAFB) All initial and requalification instructor students (pilot and boom)
   will complete an Instructor Open Book exam as a prerequisite to the instructor evaluation.
   1.15.3. Closed Book (Closed Book). The closed book exam will consist of a minimum of 20
   questions derived from the Master Question File (MQF). All crewmembers with Boldface
   responsibilities will complete a Boldface exam in conjunction with the closed book
   examination.
   1.15.4. Instrument Exam.       Pilots and navigators only, see AFI 11-202V2 instrument
   requirements.
1.16. Typical KC-135 Evaluation Profile.
   1.16.1. Units determine a flight evaluation profile to maximize successful completion of all
   evaluation requirements on a single in-flight mission. A typical profile may include takeoff,
   cruise, rendezvous, air to air refueling (AAR), and transition when pilot QUAL and INSTM
   portions are to be accomplished in-flight along with the MSN evaluation. Aircrew training
   simulator (ATS) profiles will be used for accomplishment of simulator evaluations. Flight
   examiners may alter the order of maneuver accomplishment and may request to see
   additional maneuvers. Flight examiners may not alter mission parameters (weather, winds,
   gross weight, etc) from restrictions placed in this volume or HQ AMC approved ATS
   courseware.
   1.16.1. (ALTUSAFB) Evaluations may be conducted on any Altus AFB scheduled training
   sortie that meets the requirements of the flight evaluation, i.e. Air to Air Refueling (AAR)
AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012                                              11


   scheduled if required. Permanent party evaluations may be conducted on off-station
   missions. Evaluators and schedulers will ensure that the scheduled mission meets the
   requirements of the evaluation.
1.17. Senior Officer Requirements. See AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and the appropriate
aircrew chapter.

                                            Chapter 2

                                    PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including the requirements for instrument, qualification, mission, and instructor pilot evaluations.
   2.1.1. Flight evaluation of INSTM/QUAL is not authorized when ATS is collocated with
   unit of assignment (EXCEPTION: Refer to paragraph 1.9). Events that are accomplished
   during ATS portion of the evaluation are not required to be evaluated again (e.g. if a non-
   precision approach is flown during a one engine inoperative approach and landing, it does
   not have to be re-accomplished during the instrument phase of the check ride); however a
   landing will be accomplished in flight in conjunction with the MSN evaluation. Events
   accomplished during the flight portion of the evaluation are not required to be evaluated
   again during the ATS portion of the evaluation.
   2.1.2. Examiner pilots will utilize the standard ATS evaluation profile. Ceiling for all
   simulator evaluations will be set no lower than 200 feet above the lowest compatible circling
   approach minimums. Visibility will be set no lower than 1 mile above the lowest compatible
   circling approach minimums. Crosswinds for simulator evaluations will not be greater than
   10 knots.
   2.1.3. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Pilot specific evaluation events are listed in Attachment 5 of
   this supplement. Detailed Rules of Engagement for check-ride guidance is listed on the 54
   ARS/DOV SharePoint site.
2.2. Instrument Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualifications). KC-135 instrument
evaluations should be combined with a qualification evaluation. Include all items under
GENERAL and INSTRUMENT. Evaluations will be conducted in a certified simulator when
collocated at the unit. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for conducting INST/QUAL
evaluations in the aircraft due to simulator availability. Forward approved waivers to
AMC/A3VK through AFRC/A3V and NGB/A3O. In addition, document waivers in SEB
minutes.
2.3. Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). KC-135 qualification
evaluations should be combined with instrument evaluation. Include all areas under GENERAL,
and QUALIFICATION. Evaluations will be conducted in a certified simulator when collocated
at the unit. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for conducting INST/QUAL evaluations in the
aircraft due to simulator availability. Forward approved waivers to MAJCOM/A3V who will in-
turn provide copies to AMC/A3VK. In addition, document waivers in SEB minutes.
   2.3.1. FPC (qualified legacy copilot). Evaluate pilot duties performed from the right seat.
   Engine-out activity, touch and go, and 30/40 flap landing not required.
   2.3.2. FP (flight pilot – e.g. senior officer), FPQ (pilot initial qualification pilot – ―PIQ‖),
   MP (mission pilot), IP (instructor pilot). Evaluate FPQ and MP on at least one landing in
   both left and right seats. A 30 or 40 flap landing is required for dual seat qualified pilots but
   may be accomplished in either seat. Four-Engine pattern work not required. An instructor
   pilot may receive all periodic evaluations in either seat, but are not required to be evaluated
AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012                                                        13


   in both. If an IP evaluation takes place in the right seat, taxi and full-stop braking do not
   need to be evaluated.
   2.3.3. (Added-ALTUSAFB) All initial and requalification pilot students will complete an
   ops limits examination either verbally or written sheet as a pre-requisite to their Qualification
   (QUAL) evaluation.
2.4. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Re-qualifications). Include all areas under
GENERAL and MISSION (Tanker AAR). Rendezvous is required. Receiver must maintain the
contact position (minimum duration determined by evaluator) but an actual offload is not
required. Autopilot-off AAR is required on at least one contact (duration at the discretion of the
evaluator). When INSTM/QUAL evaluation is performed in ATS, a landing will be
accomplished per pilot in conjunction with the MSN evaluation.
   2.4.1. FPC. Evaluate pilot duties performed from the right seat.
   2.4.2. IP, MP, FPQ. Pilots can be evaluated in either seat and will be evaluated on AAR and
   a breakaway as the pilot flying. Breakaway procedures can be evaluated with receiver not in
   contact, but within the AAR envelope.
   2.4.3. Senior Officer Basic (QUAL) Qualification. Senior Officer initial, periodic and re-
   qualification evaluations include the areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION, and
   INSTRUMENT. Area 13D, Right Seat Landing and Area 16, Simulated Engine-Out Ops are
   not required.
       2.4.3.1. Conduct an EPE to Senior Staff Officers in a random selection of Boldface
       procedures.
       2.4.3.2. Testing requirements. Senior Officer initial, periodic and re-qualification
       evaluations include the following requisites:
           2.4.3.2.1. Instrument exam.

           2.4.3.2.3. KC-135 Closed book test.
           2.4.3.2.4. Boldface exam.
       2.4.3.3. Annotate AF Form 8 crew position as ―FP‖, type of evaluation is QUAL/INSTM
       and include an expiration date. Add the following restriction in the remarks:
       ―RESTRICTION: This evaluation permits operating the aircraft from a primary crew
       position only under direct supervision of an instructor pilot.‖
   2.4.4. (Added-ALTUSAFB) All initial and requalification pilot students will complete a
   written boldface examination as a pre-requisite to their Mission (MSN) evaluation.
2.5. Additional Qualification/Mission Evaluations.
   2.5.1. Receiver AAR. Include all areas under GENERAL and MISSION (Receiver AAR).
   For initial/re-qualification evaluations, rendezvous or closure from a minimum of 1 NM is
   required. Initial and re-qualification pilots will demonstrate 15 minutes of contact time
   within a 30-minute period of arriving in the astern position. Evaluate aircraft commanders in
   left seat. Evaluate instructors in either seat. During periodic evaluations, pilots will perform
   10 minutes of contact time within a 20-minute period of arriving in the astern position.
 14                                      AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012


   Evaluate limits demonstrations for instructor pilots, inadvertent disconnect tolerances and
   breakaway procedures. Conduct a portion of the evaluation with tanker autopilot off.
   Annotate ―Receiver AAR Qualified‖ in the remarks section.
   2.5.2. Operational Mission Evaluation (OME). A flight evaluation given to prospective
   aircraft commanders prior to aircraft commander certification. The profile must be balanced
   between mission availability and the imperative to not delay aircraft commander
   certification. The evaluation profile is at the discretion of the operations group commander
   or equivalent. With OG/CC or equivalent approval, a full qualification/instrument and/or
   mission evaluation administered just prior to aircraft commander certification may satisfy
   this requirement. If a qualification/instrument and/or mission evaluation is used, the focus
   for the evaluation shall be on decision making and CRM.
       2.5.2.1. Suggested profile for OME. Conduct in the left seat, ground operations, taxi,
       takeoff/departure, rendezvous and tanker AAR, descent/arrival, and off-station RON.
       2.5.2.2. Documentation. Document the OME on the AF Form 8 as a ―SPOT‖ evaluation
       and include the following comment in the remarks section, ―This OME was conducted in
       conjunction with aircraft commander certification.‖ If this evaluation is intended to
       satisfy the requirements of a qualification/instrument and/or mission evaluation, comply
       with the requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and this AFI. Include the remark ―This
       evaluation was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander certification.‖
2.6. Instructor Evaluation. Flight examiners will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s
ability to recognize student difficulties and provide timely, effective and corrective action. At a
minimum, demonstrate and instruct a variety of approaches. NOTE 1: Pilots who desire to
realign their INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation during the initial instructor evaluation will
complete (demonstrate) all required areas/subareas in GENERAL, QUALIFICATION,
MISSION (Tanker AAR), INSTRUCTOR, and complete all required requisite written
examinations. NOTE 2. For Receiver AAR by an instructor pilot, limited inadvertent
disconnects are permissible during a boom limits demonstration and will not be counted against
the instructor pilot examinee at the examiner’s discretion. NOTE 3. Initial instructor
evaluations combined with a QUAL or MSN evaluation that results in a Q3 requires successful
completion of the failed QUAL or MSN evaluation before attempting another INIT INSTR
evaluation.
   2.6.1. Conduct initial or requalification instructor evaluations with a qualified pilot
   occupying the other seat. On initial instructor evaluations, the examinee will occupy the
   right seat and a qualified instructor (or evaluator) will sit in the other seat for IP-only
   maneuvers and demos. Initial instructor evaluations are to be conducted in the simulator
   whenever possible and may be completed in the traffic pattern-only.
       2.6.1.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) During the ground evaluation/EPE, instructor candidates
       will brief an instructional topic (i.e. landing attitude demo, simulated engine out
       procedures, etc). Each brief should not exceed 10 minutes. Evaluators may specify the
       briefing topic or allow the students to choose a topic. Initial instructor evaluations will
       include a written boldface examination as a pre-requisite.
AFI11-2KC-135V2_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 11 May 2012                                                       15


     2.6.2. Administer periodic instructor evaluations in conjunction with INSTM/QUAL/MSN
     evaluation. Include all areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION, MISSION (Tanker
     AAR), MISSION (Receiver AAR) (if applicable), INSTRUMENT, and INSTRUCTOR.
2.7. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Unit determines EPE requirements. EPE will
normally be conducted in certified simulator in conjunction with INSTM/QUAL evaluation.
One-on-one discussions or on-aircraft evaluation methods may be utilized when certified
simulator is not available to conduct the EPE. The EPE should cover a cross section of aircraft
systems. Examinees should be able to demonstrate an understanding of aircraft systems in
emergency scenarios. Include situations during takeoff/climb-out, cruise, and approach to
landing phases. The EPE may also include emergency egress, aircrew flight equipment (AFE),
and FCIF and/or special interest identified EPE topics.
     2.7.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) 54 ARS DOV will maintain a pilot EPE/general knowledge
     guide. Initial and requalification pilot ground evaluations should normally consist of asking
     the student questions from this guide. The goal is to standardize the knowledge level
     expected of students for each qualification level. Evaluators will focus questions on the type
     of evaluation being given, i.e. aircraft system and instrument procedures for the
     INSTM/QUAL evaluation and AAR and Tactical procedure questions for the MSN
     evaluation.
2.8. Pilot Grading Criteria.
