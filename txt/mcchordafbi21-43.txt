                                             Chapter 1

                                 HANGAR DOOR OPERATION

1.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes responsibilities and procedures for proper and safe
hangar door operation for facilities assigned to the 62d and 446th Airlift Wings (62/446 AW).
OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAE (DSN 382-6975/4152/Commercial 253-982-6975/4152)
1.2. Procedures.
     1.2.1. This chapter contains all steps necessary for safe operation of designated hangar
     doors. All personnel operating hangar doors must be familiar with and comply with all
     directions covered under AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety,
     Fire Protection, and Health Program (AFOSH); Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
     Standard (AFOSHSTD) 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities;
     AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard; and
     AFOSHSTD 91-100, AMC Sup 1. NOTE: Each hangar type has a separate and individual
     instruction for the operation of its doors. This chapter and Attachments 2-9 to this instruction
     will be posted on hangar doors for the operator’s use.
     1.2.2. All personnel required to operate hangar doors will receive annual door-specific on-
     the-job training (OJT) from a certified trainer (5-skill level or civilian equivalent) using a
     current lesson plan. The training plans are located in \\AW_Common\Common\Hangar
     Doors\Hangar Door Training\Masters (See Attachment 10 for course codes.) Work center
     personnel previously identified in Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) for
     Mobility (G081) as qualified under course code SAFE 1100 and are current operators of their
     work center hangar doors are considered qualified to train and will train and certify new
     users on only their specific work center hangar doors. Certification for maintenance
     personnel will be entered into the G081 system. Non-maintenance personnel will use an AF
     IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, for documentation of their training. Dual-
     training documentation is not required in accordance with (IAW) AFI 91-301, paragraph
     7.3.1. However, AF IMT 55 must list hangars as work center safety hazards.
        1.2.2.1. All personnel that routinely work in hangar facilities in the performance of their
        duties, regardless of Air Force specialty code or duties, must receive initial awareness
        training available via computer-based training (CBT) at the Distance Learning Center or
        its website:       https://62mxginfo.mcchord.af.mil/dlc/main.asp upon assignment.
        Awareness training will be documented in G081 using course code SAFE 1100 for
        maintenance personnel and the AF IMT 55 for all others.
        1.2.2.2. For non-maintenance personnel required to operate hangar doors, the squadron
        commander will forward a letter to the 62d Maintenance Group Commander (62
        MXG/CC) listing qualified and authorized door operators for each type of hangar door.
        Total number of qualified operators will be kept to a minimum.
     1.2.3. Hangar doors will only be operated using the ―two person‖ concept with the second
     person acting as a safety observer during operation. They will also act as a safety guard in
     the case of a door malfunction while the first person seeks assistance.
     1.2.4. To save heat during cold weather operations, the following instructions will apply:
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 5


       1.2.4.1. When towing aircraft into and out of hangars, the tow supervisor will ensure the
       hangar doors are opened/closed as required for energy conservation.
       1.2.4.2. The main hangar doors will be utilized for entry/exit of vehicles and equipment
       that cannot be safely moved through the service roll up doors.
   1.2.5. As applicable, the work center supervisor/facility manager of each hangar will:
       1.2.5.1. Maintain the door operating instruction using current attachments to this
       instruction.
       1.2.5.2. Post a current set of door operating instruction by each door’s control switch.
       1.2.5.3. Maintain legible identification stencils for all door control switches.
       1.2.5.4. Maintain hangar door ―FULL OPEN POSITION‖ markings located at the wing
       tip clearance floor marking or wider.
       1.2.5.5. Ensure a nose wheel stop line perpendicular to the nose wheel guideline is
       maintained outside each hangar and identified with ―STOP! CHECK WING TIP
       CLEARANCE HERE‖ markings.
       1.2.5.6. Paint a nose wheel stop line inside the hangar, perpendicular to the nose wheel
       guideline, to indicate the mandatory stop position where the aircraft is to be parked. Stop
       lines will be painted in all hangars for C-17 aircraft.
       1.2.5.7. Maintain floor markings for minimum 10-foot hangar door opening distance.
       1.2.5.8. Ensure the 62 AW Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) at DSN 382-3336 is
       notified of inoperative doors and the measures taken to correct the problem. Call in
       emergency work order requests to 62d Civil Engineer Squadron (62 CES) work order
       desk at DSN 382-5739.
       1.2.5.9. Hangar doors are to be locked out only by personnel qualified and certified
       under the requirements of AFOSHSTD 91-501.
   1.2.6. In case of a power failure, electrically operated hangar doors will only be disengaged
   and operated by qualified 62 CES personnel, properly trained facility managers, and Aircraft
   Maintenance Squadron/Maintenance Squadron (AMXS/MXS) production superintendents.
   Manual operation by unqualified personnel may result in hangar doors falling from door
   tracks.
1.3. Hangar Door Status Reporting. Hangar door discrepancies, repair status, and get-well
date of inoperable door systems will be tracked by facility managers and up channeled to the
group facility managers. This information will be briefed by 62 CES monthly to the 62
MXG/CC and 62 AW/CC.
1.4. Other Related References. AFIs, AFOSH STD, AWIs, and TOs are listed in Attachment
1.

                                             Chapter 3

                               CONFINED SPACES PROGRAM

3.1. Introduction. This chapter defines the Confined Spaces Program and is applicable to all
units and personnel assigned or attached to the 62d and 446th Maintenance Groups (62/446
MXG). OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI (DSN 382-5361/Commercial 253-982-5361)
3.2. Procedures.
     3.2.1. Each squadron with personnel requiring entry into a permit-required confined space
     on a regular basis will implement a confined space program utilizing a Master Entry Plan
     (MEP) and Training Program in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Occupational Safety and
     Health (AFOSH) Standard 91-25, Confined Spaces. The MEP must:
        3.2.1.1. Be reviewed annually and forwarded to 62d Airlift Wing Safety (62 AW/SEG),
        Bioenvironmental Engineering (62 MDS/SGPB) and the Fire Department (62 CES/CEF)
        for approval.
        3.2.1.2. Identify all trained individuals authorized to perform as an entry supervisor,
        entrant or attendant. If an Organizational Rescue Team is required, trained members will
        also be identified.
        3.2.1.3. Document atmospheric monitoring, if required by the MEP, on McChord AFB
        IMT 604 or equivalent (i.e., the Confined Space Field Permit used in 62 MXS/MXMCF).
        The McChord AFB IMT 604 must be kept on file for one year and be available to 62
        AW/SEG, 62 MDS/SGPB and 62 CES/CEF personnel.
     3.2.2. Reclassification of a confined space is mandatory and a new confined space entry
     permit (CSEP), McChord AFB IMT 604 or equivalent, must be routed through 62 AW/SEG,
     62 CES/CEF and 62 MDS/SGPB for approval whenever:
        3.2.2.1. Conditions develop that are not consistent with the MEP.
        3.2.2.2. A chemical is introduced into a confined space or when performing work not
        identified in the MEP or CSEP. An atmospheric test must be completed to avoid a
        potential asphyxiation when performing work that creates dust (sanding) or toxic
        byproducts.

                  WARNING TAGS & CIRCUIT BREAKER COLLARS

4.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes additional local guidance outside of AFI 21-101,
TO 00-20-1 and applicable MAJCOM supplement(s) for the use of circuit breaker collars and the
AF Form 1492, Warning Tag. OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI (DSN 382-
5361/Commercial 253-982-5361)
4.2. Responsibilities. Maintenance Group squadron commanders, superintendents, and
supervisors at all levels are responsible for ensuring compliance with this chapter.
4.3. General. As applicable, a circuit breaker collar or an AF Form 1492 readily identifies a
temporary unsafe condition or system that, if operated, could result in injury to personnel and/or
damage to equipment.
4.4. Flight Line Procedures. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, complete all warning
tag or circuit breaker collar documentation IAW AFI 21-101 and/or TO 00-20-1 (and applicable
MAJCOM supplements). See Attachments 14 and 17.
   4.4.1. Circuit breaker collars are the preferred method of locking out circuit breakers. In
   such cases, perform the following:
       4.4.1.1. In the discrepancy block, annotate the number of collars and/or warning tags
       installed by task number followed by an applicable warning note (written or underlined in
       red). For example, ―3 C/B collars installed IAW S/S/SN 07-12-01-1 NOTE: Do not
       apply power to galley - fire hazard‖, ―NOTE: Fuel lines disconnected - Do not apply
       electrical power‖ or ―NOTE: T/S or R2 in progress – Do not reset‖. Itemization and
       location of collars/tags is no longer required since this information is clarified in the
       S/S/SN. See Attachment 14 Block 1.
       4.4.1.2. DELETED
       4.4.1.3. Circuit breaker collars and/or warning tags may be documented in the original
       (warranting) discrepancy as long as the original discrepancy is a red ―X‖. If documented
       separately, use the - See Pg ____ Item ____ format for both original and collar/tag
       discrepancies. Additionally, use the same JCN (no WES/WCE) as the original (or
       warranting) discrepancy. See Attachment 14 Blocks 2 and 3.
       4.4.1.4. When circuit breaker collars and/or warning tags are removed, annotate the
       number of tags/collars removed in the corrective action block with the applicable S/S/SN
       and line through the warning note. When warning tags/collars are written up as separate
       discrepancies only the inspected by block is required to be signed. See Attachment 14
       Block 3.
       4.4.1.5. DELETED
   4.4.2. DELETED
   4.4.3. If a warning tag is used, PART A will be attached to the aircraft so that it will be
   visible to personnel attempting to operate the affected system. PART B will be attached to
   the aircraft forms binder ring aligned with the discrepancy listing the tag(s).
 12                                            MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


   4.4.4. Prior to removal, technicians will ensure the condition that warranted the tag or collar
   has been corrected by physically verifying the warranting discrepancy has been cleared.
   Remove both parts of the tag from the forms and aircraft and clear the warning tag or collar
   discrepancy IAW TO AFI 21-101 and/or TO 00-20-1 (and applicable MAJCOM
   supplements).
       4.4.4.1. When the system is to be reactivated the discrepancy will be upgraded to a red
       ―X‖ prior to repair actions.
4.5. C-17A paperless HSC procedures. All warning tags or circuit breaker collars associated
with the four HSC packages will be numbered chronologically beginning with 001 and stored in
a separate warning tag book. Each shop involved in the HSC will maintain a separate warning
tag book for their respective portion of the HSC. The book will remain with the dock controller
for the duration of the HSC or until all tags and/or collars are removed from the aircraft. One
discrepancy will be entered in G081, to cover the entire warning tag/collar book for each shop.
The discrepancy will read as follows: ―(SHOP) warning tag/collar book # 000 XXX used for this
HSC‖ and the symbol will be a Red ―X.‖ To easily track warning tags & circuit breaker collars,
transparent envelopes containing PART B (if applicable) will be maintained in the book. When
the aircraft is released from HSC, all tags & collars will be accounted for and cleared. If an
unsafe condition still exists, a new warning tag or collar will be installed and entered in the
aircraft forms IAW AFI 21-101 and/or TO 00-20-1 (and applicable MAJCOM supplements).
The HSC controller will ensure all forms documentation is completed.
   4.5.1. For accountability and control purposes, warning tag/circuit breaker collar books are
   only authorized for aircraft undergoing HSC or hard point inspections. All warning
   tag/collar books will be maintained by the dock coordinator for accountability and control.
   4.5.2. All additional warning tags required for HSC component removals, additional
   inspection requirements or any other conditions requiring a warning tag will be placed in the
   HSC shop warning tag book as outlined in paragraph 4.4 and kept at the dock coordinator
   desk.
       4.5.2.1. Technicians will ensure that additional warning tags/collars are annotated in
       G081. Example: LEFT AFT NAV LIGHT INOP. 2 C/B COLLARS INSTALLED IAW
       S/S/SN XX-XX-XX.           Corrective action example: R2 LIGHT. COLLARS
       REMOVED/RESET CBS. OPS CK GOOD.
4.6. Procedures to follow when more than one work center needs to tag the same system.
When the same aircraft system is required to be locked out by more than one work center, ensure
an additional warning tag entry is annotated for the same system IAW paragraphs 3 and 4 of this
chapter. The additional warning tag(s) Part A will be attached to the effected system circuit
breaker or component and additional Part B for each warning tag(s) with the aircraft AFTO Form
781A along with an additional corresponding 781A entry. When maintenance is complete,
follow paragraph 3 of this instruction for removal procedures. However, do not reset system
circuit breaker(s), components, or return the system to normal until all additional maintenance
has been completed on the system and all warning tag(s) have been removed.

                   AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SAFETY PROGRAM

5.1. Introduction. This chapter outlines the elements of McChord AFB’s Aircraft Maintenance
Safety Program (AMSP). OPR for this chapter is MXG MRM/AFSO 21 (DSN 382-6115)
   5.1.1. Background. The introduction of Maintenance Resource Management (MRM) to the
   Air Force has greatly improved awareness of the specific nature of aircraft maintenance
   safety. However, without an active program to support and ensure implementation of the
   knowledge provided during MRM training, the training is orphaned, hampering the
   realization of the full intended benefits. Implementation of an AMSP within MXG becomes
   the next logical step, incorporating MRM training and taking its concepts from the classroom
   to the flight line.
   5.1.2. Goal. The primary goal of the AMSP is to reduce mishaps representing a risk to
   aviation personnel and resources through a focus on safety in aircraft maintenance activities.
   As part of supporting the USAF’s Mishap Prevention Program and IAW AFI 91-202, The US
   Air Force MISHAP Prevention Program , Chap 7 Flight Safety, the AMSP also ensures the
   integration of all flight line maintenance activities into 62 AW’s Flight Safety Program.
   5.1.3. Strategic Alignment. An important premise of the AMSP is the recognition that the
   inherent risks and related consequences associated with supporting flying operations warrant
   an enhanced focus. As part of the AFI 91-202 requirement for alignment/integration with
   flight safety and to ensure the commensurate level of focus and attention within the aircraft
   maintenance community, the AMSP seeks to focus on bridging the gap with flight safety
   while actively drawing a distinction from the vast arena of general safety.
5.2. AMSP Framework. The AMSP is supported by three key components: training,
promotion and program tools. Together, these components aim to create a safe environment
focused on prevention and preventative measures.

5.4. The Program Components.

Figure 5.3. AMSP Program Components.




   5.4.1. Training. As the fundamental building block of the program, training provides
   enhanced awareness of aircraft safety and related resources available to ensure all those
   involved in aircraft maintenance are able not only to perform their work safely but also to
   contribute to the overall enhancement of aircraft maintenance safety. The primary
   component of AMSP Training is Maintenance Resource Management (MRM) Training.
   This training is supplemented by specialty training for personnel involved in managing the
   AMSP. Recurring briefings such as Wing Flight Safety Briefings, which review Flight
   Safety Mishaps, other opportunity briefings (i.e. at Commanders’ calls, roll calls, etc…),
   AMSP Discussion Forums and a variety of aircraft maintenance safety information further
   supplement the primary training.
      5.4.1.1. Maintenance Resource Management (MRM) Training
          5.4.1.1.1. General. MRM is supported by AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
          Maintenance Management, AMCSUP1, Chap 2, Safety, and is intended to foster
          safety focus within the maintenance community. By training on how error reduction
          efforts through analysis can improve processes, MRM training works to reduce
          maintenance errors, decrease maintenance-induced damage, and decrease on-the-job-
          injuries. MRM Training teaches how to integrate the technical skills of maintenance
          personnel with interpersonal skills and basic human factors knowledge along with
          operational risk management in order to improve communication, effectiveness, and
          safety in maintenance operations.
          5.4.1.1.2. MRM Training Objectives:
             5.4.1.1.2.1. Overall Objectives. Using Federal Aviation Administration Advisory
             Circular (AC) 120-72, Maintenance Resource Management Training, as basic
             guidance, in conjunction with the local wing safety, flight safety, Union, and the
             medical squadron, provides the required formal training to support the AMSP,
             prevent mishaps, mitigate and reduce maintenance errors, decrease maintenance-
             induced damage, decrease on-the-job injuries, and devise improvement strategies
             while increasing the mission capable rate.
             5.4.1.1.2.2. Specific objectives for the training include:

20                                       MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


        and supplemental information about the AMSP and STAT. 446 MXG will follow
        AFRC A-4 guidance on frequency of training.
        5.4.1.1.4.3. Initial training consists of a 2-day class taught by the MRM Training
        Manager, approved Air Force instructors, or industry experts and completing an
        end-of-course examination with a passing score of 80% corrected to 100%.
        Trending of class average will be accomplished by the MRM Training Manager
        and reported quarterly.
        5.4.1.1.4.4. Biennial recurring training will consist of a 1-day class taught by the
        MRM Training Manager, qualified Air Force personnel who have been certified
        to instruct by the MRM Training Manager or industry experts. In addition to an
        overview of the AMSP, this course will provide reinforcement of basic ORM
        principles, provide a means to update all personnel on new MRM information and
        industry standards, and provide a means to share and cross flow success and
        problems encountered over the past two years between all levels of personnel.
        5.4.1.1.4.5. Personnel assigned to McChord AFB attending this course will be
        considered TDY for the duration of the course and be relieved of home-station
        responsibilities.
        5.4.1.1.4.6. Documents Produced/Maintained:          Registration information,
        feedback, and test sheets will be maintained for one year following class
        completion. Student study guides will be provided to all attendees and will be
        updated to reflect current Air Force and industry information. Course plans of
        instruction will be maintained.
        5.4.1.1.4.7. All course material will have an annual validation and recertification
        approved by the MXG/CC or designate.
        5.4.1.1.4.8. The course shall include an overview of the AMSP with special focus
        on Program Tools and provide for flexibility to emphasize areas of concern
        identified by STAT trend data.
     5.4.1.1.5. MRM Implementation Tools:
        5.4.1.1.5.1. Purpose.    MRM implementation tools are provided for self-
        prevention, mitigation, and prevention of maintenance errors. These tools will be
        utilized to reduce maintenance errors, decrease maintenance-induced damage, and
        decrease on-the-job injuries.
        5.4.1.1.5.2. The TKC (Think Ahead, Know the Risks, Choose to be Safe) Card
        (Attachment 18) is a tool designed to provide a fast and effective reference
        document to quickly and efficiently assess potentially hazardous tasks and ensure
        that the technician involved understands the risks associated and can mitigate
        them.
        5.4.1.1.5.3. This card DOES NOT AUTHORIZE deviation from technical data.
        Rather, it allows a technician(s) qualified on the task, but who may not be
        completely proficient or experienced, to review the risk factors associated with
        the task and determine if it is appropriate to proceed.
        5.4.1.1.5.4. Maintenance personnel who are involved in complex or potentially
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                        21


         hazardous tasks, where inexperience may be a concern, will conduct an
         assessment of the task and concur to GO or NO-GO. If conditions exists which
         are a NO-GO condition, the maintenance personnel will immediately inform the
         on-duty supervision and request mitigation of the hazard.
         5.4.1.1.5.5. The ―Knock It Off‖ card (Attachment 19) is designed for ALL
         personnel to have a visual cue in the event that a hazardous or nonstandard
         condition exists where ANY person feels unsafe, is unsure of how to proceed, or
         identifies a potential hazard to life, limb, or equipment.
         5.4.1.1.5.6. The term ―Knock It Off‖ is the common assertive statement for all
         MXG personnel to stop any action in order to address concerns or assess potential
         hazards.
         5.4.1.1.5.7. The back side of the ―Knock It Off‖ card contains a generic pre-task
         briefing. It provides valuable information to maintenance team members prior to
         starting a maintenance task. If no pre-task briefing is provided in the technical
         order or job guide, all members will review this prior to starting any task.
         5.4.1.1.5.8. Any time any member of our organization witnesses a potentially
         unsafe situation during their maintenance activity, they will call a ―Knock It Off‖
         by addressing the senior maintenance person(s) present and saying ―Knock It
         Off.‖
            5.4.1.1.5.8.1. ―Knock It Off‖ will:
            5.4.1.1.5.8.2. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation from technical data
            or a potential safety concern(s).
            5.4.1.1.5.8.3. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before the
            mishap occurs.
            5.4.1.1.5.8.4. Notify all maintenance team members that someone sees the
            maintenance team departing from established guidelines, technical data, or
            that someone is simply uncomfortable with the developing situation.
              5.4.1.1.5.8.4.1. Upon calling a ―Knock It Off‖ members will:
              5.4.1.1.5.8.4.2. Safety permitting stop all activities in question.
              5.4.1.1.5.8.4.3. Listen to the initiating maintenance team member voice his
              or her concern(s).
              5.4.1.1.5.8.4.4. Be provided an opportunity by the senior maintenance
              person present to voice their inputs relative to the stated concern(s).
              5.4.1.1.5.8.4.5. After evaluating all inputs, continue the current course of
              action or have the senior maintenance member direct a new course of action.
              5.4.1.1.5.8.4.6. The senior maintenance team member present is the final
              on-scene decision-making authority; however, if any member of the team
              believes that their concerns were not properly addressed, that member
              MUST pursue their concern using the chain of command. There will be NO
              concern for reprisal or punishment. Commanders at all levels will
22                                           MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


                  investigate any alleged reprisal and take appropriate corrective action when
                  necessary.
     5.4.1.2. Specialty Training
        5.4.1.2.1. General.    Specialty training will supplement basic MRM training.
        Provided based on demand, it shall provide the MXG AMSP Manager, Squadron
        POCs and Facilitators with more in-depth aircraft/flight safety related training as well
        as standardized STAT specific content expertise to maximize data integrity. Some of
        this training, such as STAT use and content, can be taught in house using MRM
        resources while AMC, Air Force and commercial sources shall be explored to cover
        the more generic areas.
        5.4.1.2.2. Specialty Training content shall include but not be limited to the following:
            5.4.1.2.2.1. Effective management of aviation safety programs.
            5.4.1.2.2.2. Specific responsibilities associated with each position (MXG AMSP
            Manager, Squadron POCs, and Facilitators).
            5.4.1.2.2.3. AMSP Tools with specific emphasis on functionality of the STAT
            database, intent of each field, review of previously inputted data, etc.
     5.4.1.3. Participation of Maintenance Personnel at Flight Safety Briefings
        5.4.1.3.1. General. As per AFI 91-202 Chapter 7, Flight Safety, like the flight crews,
        all flight line maintenance personnel should be briefed on aircraft mishaps. As part of
        the AMSP, this is extended to all MXG personnel.
        5.4.1.3.2. Flight Safety Briefings are regularly scheduled events which provide a
        review of recent flight safety accidents/incidents to improve awareness. These events
        serve as an important reminder of the inherent risks and consequences associated with
        flight operations and the need for constant vigilance and attention to detail by all
        personnel involved in operating or supporting flying operations. Even though some
        of the content may not directly involve maintenance, these briefings foster better
        overall awareness and impress the one team one fight concept as it relates to safety.
        Participation at these briefings by all available MXG personnel shall be the goal, with
        access to the briefing materials through the Squadron POCs for those unable to
        attend.
     5.4.1.4. Opportunity Briefings
        5.4.1.4.1. General. There are recurring opportunities where unit personnel are
        gathered to pass on information. Each of these opportunities shall be considered as a
        chance to pass on AMSP type information. For example, Commanders’ calls should,
        whenever possible, include a briefing on recent AMSP safety issues/information.
        Roll calls can be used to educate personnel on recent AMSP related issues and for
        quick dissemination of safety information.
     5.4.1.5. AMSP Discussion Forums
        5.4.1.5.1. General. On a quarterly basis, or in conjunction with appropriate themed
        events (i.e. safety days), Squadron POCs and/or Facilitators will hold discussion
        groups on aircraft maintenance safety with working level personnel. Specific themes
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              23


        or talking points based on past maintenance events, ongoing areas of concern or
        aviation safety topics can be used to facilitate discussion. Efforts shall be made to get
        all attendees involved in the discussion and Squadron POCs or Facilitators shall focus
        their role to keeping the discussion alive. The aim of these discussion groups
        includes emphasizing importance from the leadership level by scheduling time out to
        focus on safety, getting the worker level involved in thinking about safety, having
        personnel provide input on how to improve safety in all aspects of aircraft
        maintenance safety
     5.4.1.6. Aircraft Maintenance Safety Material
        5.4.1.6.1. General. There are a variety of sources to obtain aircraft maintenance
        safety information. Establishing communication channels to these sources is an
        important part of maintaining an up to date AMSP. This information shall be
        disseminated by the MXG AMSP Manager through the most expeditious means
        considering the urgency of the information. Various information sources include but
        are not limited to civilian aviation authorities (i.e. FAA), other services’ air branches,
        and foreign military air forces.
  5.4.2. AMSP Promotion
     5.4.2.1. General. The key to a vibrant safety program is ensuring that it becomes part of
     the unit culture. To facilitate this process, it must be widely communicated, constantly
     emphasized and supported by all members of the chain of command. As such, all
     opportunities shall be used to stress the importance of overall aircraft maintenance safety
     and safe work practices.
     5.4.2.2. Safety Focus. Specific efforts shall be made at all levels to target and eliminate
     behaviors which create an unsafe work atmosphere such as horseplay, unwarranted
     urgency, distractions, etc. In order to ensure maximum personnel involvement and data
     integrity, maximum effort shall be made to promote data collected by the STAT as
     distinct and separate from information gathered for disciplinary purposes and focused on
     positive performance.
     5.4.2.3. AMSP Awards. As an important element of the AMSP the awards portion is
     intended to provide a wide variety of avenues to stimulate performance and recognize
     individual or unit achievement. Specific actions taken by personnel to enhance safety or
     eliminate hazards shall be considered for recognition.
        5.4.2.3.1. Individual Awards. Individual awards should be based on the level of
        achievement and follow an awards progression as follows:
            5.4.2.3.1.1. Verbal Compliment from supervisor or commander
            5.4.2.3.1.2. Letter of Appreciation from supervisor or commander
            5.4.2.3.1.3. Letter of Commendation
            5.4.2.3.1.4. Wing Safety Coin Award Program per 62 AWI 91-202
            5.4.2.3.1.5. AMC Distinguished Individual Safety Award. Squadrons should
            submit nominations through channels to 62 AW/SE IAW AFI 36-2833, Safety
            Awards.
24                                           MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


        5.4.2.3.2. Unit Awards. The 62 AW and AMC Safety Awards programs provide
        numerous avenues to stimulate performance and recognize unit achievement.
        Possible unit awards are as follows:
            5.4.2.3.2.1. 62 AW Commander’s Outstanding Unit Safety Award: This award is
            established to annually recognize the 62 AW units, which most aggressively
            implement the mishap prevention program.
            5.4.2.3.2.2. Applicable USAF, AMC Unit awards as per AFI 36-2833 and AMCI
            36-2805, Safety Awards Program.
     5.4.2.4. Presentation of Awards/Displaying of Awards. Senior personnel should present
     awards in a timely manner, with maximum participation and publicity. Presentations
     should be coordinated with local Public Affairs office whenever possible. Unit awards
     should be displayed in a central location so that all may share in the achievement.
  5.4.3. Program Tools
     5.4.3.1. General. The following sections detail tools designed to ensure the effective
     functioning of the AMSP. These strive to facilitate reporting, dissemination, safety
     intervention as well as trending and analysis. More importantly, they empower users to
     address safety concerns and provide leadership with the ability to assess program
     effectiveness, analyse problem areas and identify specific targets for improvement. The
     tools encompass the STAT and its related activities.
     5.4.3.2. The Safety Trend Analysis Tool (STAT)
        5.4.3.2.1. General. The STAT is a database designed to collect safety event related
        information and preventative measures to enable meaningful trend and analysis data.
        This is intended to enable leadership to focus on trends and implement preventative
        measures. The STAT response actions do not replace established AF Safety
        investigations, but will locally augment existing processes. All actions such as data
        collection, interviews, etc which may be required under AFI 91-204, Safety
        Investigations and Reports, for specific events are to be conducted in close
        cooperation with the applicable lead safety investigation agency. As accurate and
        complete data on all incidents is required to ensure the effectiveness of trend analysis
        and preventative measures, all information related to these goals should be input into
        the STAT while complying with information distribution limitations as directed by
        the lead investigative agency, as applicable.
        5.4.3.2.2. All applicable STAT fields shall be completed as part of an event.
        5.4.3.2.3. STAT Policy Guidance: The most important consideration when initiating
        a STAT entry is the evaluation of the intent of the individual(s) involved in the event.
            5.4.3.2.3.1. When considering intent, it is important to understand that a
            maintenance error or an incident is the failure of a planned action to achieve a
            desired goal. All errors involve some form of deviation from the technician’s
            goal. Accidents and mishaps often happen because people lose focus, rush, or
            make poor risk decisions. Intent can be classified in three categories:
               5.4.3.2.3.1.1. Willful Intent: The person knew that their actions would cause
               a bad outcome.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 25


                   5.4.3.2.3.1.1.1. Recklessness: The person knew there was an extremely
                   high probability that their actions could cause a bad outcome.
                   5.4.3.2.3.1.1.2. Unintentional: The person did not know/realize there was a
                   high probability that their actions could cause a bad outcome.
         5.4.3.2.4. A STAT shall be completed for all QA events as well as for all aircraft
         related mishaps, whether damages or injuries occurred (i.e. this includes close calls),
         unless the event clearly resulted from willful intent, recklessness or enemy action.
             5.4.3.2.4.1. QA events determined to have safety implications according to
             criteria agreed upon between the AMSP Manager and the Lead QA Inspector.
             5.4.3.2.4.2. All aircraft related mishaps, whether damages or injuries occurred
             (i.e. this includes close calls), unless the event clearly resulted from willful intent,
             recklessness or enemy action.
             5.4.3.2.4.3. Upon request by any individual with a safety concern related to the
             goals of this program (see Safety Concern / Close Call - Anonymous Option
             section at the end of this chapter for further details).
         5.4.3.2.5. If a STAT entry is initiated, and during the course of data gathering, issues
         come to light that point to purpose and knowledge or recklessness or identify a
         member as violating UCMJ standards, the matter will be referred back to the
         appropriate Squadron Commander. As the STAT is not to be used as an investigative
         tool to support disciplinary actions, a separate information gathering process, not
         involving AMSP personnel or information is to take place.

        5.4.3.2.6.1. Once an event has occurred and a STAT is to be initiated based on
        the criteria discussed above, personnel involved in the event shall follow local
        reporting procedures to ensure that a STAT entry is completed expeditiously.
        5.4.3.2.6.2. If the situation includes a hazard or if there is another compelling
        reason for immediate and wide distribution of the situation, it shall be rectified
        immediately and a means of rapidly disseminating the information such as a QA
        Flash shall be completed as soon as possible and distributed as appropriate.
        Consideration shall be given to posting this information in relevant areas,
        releasing it at roll calls and passing it on to Wing Flight Safety and/or AMC as
        applicable.
        5.4.3.2.6.3. The data collected shall be analyzed daily by the MXG AMSP
        Manager and considered for urgent action as required.
     5.4.3.2.7. STAT Data Analysis & Presentation
        5.4.3.2.7.1. The MXG AMSP Manager shall analyze the data with the aim of
        identifying trends and key areas where action is required to treat the underlying
        causes of the events. The MXG AMSP Manager shall develop and present a
        series of reports drawn from the STAT with a focus on trends and problem areas.
        The reports shall be designed to provide meaningful information to leadership at
        regular intervals, such as part of the MSEP briefings, facilitating decision making
        to address problems. Particular attention shall be paid to preventative measures
        requiring leadership intervention, action or approval.
        5.4.3.2.7.2. The MXG AMSP Manager shall routinely review preventative
        measures and consider each for adequacy.
     5.4.3.2.8. Spreading the Word: Safety awareness requires effective dissemination of
     the information surrounding safety events as well as the preventative measures.
     Avenues including, MRM training, Commanders’ Calls, roll calls, briefings, shall be
     utilized to pass the information within MXG. Communication channels through the
     wing and AMC shall be used to disseminate relevant information.
     5.4.3.2.9. Feedback loop: The MXG AMSP Manager shall ensure that feedback on
     recommendations is passed to the individual(s) who proposed them in accordance
     with local procedures to impress the importance and value of participation in the
     program.
     5.4.3.2.10. Safety Concern / Close Call - Anonymous Option
        5.4.3.2.10.1. A Safety Concern is defined as an existing condition or deficiency
        having the potential to cause injury or damage. When individuals become aware
        of such a situation, they may contact the duty AMSP facilitator and complete a
        STAT entry with the option of remaining anonymous if they so chose. If the
        individual does not wish to contact a facilitator, a paper version of the STAT will
        be available allowing for submission to the Squadron AMSP POC or drop off in
        an amnesty box or other similar facility/process publicized by the squadron or
        flight.
        5.4.3.2.10.2. The same venue can be utilized to report data on un-witnessed close
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              27


             calls (i.e where the individual involved was the only one present). A Close Call is
             defined as a mishap with the potential for, but with no actual resultant damage or
             injury.
             5.4.3.2.10.3. In any case, all MXG personnel have the right to bring up a safety
             concern in the course of their duties without fear of reprisal, whether done directly
             through the chain of command or through an AMSP representative. Any concern
             identified to AMSP personnel shall be documented at the MXG AMSP Manager
             level along with action taken.

                                          Chapter 6

       ELECTRONIC WARFARE SYSTEMS PREPROGRAMMING PROCESS

6.1. Introduction. This chapter assigns responsibilities and procedures for control of
reprogramming Electronic Warfare Systems (EWS) of the aircraft assigned to the 62d Airlift
Wing (62 AW). OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/WTQM (DSN 382-2204/Commercial 253-
982-2204)
6.2. Responsibilities. Commanders and supervisors at all levels within the maintenance
complex are responsible for enforcing compliance with this chapter.
6.3. EWS Reprogramming Process.
   6.3.1. Upon receipt of reprogramming message (e.g., SERNE BYTE) and/or time
   compliance technical order (TCTO) from Headquarters Air Mobility Command, the base
   Electronic Combat Officer (ECO) will inform the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of
   the reprogramming requirement. The MOC will notify the 62d Aircraft Maintenance
   Squadron (AMXS) through Saber 3 and the Pro Super(s) who in turn will notify the ranking
   EWS technicians on shift. The EWS technicians will contact the ECO to obtain the
   following information: tail number(s) affected, security classification of reprogramming, and
   priority/time requirements.
   6.3.2. Once tail numbers and priority/time requirements are established, EWS technicians in
   close coordination with the Pro Super and flight line expediter, will set reprogramming
   priorities by tail number. The current and next-day flying schedule should determine initial
   reprogramming priorities if more than one aircraft is affected. Other considerations should
   include aircraft availability, current aircraft flare configuration(s) and location.
   6.3.3. Expediters should make every effort possible to ensure active aircraft forms are ready
   and available to EWS technicians for expedient reprogramming and system operational
   checks. In addition, other maintenance personnel should be used to the maximum extent
   possible to assist EWS technicians (e.g., applying external/APU power, aircraft tows, etc.) as
   most reprogramming tasks are time sensitive.
   6.3.4. EWS technicians will coordinate with the Pro Super if flare load configuration
   changes will occur or other maintenance is affected as a result of the reprogramming and an
   estimated time for completion..
   6.3.5. Once the reprogramming/TCTO is complete, EWS personnel will inform production
   personnel for coordination with Saber 3, the MOC and the ECO.
6.4. Other Related References. AFIs, AFOSH STD, AWIs, and TOs are listed in Attachment
1.

                            C-17A FLARE DEFENSIVE SYSTEM

7.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes specific requirements for the flare defensive system
on C-17A aircraft. These systems use Class 1.3 munitions, which require special handling and
coordination. These requirements apply to all agencies involved in handling flares or flare-
loaded aircraft. The following procedures must be followed to ensure flares are handled safely
and expeditiously. Procedures identified in this chapter apply to all individuals, including
aircrews, who are actively engaged in the operation, uploading, downloading, and
troubleshooting of the Defensive Systems (DS). With the addition of multiple flare load
configurations, this chapter will establish minimum load requirements for each configuration and
flare type. This chapter complements AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards and
provides local procedures for the requirements found in AFI 21-101. OPR for this chapter is 62
MXG/WTQM (DSN 382-2204/Commercial 253-982-2204)
7.2. General Precautions.

   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), 62d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS), 62d
   Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Production Superintendents (Mike 2), 62d Maintenance
   Group Quality Assurance (QA) and 62d Airlift Wing Safety Office in the event of any flare
   mishap.
   7.2.2. Withdraw all nonessential personnel and establish a 600-foot cordon around the
   aircraft/ flare set until ground emergency has been terminated by the Fire Department or
   EOD Team.
   7.2.3. Do not use Halon, carbon dioxide, or water (Type A, B, or C rated) fire extinguishers
   on or near fires involving munitions, pyrotechnics, or magnesium incendiaries (flares). Fire
   extinguishers should only be used for initial knockdown of fires on aircraft and equipment
   before the involvement of munitions, pyrotechnics, or magnesium incendiaries or to protect
   adjacent equipment and facilities.
   7.2.4. Under no circumstances will load crew personnel attempt to upload or download
   flares if not qualified to do so and either checklist TO 1C-17A-33-1-2-1CL-1, Non-nuclear
   Munitions Loading Procedures AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispense System (IRCM
   Aircraft)     or checklist TO 1C-17A-33-1-2-2CL-1, Non-nuclear Munitions Loading
   Procedures AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispense System (Non-IRCM Aircraft) is not
   available. Aircraft forms will be present during flare upload and download operations and
   properly documented to reflect any DS maintenance activities performed.
   7.2.5. To increase DS safety awareness, all aircraft should be treated as if loaded with flares.
   7.2.6. Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, and Joker ramps on McChord AFB are explosive
   sited for the 1,000 lbs of Hazard Class/Division (HC/D) 1.3 and Mission Essential Quantities
   of HC/D 1.4 explosives loaded as ―Cargo.‖ Cargo-loaded aircraft require placards with the
   appropriate HC/D fire symbols and subsidiary risk symbols. Aircraft configured with
   internally loaded explosive assets for example, Defensive Systems flares, do not require
   placards on McChord AFB.

      Oxygen Servicing Trailer Log (Liquid/Gaseous). Users will also ensure the LOX level in
      the cart doesn’t drop below 5 gallons during aircraft LOX servicing. If the LOX cart
      requires servicing, notify MOC or POL.
          8.3.1.9.1. If a user fails to annotate the AFTO Form 134 after use, POL drivers will
          attempt to remedy the situation by contacting the appropriate flight line expediter
          and/or Pro Super. Documentation of LOX cart usage is critical as POL will not
          service any cart without properly accounting for the LOX used.
      8.3.1.10. Ensure proper control and accountability of equipment by processing AGE
      deployment requests (e.g., MRTs) through Mike 2 or 62 MXS AGE Mobility
      Noncommissioned Officer (NCO). The AGE Mobility NCO or shift supervisor will
      provide documentation for the equipment. Documentation for deployment requests of
      LOX and GOX carts will be provided by the Electro-Environmental shop shift supervisor
      after coordination with Mike 2 or the 62 MXS AGE Mobility NCO.
      8.3.1.11. Ensure the speed control switch on the universal maintenance stand (UMS) is
      placed in the ―slow‖ position when operating within 25 feet of aircraft, equipment,
      buildings, and maintenance personnel. Utilize LCL 62 MXG-8, Flight Line Operation of
      the Split Deck Universal Maintenance Stand (UMS) for additional operating guidance.

                                           Chapter 9

                   AEROSPACE CORROSION CONTROL PROGRAM

9.1. Introduction. This chapter provides guidance to develop and manage a corrosion control
program (CCP) to safely and effectively extend the service life of assigned C-17A aircraft,
Support Equipment (SE), and Munitions Material Handling Equipment (MMHE) in an
environmentally conscientious manner. OPR for this chapter is 62 MXS/MXMFB (DSN 382-
1198/5332/Commercial 253-982-1198/5332)
9.2. General. All maintenance personnel are responsible for identifying potentially corroded
structures/components and documenting them in the appropriate forms. The Aircraft Structural
Maintenance (ASM) Section evaluates corrosion discrepancies to determine proper treatment or
repair. Aircraft paint touch-up requirements are based on the scoring process and overall paint
deterioration. To maintain healthy paint condition, aircraft are painted on a ―worst first‖ basis.
The 62d Maintenance Group Commander (62 MXG/CC) and/or 62d Airlift Wing (62 AW) CCP
Manager retain authority to alter the paint cycle.
9.3. Responsibilities.
   9.3.1. The 62 AW CCP Manager has overall responsibility for corrosion prevention and
   control program/capabilities of the flight line, contract maintenance, and support shops, and
   acts as a liaison/technical advisor for the 62 AW. Additionally, the CCP Manager is
   responsible for inspecting, documenting, tracking, and maintaining the corrosion prevention
   and protective coating condition of assigned aircraft. The CCP Manager will:
       9.3.1.1. Prioritize aircraft maintenance paint requirements and provide 62d Maintenance
       Operations Squadron (62 MOS), Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (PS&D) section
       with prioritized inputs monthly.
       9.3.1.2. Accomplish a paint score and corrosion control inspection for aircraft returning
       from depot programmed maintenance or command transfer prior to the aircraft’s first
       scheduled home-station departure.
       9.3.1.3. Provide assistance to and serve as point of contact for all external units to
       develop their own corrosion control programs for their assets.
       9.3.1.4. Ensure operations conducted within corrosion control facilities comply with
       established safety and occupational health practices and procedures.
       9.3.1.5. Establish and chair a local corrosion prevention working group to formalize the
       wing corrosion management program. Working groups will meet at least annually.
       9.3.1.6. Provide a current copy of the Qualified Products Listing (QPL) for mil-spec
       approved cleaners for assigned aircraft and equipment every six months to Aircraft
       Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) and Maintenance Squadron (MXS) maintenance
       supervision and flight chiefs, aircraft wash rack and support sections.
   9.3.2. The Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Flight has overall responsibility for
   inspecting, documenting, tracking, and refurbishing AGE.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              39


   9.3.3. PS&D provides the aircraft tail number at least one week in advance and will ensure
   the wash is scheduled prior to paint. PS&D will schedule aircraft based on Corrosion
   Control Facility (CCF) and aircraft availability at the discretion of the Wing CCP manager.
   The aircraft selected comes from a list of candidate aircraft on a ―worst first‖ basis provided
   by the Wing CCP Manager. Departures in scheduling from the list of candidate aircraft will
   be coordinated through the Wing CCP Program Manager. Aircraft scheduled within 180 days
   of programmed Depot scuff/repaint or strip/repaint are not painted regardless of condition.
9.4. Aircraft Scoring and Ranking Procedures.
   9.4.1. Paint scoring will be accomplished during each home station check (HSC), all
   transfers, and upon return from depot maintenance. All major external components will be
   installed to provide an accurate assessment of the overall paint condition.
      9.4.1.1. Digital photographs will be utilized to archive the scoring and stored/filed in the
      aircraft database located at L:\MXMF\Structural Maintenance\C-17 Aircraft Files. Each
      aircraft has a folder, named and dated with month/year of the most recent paint score.
      Once painting is complete, all previous paint photographs are deleted.
      9.4.1.2. Paint deteriorations and/or discolorations will be photographed in such a manner
      that the component can be easily identified. The aircraft is broken into scoring zones and
      each zone is photographed. Any additional areas with significant paint discrepancies are
      also photographed (Attachment 25).
   9.4.2. Aircraft are ranked/prioritized utilizing categories (CAT) I to V (I being best and V
   being worst), based on the severity of paint deterioration. Once categorized, the aircraft are
   identified on the paint schedule with the required paint time and minimum cure time
   estimates. NOTE: A 24 hour paint cure is established only when the CCF heating system is
   operating at a 75 degree Fahrenheit temperature, otherwise a 72 hour paint cure will be
   imposed IAW Technical Order (TO) 1-1-8, Application and Removal of Organic Coatings.
      9.4.2.1. CAT I ranking indicates a negligible condition not requiring maintenance.
      9.4.2.2. CAT II ranking indicates a correctable condition with SEMPEN paint pens,
      minor spraying, and/or brush touch-up, usually limited to slat leading edges or exposed
      composite materials. An estimated time in commission (ETIC) is set at 48 hours + 24-
      72-hour cure before flight depending on conditions.
      9.4.2.3. CAT III ranking indicates a condition that may include sectionalized painting of
      wing leading edges, nacelles, and flaps. An ETIC is set at 72 hours + 24-72-hour cure
      before flight depending on conditions.
      9.4.2.4. CAT IV ranking indicates a condition requiring complete repaint of major
      components involving most zones. An ETIC is set at 96 hours + 24-72-hour cure before
      flight depending on conditions.
      9.4.2.5. CAT V ranking indicates an aircraft requiring complete repaint of major
      components involving most zones and large areas of the fuselage. An ETIC is set at 120
      hours + 24-72-hour cure before flight depending on conditions.
   9.4.3. Aircraft ranked III, IV, or V are scheduled into the corrosion control facility for
   protective coating (paint) maintenance. This permits paint touch-up approximately at mid-
   point of the 5 and 10 year paint cycles.
 40                                           MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


9.5. Protective Coating Maintenance.
   9.5.1. Maintenance painting is defined as the application of coatings to aerospace equipment
   where the existing coating system is deteriorated or missing. Maintenance painting must be
   kept to a minimum and must comply with federal, state, and local environmental regulations.
   Maintenance painting of aircraft accomplished solely for cosmetic purposes is highly
   discouraged due to adverse environmental impact, coating thickness restrictions, and weight
   and balance issues.
   9.5.2. Aircraft are pre-positioned and configured for maintenance paint in the CCF, hangar
   6, no-later-than 1900 the evening of the scheduled paint day per LCL 62 MXG-5 Hangaring
   of All Assigned and Transient Aircraft (access panels installed, cowlings closed, battery
   disconnected, etc.). The aircraft configuration is determined by structural maintenance
   technicians and hangared in the CCF with sufficient time to dry aircraft after wash to allow
   the skin surface to warm to at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This time varies depending on air
   temperature and relative humidity.
      9.5.2.1. Maintenance painting is accomplished from seam-to-seam, and will be masked
      at the edges. Where a seam is not reasonably accessible, a ―simulated‖ seam may be
      created. No unmasked spray touch-up is authorized.
      9.5.2.2. Atomized spray, paint brushing, rolling, dual component aerosol, and SEMPEN
      paint pens are the only authorized methods for paint application. SEMPEN paint pens
      and paintbrush application methods are the preferred means of touching-up minor
      scratches and fastener heads. Single-component aerosol paint cans are not authorized and
      will not be used to touch-up any type of defect on aircraft or SE.
      9.5.2.3. Paint cure times are critical to the effectiveness of the final coating. After
      painting, allow aircraft to cure in a dust-free temperature controlled environment for a
      sufficient time prior to placing in service. Aircraft paint cure at 75 degrees F and 30-50%
      relative humidity will be 24 hours. In the absence of accelerated curing at 75 degrees F at
      30-50% relative humidity, the aircraft shall not be flown for at least 72 hours after
      painting. Aircraft freshly painted need to air dry and out-gas for a minimum of 12 hours
      before technicians can perform other types of maintenance or subject the aircraft to
      inclement weather.
9.6. AGE Corrosion Control Program (ACCP) and Munitions Corrosion Control Program
(MCCP).
   9.6.1. Fabrication, AGE, and Munitions Flights will determine the appropriate flow and
   manpower for the painting of SE and MMHE. Equipment will be painted on a ―worst first‖
   basis.
   9.6.2. SE and MMHE Categories and Quantities:
      9.6.2.1. CAT I indicates a condition that requires minimal touch-up or no work at all.
      9.6.2.2. CAT II indicates a condition requiring partial paint touch-up or scuff and repaint
      of SE and MMHE. Prior to paint application, the location or severity of corrosion
      determines the necessity for its removal from the unit. Unit downtime in this category
      should be minimized.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                            41


      9.6.2.3. CAT III indicates a condition that requires plastic media blasting (PMB) and full
      paint compliance is needed for SE and MMHE identified under this category. Complete
      tear down of the unit may be necessary when full paint is required. The size of unit and
      complexity of tear down will determine required downtime.
   9.6.3. Contracted AGE and MMHE painting will be monitored by respective flights.
   Contract specifications will be approved by the Wing Corrosion Control Program Manager.
      9.6.3.1. Periodic inspections will be performed throughout the process to ensure proper
      materials and coating application are used IAW TO 1-1-8.
      9.6.3.2. Paint quality/conformance and corrosion acceptance inspections will be
      performed on SE and MMHE by the CCP Manager when it is received back from
      contracted painting.
   9.6.4. Responsibilities.
      9.6.4.1. The ACCP and MCCP is designed to aide 62 MXS AGE Flight (MXMG) and
      Munitions Flight (MXMW) personnel to properly identify and update CAT priorities
      during equipment periodic inspections.
      9.6.4.2. MXMG will provide SE weekly to Fabrication Flight (MXMF) for paint. The
      point of contact (POC) within MXMF is ASM supervision. The ASM section will be
      given a copy of AGE scheduled for paint monthly. If additional equipment requires
      paint, MXMF will be contacted to fit the additional units into the established AGE paint
      schedule.
      9.6.4.3. MXMW will provide MMHE on an as needed basis to MXMF for paint. The
      POC within MXMF is ASM supervision. The ASM section will be given a copy of
      MMHE scheduled for paint monthly. If additional equipment requires paint, MXMF will
      be contacted to fit the additional units into the established weekly paint schedule.
      9.6.4.4. MXMF will procure, monitor and store the media/paint supplies to ensure
      sufficient quantities are available to successfully prepare and paint equipment in the
      ACCP/MCCP.
      9.6.4.5. MXMG and MXMW will have primary responsibility for the preparation of SE
      and MMHE for paint to include transportation, teardown, forms documentation, sanding,
      and blasting. ASM will assist with the PMB and sanding of equipment unless mission
      requirements dictate otherwise. MXMG and MXMW will stencil, apply reflective tape,
      provide mobility placards, and reassemble MMHE after painted. PMB equipment
      requires a respirator-qualified 2-man concept. Only ASM personnel will perform the
      paint process.
      9.6.4.6. MXMG and MXMW will conduct a 100 percent corrosion inspection on all
      SE/MMHE. Each piece will receive a corrosion category rating of I, II, or III and placed
      in the ACCP/MCCP. MXMG will re-inspect AGE during semi-annual inspections and
      make required rating changes. MXMW will inspect MMHE annually and make required
      rating changes.

      12.3.6.1. Under no circumstances will aircraft files be swapped between aircraft. Upon
      arrival at home station, the aircraft TO file will be removed and turned into 62 AMXS
      TODA.
   12.3.7. If a TO, job guide (JG), or work card (WC) is found to be missing either from a
   library or G file, a Lost Tool/Missing Item Report will be accomplished IAW Chapter 15 of
   this instruction, Tool Control Procedures and a copy of the report will be given to the
   TODO. No replacement will be ordered until a Lost Tool/Missing Item Report is filed. If
   the lost book is from an aircraft file, a Lost Tool/Missing Item Report will be immediately
   filled out, and a list of en-route stops made will be attached to the report so the TODA can
   contact those bases.
12.4. Local Checklists (LCL)/Local Work Cards (LWC)/Local Job Guides (LJG)/Local Page
Supplements (LPS).
   12.4.1. Use of local checklists/work cards/job guides and page supplements will be limited.
   Local procedures are for tasks that only apply to McChord AFB. If a procedure will affect
   McChord personnel off station, then the procedure will be submitted as a change to the TO.

   Inspection Work Card Cover. The tech data will include a purpose statement and a list of the
   technical orders/directives from which the procedures are extracted.
   12.4.5. The TODO will assign a LCL/LWC, LJG or LPS technical order number to the draft
   and review it for grammatical accuracy. The draft will then be returned to the OPR with any
   recommendations and/or any changes needed. The final draft will be resubmitted to the
   TODO for routing to potential users identified by the OPR and final editing. Checklist, job
   guides, and work cards will be printed on yellow card stock and page supplements will be
   printed on salmon card stock. Publications used by Night Vision Goggle wearers will be
   distinguished by a means other than colored pages.
   12.4.6. When the final draft is ready for formal publication, TODO will verify the proper
   format and forward the publication to the respective Group Commander for approval and

  FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHT/OPERATIONAL CHECK FLIGHT/HIGH SPEED
                             TAXI

13.1. Introduction. This chapter standardizes procedures for managing an effective Functional
Check Flight (FCF), Operational Check Flight (OCF), In-flight Operational Check (IOC) and
High-Speed Taxi Check (HSTC) program. It applies to all personnel involved in preparation and
performance of FCFs, OCF/IOCs and HSTCs on assigned or transient C-17A aircraft at
McChord Air Force Base. FCFs, OCF/IOCs and HSTCs are defined in AFI 21-101. OPR for
this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI (DSN 382-5361/Commercial 253-982-5361).
13.2. Responsibilities. The 62d Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) and 62d
Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) have joint responsibility for effective management of
the installation FCF program. The success of this program relies on cooperation between the
maintenance and operations communities. The MXG/QA Superintendent or Chief Inspector and
the OG/OGV FCF officer in charge (OIC) collaborate to ensure a viable program.
13.3. Procedures. These procedures will typically be accomplished after flight-altering
modifications, completion of maintenance specified in the applicable aircraft technical order TO
1C-17A-6, Inspection Requirements Manual, or when commanders deem a
functional/operational test flight, in-flight operational check, or high-speed taxi check is
appropriate. This instruction provides guidance to ensure the procedure is accomplished safely,
expediently, and by an appropriately qualified crew.
13.4. 62d Maintenance Group (MXG) Quality Assurance Inspection (QAI) Office
Responsibilities. MXG/QAI is the maintenance focal point for FCF, OCF, IOC, and HSTC
matters. The QAI section will:
   13.4.1. Help plan and monitor the FCF.
   13.4.2. Establish points of contact in QAI, OG/OGV, and the applicable squadron or AMU
   Maintenance Superintendent for coordination of each FCF.
   13.4.3. Notify Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation (MOS/MXOOS), Operations Group
   Deputy Director (OG/OSO) and OG/OGV of the FCF requirement providing a minimum 24-
   hour notice for scheduling and establishing crew alert times.
   13.4.4. Monitor the aircraft maintenance estimated time in commission (ETIC) schedule and
   schedule the date, time, and location for a ―prior-to-flight‖ aircrew briefing (pre-brief) no
   later than 3 hours prior to launch.
   13.4.5. Ensure a combined Preflight/Basic Post-flight or Preflight (whichever is applicable)
   quality verification inspection (QVI) is accomplished no later than 6 hours prior to the actual
   FCF flight. If the aircraft requires a subsequent FCF due to a non-release condition, a second
   QVI is not required.
   13.4.6. Host the pre-brief ensuring all requirements outlined in AFI 21-101 are met.
   (Attachment 35).
   13.4.7. Initiate the FCF worksheet (Attachment 36) and issue the FCF kit to the flight crew.
   The FCF worksheet is a detailed checklist used to record coordination requirements and aids

     AFTO Form 781A or appropriate equipment forms/maintenance work package.
     14.3.5.3. Ensure MOC has notified 62d Airlift Wing Safety Office (62 AW/SE). NOTE:
     The 62 AW/SE will determine whether a formal investigation needs to be accomplished
     under the provisions of AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. This does not
     preclude making the aircraft systems safe or downloading live ordnance. Do not alter,
     disrupt, tear down or test parts until cleared by the wing safety investigating officer.
     Work closely with the investigating officer to ensure timely repair of equipment while
     preserving valuable evidence.
     14.3.5.4. Brief the Impound Authority daily on progress.
     14.3.5.5. Verify the status of all parts removed and sent to repair shops for bench check.
     An AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag, bordered in red with the words
     ―IMPOUNDED OPR: (Impoundment Official name), (duty phone)‖ written on the
     bottom of the tag will be attached with each part removed from an impounded
     aircraft/equipment. Coordinate with the QA office and contact the repair shop prior to
     determine the disposition of any parts. All suspected parts should be submitted for
     deficiency reporting through the QA product improvement office.
     14.3.5.6. Use all sources necessary (Air Force Engineering and Technical Services,
     Boeing, etc.) and assemble the appropriate technicians. Only highly qualified technicians
     (typically 7-levels) will be appointed to work on impounded aircraft.
     14.3.5.7. Review aircraft records and analyze data to identify any history or contributing
     discrepancies.
     14.3.5.8. Control and limit access to impounded aircraft/equipment and historical records
     (jacket files).
     14.3.5.9. Ensure all recoverable data is collected prior to operating systems that may
     dump stored information such as Standard Flight Data Recorder (SFDR), Quick Access
     Recorder (QAR), and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). In cases where mishap
     investigation directs SFDR, QAR, and/or data removal, adhere to procedures contained in
     AFI 91-204. Do not release without Wing Safety approval in these situations.
     14.3.5.10. Comply with the requirements of the Impoundment/Quarantine Official
     checklist and record all significant findings/events on the Impoundment/Quarantine
     Official checklist (Attachment 38). Ensure the completed checklist is returned to QA
     immediately after the impoundment is cleared.
     14.3.5.11. Review the applicable maintenance forms for accuracy and adequacy of
     maintenance and corrective action. Sign off and initial the symbol block for the forms
     review.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                               57


       14.3.5.12. Generate an impoundment report citing all findings, discoveries or any other
       pertinent information for distribution to the Impoundment Authority and ensure QA has a
       copy.
14.4. Aircraft Quarantine.
   14.4.1. Aircraft will be quarantined when:
       14.4.1.1. Actual animals or pests or evidence of suspected animal or pest infestation is
       on aircraft or if identified by Department of Agriculture or base public health officials as
       having possible biological contaminants from soils or organic debris.
       14.4.1.2. Actual or suspected contaminated soil, organic debris or bio-hazard is on the
       aircraft.
   14.4.2. For quarantine conditions, contact the MOC to run the quarantine QRC. Limit
   access to the affected aircraft until 62 MDS Bioenvironmental Engineering/United States
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) personnel can clear the condition. NOTE: Performance
   of normal ground handling, servicing, and maintenance of the aircraft must be coordinated
   and approved through 62 MXG/CC (and/or designee), USDA officer, and public health as
   applicable. Use every precaution necessary to prevent soils and organic matter from
   migrating.
14.5. Transient Aircraft Impoundment. Aircraft in transit at McChord AFB will only be
impounded after contacting the aircraft commander and coordinating with the owning MXG/CC.
When impoundment is necessary, specific procedures will be followed as outlined in AFI 21-101
and this instruction. For AMC–controlled aircraft, notify Tanker Airlift Control Center,
Logistics Control (TACC/XOCL). The home station impoundment authority will appoint an
impoundment official from the home station, but may request one from a closer main operating
base.

                                           Chapter 15

                              TOOL CONTROL PROCEDURES

15.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes policies and procedures and assigns
responsibilities for controlling tools to all units and personnel assigned or attached to the 62/446
AW and contract aircraft maintenance agencies. OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI (382-
5361)
15.2. Responsibilities. Tool control is the responsibility of all personnel within the Wing.
Commanders and supervisors at all levels will ensure compliance with this instruction.
15.3. Policies. Squadrons will establish a tool control program in accordance with this
instruction and AFI 21-101. Squadrons will ensure the arrangement of all tools and equipment
items to facilitate a quick inventory. The ―show‖ (e.g., a shadow of the tool) and ―know‖
(knowledge of tool or kit location) concept, as specified in AFI 21-101 will be used. Units with
specific, published tool control guidance will follow it provided the intent of this instruction is
achieved for inventory, lost tool notification, and control and accountability. In addition, ―CTK‖
and ―tool control‖ custodians are synonymous with one another.
15.4. Security Procedures.
   15.4.1. Controlled areas are defined as hangars/shops that have the capability of being
   locked or flight line maintenance areas within the restricted area boundary.
       15.4.1.1. Dispatchable tools, equipment and CTKs will be locked and secured when left
       unattended in areas that are not controlled.
       15.4.1.2. For other tool security procedures, follow guidance in AFI21-101 and
       applicable MAJCOM supplements.
15.5. Control and Accountability Procedures.
   15.5.1. Each squadron will ensure a primary and alternate composite tool kit (CTK)
   custodian is designated for applicable sections and flights that use tools during everyday
   operations (i.e., 62d Civil Engineering Squadron’s Power Production Shop, 62d Logistics
   Readiness Squadron’s Vehicle Maintenance Flight, Aircrew Flight Equipment, and all
   aircraft maintenance organizations). These custodians will be responsible for the operation
   of the tool control program in their respective areas. Technical orders (TOs), checklists, job
   guides, aircraft G files and laptops used for electronic and digital TOs are part of the tool
   control program when taken to the job site and for all aircraft maintenance operations. When
   removed from the immediate file area, TOs and/or Enhanced Technical Information System
   (ETIMS) laptops will be checked out by one of the following methods: AF IMT 1297,
   Temporary Issue Hand Receipt, chits, Tool Accountability System (TAS) TC MAX or AF
   Form 614, Charge Out Record.
   15.5.2. A Master Inventory List (MIL) is required for each CTK, series of identical CTKs,
   dispatchable support equipment containing multiple parts, and dispatchable special tools
   assembled in a kit containing multiple parts (NOTE: When TAS is used, the master MIL
   resides in TAS but a hard copy of the MIL must reside on/with any dispatchable CTK,
   dispatchable kit or dispatchable support equipment containing multiple parts). Units are
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              59


   required to electronically back up their respective databases at least once a month. This
   backup must be kept separate from the computer that houses the tool control database.
      15.5.2.1. For those sections using manual tracking and not TAS, tools/equipment and
      tool kits will contain a MIL, McChord AFB IMT 140, CTK Inventory and Control Log;
      and a McChord AFB IMT 146, Missing/Removed Tool Log.
      15.5.2.2. All dispatchable equipment or special tools not physically located in a tool
      room due to their size or function will be on the master MIL.
      15.5.2.3. Non-aircraft maintenance work centers will use the AF IMT 1297, a chit
      control system, or locally developed method providing positive control of tools and tool
      kits removed from the work center, removed from an individual tool kit or shadow board
      beyond the required inventory interval.
      15.5.2.4. At no time will the same person sign out and sign in their own CTK(s) or
      equipment. In sections with minimal personnel or a single person on shift, utilize the
      squadron production superintendent or neighboring section supervisor to conduct turn-in
      inventories.
      15.5.2.5. Blue dye is not specified for use in the C-17 engine blade-blending process.
      15.5.2.6. Weapons load crew crimpers, die and lead seals are not utilized on the C-17 or
      by munitions personnel.
15.6. Inventory Procedures.
   15.6.1. Non-aircraft maintenance work centers with existing directives will follow their unit-
   published guidance and ensure the inventory intent of this instruction is completely met or
   exceeded.
   15.6.2. Maintenance work center supervisors will ensure that inventories are accomplished
   IAW AFI 21-101 and applicable MAJCOM supplements in addition to the following:
      15.6.2.1. Personnel issued tools or equipment will be responsible for all items issued
      until turn-in. Individuals will perform an inventory of all CTKs or equipment when
      issued for use, at the completion of a job or task and when leaving an aircraft or job site.
      Individuals, in conjunction with tool room personnel, will perform an inventory of all
      CTKs or equipment when returned to the tool room.
      15.6.2.2. As a minimum, CTK custodians will conduct a complete and comprehensive
      inventory of all tools, equipment and CTKs annually.
      15.6.2.3. When the CTK custodian changes, a complete and comprehensive inventory of
      all tools, equipment and CTKs will be accomplished (to include mobility kits). These
      inventories will be documented by date and name in TAS (if applicable) and/or on a
      separate memorandum for record filed in the CTK custodian’s program continuity book.
      15.6.2.4. Mobility kits will be inventoried annually. Units should consider a complete
      inventory prior to Aerospace Expeditionary Force deployments. Mobility kits will be
      sealed after they have been inspected. Sealing will be accomplished by a CTK custodian
      or Section/Flight chief. The seal will include date sealed, employee number, and
      signature and will be tracked by the CTK custodian. If a mobility kit seal is found broken
      at any time, a new inventory will be immediately accomplished and the kit resealed.
 60                                            MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


       15.6.2.5. Tool room personnel will inventory and account for all items at the beginning
       and end of each shift. All shift inventories will be documented on the McChord AFB
       IMT 140, CTK Inventory and Control Log or reconciled in TAS (whichever is
       applicable). Dispatchable tool kits and equipment must be accounted for but do not
       require an inventory during shift change if already inventoried on turn-in or not used
       during the shift.
15.7. Warranted Tool Management.
   15.7.1. The CTK custodian(s) controls warranty tools. Identify warranty tools and ensure
   broken or damaged warranty tools are isolated from other broken or damaged tools and under
   strict control until replaced or exchanged.
       15.7.1.1. Section TODAs are responsible for ensuring that E-tools with documented
       discrepancies are forwarded to the LOGNET contractor for repair within 5 duty days.
       15.7.1.2. Section TODA’s and CTK custodians are responsible for ensuring that E-Tools
       are inspected and cleaned IAW Attachment 54 and that batteries are charged IAW
       Attachment 55.
15.8. Procedures for Replacement, Expendable and Consumable Hand Tools, HAZMAT and
Other Items in CTKs.
   15.8.1. Tool replacement will be a one-for-one swap and is the responsibility of the CTK
   custodian. De-etching of broken tools and etching of new tools is also the responsibility of
   the CTK custodian but may be delegated to the work center supervisor.
       15.8.1.1. Limited quantities of spare/replacement tools are authorized to be retained
       within the work center’s tool control area. Each work center will maintain a current
       inventory of the type and quantity of non-etched spare/replacement tools. The CTK
       custodian will ensure strict control of spare/replacement tools.
   15.8.2. Expendable and consumable items (e.g., rubber gloves, lint cloth, cotton swabs, etc.)
   used to perform aircraft maintenance and not included in a CTK will be accountable. Units
   will establish a means for positive control of consumables by shift (e.g., AF IMT 1297, TAS,
   sign-out/sign-in log, etc.). Regardless of condition, these items will be returned to the tool
   room for FOD control purposes. Proper disposal will be accomplished by tool room
   personnel.
   15.8.3. At no time after issue will tools or equipment be passed from one individual to
   another without a documented hands-on inventory and approval from a work center SNCO or
   civilian equivalent. Special tools or equipment remaining in place for safety or task
   continuity will be chitted, hand-receipted or bar-coded out by the individual accepting
   responsibility and usually falls upon on-coming shift personnel.
15.9. Lost or Missing Tool/Item Procedures. Any item lost or discovered missing in the
aircraft maintenance complex, airfield operating area or on aircraft can cause foreign object
damage to the aircraft. It is imperative that all items lost or missing in these areas are
immediately reported. It is especially important to report personally issued equipment items
such as personal protective equipment (PPE), aircrew flying and non-flying gear and special duty
equipment such as aircrew checklists. Immediately upon discovering a missing item or tool, the
person identifying the missing or lost item or tool will search the immediate work area.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              61


  15.9.1. For Mission Support Group and Operations Group personnel: If the missing
  tool/item is not found after the initial search (within 30 minutes) and was lost in the aircraft
  maintenance complex or in the vicinity of the aircraft operating areas, the procedures are as
  follows:
     15.9.1.1. The individual who identifies the missing item will immediately notify their
     supervisor and tool control custodian or monitor.
     15.9.1.2. Initiate McChord AFB IMT 43, Lost Tool/Object Report, and immediately
     notify the MOC to obtain a control number. Personnel will provide as much pertinent
     information regarding the type of tool or equipment and where lost. NOTE: Units with
     specific, published lost tool reporting forms will utilize them provided the full lost tool
     reporting intent of this instruction is met.
     15.9.1.3. After a thorough search is completed and the tool or item is found, the
     McChord AFB IMT 43 will be closed out by the appropriate supervision level and a copy
     will be immediately forwarded or faxed to on-station MXG/QA flight (if applicable) and
     home station QA.
     15.9.1.4. If the item is not found, the McChord AFB IMT 43 will not be closed out. The
     CTK custodian will maintain the original on file and forward a copy to on-station
     MXG/QA flight (if applicable) and home station QA. These forms will remain active
     until the item is found. When the item is found, the original form will be completed and
     closed, and a copy will be forwarded to the applicable QA office for filing and
     accountability. If, after one year the tool is still not found, the report will be closed.
     NOTE: The CTK custodian will maintain all closed reports for found items on file for a
     period of 1 year after the close-out date.
  15.9.2. For Maintenance Group and Aircrew Flight Equipment personnel, the procedures are
  as follows:
     15.9.2.1. The person identifying the missing or lost item or tool will notify the shop
     chief, expediter, production superintendent or line chief. If the item is not found after
     completing the initial search (within 30 minutes), initiate a McChord AFB IMT 43 and
     notify the MOC for a control number.
     15.9.2.2. When making entries into support equipment or aircraft forms, include a
     description of the lost item, the ID number marked on the item and the vicinity or last
     known location where the item was seen or used. NOTE: Impoundment authorities will
     determine if impoundment is required on a case-by-case basis.
     15.9.2.3. If the item is found, the appropriate (AMXS/MXS) Production Superintendent
     or Shop Chief supervising the search will annotate the aircraft or equipment forms with
     the corrective action, clear the Red X, close out McChord AFB IMT 43 and forward a
     completed copy to MXG/QA.
     15.9.2.4. If the item is not found, the appropriate squadron Operations Officer
     (OO)/Maintenance Superintendent will sign off the Red X and enter in the corrective
     action: ―Extensive search conducted and item not found. Aircraft released for flight
     IAW 62 MAFBI 21-43, Para 10.9.2.4.‖ In addition, the OO/Mx Supt also signs and dates
 62                                             MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


      the McChord AFB IMT 43 signifying the search has been terminated. Once complete,
      the work center supervisor will notify the MOC and MXG/QA.
          15.9.2.4.1. The CTK custodian will maintain the original McChord AFB IMT 43 on
          file and forward a copy to MXG/QA. These forms will remain active until the item is
          found. When the item is found, the original form will be completed/closed and
          forwarded to MXG/QA for filing. NOTE: All closed or active reports will remain on
          file for a period of 1 year after the OO/Mx Supt have signed and dated the McChord
          AFB IMT 43.
      15.9.2.5. If an aircraft is taxiing or in flight and an individual who was performing
      maintenance on the aircraft discovers an item is lost or missing, accomplish the
      following:
          15.9.2.5.1. Immediately notify the MOC by the quickest means possible, providing a
          description of the lost item, the vicinity (if known) of the missing item and the aircraft
          systems potentially affected.
          15.9.2.5.2. The MOC will coordinate with the MXG/CC or designated representative
          and AMXS/MXS supervision to make a determination as to whether the aircraft
          needs to return to the point of origin. The MOC will relay this information to the
          Command Post Duty Officer.
   15.9.3. Upon notification of a lost/missing tool/item, MOC will:
      15.9.3.1. Log the information for the lost/missing item in the Lost/Missing Tool/Item
      Log.
      15.9.3.2. Assign a control number for the lost tool report and pass it to the CTK
      custodian and QA. Control numbers will consist of 62AW09(Year), 08(Month)and
      01(two-digit number). EXAMPLE: 62AW090801.
      15.9.3.3. Notify MXG/QA of the lost/missing item.
15.10. Assignment of Equipment Identification Designators (EID) for CTKs, non-CA/CRL
Equipment and CTK Numbers for Tools.
   15.10.1. Non-aircraft maintenance work centers will mark all tools and equipment with the
   squadron designator, flight, and element, and if used, a dispatchable tool kit number. Units
   with specific, published tool control guidance will follow it provided the intent of this
   instruction for tool marking is fully met.
   15.10.2. Numbers will be applied on all kits and toolboxes in easy-to-read letters and
   numbers that are visible when boxes are closed or locked. Toolboxes used or transported
   anywhere on the flight line will have reflective tape installed in such a way that it is visible
   from all four sides.
   15.10.3. Mobility toolboxes. Units with mobility boxes will follow the same identification
   procedures as outlined in this instruction and have the weight and cubic inches applied on
   each end of the box IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.
   15.10.4. Units assigned or attached to the Maintenance Group and Aircrew Flight Equipment
   will use the Worldwide Identifier (WWID) prefix and additional digits to create a 9-digit
   identification number for each tool room, dispatch able kit and special equipment. These 9-
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                               63


   digit numbers constitute the EID; a critical element designed to allow tools and equipment to
   be easily identified both at home station and abroad. NOTE: The MXG/QA office assigns
   WWID numbers to all units within the maintenance complex and to Aircrew Flight
   Equipment (see Attachment 39).
   15.10.5. All tools too small to mark will be identified on the MIL by an asterisk (e.g., Allen
   wrenches, apex bits, etc.).
   15.10.6. On tools where marking the kit numbering is impractical due to their size or
   hardness (for example, apex bits, drill bits, and Allen wrenches), the tools will be placed in a
   container and the container will be marked with its EID. The container will normally count
   as one item. However, if the container has a lid or cover that can be removed and separated,
   it must be marked and counted as two items. Tool sets are identified on the MIL by total
   number of items in the set (e.g., Allen Wrench Set - 9 each allen wrenches + container & lid).
   15.10.7. If chits/dog tags/identification tags or similar tags, dust caps or streamers are
   attached to tools or equipment, they will be secured in a manner that will preclude any
   possibility of FOD. Locks, keys and tie down straps, if not permanently attached, will be
   marked or etched with the appropriate CTK number. All items are listed on the MIL.
   15.10.8. All shadow boards will have tool locations silhouetted and marked with the WWID
   (see Attachment 39).
   15.10.9. For all other tool identification and marking, consult AFI 21-101 and applicable
   MAJCOM supplements.
15.11. Procedures for Issue and Control of PPE. Aircrew personal protective equipment will
be marked and controlled IAW technical orders, AFI 21-101 (and applicable MAJCOM
supplements) and local instructions. Units will determine applicable accountability and turn-in
requirements. PPE issued from a tool room or CTK will be issued and controlled as any other
dispatchable item or tool. All items will be accounted for prior to entry into and departure from
an aircraft.
15.12. Rag Control Procedures.
   15.12.1. In aircraft maintenance work centers, shop towels and rags are not disposable or
   consumable and will be controlled as tools and replaced on a one-for-one basis. Other work
   centers working anywhere within the boundary of the airfield will utilize a locally developed
   means of positive rag control that focuses on accountability.
   15.12.2. Shop towels and rags will be issued in a container or be attached to a locking device
   going through the rags. Either the container or locking device will indicate the number of
   rags.
15.13. Procedures to Procure Tools. CTK custodians and specifically designated government
purchase cardholders are the only personnel authorized to procure tools.
15.14. Locally Manufactured Tools/Equipment.
   15.14.1. Requests for locally manufactured aircraft maintenance tools not already specified
   in technical data will be coordinated through the MXG/QA office. The MXG/CC and/or
   their designated representative have approval authority. Process local manufacture requests
   IAW Chapter 16 of this instruction.
 64                                            MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


15.15. Depot Team, Factory Representatives and CFT Procedures.
   15.15.1. When a depot team, factory representative, or contract field team works on aircraft
   or equipment, they will comply with applicable Air Force procedures for tool control and
   accountability or a signed Statement of Work procedure. If visiting maintenance personnel
   have no provisions for tool control and accountability, the visiting team chief will coordinate
   with MXG/QA to develop a program. The guidance developed will be documented by letter,
   signed by the MXG/QA OIC or Superintendent and the team chief and maintained for the
   duration of the stay.
15.16. Multiple Work Centers and/or Multiple Support Sections.
   15.16.1. Work centers are limited to a single tool room where tools and tool kits will be
   issued and controlled from a single location in a work center. Non-aircraft maintenance
   work centers without a specific dedicated tool room space will utilize available space as
   required with tool storage and organization designed to facilitate control and accountability
   centralized within existing facility space.
15.17. Decentralized Locations.
   15.17.1. Units may wish to store oversized CTKs or equipment outside of a designated tool
   room when size makes it impractical to store within. In these situations, all other
   requirements (e.g., control, use, accountability, etc.) are identical. The CTK custodian must
   ensure all program requirements meet the intent of AFI21-101 (and applicable MAJCOM
   supplements) and this instruction.
15.18. CDDAR and Hydrazine Response Equipment.
   15.18.1. CDDAR trailers are controlled by HSC CTK as any other dispatchable tool kit.
   Tool kits required for crash response are daily use CTKs controlled through the tool room.
   In addition, no hydrazine response capability exists at McChord.
15.19. Controlling Access to Tool Rooms.
   15.19.1. Tool rooms will be locked at all times when not occupied by tool room personnel.
   Units will establish procedures for situations where access is required when a tool room
   employee is absent. Typically, Pro Supers or SNCOs should have control or access in these
   situations. See the control and accountability section above for more guidance.
15.20. Miscellaneous Tool Procedures.
   15.20.1. Personal tools (e.g., flashlights, Leatherman, buck knives, etc.) not controlled
   through this instruction or AFI21-101:
      15.20.1.1. Will not be issued to aircraft maintenance personnel and are not authorized for
      use on the flight line or in any aircraft maintenance area.
      15.20.1.2. Can be issued to personnel for the performance of their assigned duties (e.g.,
      communication squadron cable maintenance, security forces, aerial port transporters,
      etc.). These tools must be marked with the individual’s last name, squadron and last four
      digits of their social security number. Issued tools with surfaces too small for complete
      markings will be identified with a locally devised code associating unit and individual.
      Members and shift supervisors are responsible and accountable for ensuring these items
      are secure at all times, particularly when in the boundary of the airfield. Aircrew tools
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              65


       worn and continuously controlled in-flight require specific marking as required by AFI
       21-101 and unit instructions. All items will be accounted for prior to entry into and
       departure from an aircraft. If at any time an item is thought to be missing, immediately
       notify the Command Post.
   15.20.2. Any equipment or tools utilizing an AFTO Forms 244/245, Industrial/Support
   Equipment Record, will have the Supervisory Review (section IV) complied with after every
   180 days or when new or replacement forms are generated.
   15.20.3. Equipment forms may be maintained in a separate location when frequent
   equipment usage and/or size makes it impractical for the forms to accompany the equipment.
   AFTO Forms 244/245 not attached to such equipment will be stored in a central file located
   within CTKs.
   15.20.4. All padlocks will be attached or affixed by a cable or chain.
15.21. Inspections and Serviceability.
   15.21.1. Inspections will consist of inspecting all tools and kits for serviceability according
   to TO 32-1-101, Use and Care of Hand Tools and Measuring Tool. In addition, inspect each
   tool to ensure its etchings match the tool control number (EID) or owning unit number or
   acronym (non-aircraft maintenance units).
   15.21.2. Inspect tool kits and all dispatchable equipment in aircraft maintenance work
   centers every 90-days for the following:
       15.21.2.1. Correct etching. Particular attention will be given to ensure etching is clear,
       easily identifiable and not double etched.
       15.21.2.2. Missing or unserviceable tools. Unserviceable tools are defined as tools that
       cannot be safely and properly used for their intended purpose. For example, a flat-head
       screwdriver with a tip half-broken would be considered unserviceable.
       15.21.2.3. Obvious major corrosion. Tools that have so much corrosion that affects the
       serviceability of the tool or require a wire brush to remove would be considered major
       corrosion. Corrosion that can be wiped away with a rag is minor corrosion.
       15.21.2.4. Overdue inspections (e.g., PMEL or shelf life).
       15.21.2.5. Tool cutouts or shadowing no longer in-use and not documented.
       15.21.2.6. Locks that are broken or provide no security.
       15.21.2.7. Verify MIL contents match the inventory and are documented properly.
       15.21.2.8. Grease guns, oil cans or other products not marked appropriately.
       15.21.2.9. Verify all required forms are inside the CTK (if applicable) and documented
       correctly.
       15.21.2.10. Foreign objects particularly under pallets/tool cutouts, in FOD pouches and
       under tools.
 66                                            MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


15.22. Chit Usage (non-Aircraft Maintenance Units Only).
   15.22.1. Color-coded chits or placards, when this option is utilized, will be used to account
   for removed or missing tools (lost, damaged, backordered, etc.) from the designated tool
   room location in the following manner:
      15.22.1.1. Red Chit/placard – Missing, Broken, and Removed. Missing tools requires
      submission of McChord AFB IMT 43 (or equivalent), Lost Tool/Items Investigation
      Record.
      15.22.1.2. Yellow Chit/placard – Deployed.
      15.22.1.3. White Chit/placard – Signed out on an AF IMT 1297.
      15.22.1.4. Green Chit/placard – Calibration (PMEL).
   15.22.2. Color-Coded Chit/Placard Control Log will be used to record and account for color-
   coded chit/placard and to maintain status of tools on backorder.
   15.22.3. Chits will not leave the tool room or the composite tool kit.
   15.22.4. Use McChord AFB IMT 146 (or equivalent) to record removed, broken, or lost
   tools for dispatchable tool kits and equipment. At no time will chits be maintained, stored or
   used with a dispatchable tool kit or dispatchable equipment.
   15.22.5. If the chit or placard system is used in lieu of the bar code system, permanent
   identification control numbers will be marked onto each chit or placard. Plastic or metal
   embossing tape will not be used. Chit or placard identification numbers will be prefixed (see
   Attachment 41). Perform and document an inventory of all chits or placards at the beginning
   and end of each work shift.
   15.22.6. A set of chits will be maintained for each section’s tool room or composite tool kit.
   These chits will be stored on a shadow board either in the tool room or as part of the
   composite tool kit.
      15.22.6.1. Chits are assigned on an individual basis by the supporting tool room. Use
      these chits to check out tools and equipment.
      15.22.6.2. In the absence of a bar code system, chits or placards are the preferred method
      of the "show and know" concept. An AF IMT 1297 may be used in place of chits for
      checkout of dispatchable tool kits, special tools or equipment when chits are not
      available. Chits will be used on shadow boards.
      15.22.6.3. Work centers using chits will use an AF IMT 1297 or an additional set of chits
      when an individual requires additional tools or special equipment and has exhausted their
      assigned chits for a task. These chits will be signed out to the individual needing the
      equipment or special tools.
      15.22.6.4. The CTK custodian will control spare and blank chits and placards to prevent
      unauthorized use. A current roster of all work center chit numbers reflecting appropriate
      assignments to individuals will be maintained by the work center.
15.23. Other Related References. AFIs, AFOSH STDs, AWIs, and TOs are listed in
Attachment 1.

                                          Chapter 16

                                  LOCAL MANUFACTURE

16.1. Introduction. This chapter implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and
Space Maintenance, outlining and directing procedures and responsibilities to local manufacture
(LM) mission-essential/nonessential aircraft parts, tools, equipment, or base support items at
McChord AFB. Duties and responsibilities are assigned in accordance with Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. This instruction
provides the directions required for the LM program to fulfill mission-essential requirements for
non-procurable items. Items suitable for LM include: components with a source, maintenance,
and recoverability (SMR) code in the technical order (TO) as requiring LM; items specified in
locally manufactured munitions equipment (LMME) publications and locally designed tools and
equipment not feasible for custom or commercial manufacture. LM is not intended to replace
existing supply or contracting channels. LM is an essential part of unit maintenance support. This
instruction provides the measures and controls needed to effectively accomplish the LM
program. OPR for this chapter is 62 MXS/MXMF (DSN 382-3332, Commercial 253-982-3332)
16.2. Responsibilities.
   16.2.1. 62d Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) will:
       16.2.1.1. Ensure LM procedures are established including annual review of items
       affecting aircraft generation mission velocity worldwide, and, where possible pre-make
       LM items to help prevent or reduce launch delays. Ensure aircraft maintainers and
       maintenance supervision are involved with the annual LM procedures review.
       16.2.1.2. Designate 62d Maintenance Squadron/62d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
       (MXS/AMXS) Operations Officers (OO), Maintenance Superintendents, Maintenance
       Directors, or Production Superintendents as LM approval authority. This paragraph
       serves as the delegation of the LM approval authority.
       16.2.1.3. Ensure LM of procurable aircraft parts (SMR coded PA***) is restricted to
       aircraft mission capable (MICAP) requirements. In special circumstances, authorization
       may be given to LM MICAP aircraft parts (e.g.: excessive lead time or unacceptable
       supply status). Review paragraph 16.3.7 for MICAP LM procedures.
       16.2.1.4. Designate OO, Maintenance Superintendent, or Maintenance Director as LM
       approval authority to fabricate and modify special tools and equipment not specified by
       technical orders, but carry a load, change torque, or present potential damage to
       government resources. These requests are approved or disapproved after coordinating
       with 62 MXG Quality Assurance (QA) to justify the requester’s needs and intended use.
       This paragraph serves as the delegation of the LM approval authority to fabricate and
       modify special tools and equipment not specified by technical orders, but carry a load,
       change torque, or present potential damage to government resources.
       16.2.1.5. Designate the MXS manufacturing elements NCOIC or designee as LM
       approval authority to fabricate or modify tools and equipment authorized or specified by
       TO.
 68                                           MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


      16.2.1.6. Designate 62 MXS Aircraft Structural Maintenance, Metals Technology, and
      62 OSS Aircrew Flight Equipment Section Chiefs as LM approval authority to fabricate
      specialty tools and items required to facilitate their section’s aircraft and equipment
      maintenance provided these tools do not , carry a load, change torque, remain installed on
      aircraft permanently, or present potential damage to government resources. These
      sections routinely accomplish maintenance requiring use of custom-made templates,
      forming/holding fixtures, hardware extraction/installation tools, and alignment devices.
      Manufacture of specialty items is covered in technical school training, career
      development course books, general shop methods and procedures, and general technical
      orders. This paragraph serves as the delegation of the LM approval authority to fabricate
      specialty tools and items required to facilitate these section’s aircraft and equipment
      maintenance.
   16.2.2. MXS OO, Maintenance Superintendent, Maintenance Director will:
      16.2.2.1. Ensure sufficient LM capability exists to meet mission requirements. Ensure
      correct procedures are followed, validate requests, and prevent abuses of the LM process.
      16.2.2.2. Approve or disapprove LM requests to fabricate and modify tools and or
      equipment not specified by technical orders but carry a load, change torque, or present
      potential damage to government resources. These requests are approved or disapproved
      after coordinating with QA to validate the requester’s needs and intended use.
      16.2.2.3. 62 AMXS or MXS OO, Maintenance Superintendents, or Maintenance
      Directors will:
          16.2.2.3.1. Approve or disapprove LM requests for aircraft parts specified in a TO
          not having LM SMR codes specified in TO 00-25-195, Air Force Technical Order
          System Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability Coding of Air Force Weapons,
          Systems, and Equipment. In special circumstances, authorization may be given to LM
          MICAP aircraft parts that are SMR coded as procurable (e.g.: excessive lead time or
          unacceptable supply status).
          16.2.2.3.2. Ensure disapproved LM requests include specific justification why the
          LM cannot or should not be performed.
16.3. Procedures:
   16.3.1. LM requests are normally restricted to mission-essential aircraft parts, related
   support systems, and depot-directed, field-level manufacture items. The SMR code defines
   manufacturing responsibility. The first two digits determine whether a part is manufactured
   or procurable and by what organization. 62 MXS normally manufactures SMR codes
   ―MFO‖, ―MFF‖ and ―AFO‖. Items SMR coded ―XB‖ are not typically procured through
   normal supply channels and will be reviewed for local manufacture on a case by case basis.
   The responsible local manufacture shop will have approval/disapproval authority based upon
   material availability and manufacturing capability.
      16.3.1.1. SMR codes are listed in 1C-17A-4 series illustrated parts breakdown (IPB)
      TOs. Translations of SMR codes are contained in TO 00-25-195. Aircraft LM requests
      with a valid LM SMR code require creating a job control number (JCN) in the G081
      Management Information System and processing through the 62 LRS SharePoint site. No
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                            69


     further approval is necessary, but LM A0A paperwork must be processed through the
     Aircraft Parts Store (LRS/APS), to recoup material cost expenditures.
     16.3.1.2. The primary LM fabrication sections are the 62d Maintenance Squadron (62
     MXS) Aircraft Structural Maintenance, Metals Technology, Electro-Environmental,
     Pneudraulics Sections and the 62 OSS Aircrew Flight Equipment Section.
     16.3.1.3. Requestor should first contact the appropriate repair shop to verify that the
     damaged component must be replaced via local manufacture. In many cases, on-aircraft
     repairs will eliminate the need to locally manufacture a component that is SMR coded for
     local manufacture. If local manufacture must be accomplished, proceed as follows:
  16.3.2. Routine requests to LM Aircraft Parts.
     16.3.2.1. Requester will:
         16.3.2.1.1. First verify the component can be repaired rather than replaced via local
         manufacture. Many components SMR coded as MFO, MFF or AFO can be repaired
         by Aircraft Structural Maintenance (ASM). Coordinate efforts with ASM personnel
         (Radio Call Sign Mike 16) to determine reparability prior to initiating local
         manufacture request.
         16.3.2.1.2. If a component must be locally manufactured, request the item through
         the LRS SharePoint site. Go to: https://62msg.mcchord.af.mil/62LRS/LGRM/ and
         select ―Local Manufacture Order Form‖. Initiate the request by selecting ―New
         Item.‖
         16.3.2.1.3. Completing the local manufacture order form:              NOTE:       The
         manufacturing shop requires a current blueprint attached to the request to produce the
         part. Contact Boeing engineering to obtain an electronic (PDF) version of the
         blueprint. Ensure that the notes list (NL) and parts list (PL) are included. Once
         received, save the blueprint to a location where it may be retrieved.
             16.3.2.1.3.1. Annotate all items on the form identified with an asterisk * and the
             start date/time. All questions are self explanatory. NOTE: Under ―status of
             request‖ the initiator will select ONLY ONE of the following options:
             16.3.2.1.3.2. Click on ―Attach file‖ at the top of the form. Browse to the saved
             blueprint and attach it to the request.
             16.3.2.1.3.3. Click on ―Save and close‖ – The request has been submitted.
         16.3.2.1.4. For MICAP aircraft parts, if the item does not have a valid LM SMR code
         in the TO, and/or lead time is long, obtain LM approval from MXG/CC or designated

                           C-17A CRITICAL TIRE INSPECTION

17.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes procedures and responsibilities for tire condition
limitations on C-17A aircraft airlift missions. OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QA (DSN 382-
5361/Commercial 253-982-6351)
17.2. Critical Tire Inspections.
   17.2.1. A critical tire inspection (CTI) is a special inspection on C-17A tires with additional
   tire wear and/or cuts limits that are more stringent than the applicable technical order
   inspection requirements. These inspections are conducted on aircraft transiting locations or
   performing a specific mission where tire reliability is of the utmost importance to ensure
   mission accomplishment. CTIs are required for:
       17.2.1.1. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) missions (REF: AFI11-299).
       17.2.1.2. Phoenix Banner/Silver (Presidential support) missions.
       17.2.1.3. Aircraft transiting the following areas or performing the following missions:
       Africa, South America, Pacific Coral Reef, Australia, Former Soviet Union and
       INF/START.
   17.2.2. Limited critical tire inspections (LCTI) will be directed by the Maintenance Group
   Commander or designated representative . LCTIs are less stringent than the CTI
   requirement, but maintain the emphasis on prolonging tire reliability at airfields with limited
   or no tire change capability. The limits in paragraph 17.5. are designed to increase the
   reliability as mission requirements may dictate at locations or situations not addressed in the
   paragraphs above. The Maintenance Group Commander or designated representative should
   base the decision to perform LCTIs on airfield conditions and operational factors.
17.3. CTI and LCTI Procedures.
   17.3.1. Production superintendents will ensure CTIs and LCTIs are performed on identified
   aircraft. Tires will be inspected and the results documented in accordance with this
   instruction and the references listed in Attachment 1. Any tire not meeting minimum
   inspection requirements will be documented in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
   Discrepancy and Work Document.
   17.3.2. CTIs will be accomplished on both primary and backup aircraft (if applicable) and
   tire replacements will be accomplished on both aircraft in accordance with production
   priorities. Any decision not to change affected tires on identified aircraft will be made by the
   MXG/CC or designated representative.
   17.3.3. Aircraft movement. If an aircraft is towed after a CTI is accomplished, another CTI
   will be performed and documented in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781A.
17.4. Critical Tire Inspection Limits.
   17.4.1. Phoenix Banner/Silver mission tire inspection limits:
       17.4.1.1. Cuts: Tires with cuts that exceed one-half the embossed cut limit or cuts of
       more than ½ inch in length will be replaced. If a sidewall cut extends into the cord body,
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              75


       the tire will be replaced as prescribed in TO 4T-1-3, Inspection, Maintenance
       Instructions, Storage, and Disposition of Aircraft Tires and Inner Tubes.
       17.4.1.2. Wear: Tires with a measurement of less than 3/32-inch depth over the full
       length of any 12-inch span of a tire tread will be replaced.
       17.4.1.3. For PNAF CTI requirements , refer to AFI11-299 for CTI limits.
   17.4.2. Critical tire inspection limits for missions and locations identified in paragraph
   17.2.1.3.
       17.4.2.1. Cuts: Tire cuts with a depth of 1/32-inch or less than the embossed tire cut
       limit, will be replaced (Example: 8/32-inch cut on a tire with a 9/32-inch embossed cut
       limit needs to be replaced). If a cut extends into the cord body of the sidewall, the tire
       will be replaced as prescribed in TO 4T-1-3.
       17.4.2.2. Wear: Tires with a measurement of less than 3/32-in depth over the full length
       of any 12-inch span of a tire tread will be replaced in accordance with the aircraft
       generation schedule.
17.5. Limited Critical Tire Inspection Limits.
   17.5.1. Cuts: Use the same cut limit described in paragraph 17.4.2.1.
   17.5.2. Wear: Tires with a measurement of less than 2/32-inch length depth over the full
   length of any 12-inch span of a tire tread will be replaced in accordance with the aircraft
   generation schedule.
17.6. Documentation. The AFTO Form 781A will have a red dash symbol and the following
entry in the discrepancy block: ―Critical Tire Inspection (CTI)/Limited Critical Tire Inspection
(LCTI) due.‖ When the inspection is completed, the discrepancy will be signed off with the
following entry placed in the corrective action block for aircraft tires that pass the inspection:
―CTI/LCTI complied with—all tires within CTI/LCTI limits.‖ For tires that fail the CTI, the
following entry will be entered in the corrective action block: ―CTI/LCTI complied with.
(specific number) tires failed.‖ Tires changed as a result of a CTI/LCTI will be referenced to the
original CTI discrepancy.
   17.6.1. On occasion, units may want to inspect several aircraft to select the best candidate
   for the mission. In this circumstance, an ―Info Note‖ is sufficient documentation (e.g., INFO
   NOTE: CTI performed IAW MAFBI21-43, Para 17.4.2.1. Tires 3, 5 and nose tires bad).
   However, once a tail selection has been made on an aircraft with a failed CTI/LCTI, follow
   the documentation process in paragraph 17.6.

chapter is 62 MOS/MXOO (DSN 382-3010/253-982-3010)
19.2. Procedures:
   19.2.1. The 62d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Production Superintendent (Pro
   Super) determines when to CANN a part or series of parts for partially mission capable
   and/or non-mission capable C-17A aircraft.
       19.2.1.1. All CANN actions will be coordinated with the 62 AMXS/MXA or Line Chief
       (SABER 3) for potential impact to overall C-17A fleet readiness.
       19.2.1.2. All CANN actions involving home station check (HSC) aircraft will be
       coordinated with the 62d Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Pro Super (MIKE 2).
       19.2.1.3. Spare   engine   CANN    requires    coordination   through   Boeing   Engine
       Management.

20.2. Policy.
   20.2.1. McChord Air Force Base will return to operational status as soon as practical after a
   mishap. The 62d Airlift Wing Commander or designated representative, as stated in
   AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations, will determine the degree of emergency
   and make the decision regarding the speed with which the runway is cleared.
   20.2.2. The CDDAR is established to recover damaged or disabled aircraft in minimum time
   and consistent with the following considerations:
       20.2.2.1. The requirement to reopen the runway for operational use.
       20.2.2.2. Preservation of evidence for accident investigation.
       20.2.2.3. Safety of personnel involved with recovery operations.
       20.2.2.4. In accordance with (IAW) AFI 91-204, when an aircraft is under investigation
       by the Interim Safety Investigation Board, recovery operations will not proceed until the
       board president releases the aircraft. Personnel who are not engaged in the investigation
       will remain outside of the recovery area. The crash recovery team may be called upon to
       perform tasks as required by the investigation team.
   20.2.3. The CDDAR program instruction is procedural and will not take precedence over
   aircraft- specific technical data in recovery of crashed, damaged, or disabled aircraft.
   WARNING: Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause
   serious injury or death to those in contact with it. Transient aircraft home bases should be
   contacted to determine composite material risks and requirements for personal protective
   equipment (PPE). CAUTION: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed only to the extent
   required to eliminate an imminently dangerous situation to the aircraft, support equipment,
   and personnel and will remain in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to
   maintenance by the incident commander (IC).

             ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS MISHAP RESPONSE

21.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes responsibilities, unit capabilities, and procedures
necessary for Advanced Composite Materials (ACMs) mishaps in the McChord AFB area of
responsibility to include all host and transient aircraft. All agencies involved with response,
containment, and disposal operations will ensure compliance with this instruction to ensure a
cooperative, coordinated, and safe response to an ACM mishap situation. OPR for this chapter is
62 MXG/QA (DSN382-5361/Commercial 253-982-5361)
21.2. Advanced Composite Materials Specific Concerns.
   21.2.1. Carbon fibers are very light, become easily airborne, and are respirable. Plume
   dissipation under windy conditions increases dispersion area. Fire-exposed carbon fibers
   break into shorter lengths and smaller diameters, increasing the probability for respirability
   and ease of transport. Inhaled carbon fiber particulate cannot be expelled efficiently.
   Absorbed pyrolysis products on carbon fibers allow toxic debris to enter the body, causing
   decreases in respiratory efficiency and increases passageway irritation. The combined effect
   of inherently sharp and stiff individual carbon fibers promotes easy dermal penetration.
   Partially pyrolyzed fibers easily break into smaller segments. Rubbing of exposed skin areas
   increases the affected area. Typical exposure requires medical attention for dermatitis. C-17A
   aircraft contain over 8% carbon/graphite epoxy materials by weight (15,000 pounds). (See
   Attachment 42 for locations.)
   21.2.2. Initial response personnel face the probability of an aircraft fire. As the composite
   material burns, gases, vapors, and solid particles are released into the smoke plume.
   Firefighting personnel will be exposed to toxic gases and fibers in the smoke or fibers present
   on parts when performing rescue operations. (See Attachment 43 for appropriate personal
   protective equipment (PPE) for burning/smoldering composite materials.)
   21.2.3. Recovery/containment personnel will be exposed to fibers and respirable dusts as
   aircraft parts are moved around the site or modified by cutting, breaking, twisting, or
   hammering. (See Attachment 43 for protection from broken/splintered composites.)
   21.2.4. If personnel, other than those at the accident site, have been exposed to adverse
   material hazards, the base medical staff will be consulted for evaluation and tracking. Advise
   the unthreatened populace in affected or fallout areas to:
       21.2.4.1. Shelter in place.
       21.2.4.2. Remain indoors.
       21.2.4.3. Shut external doors and windows.
       21.2.4.4. Turn off forced air intakes.
       21.2.4.5. Await further notification.
   21.2.5. When practical, remove contaminated outer garments of victims/response personnel
   at the scene to protect the medical staff. Advise the local medical staff of any ill effects they
 86                                              MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


   believe are related to their exposure to the advanced composite materials. Symptoms of ill
   effects include, but are not limited to:
      21.2.5.1. Respiratory tract irritation, reduced respiratory capacity, and difficulty
      breathing.
      21.2.5.2. Eye irritation.
      21.2.5.3. Skin irritation, sensitization, rashes, or infections.
   21.2.6. Avoid excessive walking, working, or moving at the mishap site to minimize dust
   disturbance and creating airborne particulate fibers. All contaminated footwear will be
   cleaned to limit the spread of debris in the area and inside support vehicles.
   21.2.7. Clean sites (i.e. tent or trailer) for donning/removal of PPE will be set up. When
   exiting the mishap site, personnel will use a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered
   vacuum, if available, to remove advanced composite contaminants from their outer clothing,
   work gloves, boots, headgear, and equipment. If unavailable, efforts shall be made to wipe
   or brush off as much contamination as possible.
   21.2.8. No eating, drinking, or smoking is permitted within the established cordoned area.
   Personnel must be advised to wash hands, forearms, and face prior to eating, drinking, or
   smoking. Personnel will shower (in cool water) prior to going off duty to preclude injury
   from loose fibers.
   21.2.9. Wrap and seal disposable protective clothing in protective plastic bags after use and
   discard as routine waste. Severely contaminated clothing will be labeled and discarded in
   accordance with paragraph. 21.5.2., otherwise, launder non-disposable clothing separately.
   The 62d Medical Squadron (MDS) Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) will determine if
   other special handling or cleaning procedures are required.
21.3. Initial Response Requirements.
   21.3.1. The first responder(s) will be the 62d Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) Fire
   Department. The Senior Fire Official will conduct an initial survey to inspect for:
      21.3.1.1. Signs of fire-damaged composites (See Attachment 42 for C-17 aircraft
      locations).
      21.3.1.2. Presence of loose and airborne fibers and particulates.
      21.3.1.3. Prevailing weather conditions and directions.
      21.3.1.4. Degree of site exposed to fire, explosion, and impact.
      21.3.1.5. Local and proximal equipment and asset damage and danger.
      21.3.1.6. Exposed personnel.
   21.3.2. 62d Security Forces, along with any military person under Security Forces’ direction
   required for what is essentially sentry duty, will enforce an initial 2,500-foot clearance zone
   centered on the burning and/or smoking mishap site. Restrict personnel and traffic from
   entering.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                               87


       21.3.2.1. Evacuate areas in the vicinity of the mishap site affected by direct and dense
       fallout from the fire and explosion-generated smoke plume, along with easily mobile,
       critical equipment.
   21.3.3. Extinguish fire and cool composite materials to below 300°F. Only firefighters
   equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are authorized within the 2,500-
   foot clearance zone of a burning and/or smoking mishap site until the Senior Fire Official
   declares the area fire safe.
       21.3.3.1. Avoid high-pressure water break-up and dispersal of composite material
       structures.
       21.3.3.2. Do not use helicopters or low flying aircraft to control or suppress the fire. No
       flight, hovering, or taxiing within 500 ft above ground level (AGL) and 1,000 ft
       horizontally of the site.
   21.3.4. The appointed Incident Commander (IC) if available, or without an IC, the Senior
   Fire Official, will establish control at the mishap site until fires are extinguished and
   composites cooled below 300°F. When the mishap scene is deemed fire safe by the Senior
   Fire Official and the 62 Maintenance Squadron (MXS) Crash Recovery Team (CRT) has
   contained damaged advanced composite material surfaces (in accordance with paragraphs
   21.4.1. – 21.4.6.), the IC, if available and present at the time, will assume control. The IC or
   Senior Fire Official will ensure all responding personnel within the clearance zone wear
   appropriate personal protective equipment (See Attachment 43).
   21.3.5. The IC or Senior Fire Official will consult with the 62 MDS BE and determine when
   to eliminate the 2,500-foot clearance zone and designate the cordoned area. As a guide, the
   cordoned area will be defined as more than 25 feet away from damaged composite parts,
   although it may vary depending upon environmental conditions (rain, dry, high winds,
   remote site, etc.).
   21.3.6. 62d Security Forces will rope/cordon off the mishap area as established by the
   IC/BEE and establish a single entry and exit point. Only sufficiently protected individuals
   are authorized into the immediate mishap site/cordoned area (Attachment 43.
   21.3.7. The IC or Senior Fire Official will inspect for and identify specific aircraft hazards
   while consulting with the crew chief, weapons system manager, reference documents,
   contractor, or aircraft specialists. Note composite and other hazardous materials to mishap
   response personnel.
   21.3.8. Access to the crash site to conduct a more thorough survey will be coordinated with
   the IC. Ensure appropriate PPE is utilized (Attachment 43).
   21.3.9. Alter or move aircraft and flight operations exposed to the immediate fallout area as
   soon as safely practical. Restrict all unprotected personnel from assembling downwind of the
   crash site.
21.4. Containment. All affected agencies must ensure compliance with the following:
   21.4.1. 62 CES firefighters will secure burned and/or mobile composite material fragments
   and loose ash and particulate residue with firefighting foam or a fine water mist until a hold-
   down fixant material can be applied to immobilize the fibers. Initial actions will concentrate
   on debris containment.
 88                                             MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


   21.4.2. The 62 MXS CRT will deploy to mishap site with a fixant or ―hold-down‖ solution,
   consisting of either acrylic floor wax and water mixed in a 10:1 water-to-wax ratio, or
   Polyacrylic Acid (PAA-Carboset XL-11). The CRT will maintain an adequate supply of
   fixant solution(s) and spray equipment.
      21.4.2.1. The fire must be completely extinguished and the composites cooled to below
      300°F (149 °C) before fixant application. Firefighting equipment will be available during
      fixant application and aircraft break-up and recovery.
   21.4.3. CRT members will apply (preferably spray) a heavy coating of the fixant solution to
   all burned composite materials and to areas containing scattered or settled composite debris.
   Completely coat the material until wet to ensure the particulate fiber and dust is immobilized.
   Immediately flush and clean fixant-application equipment with a diluted solvent to avoid
   clogging.
      21.4.3.1. If fixant cannot be used, or further protection is needed, carefully wrap the
      coated parts and/or material with plastic sheet/film or place in a plastic bag that is a
      minimum of 0.006 inches (6 mils) thick. Seal and secure the damaged materials with
      tape.
   21.4.4. CRT members will use soil-tackifiers (i.e., Polychem, J-Tack, Terra Tack) to hold
   materials on sand or soil. Solution will be sprayed onto the ground at a rate of 0.5 gal/sq. yd.
   21.4.5. Apply masking tape over the non-fire/crash-damaged composite parts and material.
   These parts and materials may be required for investigative purposes. Place the damaged
   composite part and material in a plastic bag if possible and label as required. Pad all sharp
   projections from damaged composite parts to prevent accidental injuries.
   21.4.6. Improved hard surfaces (i.e., concrete, asphalt) will be vacuumed (with electrically
   protected HEPA vacuums) or washed down with a detergent and water solution. The waste
   will be collected via plastic or burlap coated trenches or drainage ditches. Sweeping
   operations will be avoided, as they will dispense the particulate debris.
21.5. Clean-up and Disposal of Exposed Advanced Composites.
   21.5.1. Conduct material disposal according to local, state, and federal guidelines. The 62
   MXG hazardous materials and waste contractor, Aleut (main office in Bldg 745) will be
   contacted to assist with cleanup, sampling, and turn-in of the advanced composite parts and
   material that do not require accident investigation, evaluation, or repair or is not needed.
   Ensure the Safety Investigation Board (SIB) releases the parts before disposal is authorized.
   21.5.2. If possible, a HEPA vacuum will be used to clean up the local area. Ensure
   composite materials to be disposed of are demilitarized, netted, and double wrapped in
   plastic for disposal purposes. All crash debris, vacuum bags, coveralls, gloves, and any other
   contaminated materials will be properly disposed of and labeled appropriately with the
   following: "Carbon Fiber Debris. Do not incinerate. Do not sell for scrap. Dispose of in
   approved landfill. Composite Waste." Any required hazard warnings will also be added.
   Aleut will coordinate composite waste disposal through 62 CES/CEV.
   21.5.3. In the event of an open terrain mishap area, the surface will be sprayed with a final
   foam application and plowed under after all necessary and possible material collection
   actions have been completed.

      21.5.3.1. Terrain will require advance coordination with the Operations Flight (62
      CES/CEO) of 62 CES to see if affected airfield environment is suitable for the ―plow
      under‖ of terrain due to presence of shallow-to-deep-buried utilities that service to
      airfield
   21.5.4. If aircraft were subjected to the smoke and debris of the mishap, the following will
   be undertaken:
      21.5.4.1. Vacuum the air intakes with an electrically protected vacuum cleaner.
      21.5.4.2. For internally ingested smoke, visually and electronically (i.e., "sniffer")
      inspect all compartments for debris and vacuum thoroughly.
      21.5.4.3. Prior to flying, perform electrical checks and engine run-up.
21.6. Training.
   21.6.1. 62 MXS CRT members, Aleut, and 62 MDS BE personnel will:
      21.6.1.1. View 14-minute training video titled Mishap Response for Advanced
      Composites. Video may be viewed at the 62d Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS)
      Maintenance Training Flight (SW corner of Hangar 1).
      21.6.1.2. Be medically cleared for respirator use and receive initial and annual training
      and fit testing to maintain respirator certification.
      21.6.1.3. Direct all technical advanced composite materials questions to the 62 MXS
      Structural Maintenance Section, Bldg. 745, commercial (253) 982-5375/DSN 382-5375.
      21.6.1.4. Direct all disposal concerns and questions to Aleut, commercial (253) 982-

                                         Chapter 22

                     DROPPED OBJECT PREVENTION PROGRAM

22.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes policies and procedures to be used to accomplish
the Dropped Object Prevention Program (DOPP). This instruction applies to all aircraft
maintenance personnel assigned or attached to the 62d/446th Maintenance Group (62/446
MXG). Commanders and supervisors at all levels within the 62/446 MXG are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this instruction. OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI (DSN 382-
5361/3028/.Commercial 253-982-5361/3028)
22.2. General. All AMC units will participate in DOPP as directed in AFI 21101 and this
instruction. The prevention of dropped objects requires a multifaceted approach. The following
areas will be emphasized to aid in DOPP improvement; training, inspection, analysis, reporting
and follow-up.
22.3. Responsibilities.
   22.3.1. Proper removal, opening, installation, and closing of panels, fairings, externally
   mounted aircraft components, cowl doors, and hinged access panels are key to preventing
   dropped objects and the responsibilities of all aircraft maintenance personnel.
   22.3.2. Upon discovery of a dropped object, the owning unit/squadron will immediately
   notify the Maintenance Operations Center and 62 MXG Quality Assurance inspection
   section, and within 12 hours, deliver a completed McChord AFB IMT 517, Dropped Object
   Report, to QA. The MOC will immediately notify 62 MXG/CC upon notification of a
   dropped object.
   22.3.3. The QA DOPP monitor will ensure the McChord AFB IMT 517 is properly
   completed. If a material or design deficiency is a factor in a dropped object, a Deficiency
   Report Work Sheet (see 62 MXG share point for work sheet) will be completed and
   forwarded to the QA Product Improvement office. The QA DOPP monitor will record the
   dropped object incident with recommendations in the QA database for trending and tracking
   purposes and will notify higher headquarters agencies in accordance with AFI 21-101. Once
   the report is released from AMC, the incident will be loaded into G081, and the AMC DOPP
   website within 3 duty days. The website will be checked by the QA DOPP monitor monthly
   to ensure data accuracy.
22.4. Panel Inspection and Documentation Procedures.
   22.4.1. Prior to removal and/or installation of each and every external panel, fairing,
   component and/or the opening of engine cowl doors, maintenance personnel will place a red
   "X" symbol and appropriate entry in the aircraft forms. The AFTO Form 781A, Aircraft
   Discrepancy and Work Document, will clearly identify the panel, component and/or engine
   cowl removed and/or opened. NOTE: For guidance on flare panel installation/removal
   during flare load operations see Chapter 7 paragraph 7.7.4.5.
   22.4.2. All hinged access doors and panels will be fully opened and secured (if applicable),
   or fully closed and secured. Under no circumstances will hinged doors and panels be left
   unsecured.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                            91


  22.4.3. Panels or components will not be installed in a partial or temporary manner. The
  only exceptions to this policy are outlined in TO 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft
  Integral Tanks and Cells, which authorizes temporary installation of access doors and fuel
  filler caps in the event of unforeseen high winds and/or thunder/lightning storms within a 5-
  mile radius. The on-duty Saber 3 or Mike 2 has the discretion of temporarily installing
  panels if he/she determines any of the above weather conditions warrant the installation. The
  original red ―X‖ entry for the removal/opening of the panel/component will remain open in
  the aircraft forms during the temporary closure period. Upon termination of the weather
  induced maintenance restriction(s), fully open all temporarily installed panels/components
  for a clear visual identification of the actual aircraft status. The Production Superintendent
  must verify all panels temporarily installed have an open red ―X‖ for removal in the AFTO
  Form 781A.
  22.4.4. The DOPP inspection will be accomplished within a 6-hour window prior to the
  scheduled launch time. EXCEPTION: Aircraft generated during exercises or real-world
  contingencies may have DOPP inspections completed earlier than 6 hours prior to flight.
     22.4.4.1. The DOPP inspection will be accomplished using AFI 21-101, AMC
     Supplement 1, Addendum C, C-17 Dropped Object Prevention Program (DOPP)
     Checklist.     Any aircraft that is on alert status that has had a DOPP inspection
     accomplished will carry the inspection throughout the alert status. NOTE: The person
     who performed and signed off the -6 work card inspection is not authorized to perform
     and sign off the DOPP inspection on the same aircraft. EXCEPTION: Flying Crew
     Chiefs may accomplish their own DOPP inspection in conjunction with a -6 inspection at
     locations where no other qualified personnel are available.

   taken.
23.4. General FOD Prevention Practices.
   23.4.1. Personnel will be constantly alert for any form of FOD during all phases of a job.
   Special attention must be given to small items of debris (e.g., safety wire, bolts, nuts, screws,
   etc.). Loose material and hardware will be placed in parts bags or FOD containers during the
   normal course of job performance. In addition, all personnel will:
      23.4.1.1. Ensure all composite tool kits, or equivalents, are inspected for tool
      accountability at the completion of each task and all FOs are removed.
      23.4.1.2. Ensure all work tasks, regardless of location, include a thorough cleanup as part
      of that task.
      23.4.1.3. Ensure that FO bags (plastic or cloth) are available and are used to control
      hardware during maintenance.
   23.4.2. All vehicles normally driven on the flight line will be equipped with secured and
   lidded FO containers. The containers will be emptied when full or at the end of each day,
   whichever comes first. For specific container requirements, consult AFI 21-101.
      23.4.2.1. Vehicle operators are responsible for inspecting the cab interior, cargo bed area
      and tires for FOs objects prior to use. Operation of flight line vehicles on unpaved
      surfaces will be avoided whenever possible. When circumstances require off-road
      vehicle operation or transit through construction zones with rocks present, personnel will
      stop before entering the flight line to inspect and remove debris collected in the tire
      treads.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                               95


   23.4.3. When engine and pitot covers are installed, they will be written up on a Red X.
   23.4.4. Maintenance personnel will ensure a FOD inspection of the aircraft parking spot is
   performed preceding the block-in and prior to and following the block-out of all aircraft.
   23.4.5. Any individual that escorts a person or group onto the flight line is responsible for
   the personal belongings and/or equipment of the escorted person(s).
   23.4.6. Hats, berets, wigs or hairpieces will not be worn on the McChord AFB flight line.
   The MXG/CC can authorize exceptions to the no-hat policy for official functions that occur
   on the flight line. EXCEPTIONS: Wear of the seasonal watch cap is authorized. However,
   it will not be worn within 25 feet of any operating aircraft engine. Additionally, on-duty
   Security Forces personnel may wear their berets until they are within 25 feet of an operating
   aircraft engine.
23.5. Inlet and Exhaust Inspections.
   23.5.1. The -6 Engine Inlet and Exhaust Inspection will be accomplished during pre-flight
   (PR), thru-flight, basic post-flight (BPO) or combined BPO/PR. Annotate ―All engines due
   Inlet and Exhaust Inspection for XXX (applicable -6 inspection) IAW TO 1C-17A-6-WC-1
   and 1C-17A-2-71JG-00-1‖.
   23.5.2. The FO inspection will be accomplished prior to the first flight of the day after
   engine inlet covers have been removed or when aircraft turn time does not warrant a -6
   inspection (6 hours or less). The FO inspection does not require inlet entry. It will be a
   visual inspection of the inlet and exhaust area to verify that there is no FO or readily
   detectible discrepancy present that could cause damage during engine start. Use a light
   source of sufficient illumination to inspect aircraft inlets and exhausts for FO.
   23.5.3. All Engine Inlet and Exhaust Inspections and FO Inspections will be documented on
   a Red X and will be documented in G081 and the aircraft forms using Reference Designator
   0413C for inlet/exhaust inspections and 04199 for FO inspections.
   23.5.4. Do not attempt entry into the inlet or exhaust until engine rotation has stopped. If the
   engine is wind-milling due to high winds, cover the exhaust before entering the inlet. NOTE:
   The inspection will be accomplished even if the engine is scheduled for removal.
23.6. FOD Investigation and Reporting.
   23.6.1. Investigators will use the McChord IMT 199, Foreign Object Damage (FOD)

                           MAINTENANCE RECOVERY TEAM

24.1. Introduction. This chapter gives procedures for repair or recovery of off-station aircraft.
It refers to AFI 21-101, and AMCI 21-108, Logistics Support Operations, and applies to all
maintenance activities and personnel assigned or attached to the 62d Airlift Wing (62 AW).
OPR for this chapter is 62 MOS/MXOOC (DSN 382-0525/Commercial 253-982-0525)
24.2. Responsibilities. All commanders within the 62 Maintenance Group as well as the 62d
Mission Support Squadron, Personnel Readiness Function (62 MSS/DPMX) and 62d Logistics
Readiness Squadron, Readiness Flight (62 LRS/LGRR) will ensure compliance with this
instruction.
24.3. General. The Tactical Airlift Control Center, Logistics Control (TACC/XOCL) is
responsible for the dispatch of MRTs. The purpose of an MRT is to repair or recover Air
Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft grounded for maintenance at stations lacking support,
needing technical assistance, or experiencing station saturation or work stoppage. MRTs consist
of a selected technician or team of technicians with equipment and any necessary replacement
parts.
   24.3.1. MRT personnel will possess all required items necessary for travel and any special
   requirements passed down by XOCL (e.g. government travel card, shot records, passport,
   etc.).
24.4. Procedures. TACC/XOCL will refer all requests for off-base support to the MOC. The
MOC at the downrange location will create and close the discrepancy for the not mission capable
(NMC) aircraft in G081. In the absence of an Air Mobility Command (AMC) MOC at that
location, the home station MOC will be responsible for G081 data entry. The home station MOC
will immediately notify Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) of any MRT personnel or
equipment tasked to support the expeditious recovery of the aircraft.
   24.4.1. For aircraft on a TACC-funded mission, TACC/XOCL will task MOC and provide a
   Unit Line Number (ULN). The MOC will provide all pertinent information to the IDO to
   include the ULN, Geographic Location (GLOC), Unit Type Code (UTC), etc. for
   coordination with the 62 MSS/DPMX, who will prepare the Contingency Exercise
   Deployment (CED) orders. The IDO will notify the 62 APS Traffic Management Flight
   (TMF), Passenger Travel element of the priority requirement to move personnel and/or
   equipment.
   24.4.2. For aircraft on a 62 AW-funded training mission, the MRT will be coordinated
   through the 62 MXG/CC. The tasked individuals will prepare their own temporary duty
   orders and travel through the Defense Travel System (DTS). Regardless of fund cite, if civil
   service employees or reservists are tasked, AMXS or MXS mobility sections will prepare
   Automated Business Services System (ABSS) orders for their respective travelers. It is
   imperative that flight reservations be based on earliest necessary departure, not team member
   convenience. If time does not allow the traveler to input an authorization into DTS, the unit
   requesting the travel shall prepare a Letter in Lieu of orders (see Attachment 44) signed by a
   Competent Authority and submit to TMF. Every effort should be made to process orders in
   DTS. The official travel order must be provided to TMF Passenger Travel element, fax 2-
 98                                             MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


   5700, within 24 hours on the first official duty day after the member has departed home
   station for the official travel. All travel orders shall indicate whether or not the member is a
   Government Travel Card (GTC) card holder, in accordance with (IAW) DOD 7000.14-R,
   Volume 9, Chapter 3, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation. It is
   imperative that the member and the unit GTC manager have the GTC activated prior to
   travel. Sufficient funds must be available on the GTC for member to complete travel.
   24.4.3. The MOC will coordinate manning and equipment requirements between
   TACC/XOCL and 62 AMXS supervision (Saber 3). If 62 MXS support is required, the
   MOC will contact 62 MXS Mike 2 Production Superintendent. Information will include the
   required number of personnel by Air Force specialty code (AFSC), tools, parts, equipment,
   MRT mode of transportation, and estimated departure time. The MOC will provide the
   tasked organization a detailed description of the malfunction and condition of the aircraft.
   24.4.4. The tasked organization will ensure the team members possess the proper
   qualifications for the task(s), provide the name of the team chief and the names of other
   team members within two hours of tasking to the MOC senior coordinator. TACC/XOCL
   may shorten these times when necessary. All team members will be considered Mission-
   Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP), with ―MEGP Authorized‖ and/or ―Mission Route
   Support‖ (authorizes cargo removal to allow space for MRT and equipment on the aircraft)
   annotated in the remarks section of the TDY orders, as applicable. The team chief will report
   to the MOC in bldg 1172 to receive a briefing on the extent and requirements of the MRT.
   The MOC senior coordinator will issue an MRT binder, brief the team chief on
   responsibilities in AMCI 21-108, and review the remarks section of the travel orders with the
   team chief.
   24.4.5. If the grounded aircraft is at a location without any means of communication,
   TACC/XOCL will notify the MOC, who will issue an International Maritime Satellite
   (INMARSAT) communications kit and instruct the team chief on set operation. Kits are
   inspected monthly and maintained by the AMC Local Area Network (LAN) contractors in
   bldg 1197. If required after hours, MOC will contact the LAN contractors on the standby
   phone list.
   24.4.6. The team chief will attempt to contact the aircraft commander or aircrew point of
   contact prior to departure and receive a brief on the malfunction. Do not delay departure,
   however, if time or circumstances prevent contact. The team chief is responsible for briefing
   the team and complying with the notification requirements IAW AMCI 21-108.
   24.4.7. Immediately upon return to home station, the team chief will report to the MOC to
   brief the results of the TDY and return the MRT binder. The MOC senior coordinator will
   contact TACC/XOCL to notify them of the team’s return. The team chief will brief the
   current location of all engines and related equipment shipped as part of the MRT and any
   known Transportation Control Numbers (TCN).
24.5. Shipment of Equipment.
   24.5.1. The Pro Super will register for the Automated DD Form 1149 System hosted on the
   AFMC WEB-SERVER https://lsotools.wpafb.af.mil/dd1149/. The Pro Super will prepare
   a DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, for shipments entering the
   Defense Transportation System. A National Stock Number is required on the DD Form 1149
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                             99


  for each item. A separate DD Form 1149 is required for each hazardous item. If shipping an
  aircraft engine, complete a DD Form 1348-lA, Issue Release/Receipt Document, in
  quadruplet and AFTO Form 20, Caution and Inspection Record, if required. If any items
  require an AMC IMT 1033, Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods, complete it in
  quadruplet. This form must be printed on a color printer. It must have the red border to be a
  valid form. The property and all documentation necessary for shipment will be taken to the
  62 APS, Packing and Crating Element, 2-5775, for shipment. Pro Supers will provide all
  TCNs to the MOC. Fund cites will be obtained from 62 LRS/LGRRP if the grounded
  aircraft is on a TACC-funded mission. Otherwise, fund cites are obtained from the tasked
  organizations.
  24.5.2. The team chief will inspect the items and verify they are exactly the required items to
  repair the aircraft and will ensure all required parts and equipment items are on the aircraft
  prior to departure. The team chief will contact the MOC for follow-up on any missing items.
  24.5.3. The MOC senior coordinator will contact 62 APS/TMO at 2-5775 and provide the
  priority, mission number, tail number of grounded aircraft, and departure time to the TMF
  Packing and Crating Element for shipment during normal duty hours. After duty hours and
  weekends, the MOC senior coordinator will notify ATOC at 2-2613 who will in turn notify
  the Traffic Management Flight Standby representative. TMF standby personnel are under
  control of the 62 APS Port Manager for the movement of all cargo and personnel via
  military or commercial transportation. It is imperative all travel and movement requirements
  are immediately coordinated with the 62 APS Port Manager and TMF standby personnel as

                                           Chapter 26

                      C-17 ENGINEERING DISPOSITION PROCESS

26.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes the procedures and responsibilities for managing
the Engineering Disposition (ED) process. It is used to provide technical assistance to the C-17
maintenance community. It outlines procedures for all units on McChord Air Force Base
requesting technical assistance for C-17 aircraft maintenance actions that are beyond the scope of
applicable technical orders (TOs). OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAP (DSN 382-
5992/5145/Commercial 253-982-5992/5145)
26.2. General. A Request for Engineering Disposition Instruction (REDI) is used to request
engineering assistance from Boeing to correct aircraft discrepancies that TOs do not address or
when all troubleshooting efforts have been exhausted.
   26.2.1. An Engineering Disposition requires the submission of a completed REDI to Boeing
   C-17 Field Engineering Support. The ED process now utilizes a web based system called
   VECTOR. When the online REDI form is completed in VECTOR, an email notification is
   automatically sent to 62 MXG Quality Assurance Product Improvement Office (QAP) and to
   Boeing Field Engineering. Once Boeing has completed the ED, the initiator will receive an
   automatic email notification. The initiator can then enter VECTOR and retrieve the ED.
   Prior to completing a REDI, 62d Maintenance Group (MXG) personnel will exhaust all
   possible resources (training, experience, technical data, tools, support equipment, etc.). If no
   fix/repair or repair is possible, then a REDI should be submitted to Boeing for assistance.
   26.2.2. There are two priority levels for REDI submission:
       26.2.2.1. Urgent: The aircraft is non-mission capable (NMC) and will not fly until the
       discrepancy has been corrected or the aircraft is partially mission capable (PMC) with
       mission restrictions until discrepancy has been corrected or the aircraft is in home station
       check (HSC) status.
       26.2.2.2. Routine: The aircraft is not restricted, but a minor discrepancy exists that
       requires correction as priorities, time, and mission tasking allow, or REDI involves a non-
       mission capable supply asset, i.e., component, panel, or line replaceable unit (LRU).
26.3. Responsibilities.
   26.3.1. Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) and Maintenance Squadron (MXS)
   Maintenance Supervision will:
       26.3.1.1. Appoint production superintendents and/or flight commanders/chiefs and
       designated section chiefs as REDI form approving officials. Provide approving official
       listing to the Product Improvement Office annually or as required due to personnel
       change. All approving officials require a VECTOR account. Contact MXG/QAP (982-
       2949 or 982-5992) to acquire an account.
       26.3.1.2. Ensure approving officials brief maintenance personnel on the ED process.
       26.3.1.3. Ensure personnel forward all completed REDI forms (form is in the 62
       MXG/QAP Share point) to their designated approving official to input the information
       into VECTOR.
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                        103


     26.3.1.4. Review monthly for trends of similar or repeat REDI submissions in the same
     specialty area and ensure AFTO Form 22s are initiated when warranted.
     26.3.1.5. Inform the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of aircraft status based on
     the REDI submission and subsequent ED response.
  26.3.2. AMXS and MXS approving officials will:
     26.3.2.1. Ensure technical order research is completed and organizational and
     intermediate-level repair remedies have been exhausted before submitting a REDI.
     26.3.2.2. Ensure the REDI form is completed with as much detail as possible, determine
     priority of REDI submission, and review the REDI form prior to submission into
     VECTOR.
     26.3.2.3. Generate an online REDI in VECTOR and fax the completed REDI form
     (printed from VECTOR) to MOC at 982-2382. If VECTOR is unavailable during normal
     duty        hours,      either     fax      (982-0183)       or       scan/e-mail
     (62MXGProductImprovement@mcchord.af.mil) a completed REDI form to
     MXG/QAP. If an urgent REDI is required after duty hours, the MOC will contact
     MXG/QAP by radio or cell phone (253-973-5444) to ensure the REDI is received and
     processed.
     26.3.2.4. Boeing has 10 hours upon receipt of an urgent REDI to respond with final ED
     response and 3 duty days to respond to a routine REDI.
     26.3.2.5. Place the completed ED in the applicable aircraft or equipment forms or
     forward to the originator for similar disposition.
     26.3.2.6. Remove ED(s) from the applicable aircraft or equipment forms once a final
     repair is made or the ED is no longer applicable.
  26.3.3. Air Force maintenance personnel/maintenance flights initiating a REDI form will:
     26.3.3.1. Generate separate REDI requests for temporary and permanent repairs of the
     same discrepancy.
     26.3.3.2. Complete the REDI form in clear and concise detail filling in all applicable
     blocks (see Attachment 49) and attach any photos, drawing(s), or other information that
     will assist with the resolution of the discrepancy.
     26.3.3.3. Submit the completed REDI form to a REDI approving official.
     26.3.3.4. Review the ED received (if applicable) from Boeing and determine if further
     guidance is needed to correct the problem.
     26.3.3.5. Document corrective action IAW the ED in the AFTO From 781A or 244 and
     include the ED number in the corrective action block.
  26.3.4. 62 MXG/QAP will:
     26.3.4.1. Be the central point of contact for all REDIs submitted to Boeing C-17
     Engineering and receive completed EDs from Boeing Engineering.
     26.3.4.2. Assist maintenance personnel requesting an account for VECTOR via Boeing.
104                                          MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


      26.3.4.3. Assist maintenance personnel in researching technical orders prior to REDI
      form submission.
      26.3.4.4. Maintain a 24-hour, 365-day point of contact where completed forms and EDs
      are centrally located. Cell phone: (253) 973-5444 during off shifts and weekends.
      26.3.4.5. Review the priority of the REDI based on the aircraft maintenance situation and
      process REDIs immediately upon receipt. Routine REDIs received during weekends will
      be processed on the next duty day.
      26.3.4.6. Assign the REDI form submission number from the REDI log and enter that
      number into VECTOR. In the REDI log, note the following: date/time received, priority,
      aircraft tail number, REDI number and discrepancy. If VECTOR is unavailable, process
      the REDI form received from maintenance as follows: assign an ED number, deliver the
      completed REDI form to Boeing C-17 Engineering and place a copy of the REDI form in
      the open REDI file. Upon receipt of the completed ED from Boeing Engineering, remove
      the submitted REDI from the master open file and distribute the completed ED to the
      requester. Boeing Engineering will maintain the original.
      26.3.4.7. If the REDI is urgent, MXG/QAP will:
         26.3.4.7.1. Review the REDI and contact the applicable engineer for that area.
         During weekends, contact the Boeing Engineer on duty. If the engineer is not
         available, contact the C-17 Base Engineering Manager for assistance.
         26.3.4.7.2. After normal duty hours, contact the Boeing C-17 Engineering Manager

       27.3.1.4. Complete wash, C-130, KC-135
       27.3.1.5. Mission readiness wash, C-17
       27.3.1.6. Major interior cleaning, C-17
       27.3.1.7. Minor interior cleaning, C-17, C-130
       27.3.1.8. Spot wash, (any aircraft)
       27.3.1.9. Clear water rinse, C-17, C-130
   27.3.2. Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) personnel will inspect all assigned aircraft
   terminating at home station and request contract services as necessary to maintain a clean
   aircraft. The single criterion for ordering a wash/cleaning (except a complete wash) will be
   the need for that service. For flight line wash services, this need will be verified by
   Maintenance Supervision or a Production Superintendent prior to scheduling the service
   through 62 MOS/MXOOS or the MOC. Automatically ordering services because an aircraft
   has returned from, or is about to depart on a mission, is not authorized; a bona fide
   requirement must exist.
   27.3.3. Authorized personnel will request contract services by contacting 62 MOS/MXOOS
   or the MOC. 62 MOS/MXOOS or the MOC will prepare an Air Force Technical Order
   (AFTO) Form 349, Maintenance Data Collection Record, in G081, Core Automated
106                                            MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


  Maintenance System (CAMS) for Mobility. MOC only schedules minor interior washes.
  The AFTO Form 349 will contain a job control number, the aircraft identification number,
  type of service required, and the scheduled time that the service is required. The AFTO
  Form 349 will then be transmitted to the printer designated for contractor use. If the G081
  system is down, 62 MOS/MXOOS or the MOC may call the contractor at 982-2912 to
  request a wash service. However, as soon as the G081 system is back up, the requester must
  transmit an AFTO Form 349 to the contractor, even if the job has been completed. The
  contractor needs a hard copy of the AFTO Form 349 for payment purposes.
  27.3.4. The contractor will forward the completed AFTO Form 349 to MXG/QAE for
  service validation.
  27.3.5. If a wash service cannot be accomplished as scheduled, personnel responsible for, or
  first aware of the delay, (i.e. AMXS/MXS) will notify the MOC (extension 982-3336) of the
  delay or termination of the service requirement. The MOC will coordinate with 62
  MOS/MXOOS during the following dayshift to ensure job orders (AFTO Form 349) are
  completed, rescheduled, or terminated. If an aircraft cannot be turned over to the contractor
  within 1 hour of the scheduled time, it must be rescheduled to start no sooner than 12 hours
  after the originally scheduled time. Rescheduled wash start times may differ from normal
  start times in order to match mission requirements.
  27.3.6. As soon as possible after completion, the contractor will sign off the wash due write-
  up in G081. Clearing wash acceptance write-ups remains the owning squadron’s
  responsibility.
  27.3.7. The contractor is not allowed to create a wash job order (AFTO Form 349) in G081.
  This can only be accomplished by 62 MOS/MXOOS or the MOC.
  27.3.8. After proper notification of a flight line wash requirement, the contractor must begin
  that service within 2 hours, unless several jobs are scheduled at the same time. In that case,
  the contractor shall accomplish the work in the priority order determined by the MOC. In
  accordance with their statement of work (SOW), as a minimum, the contractor shall maintain
  sufficient manning to accomplish an aircraft wash preparation, wash, lube, and restoration
  within specified time limits, while at the same time, recovering and launching 2 large
  aircraft. The contractor will make every possible effort to complete wash services prior to
  flight crew arrival. The contractor is responsible for employee notification and timely
  completion of the work.
  27.3.9. For complete washes, the owning organization will deliver all aircraft to the
  contractor at the scheduled time. The contractor will accomplish all towing, servicing, and
  wash preparation in accordance with (IAW) their SOW.
  27.3.10. Prior to aircraft delivery to the contractor, the owning organization will insert the
  applicable preprinted wash and lube package into the aircraft forms binder. Wash service
  will NOT begin until AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document,
  form packages have been properly entered. Upon completion of the wash and lube service,
  the contractor shall sign off all applicable write-ups in this package, as well as clear them in
  G081.
  27.3.11. The Aircraft Services SOW has designated maximum allowable times for
  contractor completion of stated tasks. The contractor is allowed a maximum of 7 hours for
MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009                                                              107


   tow and wash preparation, 10 hours for aircraft wash, 4 hours for post-wash lubrication, and
   3 hours for post-wash restoration. The contractor has a maximum of 24 hours from
   scheduled start time to complete all services on each particular aircraft and release it back to
   the government. This does not mean that the contractor will only service one aircraft in this
   24-hour period. For example, the contractor may have one work crew lubricating an aircraft
   while another work crew starts a wash in another facility. The contractor will make every
   effort to accommodate government requirements.
   27.3.12. If the contractor encounters a lube fitting that will not take grease, they will
   annotate this in the aircraft forms and notify the MOC. The MOC will contact the
   appropriate agency for troubleshooting or replacement of the fitting or associated
   components.
   27.3.13. Transient aircraft that come to McChord for wash services will not be prepped or
   lubed by the contractor. These tasks are the responsibility of the aircraft crew chiefs. The
   MOC will advise transient crew chiefs and other TDY personnel to accompany and prepare
   their aircraft for wash and to perform an acceptance inspection of the aircraft prior to
   departing the wash facility. The contractor will be available to correct any deficiencies.
   27.3.14. The contractor is responsible for collecting all deicing fluid and wash water
   generated on the flight line. All nearby sewer drains will be blocked with fluid barriers prior
   to start of the deicing or wash operation. The MOC will notify the contractor by phone (982-
   2912) or radio that a deicing operation is planned. The contractor will have 1 hour to
   respond to the parking spot with a vacuum vehicle and drain barriers. Any washes,
   excluding minor interiors, to be accomplished outside a designated wash facility must be
   coordinated through 62 CES/CEV 982-3913 for approval.
27.4. Transient Aircraft Procedures:
   27.4.1. The contractor will coordinate transient aircraft arrival and departure times, parking
   locations, fuel delivery, and maintenance requirements with the MOC. McChord aircraft on
   loan to other bases are not usually considered transient. AMXS supervision will be the
   deciding agency to whether Transient Alert or an AMU will cover these type aircraft and will
   coordinate decisions with Transient Alert. Additionally, the contractor will keep the MOC
   informed of aircraft status and any parts that are on order.
   27.4.2. When services and supplies are provided to foreign, commercial, and other non-DoD
   aircraft, the contractor will annotate this data on the AFTO Form 349 (man-hours), and AF
   IMT 726 Transient Aircraft Service Record (Consumables) and submit to the McChord
   Accounting and Finance Office (AFO) IAW TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment
   Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, and AFI 21-101. The
   AFO will use this data to gain reimbursement from these non-DoD agencies.
   27.4.3. Engine oil must be checked and samples taken within the time constraints established
   by specific aircraft technical data. When processing oil samples for the Joint Oil Analysis
   Program (JOAP), DD Form 2026, Oil Analysis Request, must be completed IAW TO 33-1-
   37-1, Joint Oil Analysis Program Laboratory Manual. The contractor will extract engine oil
   samples from transient aircraft and deliver to the JOAP lab located at Fort Lewis, Building
   9500. JOAP samples during off-shift and weekends are limited to ―red cap‖ samples only.

   27.4.4. The contractor shall clean up small fuel and hydraulic fluid spills that occur on
   transient aircraft. Personnel shall be properly trained and will use all required personal
   protective equipment. The on-site commander or fire chief will determine which spills are
   large enough to be cleaned up by the base Hazardous Materials Response Team.
   27.4.5. The contractor will check, make required entries, and clear AFTO Form 781 series
   write-ups as required. The contractor is responsible for clearing Red X symbols originated
   by Aircraft Services personnel. The contractor is authorized IAW TO 00-20-1 and shall keep
   on file a list of all employees certified to sign Exceptional Releases (ERs) on transient
   aircraft.
   27.4.6. The contractor shall respond to and support emergency or wartime contingency
   situations. The contractor may be directed to respond to emergencies on the runway or
   taxiway, tow disabled aircraft, or use ―Follow Me‖ vehicles to lead emergency response
   teams to the site of the emergency. During an aircraft hijack incident or exercise, the
   contractor may be required to block access to runways in accordance with base checklists.
   During Disaster Preparedness responses (actual or exercise), the contractor may be required
   to tow transient aircraft from affected areas or assist in relocating maintenance equipment.
   The contractor may also be required to evacuate the affected area until the all clear is given.
27.5. Operation, Maintenance, Repair and Supply of MXG Pollution Prevention (P2)
Equipment:
   27.5.1. This section establishes procedures and work center responsibility for the C-17A
   aircraft wash rack water filtration systems in Hangars 4, 5, 6 (Corrosion Control Facility

                                RED BALL PROCEDURES

32.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes procedures and responsibilities for Red Ball
maintenance and further establishes guidelines for local maintenance procedures, parts delivery,
documentation methods, and follow-on actions. This maintenance concept is intended to prevent
late takeoffs and aborts. This policy applies to all personnel assigned or attached to the
62d/446th Maintenance Groups (MXG). OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI (DSN 382-5361)
32.2. Responsibilities. Squadron commanders, section chiefs, and supervisors at all levels are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this chapter.
32.3. Procedures.
   32.3.1. Qualified maintenance personnel from each AMU will be available and readily
   accessible with proper technical data and tools during launch and recovery operations to
   troubleshoot, isolate, and repair system malfunctions.
   32.3.2. Maintenance personnel will display a sense of urgency while practicing sound safety
   procedures using MRM and ORM principles.
   32.3.3. The term ―Red Ball‖ will be used for maintenance required actions called in to the
   MOC by the respective AMU to identify time-sensitive maintenance prior to launch.
   32.3.4. MOC will be notified for all Red Ball maintenance discrepancies to be loaded into
   G081 and will close out G081 entries (9010 screen) called in complete by the respective
   AMU prior to flight. If G081 is down, MOC will manually record discrepancy(s) using
   G081 Form 115 with assigned job control number(s). When G081 is up, information will be
   loaded and the job closed out as soon as practical.
   32.3.5. All supply parts will be ordered priority 2 and delivered to the aircraft within 30
   minutes IAW AFI 21-101, paragraph 11.33.2. The flight line expediter will ensure that all
   supply parts are turned in and due-in-from-maintenance assets cleared as soon as possible.
   32.3.6. The Production Supervisor will review the AFTO 781A Maintenance Discrepancy
   and Work Document to determine the adequacy of repairs and if follow-on maintenance is
   required and to ensure accurate documentation after completion of Red Ball maintenance.

   REPEAT, RECUR AND CANNOT DUPLICATE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

33.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes procedures and responsibilities for repeat, recur,
and cannot duplicate maintenance procedures. This policy applies to all personnel assigned or
attached to the 62d/446th Maintenance Groups (MXG). OPR for this chapter is 62 MXG/QAI
(DSN 382-5361/Commercial 253-982-5361)
33.2. Responsibilities. Squadron commanders, section chiefs, and supervisors at all levels are
responsible for ensuring compliance with this chapter.
33.3. General. Maintenance discrepancy history is a vital part of determining the next
maintenance action to repair an existing problem; analysis of such information trends should
assist in resolving any discrepancy. G081 is a valuable source of this information, and users will
maintain data integrity. It is the responsibility of those involved with the existing problem to
ensure a historical review is accomplished of previous corrective actions on this and other
aircraft.
33.4. Definitions.
   33.4.1. A repeat discrepancy is when the same malfunction occurs in a system/subsystem on
   the next sortie/sortie attempt after the discrepancy originally occurred and was cleared by
   maintenance (including CNDs/no-defect-noted, etc).
   33.4.2. A recurring discrepancy is when the same system/subsystem malfunction occurs in
   the 2nd thru 4th flights/attempted flights after the original flight in which the malfunction
   occurred and was cleared by maintenance (including CNDs/no-defect-noted, etc).
   33.4.3. Cannot duplicate (CND) discrepancies are those discrepancies reported by flight
   crews or maintenance personnel that cannot be duplicated.
33.5. Guidance.
   33.5.1. Repeat/Recur and CND Discrepancies.           Follow the guidance in AFI 21-
   101_AMCSUP, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management; and TO 00-20-1,
   Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy, and Procedures and
   this instruction for how to and who can clear repeat and recur discrepancies as well as the
   required actions of the aircraft debrief section.
       33.5.1.1. Individuals authorized to clear a repeat/recur and CND discrepancies must be
       documented on the Special Certification Roster (SCR).
       33.5.1.2. Maintenance work centers will ensure maintenance actions on CND
       discrepancies are supervised by a 7-level production inspector.

responsible for enforcing this chapter.
36.3. No Ground Guide Required. Before any vehicle listed below is started for backing
movement, the driver shall walk completely around the vehicle to verify clearance and determine
a visual clear distance with a ground reference point from the cab of the vehicle. The driver will
then sound the horn and back to the preselected ground reference point. Stop and repeat as
necessary until the desired vehicle position is obtained. The following vehicles will not require a
ground guide while backing:
   36.3.1. General purpose vehicles that have 360 degrees visibility (without using mirrors)
   36.3.2. Bobtail
   36.3.3. Forklift

   36.3.5. Flat Beds (If view is unobstructed)
   36.3.6. Pickups (If view is unobstructed)
36.4. Ground Guide Required. Before any vehicle listed below is started for backing
movement, a member of the crew or the driver must walk completely around the vehicle to
ensure no one or object is in danger from the vehicle’s movement. The ground guide will be
positioned at the front or rear corners of the vehicle and must remain in full view of the vehicle
operator anytime the vehicle is in motion. They should never be directly behind the vehicle.
The ground guide will not position themselves between the vehicle being guided and another
object where inadvertent engine surge or momentary loss of vehicle control could cause injury.
The vehicle horn will be sounded before any backing operation is started. Flashlight/wands will
be used when guiding a vehicle back at night. The following vehicles will require a ground
guide while backing:
   36.4.1. Multi Stop Trucks

Composite Tool Kit— A tool box or tool cabinet used to support small work centers (i.e.,
PMEL and Avionics Flight) that do not have a tool room. These tool kits are controlled in the
same manner as tool rooms and normally do not dispatch tools outside the work center.
Dispatchable Tool Kit— normally referred to as a composite tool kit (CTK), these kits are self
contained and are dispatchable outside the work center. Normally used in maintenance
operations to contain the tools required to accomplish specific maintenance tasks. These kits are
inventoried when issued to an individual from a tool room or composite tool kit and again upon
its return.
Fixant— Hold-down solution, consisting of either acrylic floor wax/water mixed in a 10:1 water
to wax ratio, or Polyacrylic Acid (i.e., PAA-Carboset XL-11)
Impoundment/Quarantine—A period of time for intensified and controlled aircraft
management.
Impoundment/Quarantine Authority—The 62 MXG/CC or designated representative may
direct impoundment/quarantine.
Master Inventory List— A MIL consists of a master inventory, McChord AFB IMT 140, CTK
Inventory and Control Log, and a McChord AFB IMT 146, Missing/Removed Tool Log.
Off-Shore Support— A process in which a part is needed from a McChord assigned aircraft for
an aircraft broke enroute at a non-G081 location. This JCN would be loaded by the McChord
MOC against the broke, off station aircraft using a 5300 series JCN. A normal CANN job would
be loaded on the aircraft the part is being CANN—ed from.
TC MAX—tool control program that replaces TAS (Tool Accountability System)
Tool Room— An area where tools, tool kits, and special equipment is stored, inspected, issued
and received.

                                    DEBRIEF CHECKLIST

NOTE: AFI21-101 AMCSUP CL3, C-17 Debriefing Checklist will be used in conjunction with
this Debrief Checklist.
NOTE: All Debrief personnel will be familiar with the following instructions: AFI 21-101; AFI
21-103; MAFBI 21-43, Chapters 14, 28, and 29; and C-17 Mission Essential Subsystems List.
NOTE: Local turns that call in A-1 or A-2 do not require debriefing, however, the debrief
personnel must keep in contact with MOC and/or Pro Super & Expediters in case the status
changes when the aircraft blocks in. If the aircraft calls in A-3, then proceed with the following
steps in this checklist.
A46.1. PRE-DEBRIEF
   A46.1.1. Obtain aircraft landing code/status and inbound time from MOC.
A46.1.2. Coordinate specialists as required with Pro Super/Expediter. Also, find out what type
of inspection is required to be put in the forms binder.
A46.2. DEBRIEFING THE FLIGHT CREW
   A46.2.1. Gather all information needed about the flight and the discrepancies on the
      Debrief Log.
   A46.2.2. Ensure the white and silver fuel cards are in the forms binder. If missing, inform
   the Pro-Super, annotate the discrepancy in the forms, and assign a JCN using G081.
   A46.2.3. Remove AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels/Ground Servicing Documentation Log,
   ensure all fuel receipts are accounted for and the appropriate crew member has filled out the
   forms properly, to include: aircraft tail number, aircraft MDS, day/month/year, refueling
   date, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes, squadron, airfield name,
   tanker tail number, and amount of fuel.
   A46.2.4. Fax all compressor stalls, bird strikes, and dropped objects worksheets to MOC
      and QA. If fax is unavailable, these forms need to be hand delivered.
   A46.2.5. Remove AFTO Form 781 from forms binder. Ensure forms are properly
   completed to include blocks 1 through 20 and block 39 of the AFTO Form 781 per TO
      00-20-1.
   A46.2.6. MISSION RETURN ONLY: Ask the aircrews if there were any AFTO 781A
      forms transcribed out in the system. If so, ensure they are present at debrief.
   A46.2.7. Debrief will ensure the aircrew has both Aircraft Diagnostic and Integrated Test
      System (ADITS) disks when the aircraft forms arrive at debrief.
   A46.2.8. Ensure aircraft commander has signed the ―Pilot Signature‖ in block 7 of the
      Flight Condition Data on the AFTO Form 781H.
   A46.2.9. Review the aircraft AFTO form 781A discrepancies thoroughly with the flight
      crew using AFI21-101 AMCSUP CL3, Debriefing Check sheet for C-17A aircraft, and
 202                                           MCCHORDAFBI21-43 22 DECEMBER 2009


   the TO 1C-17A-2-00FR-00-1 to ensure the fault codes are accurate. Once finished, assign
       JCNs to the discrepancies.
NOTE: At this point, debrief personnel may release the flight crew.
NOTE: For mission returns, go through all of the offshore discrepancies to make sure that they
are loaded in G081.
A46.3. POST-DEBRIEF
   A46.3.1. Review last 5 sorties for repeat/recur discrepancies utilizing AMC IMT 278s or
   automated debrief sortie recaps and mark as appropriate.
   A46.3.2. Load all discrepancies into G081, mark zone 99 for A-3 discrepancies.
   A46.3.3. Put the appropriate inspection package in the forms binder and assign JCNs. Also,
   load the inspection into G081 using the 9050 screen for thru-flights or the 9001 screen for
   basic post-flight/preflight (BPO/PR).
   A46.3.4. Load ADITS disks into G081
   A46.3.5. Return forms binder to aircraft.
   A46.3.6. Generate a new AMC IMT 278 (PRD) and file on the L Drive in appropriate
   location. Maintain these records for as long as prescribed in applicable guidance.
   A46.3.7. Load all offshore/local sortie discrepancies into G081.
   A46.3.8. Load AFTO 781 into G081 and ensure debrief initials are in the maintenance
   review block 37.
NOTE: If GO81 is offline, make 2 copies of the AFTO 781As and provide one copy to the
MOC.

           *E-TOOL 90-DAY INSPECTION AND CLEANING REQUIREMENTS

Figure A54.1. E-Tool 90-Day Inspection and Cleaning Requirements.
These inspection and cleaning requirements are intended to help maximize the service life of the equipment as well
as provide resolution to common issues that may be encountered.
    1.   E-Tool Case: Inspect for broken, loose or missing parts, fasteners, screws, cracks and damage.



    2.   Port/dust covers: Inspect for broken, loose, cracked or missing covers.



    3.   Keyboard: Inspect for broken or missing keys. If installed inspect keyboard cover for cracks, damage, and
         serviceability.



    4.   Carrying Handle: Inspect for broken, loose or missing parts, fasteners, screws, cracks, damage and
         serviceability.



    5.   Screen Housing: Inspect for cracks and damage around the housing. Also check for loose or missing
         screws.



    6.   Screen: Inspect for cracks and damage.



    7.   Screen Cleaning: With proper usage and cleaning, the E-Tool display will last the anticipated life of the
         product in the field (3 to 5 years) without significant changes in view ability or function. Key to achieving
         this performance is proper cleaning of the screen.



         NEVER SPRAY WATER OR CLEANING SOLUTIONS DIRECTLY ON THE E-TOOL.
         ALWAYS USE AN APPROVED CLEANING CLOTH.



             a.   For mild cleaning tasks, always use the provided micro-fiber cleaning cloth; tougher contaminates
                  such as oily fingerprints may require light dampening with clean water. Plain water in
                  combination with the cleaning cloth will be effective for most contaminants, and should always be
                  tried before stronger solutions are considered.
             b.   For tougher cleaning tasks a mixture of Isopropyl alcohol and water (50/50) used in combination
                  with the cleaning cloth will be effective and will not damage the Touch Screen surface.
             c.   NEVER use paper products such as paper towels or wipes to clean the display surface. Paper
                  products are abrasive and will act like fine sandpaper when used on the screen surface. This can
                  cause damage to the screen surface and the anti-glare coating.

    8.   Keyboard Cover Cleaning:
            a.   For mild cleaning tasks, always use the provided micro-fiber cleaning cloth; tougher contaminates
                 such as oily fingerprints may require light dampening with clean water. Plain water in
                 combination with the cleaning cloth will be effective for most contaminants, and should always be
                 tried before stronger solutions are considered.
            b.   For tougher cleaning tasks a mixture of Isopropyl alcohol and water (50/50) used in combination
                 with the cleaning cloth will be effective.
