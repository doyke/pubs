                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction applies to all Air Force units operating RC-26B aircraft. It supplements,
and should not repeat, information already published in the parent AFI. It provides guidelines for RC-26B
operations and applies to RC-26B aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of the
RC-26B. Any changes to referenced Air Force instructions supersede this instruction. Copies of this pub-
lication will be current and available to planning staffs from headquarters to aircrew level.

1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to all aircrew operating USAF RC-26B aircraft. The Air National
Guard (ANG) is considered a MAJCOM for the purpose of this AFI.

1.3. Aircrew Responsibility. This volume, in conjunction with other governing directives, prescribes
operating procedures for the RC-26B under most circumstances. It is not to be used as a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accom-
plished if they safely enhance mission accomplishment.

1.4. Key Words Explained.
   1.4.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.4.2. “Should” is used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.4.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.4.4. “Note” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., that are considered essential to empha-
   size.

1.5. Deviations. Deviations from the procedures outlined in this AFI require specific approval of the
ANG/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates otherwise. In such cases, the Air-
craft Commander will take the appropriate action necessary to safely recover the aircraft and crew. Report
all deviations through the chain of command to the ANG office of primary responsibility (OPR).

1.6. Waivers. Waiver requests shall be forwarded through the appropriate channels to the ANG/A3 for
approval. The OPR is responsible for maintaining copies of approved waivers. A list of current waivers is
in Attachment 2 of this publication.

1.7. Supplement Procedures. This document is a basic directive. Units shall publish local procedures as
Chapter 10 of this AFI. Local procedures will not duplicate, alter, amend, or be less restrictive than the
provisions of this AFI. All units will forward a copy to MAJCOM (ANG/A3O) for validation.

                                                 Chapter 2

                                     COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. Wing Commander. The Wing Commander is the primary command authority for the administra-
tive, operational, and logistical control of the assigned aircraft and aircrew. The Wing Commander is
responsible for aircrew training, standardization, evaluation, safety, and security.

2.2. Aircraft Commander. An Aircraft Commander (AC) shall be designated for all flights on the flight
authorizations according to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. The AC is the Pilot in Command (PIC)
and may be either an instrument qualified pilot (FP) or mission qualified pilot (MP) depending on the type
of mission being flown. The aircraft commander is:
    2.2.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
    2.2.2. Responsible for the welfare of the crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
    2.2.3. Responsible for the safe operation and security of the aircraft.
    2.2.4. The final decision authority for issues affecting the crew, the aircraft, or the mission.
    2.2.5. Responsible for command and control (C2) status reporting (when a deployed mission com-
    mander is not available).

2.3. Mission Commander. A Mission Commander (MC) will be designated by the Aircraft Commander.
The MC will be a member of the crew that is current, qualified and highly experienced in the mission.
Although not required, the MC may also be the designated Aircraft Commander. The duties for the MC
are as follows:
    2.3.1. Overall responsibility for mission planning and execution. Will review mission package and
    ensure coordination with involved agencies.
    2.3.2. Should delegate duties to mission aircrew, but is the final authority responsible for ensuring air-
    crews have properly coordinated all mission details.

2.4. Deployed Mission Commander. When two or more aircraft are operating together to accomplish a
specific mission, a Deployed Mission Commander (DMC) will be designated through the appropriate
chain of command. The DMC is responsible for overall mission coordination, mission execution, status
reporting, and personnel supervision.

2.5. Mission Clearance Decision. The AC is ultimately responsible for the safe conduct of the mission.
If the AC determines it is not safe to commence or continue a mission:
    2.5.1. The mission will not depart or continue until conditions have been corrected or improved so
    that the mission can operate safely.
    2.5.2. Another AC and aircrew will not be tasked to take the same mission under the same conditions.

2.6. Operational Command and Control (C2) Reporting. All units will establish C2 reporting proce-
dures and requirements in local Chapter 10.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                      9


2.7. Command and Control (C2) Agency Telephone Numbers. Units should publish a listing of tele-
phone numbers to assist crews in coordinating mission requirements through appropriate C2 agencies.
This information should be made readily available to aircrews.
10                                                                     AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


                                                 Chapter 3

                                         CREW MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crew members, or those occupying a primary position during flight,
must be qualified or in training for qualification for that crew position. If non-current, or in training for a
particular event, the crew member must be under the direct supervision of a current and qualified instruc-
tor for that crew position while accomplishing that event.
     3.1.1. Transportation Missions. For transportation missions, or missions not involving sensor
     employment, the crew shall consist of at least one FP and one instrument qualified copilot (FC).
     3.1.2. Sensor Missions. For missions involving sensor employment, the crew shall consist of at least
     one MP, one mission qualified copilot (MC), and one mission qualified navigator who performs duties
     as a mission systems operator (MSO).
     3.1.3. During straight and level flight, one pilot may leave the duty station for brief periods to meet
     physiological needs and to perform normal crew duties.

3.2. Crew Complement. The crew complement of the RC-26B consists of two qualified pilots and one
qualified MSO as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual. The crewmembers required will depend on
the type of mission being flown. A mission crew shall consist of the following:
     3.2.1. Transportation Missions. For transportation missions, or missions not involving sensor
     employment, the crew shall consist of at least one FP and one FC or one instructor pilot (IP) and an
     upgrading pilot (UP).
     3.2.2. Sensor Missions. For missions involving sensor employment, the crew shall consist of at least
     one mission qualified pilot (MP), one mission qualified copilot (MC), and one qualified MSO. An
     upgrading pilot, or MSO in mission qualification training (MQT), may be substituted when directly
     supervised by an instructor.

3.3. Augmented Crews. Augmented crews are not authorized.

3.4. Alert Procedures. Aircrews shall not remain on alert for more than 72 consecutive hours. If alerted,
standard flight duty periods and post-mission crew rest limitations apply. Crewmembers shall be released
from alert for a minimum of 24 hours before resuming alert status. Units shall publish local alerting pro-
cedures in Chapter 10.

3.5. Flight Duty Period (FDP). The maximum FDP is 16 hours. However, the maximum FDP shall be
limited to 12 hours for the following:
     3.5.1. Both autopilots are inoperative.
     3.5.2. Functional check flights (FCFs).
     3.5.3. Flight evaluations.
     3.5.4. Emergency procedures training.
     3.5.5. Touch-and-go training.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                               11


   3.5.6. Initial/Upgrade Training

3.6. Fatigue Management. The maximum FDP listed above sets broad guidelines and is meant to give
commanders and aircrew maximum flexibility for mission accomplishment. It does not mandate mission
durations, nor does it infer recommended scheduling procedures. When scheduling mission durations, an
operational risk management (ORM) assessment shall be conducted in accordance with AFI 90-901,
Operational Risk Management. Several factors should be considered. These include, but are not limited
to: mission requirements, long-term aircrew welfare, aircrew experience level, weather, threats, time of
day, and fatigue. Continuous operations in excess of 14 hours increase the risk of cumulative fatigue. To
combat cumulative fatigue, the following procedures shall apply:
   3.6.1. Aircrews are allowed controlled cockpit rest as specified in AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   3.6.2. It is the AC’s responsibility to terminate a mission if safety may be compromised by fatigue
   factors, regardless of authorized FDP.
   3.6.3. Aircrews should receive additional crew rest for deployments spanning several time zones
   (e.g., OCONUS deployments).

3.7. Flight Duty Period (FDP) Extension. To compensate for unplanned mission delays, the AC may
extend the maximum FDP up to 2 hours provided the mission requirements justify the risk and the AC is
unable to contact the waiver authority. This does not apply to CONUS counterdrug missions.

3.8. Crew Rest. MAJCOM/DO, in this case ANG/A3, may waive all or any part of a crew rest period in
accordance with AFI 11-202V3. Crew members will enter crew rest a minimum of 12 hours before report
time.
   3.8.1. Minimum crew rest period is 12 hours. This period provides the crew a minimum of 8 hours of
   uninterrupted rest plus time for transportation, free time and meals. The crew will not be disturbed
   during this period, except during emergencies. Should the 12 hour crew rest period be infringed upon
   by official duties, the crew will enter crew rest for an additional 12 hours on completion of the official
   duties.
   3.8.2. Crew members will not be considered in crew rest during civilian employment.
   3.8.3. Post Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). Crewmembers returning to their home base will be given
   sufficient time to recover from the cumulative effects of their deployed mission and tend to personal
   needs. PMCR begins immediately upon mission termination.
       3.8.3.1. Provide one hour of PMCR time (up to a maximum of 96 hours) for each 3 hours TDY
       when the duty exceeds 16 hours away from home station. PMCR is not applicable to continuing
       missions.
       3.8.3.2. The Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) or acting representative is designated
       PMCR waiver authority and will not delegate this authority. Limit PMCR waivers to extraordinary
       circumstances only and must not be used for day-to-day operations.

3.9. Interfly. Interfly is the exchange of aircrew members between units. The OG/CC, or his designated
representative, is the approval authority. The Program Manager (PM) is responsible for ensuring all per-
sons are current and qualified for the type of mission being flown.

3.10. Orientation and Incentive Flights.
     3.10.1. For non-CD orientation or incentive flights comply with AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
     3.10.2. Incentive flights involving law enforcement agents (LEAs) require the state’s Counterdrug
     Coordinator (CDC) approval, or his representative, in addition to paragraph 3.10.1. This authority
     may be delegated in writing to the PM.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                             13


                                                Chapter 4

                            AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft for
launch with all equipment fully mission capable (FMC). Manpower limitations, skills, and spare part
availability can have a negative and direct impact on accomplishment. However, some redundant systems
allow safe operation with less than all equipment operational for certain missions under specific circum-
stances. The aircraft commander, using the following procedures, determines an aircraft’s overall status.
   4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). An item, system, or subsystem component failure or degradation
   essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion will be designated ME by the aircraft com-
   mander on AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Include a brief
   explanation of the reason for ME status in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. An aircraft com-
   mander accepting an aircraft (one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not
   commit that aircraft commander (or a different aircraft commander) to subsequent operations with the
   same item or system inoperative.
   4.1.2. Mission Capable (MC). Any discrepancies not currently ME, but may become ME (if circum-
   stances change), are designated as MC in the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. Every effort will
   be made to clear the MC discrepancies at the earliest opportunity to the extent that maintenance skills,
   ground time, and spare part availability permit. If subsequently, in the AC’s judgment, mission safety
   would be compromised by the lack of any component, he or she may re-designate the component as
   ME. However, do not delay a mission to correct a MC discrepancy.
   4.1.3. Open Item. Discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the current mission or any subse-
   quent missions are not designated MC or ME. These items receive low priority and are normally
   worked at home station. Do not accept an aircraft from factories, modification centers, or depots
   unless all instruments are installed and operative.

4.2. Procedural Guidance. See T.O. 1RC-26B-1, Flight Manual and this instruction for the equipment
and systems considered essential for routine as well as contingency operations.
   4.2.1. The aircraft commander is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure no air-
   craft is dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an unsafe degradation and or an
   undue increase in crew workload. The possibility of additional failures during continued operation
   with inoperative systems or components shall also be considered. This chapter is not intended to allow
   for continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with inoperative systems or subsystems.

4.3. Minimum Equipment List (MEL). The equipment listed in T.O. 1RC-26B-1, Chapter 5, must be
installed and operable for the types of operations indicated. Approval for one-time flights with inoperable
equipment may be granted by ANG/A3 after maintenance release. Coordination should be accomplished
through the local Quality Assurance (QA) office.

4.4. Minimum Essential Subsystem List (MESL). The MESL is used for contract purposes between
the government and civilian contractors for establishing fully mission capable (FMC), partial mission
capable (PMC), and not mission capable (NMC) criteria for aircraft systems. The MESL is not intended
as a GO-NO-GO list. The AC will not use the MESL to determine their acceptance or rejection of the air-
craft for flight.

                       OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND RESTRICTIONS

5.1. Checklist Procedures. The pilot flying (PF) will call for, and the pilot not flying (PNF) will accom-
plish, the appropriate checklist. Challenge and response will be used for appropriate checklist items.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the flight
manual, etc., are authorized. Upon completion of all checklist items, the PNF will call checklist complete.
Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be added.

5.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during flight. (EXCEP-
TION: Unqualified pilots undergoing qualification training and senior staff members who have com-
pleted the senior staff familiarization course, both under the direct supervision of an IP may be in control
of the aircraft.) The aircraft commander and copilot will be at their duty stations during all takeoffs,
departures, approaches, and landings. During other phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their duty
station for brief periods to meet physiological needs and to perform normal crew duties. Only one pilot
may be absent from the duty station at a time.

5.3. Takeoff and Landing. After thoroughly evaluating all conditions (comfort level; weather; type of
approach to be flown; and crewmember experience), the aircraft commander will determine who accom-
plishes the takeoff and landing and will occupy either the left or the right seat during all takeoffs and land-
ings.
     5.3.1. A qualified aircraft commander will accomplish all approaches and landings under actual
     emergency conditions unless specific conditions dictate otherwise.

5.4. Landing Gear and Flap Operation Policy. Under normal and most emergency situations landing
gear and flap actuation will be verbally coordinated with the other pilot.

5.5. Seatbelts.
     5.5.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seatbelt. Use of seatbelts will be as directed by
     the aircraft commander and the flight manual. (Separate flotation devices and oxygen sources are
     required.)
     5.5.2. Crewmembers occupying pilot and copilot positions will have seatbelts fastened at all times in
     flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
     5.5.3. All crewmembers will be seated with seatbelts and shoulder harnesses fastened during taxi,
     takeoff, and landing, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Additionally, anytime the seat belt advisory
     sign is illuminated, crewmembers will be seated with seat belt and shoulder harness fastened, unless
     crew duties dictate otherwise. Crewmembers performing duties in the passenger seats are exempt
     from shoulder harness requirements.

5.6. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
     5.6.1. Pilot-rated senior officers (O-6 select and above) who desire to fly on the aircraft, but are not
     fully mission qualified, must be under the supervision of an instructor pilot and must have a current
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                                 15


   instrument refresher course (IRC) and instrument evaluation. Include the senior officer on the flight
   authorization.
   5.6.2. Non-rated senior officers who desire to fly may occupy a pilot seat during non-critical phases
   of flight when under the direct supervision of an instructor pilot and no passengers onboard.

5.7. Flights with Passengers. For flights with passengers, both pilots must be instrument qualified and
current (unless regaining currency under the direct supervision of an IP). This restriction does not apply to
additional crewmembers (ACM) or mission essential ground personnel (MEGP). Additional training
restrictions are listed in Chapter 8.

5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, the flight manual, applicable T.O.s,
and Attachment 2.2.

5.9. Smoking Restrictions. Smoking is prohibited on board the aircraft.

5.10. Passenger Information Guides. Printed passenger guides must be available to all passengers.
Printed guides are not a substitute for verbal briefings.

5.11. Passenger Manifests. All passengers (including LEAs, LNOs, and contract maintenance person-
nel) will be manifested prior to flight. This information is confidential and is not to be released without
approval of the PM. Units may use locally generated forms. Maintain manifests at the C2 facility respon-
sible for flight following.

5.12. Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO). Onload/Off load with the left engine operating is
prohibited. Ensure the left propeller has stopped completely before the door is opened. A crewmember
shall be positioned on the ground to direct passengers away from the danger areas of the aircraft.

5.13. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. The wearing of wigs, hairpieces, and personal jew-
elry (e.g., barrettes, pins, clips, etc.) are permitted provided the items do not create a FOD hazard. In addi-
tion, to minimize the possibility of FOD:
   5.13.1. The passengers should be thoroughly briefed about FOD hazards.
   5.13.2. During preflight, ensure the area in the immediate vicinity of the aircraft is clear of any poten-
   tial FOD material.
   5.13.3. Exercise caution during engine running on-loads and off-loads (EROs).
   5.13.4. Avoid taxiing with the propellers over unprepared or unswept surfaces.
   5.13.5. Use the minimum power necessary for all taxi operations.

5.14. Aircraft Refueling. Passengers are not allowed on board the aircraft during refueling operations.
All aircraft electrical systems should be turned off.

5.15. Reverse Taxi. Both pilot positions will be occupied by qualified personnel IAW AFI 11-218, Air-
craft Operations and Movement on the Ground. The pilot will coordinate with the marshaller or ground
16                                                                   AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


personnel prior to reverse taxi for aircraft positioning. Reverse taxi without wing walkers is not autho-
rized.

5.16. Taxi Obstruction Clearance. Reference AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
Ground.

5.17. Runway Requirements. The AC is responsible for ensuring takeoff and landing (TOLD) data is
properly computed. In addition to the restrictions listed in the aircraft performance manual, comply with
the following:
     5.17.1. Minimum runway width is 60 feet.
     5.17.2. Minimum runway length for takeoff is 5000 feet.
     5.17.3. Do not land at an airfield from which a takeoff cannot be safely executed (this does not apply
     to emergency situations).

5.18. Runway Condition Reading (RCR). Runway condition is usually reported using either RCR (at
military fields), or Braking Action (at civilian fields). Since the RC-26B performance charts use RCR, a
reported braking action must be converted to an RCR value. The conversion values can be found in T.O.
1RC-26B-1-1, page 4A-1. Comply with the following restrictions:
     5.18.1. If neither RCR nor Braking Action values are reported, use RCR 12 for wet runways and RCR
     6 for icy runways.
     5.18.2. Jeppesen’s Aircraft Data Chart provides maximum takeoff gross weights for different RCR
     values (23,18,12, and 4). This chart should be used to determine maximum gross weights for different
     runway conditions.

5.19. Wind Restrictions. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and landing when
winds (including gusts) exceed one of the following:
     5.19.1. Maximum operating wind - 50 knots.
     5.19.2. Maximum crosswind component - 25 knots.
     5.19.3. Maximum tailwind component - 10 knots.

5.20. Takeoff and Landing Policy.
     5.20.1. The AC may occupy either the left or right seat and shall accomplish all approaches and land-
     ings under actual emergency conditions (unless circumstances dictate otherwise).
     5.20.2. The co-pilot will occupy the right seat unless enrolled in a formal AC upgrade training pro-
     gram. During such training, the co-pilot may occupy the left seat when under direct supervision of an
     IP.

5.21. Minimum VFR Altitude. The minimum altitude during VFR operations is 1000 feet AGL. This
does not apply to operations in the terminal area or tactical arrivals.

5.22. Minimum Airspeed.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                              17


   5.22.1. Approach Airspeeds.
       5.22.1.1. Approach Speed. Target approach airspeed is Vref plus 10 knots.
       5.22.1.2. Threshold Speed. In calm winds, as the aircraft approaches the runway, slow the aircraft
       to cross the runway threshold at Vref (in accordance with the Performance Manual). Vref is 1.3
       Vs.
       5.22.1.3. Touchdown Speed. Touchdown below Vref (in accordance with the Performance Man-
       ual). Recommend touchdown at Vref minus 8 knots, which is approximately 1.2 Vs.
       5.22.1.4. Gust Factor. In gusty winds, add the full gust factor (up to 20 knots) to approach, thresh-
       old, and touchdown speeds. Consider effect on landing distance.
   5.22.2. Mission Airspeeds. The RC-26B is routinely employed at low to medium altitudes and mis-
   sion effectiveness will often require sustained aircraft operations at or near final approach airspeeds
   for a given flap setting.
       5.22.2.1. During low speed mission profiles the pilot not flying is the primary monitor of aircraft
       airspeed and altitude and will advise the pilot flying of any airspeed or altitude deviations.
       5.22.2.2. Approach airspeed for a given flap setting should be used initially to determine target
       airspeed.
       5.22.2.3. The target airspeed will be cross-checked against the angle of attack and refined. At no
       time shall an aircraft continuously maintain airspeed below Vs 1.3.

5.23. Formation Flights. Formation flights and flights in close proximity to other aircraft are prohibited,
with the following exceptions:
   5.23.1. Operational test and evaluation (OT&E) flights.
   5.23.2. Developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) flights.
   5.23.3. Special flights authorized by the ANG/A3.

5.24. Night Approaches. An instrument approach procedure, if available, should be flown while operat-
ing in night VMC.

5.25. IFR VFR on Top. Aircrews are authorized to fly VFR on top if mission requirements dictate.

5.26. Prohibited Maneuvers. The following maneuvers are prohibited:
   5.26.1. Practice aborted takeoffs.
   5.26.2. Intentional stalls/spins.
   5.26.3. Unusual attitudes.
   5.26.4. Runaway pitch trim or excessive yaw demonstrations.
   5.26.5. Maneuvering in excess of 60 degrees of bank.
   5.26.6. Actual engine shutdowns. This does not apply to FCF or formal upgrade training flights.

5.27. Aircrew Communications. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to aircrews
regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high
degree of professionalism and crew coordination at all times. Good communication is essential to suc-
cessful mission accomplishment. Therefore, comply with the following procedures:
     5.27.1. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission accomplishment during
     taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000 feet MSL (except cruise).
     5.27.2. While at their primary duty station, crewmembers will monitor cockpit at all times.
     5.27.3. Crewmembers will inform the aircraft commander when checking on or off interphone.
     5.27.4. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement “Time Out”.
        5.27.4.1. “Time out” is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of
        “time out” will:
            5.27.4.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
            5.27.4.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
            5.27.4.1.3. Notify all crewmembers that someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
            established guidelines or the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable with
            the developing conditions.
        5.27.4.2. As soon as possible after a “time out” has been called, the aircrew will take the follow-
        ing actions:
            5.27.4.2.1. Stabilize the aircraft.
            5.27.4.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice his or her concerns to the crew.
            5.27.4.2.3. The aircraft commander will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity
            to voice inputs relative to the stated concerns.
            5.27.4.2.4. After considering all inputs, the aircraft commander will direct the aircrew to con-
            tinue the current course of action or direct a new course of action. NOTE: The aircraft com-
            mander is the final decision authority.

5.28. Advisory Calls. Advisory calls are used to help the pilots maintain situational awareness. This is
especially important during critical phases of flight. Any crewmember noting a condition, which may
affect the safety of the flight, will immediately notify the pilot flying the aircraft. In addition, the follow-
ing advisory calls are mandatory:
     5.28.1. Pilot Flying (PF):
        5.28.1.1. Acknowledge all advisory calls.
        5.28.1.2. Confirm all new altitude assignments and altimeter settings with the PNF.
        5.28.1.3. At decision height for a precision approach, or no later than the MAP for a non-precision
        approach the pilot flying will announce “landing” if intention is to land the aircraft, or “going
        around” if intention to is to go missed approach.
     5.28.2. Pilot-Not-Flying (PNF):
        5.28.2.1. Takeoff.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                                19


           5.28.2.1.1. “80 knots” for airspeed indicator verification during the takeoff roll.
           5.28.2.1.2. “V1-Rotate” at V1/VR.
NOTE: If a safety of flight malfunction is noted prior to V1 any crewmember shall state, “ABORT,”
along with a brief description of the malfunction (e.g., “ABORT, left engine failure”).
       5.28.2.2. Altitude Calls.
           5.28.2.2.1. One thousand feet above initial approach fix altitude (IAF) or holding altitude.
           5.28.2.2.2. Transition altitude/level.

           altitude.
           5.28.2.3.2. Non-precision Approaches.
               5.28.2.3.2.1. “Minimums” at MDA.
               5.28.2.3.2.2. “Runway in sight” when the runway environment is in sight.
               5.28.2.3.2.3. “Go Around” at missed approach point (MAP) if the runway environment is
               not in sight or if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing. The PF will advise the
               crew of his intentions.
           5.28.2.3.3. Precision Approaches.
               5.28.2.3.3.1. “Land” at DH if the runway environment is in sight and in a position for a
               safe landing. The PF will advise the crew of his intentions.
               5.28.2.3.3.2. “Go-around.” Call at DH if the runway environment is not in sight or if the
               aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing.
       5.28.2.4. Landing Rollout.
           5.28.2.4.1. 90 knots or applicable maximum reverse power airspeed.
           5.28.2.4.2. Two betas when both beta lights illuminate.
   5.28.3. Deviations:
       5.28.3.1. The PNF will advise the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed or altitude
       is more than 100 feet from desired and no attempt is being made to correct the deviation.
       5.28.3.2. Any crewmember observing a variation of 200 feet of altitude, a deviation of 10 knots
       below target airspeed, or a potential terrain/obstruction conflict will immediately notify the PF.
       5.28.3.3. Any deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will be
       announced.

5.29. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. The potential for bird strikes will vary depend-
ing on geographic location and time of year. Therefore, each unit must be familiar with local bird activity
20                                                                      AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


and migration patterns. Units shall use the standard Bird Watch Condition Codes listed in AFPAM
91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Management Techniques, Attachment 1. In addition, comply
with the following restrictions:
     5.29.1. Bird Watch Condition LOW: No operating restrictions.
     5.29.2. Bird Watch Condition MODERATE: Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when
     departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Training in the local traffic pattern is prohibited.
     5.29.3. Bird Watch Condition SEVERE: All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Waiver authority is
     the OG/CC or equivalent.

5.30. Functional Check Flights. A functional check flight (FCF) is used to determine aircraft airworthi-
ness. Maintenance actions requiring FCFs can be found in T.O. 1RC-26B-6CF-1. Comply with the fol-
lowing:
     5.30.1. FCFs will be accomplished by highly qualified instructor or Stan/Eval pilots; they will be des-
     ignated FCF qualified by the OG/CC in a letter.
     5.30.2. FCF flights will be conducted under day VMC. However, the OG/CC may authorize a flight
     under a combination of VFR, IFR, and “VFR on Top” conditions. The flight will begin in VFR condi-
     tions; if the aircraft and all systems are operating properly, it may proceed IFR to penetrate cloud
     cover to VFR on top to continue the altitude phase of the flight.
     5.30.3. Minimum altitude for engine shutdown is 5000 feet AGL or 5000 feet above any cloud deck
     when operating VFR on top.

5.31. Participation in Aerial Events. RC-26B aircraft may not participate in aerial events or public
static displays without prior approval from the OG/CC and the state’s CDC (or equivalent). If approved,
follow guidance in AFI 11-209 and ANGSUP 1, Air Force Aerial Events.

   6.7.2. Airfield Security. When departing on missions destined outside the CONUS, ACs should
   review applicable MAJCOM security publications.
   6.7.3. Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR). Air Mobility Command provides the
   ASRR for various tanker and airlift aircraft. While it does not contain RC-26B specific aircraft infor-
   mation, it does contain information that may be helpful to RC-26B aircrews. This includes general air-
   field information, information regarding operations in specific areas of responsibility (AORs), and
   important phone numbers. Aircrews should refer to the ASRR for all operations at airfields outside the
   contiguous US and unfamiliar CONUS airfields. The website address is:
   https://www.afd.scott.af.mil/.

6.8. Briefing Requirements.
   6.8.1. AC’s Crew Briefing. Cover all applicable items to include MAJCOM, NAF, and unit special
   interest items (SIIs), when applicable.
24                                                                      AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


     6.8.2. Mission Briefings. Prior to all missions the AC will conduct a mission briefing. Items covered
     will vary depending upon the mission type and location; each unit will develop a Mission Briefing
     Guide tailored to their operations. At minimum the following topics will be briefed:
        6.8.2.1. Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), if operating under VFR.
        6.8.2.2. Security/Threat Assessment.
        6.8.2.3. Risk Assessment.
        6.8.2.4. Emergency Procedures.
        6.8.2.5. Hazards associated with human factors, ORM risks, and mitigating factors.
        6.8.2.6. Items directed in Chapter 10.
     6.8.3. Weather Briefings. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Obtain a briefing
     on current weather, trends, and forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The AC
     will ensure a weather briefing is obtained for all flights and all aircrew are briefed accordingly prior to
     departure. If the flight will transit non-Air Force bases, crews must make arrangements to ensure ade-
     quate weather support facilities and services are available. If adequate services are not available,
     crews will obtain weather support through any means available to ensure required weather data is in
     their possession prior to mission accomplishment. When face-to-face briefings are not possible,
     obtain a telephone weather briefing.
        6.8.3.1. Obtain weather information from US Military weather services, any FAA-approved
        weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
NOTE: Not all Internet weather providers (including those maintained by the federal government) are
FAA certified. To qualify, agencies must be certified under the FAA’s Quality Internet Communication
Provider (QICP) program (reference FAA Advisory Circular 00-62).

6.9. Call Signs.
     6.9.1. Training/Counterdrug Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a
     2-digit suffix assigned by the parent unit. Law enforcement call signs may also be used when operat-
     ing with the corresponding agency (i.e. DEA, FBI, aircraft call signs).
     6.9.2. Operational Missions. Aircraft will use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
     clearance. If no call sign has been assigned to the mission, use unit static call sign.

6.10. Flight Logs. The following types of flight logs are approved for use by RC-26B aircrews:
     6.10.1. Computer-based.
     6.10.2. Manually computed.
     6.10.3. Flight plans stored in the Flight Management System (FMS).
     6.10.4. Local flight plan forms are authorized provided they contain the minimum information
     required by the controlling agency.

6.11. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent possible
without unacceptable mission degradation. This does not preclude VFR to maintain proficiency or to
accomplish mission essential VFR operations.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                             25


6.12. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217 Instrument Flight Procedures, this
chapter and appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
   6.12.1. Gross Weight (GW). Ensure that the aircraft does not exceed the maximum GW, zero fuel
   weight, or center of gravity limitations specified in the aircraft flight manual. GW may be further
   restricted by operating conditions such as, icing, temperature, runway length and slope, departure
   maneuvering, required climb gradients, and obstacles.
   6.12.2. It is the AC’s responsibility to ensure the aircraft can meet or exceed all published climb gra-
   dients.
   6.12.3. IFR. For IFR operations, comply with AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 8.7. guidance and the follow-
   ing:
      6.12.3.1. Determine the two-engine climb gradient. The RC-26B Performance Manual does not
      contain a Two-Engine Climb Gradient Chart; therefore, convert the vertical velocity (VVI) in the
      respective Two-Engine Best Rate of Climb Chart to a climb gradient. To fly a constant climb gra-
      dient, pilots must fly a groundspeed. To convert a VVI to a climb gradient, use the following for-
      mula: (VVI x 60) / (groundspeed x 100). Note: The RC-26B is military version of a Metro 23
      certified under FAR Part 23. When operating the RC-26B in accordance with TO 1C-26B-1-1 Per-
      formance Manual, FAR 23.65 guarantees a minimum climb gradient of 4.0% (240 ft/nm) with
      two-engines operating.
      6.12.3.2. Determine the single engine climb gradient. Jeppesen Takeoff Charts and Special
      Engine Out Procedures are the primary Special Departure Procedures (SDP) for the RC-26B and
      will be used as the primary method for One Engine Inoperative (OEI) departure planning. If
      Jeppesen data is not available, use the Performance Manual to determine if the single engine
      climb gradient meets or exceeds the required IFR climb gradient. Local RC-26B Standardization
      and Evaluation will ensure that all pilots are qualified in the use of Jeppesen data and procedures.
      Do not exceed the maximum gross weight listed in the Jeppesen Takeoff Charts.
   6.12.4. VFR. For VFR operations, comply with the following:
      6.12.4.1. If obstacles are present, do not exceed the maximum gross weight listed in the Jeppesen
      Takeoff Charts. If an engine failure occurs during the takeoff, aircrews should follow the Jeppesen
      Special Engine Out Procedure.
      6.12.4.2. If obstacles are present and Jeppesen Data is not available, the aircraft must be able to
      fly the published IFR departure procedure or maintain obstacle clearance VMC with one engine
      inoperative.
   6.12.5. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
26                                                                     AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006

                      RVR 1200,      For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must
                      ¼ SM, or       read a minimum of 1200 RVR on all transmissometers. RVR is
Operational
                      370 m          prevailing over visibility. For RVR less than 1600, centerline lighting
                                     must be on and operational and the crew must be fully qualified.




NOTE: When weather is below approach minimums (ceiling or visibility) a takeoff alternate is required.
     6.12.6. Departure Alternates. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or visibility is below landing
     minimums for an available approach (at departure aerodrome). When a departure alternate is required,
     the aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstacle clearance altitude
     (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using one engine out performance criteria. To qualify
     as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
        6.12.6.1. Existing weather at an alternate within 30 minutes flying time must be equal to or better
        than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in
        no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
        6.12.6.2. The existing weather at an alternate within 1 hour flying time must be at least 500-1
        above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but in no case lower than 600-2 for a
        precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour
        after estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the alternate.
     6.12.7. Fuel Planning. Table 6.3. is for planning purposes only. It is to be used as a planning tool for
     aircrews and mission planners. The numbers are derived from T.O. 1RC-26B-1-1, Figure 2I-14
     (16,000 pounds, ISA, 97% RPM). Actual fuel requirements may differ (due to changes in gross
     weight, temperature, true airspeed, winds, etc.). Consult the performance manual for exact numbers.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                            27

         2. Based on long-range cruise airspeed.
            The specific range is rounded to the nearest 5 nm per 100 lbs of fuel.
         3. Based on a holding airspeed of 200 KTAS.
            The fuel flow is rounded to the nearest 100 lbs.
         4.     Based on 180 KTAS at 5,000 feet MSL. (15 minutes for the instrument approach procedure,
               and 10 minutes for the missed approach procedure.)

Section 6D—Enroute

6.13. Equal Time Points (ETPs). During extended over water operations, the AC shall compute:
   6.13.1. Two engine ETP (at cruising altitude and groundspeed).
   6.13.2. Single engine ETP using max range single engine groundspeed at 10,000 feet MSL or single
   engine service ceiling (whichever is lower). This is a conservative calculation that takes into account
   both a possible depressurization and a single engine condition.
NOTE: Attachment 3 shows how to calculate ETPs.

6.14. Adverse Weather Avoidance.
   6.14.1. Plan and fly all missions to avoid areas of known or forecast severe weather including severe
   icing or severe turbulence, which may exceed aircraft limitations.
   6.14.2. During flight, use any means available to avoid thunderstorms by at least:
         6.14.2.1. At or above FL230 - 20 NM.
         6.14.2.2. Below FL230 – 10 NM.
28                                                                      AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


NOTE: Takeoffs and landings may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10 NM, but no
closer than 5 NM, as long as the pilot maintains VMC and the thunderstorm is not observed to be moving
in the aircraft’s direction of flight.
     6.14.3. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing or severe turbulence is prohibited.
     6.14.4. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most favorable for lightning strikes and
     prolonged flight in them should be avoided when feasible:
        6.14.4.1. Within 5,000 feet of the freezing level.
        6.14.4.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with thunderstorm
        activity.

6.15. In-flight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations from directives that may occur as a result of
an emergency IAW AFI 11-202V3.
     6.15.1. Single Engine Considerations. The AC will ensure there is enough fuel available to continue
     to a suitable airfield, should an engine failure occur. Compute fuel burn at 10,000 feet MSL or single
     engine service ceiling (whichever is lower).
     6.15.2. Single Engine Drift Down. Some operations over mountainous regions require minimum
     enroute altitudes that are higher than the airplane’s single engine service ceiling. In those cases, an
     adequate margin of safety may be obtained by cruising at an altitude higher than the minimum IFR
     altitude so as to allow drift down to the single engine service ceiling in the event of an engine failure.
     Drift down cruise during single engine operation would result in reaching the end of the route segment
     at an altitude equal to or greater than the minimum IFR altitude. The AC will ensure the aircraft can
     maintain the minimum IFR altitude for the entire route of flight with one engine inoperative (reference
     T.O. 1RC-26B-1-1, p. 3A-1).

Section 6E—Arrival

6.16. Descent. Prior to descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts (Operational Navigation
Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint Operations Graphic
(JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions.
     6.16.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night or
     during marginal weather unless on an instrument training flight or check ride in which case fly
     approaches necessary to complete training or evaluation requirements. If a precision approach is not
     available, fly any available approved instrument approach. During night VFR conditions, if an
     approved instrument approach is not available, a visual approach may be flown. The mission sensor
     operator and pilot not flying the approach will monitor any approach when practical to enhance safety.

6.17. Instrument Approach Procedures.
     6.17.1. The RC-26B is a Category “B” aircraft. If it is necessary to maneuver (e.g. circling or sidestep
     maneuvers) at speeds in excess of 120 KIAS, fly the minimums for the appropriate airspeed category
     in accordance with AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1 Instrument Flight Procedures, paragraph 8.5.1.1.
     6.17.2. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en route descent, pilots will confirm
     that existing weather is reported to be at or above required minimums for the lowest compatible
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                             29


   approach. Pilots shall increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ stat-
   ute miles (SM) or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway
   approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative.
NOTE: This applies only to the ALS itself, not to vertical approach slope indicators (VASI), precision
approach path indicators (PAPI), and other lights that are not components of the ALS.
   6.17.3. For a precision approach, the DH will provide a height above touchdown of 200 feet or higher.
   For precision approach radar (PAR) approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2,400 (730
   meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
   6.17.4. When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach minimums are
   a ceiling of 600 feet and 2 miles prevailing visibility, or published minimums, whichever is higher.
   6.17.5. If established on a segment of the approach or being radar vectored to final approach and the
   weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the aircraft commander has the
   option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point MAP/DH. If deciding to abandon the
   approach, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach procedure).
   Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is received.
       6.17.5.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the aircraft is in a position to
       make a safe landing and the runway environment is in sight.
       6.17.5.2. If the approach is continued, the aircraft commander must plan to have sufficient fuel
       available to complete the approach and missed approach and proceed to a suitable alternate with
       normal fuel reserve.
       6.17.5.3. The aircraft commander has final responsibility for determining when the destination is
       below designated minimums and for initiating a proper clearance request.
   6.17.6. Aircrews performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0 degrees
   C or below will refer to the Flight Information Handbook, Section 6D, Temperature Correction Chart,
   to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the final approach fix (FAF) if required.

6.18. Alternate.
   6.18.1. In addition to the requirements in AFI 11-202V3, the following conditions require an alter-
   nate:
   6.18.2. When forecast surface winds are out of limits.
   6.18.3. When the departure or destination aerodrome is outside the 48 contiguous states (regardless of
   forecast weather).

6.19. Holding in Lieu of Alternate for Remote or Island Destination. When filing to a remote or
island destination, aircrews may use 1+15 hours of holding fuel (not including fuel reserves) in lieu of an
alternate. A remote or island destination shall be defined as an isolated location, whether due to distance
or geographical barriers (e.g., mountain ranges), that is more than one hour flying time (at single engine
altitudes and airspeeds) from a suitable alternate. Comply with the following restrictions:
   6.19.1. Compute holding fuel at 10,000 feet MSL or single engine service ceiling (whichever is
   lower).
30                                                                     AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


     6.19.2. Forecast winds must be within limits at ETA plus 2 hours.
     6.19.3. Forecast weather must be equal to or greater than the published non-precision approach mini-
     mums at ETA plus 2 hours.

6.20. Fuel Reserve. Minimum Fuel is 400 pounds and Emergency Fuel is 300 pounds. Aircrews shall
plan accordingly.

6.21. Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approach. PRM approaches are used at certain airports to
increase arrival efficiency. It allows for simultaneous ILS approaches on parallel runways that are sepa-
rated by less than 4300 feet. It requires special equipment and training. RC-26B aircrews are authorized
to fly PRM approaches provided the following conditions are met:
     6.21.1. Pilots must view the FAA video ILS PRM Approach: Information for Pilots.
     6.21.2. Pilots must be familiar with the appropriate PRM information contained in the Aeronautical
     Information Manual (AIM).
     6.21.3. Training must be documented in the pilot’s training folder.
     6.21.4. Required aircraft equipment must be installed and operable.

Section 6F—Miscellaneous

6.22. Life Support Equipment.
     6.22.1. Life preserver units (LPUs) are required for all over water flights beyond gliding distance of
     land.
     6.22.2. Life rafts are required for all extended over water operations. Extended over water operations
     shall be defined as operations beyond gliding distance of land (not including instrument approach pro-
     cedures or traffic pattern operations).
     6.22.3. Aircrew occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected and readily available
     for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.

6.23. Arresting Cables. The aircraft may be taxied over arresting cables, however, use caution since the
cables may damage the propellers or surveillance pod. Takeoff or landing over raised arresting cables is
prohibited.

6.24. Landing with Hot Armament. Units with aircraft that have been modified with defensive systems
shall publish hot armament procedures in local Chapter 10.

6.25. Flight Management System (FMS).

6.26. Area Navigation (RNAV). The KNS-660 FMS is RNP-5 certified and is approved for enroute
RNAV for CONUS airspace only.
     6.26.1. It is not certified or approved for navigation when the GPS is the only sensor providing inputs
     to the FMS.
     6.26.2. It is not certified as a single long range navigation system.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                           31


   6.26.3. Terminal RNAV operations are prohibited.

6.27. Vertical Navigation (VNAV). The KNS-660 FMS is not certified for VNAV.

6.28. Dropped Object. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will notify the con-
trolling agency as soon as practical. (Include routing, altitude, weather, etc).
   6.28.1. Perform maintenance at the first station transited.

6.29. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and terminating
the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker (if the airplane is equipped).

6.30. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the aircraft
commander should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling agency for
further instructions.

                                                  Chapter 7

                                          AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting aircraft
piracy (hijacking) of RC-26B aircraft. AFI 13-207, AFI 31-101, volume 1, The Air Force Installation
Security Program, and specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews
will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or mis-
sions to the public.

7.2. Security. The aircraft commander (AC) will ensure that adequate security of the aircraft is provided
at all times. This includes determining that aircraft is properly chocked and responsible personnel on both
military and civilian airfields are advised as to the length of stay and where the crew may be contacted.

7.3. Security Procedures.
     7.3.1. Briefings. When required, ACs will receive a threat assessment and security capability evalua-
     tion briefing at home station and receive updates at en route C2 facilities.
     7.3.2. Unauthorized Entry. The AC will have the aircraft locked with a security system employed dur-
     ing all remain over nights (RON) and at other times when a crewmember is not at the aircraft.
        7.3.2.1. If forced entry is apparent, notify the local authorities and nearest command and control.
        Inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
        7.3.2.2. Coordinate with the local base operations or transient alert representatives on procedures
        for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.

7.4. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
     7.4.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked and unsealed to
     allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the AC's judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
     sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
        7.4.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
        7.4.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (for example, tape the
        inside of doors to the airframe so that the entry pulls the tape loose).
        7.4.1.3. Close and lock the door.
        7.4.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of a forced
        entry.
        7.4.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Air Force Office of Special Investiga-
        tions (AFOSI), security forces or local authorities, and the controlling agency. Have aircraft thor-
        oughly inspected prior to flight.
     7.4.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must always
     remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations. During preflight
     activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel wells, and tail cone com-
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                                33


   partment for unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will
   maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.

7.5. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation
Act of 1958, as amended, vest the FAA administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military) in flight in
the United States.
   7.5.1. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military contract air-
   craft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft. Should preventive efforts fail, any
   actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.5.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under military
   command within the scope of their duties.
   7.5.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying documents, equip-
   ment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or weapons of mass destruction,
   DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI, with all pertinent information. Where possi-
   ble, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.5.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft is opera-
   tionally ready for flight.
   7.5.5. Air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom the threat of
   death is not a deterrent but a stimulus; therefore, ordinary law enforcement procedures may be ineffec-
   tive. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the hijackers may
   require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.5.6. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of life or
   property.
   7.5.7. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the passen-
   gers.
   7.5.8. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested by the
   pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the anti-hijacking
   effort.

7.6. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are taken to min-
imize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a RC-26B is operating away from the home sta-
tion, the AC will ensure provisions of this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented, are complied with.
   7.6.1. The host station passenger processing or manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking
   inspections. Do not board passengers until the aircraft commander is fully satisfied with inspection
   results. In the absence of qualified passenger service representatives, the AC will ensure the
   anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is accomplished.
   7.6.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When
   patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections
   prior to loading.
34                                                                       AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


     7.6.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the movement of
     large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers and perform
     anti-hijacking inspections.
     7.6.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage
     aboard an aircraft except special agents, guards of the Secret Service or State Department, and other
     individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons. Note: During operations in support of law
     enforcement agencies, law enforcement agents (LEAs) are normally on board the aircraft. Most often
     these agents are armed. It is the AC’s responsibility to ensure verification of the LEA’s identification
     and proper licensing prior to allowing the LEA to board the aircraft.
     7.6.5. If weapons must be cleared, ask the individual to:
        7.6.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel
        before un-holstering or un-slinging his or her weapons.
        7.6.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.

7.7. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft within the
United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until FAA assumes active direction
of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple
discussion through deception and subterfuge to direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of
weapons. Use the following guidelines to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened, while the aircraft is on
the ground:
     7.7.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the aircrew to estab-
     lish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
     7.7.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is vested in the
     highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot be established, or when
     time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following order:
        7.7.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
        7.7.2.2. MAJCOM commander in whose area of responsibility (AOR) the airfield lies.
        7.7.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
        7.7.2.4. Aircraft commander in compliance with MAJCOM directives.

7.8. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the resourceful-
ness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude using any specific counter-hijacking proce-
dure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of action to be taken, including the
nature of the threat, danger to life, or crippling damage to the aircraft in flight, destination indicated by the
hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material on board. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may
consider are:
     7.8.1. Engage the hijacker in conversation to calm him or her and evaluate what course of action
     might be effective.
     7.8.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
     7.8.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker that intermediate stops are necessary.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                                35


   7.8.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a hostile, country.
   7.8.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker physically, includ-
   ing the prudent use of firearms.

7.9. Communications between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking threat will
notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow up with situation reports as
circumstances permit.
   7.9.1. If possible, transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Controllers will assign
   IFF code 7500 (does not preclude subsequent selection of code 7700).
   7.9.2. If in-the-clear transmissions are not possible, report “am being hijacked” by setting transponder
   to code 7500. If unable to change transponder code, or when not under radar control, transmit a radio
   message to include the phrase “(call sign) transponder seven five zero zero.”
   7.9.3. Controllers will acknowledge receipt and understanding of transponder code 7500 by transmit-
   ting “(call sign) (facility name) verify squawking 7500.” An affirmative reply or lack of reply from the
   pilot indicates confirmation and proper authorities are notified.
   7.9.4. To report “situation appears desperate; want armed intervention” after code 7500 is used,
   change to code 7700. If unable to change transponder code to 7700, or when not under radar control,
   transmit “(aircraft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero.”
       7.9.4.1. When changing from code 7500 to code 7700, remain on 7500 for at least 3 minutes or
       until a confirmation of code 7500 is received from ATC, whichever is sooner, before changing to
       code 7700. ATC acknowledges code 7700 by transmitting “(call sign) (facility name) now reading
       you on transponder seven seven zero zero.”
       7.9.4.2. Aircraft squawking 7700 after squawking 7500 that are not in radio contact with ATC are
       considered by ATC to have an in-flight emergency (in addition to hijacking). Appropriate emer-
       gency procedures are then followed. Notification of authorities in this case includes information
       that the aircraft displayed the hijack code as well as the emergency code.
   7.9.5. To report “situation still desperate, want armed intervention and aircraft immobilized,” leave
   flaps full down after landing or select flaps full down while on the ground. To facilitate message dis-
   tribution, transmit “(aircraft call sign) flaps are full down.”
   7.9.6. To report “leave alone, do not intervene,” retract the flaps after landing. Pilots who retract flaps
   after squawking 7700 should return to code 7500 and remain on code 7500 for the next leg of the
   hijacked flight unless the situation changes. Transmit “(call sign) back on seven five zero zero” to
   emphasize that intervention is no longer desired.

7.10. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. The following procedures are designed to deter pos-
sible hostile action against the hijacked aircraft that has been forced to penetrate airspace of a nation
unfriendly to the United States:
   7.10.1. If instructions from the unfriendly nation are received either by radio contact or by air inter-
   cept before boundary crossing, comply with instructions received.
   7.10.2. If no contact with the unfriendly nation is made before approaching a boundary:
       7.10.2.1. Maintain true airspeed (TAS) not more than 400 knots.
36                                                                      AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


        7.10.2.2. Maintain an altitude between 10,000 feet and 25,000 feet if possible.
        7.10.2.3. If no course is specified, fly a direct course toward destination announced by the
        hijacker.
        7.10.2.4. Transmit the international distress signal, MAYDAY, on any of the international distress
        frequencies (121.5 MHz, 243.0 MHz, or 2182 KHz) in an effort to establish communications.
        7.10.2.5. Set mode 3 code 7700 on transponder.
        7.10.2.6. If radio contact cannot be established, follow procedures set forth in the FLIP.
     7.10.3. Consider the presence of classified documents and equipment aboard the aircraft. When a
     landing in an unfriendly nation is imminent, attempt to dispose of or destroy the equipment or mate-
     rial.

7.11. Arming of Crewmembers. When crewmembers are directed to carry weapons, one pilot will nor-
mally be armed.
     7.11.1. Before departing home station, obtain weapon and ammunition from the weapons storage
     area. Present a current AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, for weapon issue. The
     same weapon will be reissued until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crewmember
     must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crewmember using AF Form
     1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
     7.11.2. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing barrels. To transfer loaded weapons to another
     crewmember, place the weapon on a flat surface. Do not use hand-to-hand transfer.
     7.11.3. Wear weapons in a concealed holster at all times to prevent identifying armed crewmembers.
     Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and from the armory and other facilities associated
     with aircrew activities, such as, base operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminal, flight line
     cafeteria or snack bar, etc.
     7.11.4. Crewmembers will be armed prior to preflight duties and until completion of all offload
     duties.
     7.11.5. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available, normally a base armory.
     If a weapons storage facility is not available, secure firearms and ammunition in the aircraft. If aircraft
     is not equipped with a gun box, leave weapons in the most secure and least visible location on the air-
     craft. Lock aircraft during all RONs.
     7.11.6. Follow the guidance set forth in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Person-
     nel, and NGB 500-2/ANGI 10-801, National Guard Counterdrug Support. Note: During operations in
     support of law enforcement agencies, law enforcement agents (LEAs) are normally on board the air-
     craft. Most often these agents are armed. It is the AC’s responsibility to ensure verification of the
     LEA’s identification and proper licensing prior to allowing the LEA to board the aircraft.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                           37

8.3. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures.
     8.3.1. Practice emergencies that require simulating an engine shutdown, placing switches in other
     than their normal position, or an abnormal configuration, only during training, evaluation, or currency
     flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats. Preface all simulated
     emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate simulated emergencies when an actual emer-
     gency arises. Copilots designated as AC candidates may perform any maneuver authorized for an AC
     (when in the left seat) under the direct supervision of an IP.
     8.3.2. Use realistic approach, do not compound emergencies, and use radar flight following to the
     maximum extent possible, consistent with training objectives.
     8.3.3. Simulated Single Engine.
        8.3.3.1. Direct IP supervision required.
        8.3.3.2. Weather. Simulated engine failure is authorized in day IMC if the weather is at or above

40                                                                    AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


     8.9.4. Approach to stalls (note: this maneuver must be performed above 5,000 feet AGL).

8.10. Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. Aircrews are authorized to fly practice instrument
approach procedures under VFR. Comply with the restrictions in AFI 11-202V3.

8.11. Tactical Arrival Training. Tactical arrivals are non-standard methods of arrival used to get the air-
craft on the ground quickly with minimal exposure to ground-based threats. Altitudes, airspeeds and sink
rates are non-standard and must be thoroughly briefed. The high sink rates will cause the GPWS to acti-
vate. The GPWS warning may be detrimental to aircrew communication; therefore, the GPWS should be
disabled during this maneuver. In addition, comply with the following restrictions:
     8.11.1. Tactical arrival training with passengers on board are prohibited.
     8.11.2. Tactical arrival training must be conducted in day VMC.
     8.11.3. Limit maneuvering to 60 degrees of bank (without flaps). If flaps are extended, limit bank
     angle to 45 degrees.
     8.11.4. The aircraft must be stabilized on final by 200 feet AGL and NM. Stabilized is defined as:
     wings level, 140 KIAS (maximum), and 1000 VVI (maximum). If any of these parameters are
     exceeded, execute a go-around.
     8.11.5. Brief the touchdown no-later-than point.
     8.11.6. All landings without an IP must be to a full stop.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                             41

                                     MISSION EMPLOYMENT

9.1. Sensor Pod. Do not apply power to the sensor pod if the sensor pod fire extinguisher is inoperative.

9.2. Lowering the Turret. The MSO must receive confirmation from the AC before lowering the turret.

9.3. Imagery Collection. Prior to obtaining any images, the MSO shall positively identify the target with
the LEA. To facilitate interfly between units, aircrews should use standard terminology and the following
procedures:
   9.3.1. Target Acquisition:
       9.3.1.1. For target acquisition crews will coordinate using a combination of target coordinates,
       Situation Awareness Display System (SADS) steering points, Cockpit Display Unit (CDU) video,
       azimuth/elevation references, and visual cues. MSOs should enable CDU LOS and target steering
       to the maximum extent possible.
       9.3.1.2. Aircraft should be slowed and configured (recommend flaps) 5 to 10 miles prior and off-
       set approximately .8 miles from the target to establish an orbit.
       9.3.1.3. For pilot visual acquisition prior to IR/TV, pilots should use azimuth and elevation refer-
       ences to initially direct MSO control of IR/TV. Once a point is identified in pilot’s CDU, pilots
       should use up/down and left/right directions to identify target to MSO.
       9.3.1.4. Once target is acquired, MSO will refine target coordinates.
   9.3.2. Aerial Photography
       9.3.2.1. MSO’s will be directive on desired run-in azimuth, altitude, and airspeed to optimize
       photo quality and usability.
       9.3.2.2. MSO’s will ensure proper camera configuration, and verify camera door is open NLT
       thirty seconds prior to camera-ON point, and will advise crew accordingly.
       9.3.2.3. Pilots will confirm that wings are level and airspeed is ≥140 KIAS and will advise with a
       verbal wings set call. Pilots should have aircraft stabilized NLT 1 NM prior to camera ON point.
       9.3.2.4. MSOs will advise the crew when camera(s) are switched ON or OFF. Pilots will maintain
       wings-level while cameras are on, and conversely be cleared to maneuver when cameras are
       turned off.

9.4. Recording Equipment. The MSO should notify the crew when any VCR or audio equipment is
turned on or off. Recording of audio should be determined by the LEA. Crews should be aware of the con-
text of their recorded observations.

9.5. LEA Responsibility/Chain of Custody. The LEA will be solely responsible for compliance with
local search and seizure laws. Crewmembers will not assume this responsibility.

     9.5.1. Counterdrug (CD) Transportation. For missions involving the transportation of illegal cargo
     (narcotics or personnel), ensure the LEAs maintains custody of the cargo at all times. Aircrews must
     not enter the chain of custody.

9.6. VFR Operations. All Surveillance/reconnaissance missions (including training missions) may be
conducted under VFR.
     9.6.1. Consider notifying the controlling agency via telephone prior to the mission if extended opera-
     tions within class B or C airspace are anticipated.
     9.6.2. When operating near an uncontrolled airfield, aircrews should monitor the appropriate UNI-
     COM or common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). Make advisory calls, if appropriate.
     9.6.3. For operations within 25 NM of the southwest border, contact the Air Marine Operations Cen-
     ter (AMOC) at 1-800-553-9072. Monitor the appropriate radio frequency.

                               OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

11.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For assistance in
completing safety forms contact the wing, unit, or local flight safety officer.

11.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report (AFI 91-202). AF hazard reporting system provides a
means for Air Force personnel to alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring
prompt corrective action. A hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may jeopar-
dize the health and well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or destruction of any
weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource.

11.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). See AFI 91-202, Attachment 3, Hazard-
ous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Program (RSC HAF-SE (AR) 7602).
     11.3.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near midair colli-
     sions (NMAC) and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in HATR reports only for
     mishap prevention. AFI 91-202 list reportable incidents.
     11.3.2. Procedures:
        11.3.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. cen-
        ter, FSS, control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and give the following information as appro-
        priate:
            11.3.2.1.1. Identification or call sign
            11.3.2.1.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield, incident,
            etc.
            11.3.2.1.3. Altitude or flight level
            11.3.2.1.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle
            11.3.2.1.5. Include a verbal statement as soon as possible after occurrence that a written
            HATR report will be filed upon landing
NOTE: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA, etc) must know if an official report is being filed.
        11.3.2.2. File the HATR as soon as possible (24 hours) using any available means of communica-
        tion. Normally, it should be filed at the Air Force base operations office at the landing airport. If
        this is impractical and if communications permit, notify the safety office of the Air Force base
        where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home base, or as prescribed by the overseas
        MAJCOM. In any case, provide the base or wing safety office with all available information
        needed to prepare AF Form 651. Turn in a completed copy of AF Form 651 to the wing safety
        office.
     11.3.3. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted immunity from disciplinary action provided:
        11.3.3.1. Their violation was not deliberate.
        11.3.3.2. They committed no criminal offense.
AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006                                                                             45


       11.3.3.3. No mishap occurred.
       11.3.3.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
NOTE: HATR reports are not privileged information and may be released outside the USAF.

11.4. AF Form 711, USAF Aircraft Mishap Report Worksheet.
   11.4.1. Responsibilities. Notify the appropriate authorities of any mishap involving aircraft or crew.
   When notified, units will initiate investigative and reporting actions in accordance with AFI 91-204
   Safety Investigations and Reports and OPREP-3.
NOTE: Do not attempt to classify a mishap.
   11.4.2. Reportable Mishaps:
       11.4.2.1. Report damage to the aircraft, or injury to the crew or passengers; also report any dam-
       age or injury to another organization’s equipment or personnel resulting from the movements or
       actions of an aircraft or crew.

           (wing or squadron assignment of crew), home base, route of flight, point of alleged deviation,
           and miles off course.
   11.5.5. ACs must keep appropriate MAJCOM agencies apprised of any unusual events or circum-
   stances impacting their missions. Examples of reportable events include meaconing, jamming, intru-
   sion, interception, fuel dumping, loss of multiple engines, hostile fire, injury to passengers or
   crewmembers, etc. This list is not exhaustive. Some events may require the C2 agency to forward
   OPREP reports to higher headquarters. The old adage, "when in doubt, report it," applies.

11.6. Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. S e v e r a l d i f f e r e n t
forms are used to record aviation fuels transactions. The form used to record the transaction depends on
who and where the actual refueling takes place. Basically, these transactions can be broken down into two
categories: refueling at USAF locations and refueling at other than USAF bases:
   11.6.1. Refueling at USAF Locations. AF Form 1994, Fuels Issue/Defuel Document, is used to
   record the Aviation Fuels Transaction (issue or defuel) at USAF locations.
   11.6.2. Refueling at locations other than USAF bases:
       11.6.2.1. DD Form 1898, Fuel Sale Slip. This form is used to record the aviation fuels transaction
       (issue or defuel) at other DOD locations (USA, USN, and USMC) and at commercial airports
       where into-plane contracts are in force.
       11.6.2.2. AF Form 315, United States Air Force AVFuels Invoice. This form is used to purchase
       aviation fuels and oils at commercial locations where into-plane contracts are not in force. The
       form is filled-in by the AC or his authorized representative and is described in AFI 23-202, Buying
       Petroleum Products and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station. If the vendor wants to be paid
       without submitting an invoice, the AC retains the original AF Form 315 to return to home station
       for accounting and finance processing. Provide two legible copies of the form to the vendor. If the
       vendor wants to submit an invoice for payment, give the vendor the original AF Form 315 to
       attach to the invoice.
       11.6.2.3. Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement (AIR) Card. The AIRcard is a commercial credit
       card, which allows aircrews to purchase aviation fuel, fuel related supplies, and/or ground services
       at commercial airports where no DoD/Canadian into-plane contracts exist. Accepted at over 4200
       locations, it is intended to replace the AF Form 315, United States AVFuels Invoice and AF Form
       15, United States Air Force Invoice, at locations that accept the AIRcard. All Air Force aircraft
       will be issued an AIRcard. Additional information at SF WEB page: (WWW.KELLY.AF.MIL/
       SFWEB/AIRCARD.HTM).
           11.6.2.3.1. When using the AIR Card charges incurred during routine aircraft servicing gener-
           ate a charge receipt. The aircraft commander is responsible for ensuring the receipt is correct
           and all appropriate signatures are obtained before departing the fixed base operator (FBO).
           The aircraft commander then gives all charge receipts to the unit document control officer
           (DCO) at the completion of the mission.
           11.6.2.3.2. Charges incurred for other services, including landing fees, aircraft de-icing, fol-
           low-me trucks and other aircraft related services might not generate a receipt that is given to
           the aircrew. If no receipt for these services is generated and provided to the aircrew the aircraft
           commander will ensure the location and services performed are noted and relayed to the unit
48                                                                    AFI11-2RC-26BV3 19 MAY 2006


            DCO when the receipts are turned in upon completion of the mission. If a separate receipt is
            generated, turn it into the unit DCO.

11.7. AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice. Used to purchase ground fuels, oils, or services at
non-DoD activities, see AFI 23-202. When completed, log and place inside AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels
Documentation Log.
     11.7.1. Use the AF Form 15 for vendor services/supplies only if contract vendors are not available or
     the contract vendor will not accept the aircraft identaplate.
     11.7.2. If the vendors require a signature on their form and an AF Form 15 has been used, write the
     statement "AF Form 15 Executed" on the vendor’s form.
     11.7.3. Return two copies of the AF Form 15 to home station.
     11.7.4. Purchases at Canadian into-plane locations will be documented using the local vendor’s
     invoice. AF Form 15 or 315 will not be accomplished. Hand scribe the information from the aircraft
     identiplate to the vendor’s invoice, and complete a separate sheet with the information listed on the
     Aviation Issues to DoD and Non-DoD, Aircraft Refueling Tender Sheet (See AFI 23-202). Log and
     place a copy inside the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log.
     11.7.5. Purchases at SITCO Agreement locations require presenting the aircraft identiplate. The
     invoice must include the date of transaction, grade of the product, quantity issued or defueled, unit of
     measure, and signature of the Air Force representative. If the vendor also requires completion of an
     AF Form 15 or 315 in addition to their invoice, annotate on the vendor’s invoice "AF FORMS EXE-
     CUTED." Log and place the documentation inside the AF Form 664.
     11.7.6. Purchases at non-contract commercial airfields are accomplished using the AF Form 15 or
     315. See AFI 23-202 for instructions on completing these forms.
     11.7.7. Purchases at foreign military airfields, including replacement-in-kind (RIK) locations, the
     host country forms are used to record the purchase. Information from aircraft identiplate should be
     hand scribed on the local form. Log and place a copy inside AF Form 664.

11.8. Forms Adopted. AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice, AF Form 315, United States Air
Force AVFuels Invoice, AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to

                                     EQUAL TIME POINTS (ETPS)

A3.1. Equal Time Point (ETP). The equal time point is an airborne decision point. It is the point along
the route of flight (usually over water) from which it takes the same amount of time to return to the point
of departure (or to the last suitable airfield) as it would to continue to the destination (or the first suitable
airfield). In no wind conditions, the ETP is simply the halfway point between the two airfields. However,
when flying into a headwind, the ETP moves closer to the destination aerodrome. Conversely, when fly-
ing into a tailwind, the ETP moves closer to the departure aerodrome. The distance and time to the ETP
from the departure aerodrome (or last suitable airfield) may be calculated using the following formulas:

Figure A3.1. Example


         Distance to ETP =           (Total Distance) x (Ground Speed Home)
                                    (Ground Speed Out) + (Ground Speed Home)


         Time to ETP         =                      Distance to ETP
                                                   Ground Speed Out




Problem:                                                Solution:
Distance from A to B: 800 NM                            Distance to ETP = 800 x 300 = 240,000 = 480 NM
Wind: 50 kts headwind                                                     200 + 300     500
TAS: 250 kts
GS Out: 200 kts (250 kts - 50 kt headwind)              Time to ETP = 480 NM = 2.4 hrs
GS Home: 300 kts (250 kts + 50 kt tailwind)                           200 kts
