SUMMARY OF CHANGES

AFI 33-360 and AFI 90-201 tier identification and waiver requirements have been incorporated.
Other major changes include: USAFE Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS) Commander’s
authority expanded for OPREP release. Commander’s discretion guidance clarified for incidents
not covered by the Chief Staff Air Force (CSAF) OPREP-3 Reports Matrix. Air Force Service
Watch Cell (AF WATCH) has been given authority to direct units to submit OPREP-3 Reports
upon direction from Joint Staff (JS) and Headquarters Air Force (HAF) leadership. Pinnacle and
Beeline asynchronous reporting timing criteria were updated to match standard operating
procedures. Synchronous Report Body and Asynchronous Event Text formats were changed to
readily identify JS and HAF leadership required information in report. OPREP-3 System Outage
reporting procedures were updated to include voice reports as a tertiary method and removed
USMTF formatted email option. Commanders’ Situational Reporting (SITREP) requirements
were updated to reflect standard operating procedures. AF SITREP subject line requirements
and format has been updated. Hurricane Condition (HURCON) and Tropical Cyclone
Conditions of Readiness (TCCOR) Level Reporting criteria were updated. Cyber Reporting
Chapter was removed and associated requirements were captured in CSAF OPREP-3 Matrix.
This document is substantially revised and should be completely reviewed.

                                         Chapter 1

             GENERAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept of the OPREP-3 System. The OPREP-3 system provides CSAF and intermediate
commanders the information necessary for timely operational decisions. The main criterion for
inclusion in the OPREP-3 system is essential information for command and control of aerospace
forces.
   1.1.1. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will not establish OPREP-3 report rules or instruction
   below HAF level; however, may develop MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Commander-directed
   reporting requirements in order to ensure events/incidents that do not meet OPREP-3
   reporting requirements are still available to the commander (1).
   1.1.2. Due to the time sensitivity of OPREP-3 information, report each event/incident
   promptly and as accurately as possible. The FIRST CP having knowledge of an
   event/incident will report/facilitate OPREP-3 reporting (T-1). Units will not delay
   submission of an OPREP-3 to research whether another unit is also submitting the report (T-
   1). In the case of multiple OPREP-3 submissions, the AF Watch will decide if multiple units
   will continue submitting or if one unit will continue all follow-up reporting based on
   information received (T-1).
   1.1.3. Units at all levels will develop procedures to quickly obtain and report the key
   elements of an AF OPREP-3 (T-3). Installations hosting multiple units (assigned to different
   MAJCOMs, sister services, detachments) should include OPREP-3 reporting requirements in
   the Host-Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA). When a HTSA is not feasible, a Memorandum
   of Agreement (MOA) should be used to capture ORPEP-3 reporting processes for each unit.
   All Air Force units, to include Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), will comply with
   MAJCOM guidance and this instruction (T-1).
   1.1.4. Air Force component commanders within combatant commands, Joint Bases (JB) or
   Joint Task Forces (JTF) will develop written guidance to ensure compliance with this
   instruction within their command and de-conflict with combatant, JB, or JTF command
   directives (T-2).
   1.1.5. Authority. This instruction includes the requirements of the various documents of the
   Joint Reporting Structure (JRS). Air Force units will use AFI 10-206 as the primary source
   for reporting instructions (T-1).
1.2. Responsibilities.
   1.2.1. HQ USAF AF/A3O will:
       1.2.1.1. Develop and provide AF operational reporting guidance.
       1.2.1.2. Annually, review new requirements to determine operational necessity
       1.2.1.3. Develop HAF self-assessment checklist (SAC) identifying AFI 10-206 tiered
       items.
   1.2.2. HQ USAF AF/A3O-OA (AF Watch) will (T-1):
       1.2.2.1. Be the subject matter experts for OPREP-3 processing.
 6                                                                      AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014


        1.2.2.2. Coordinate OPREP-3 Reports Matrix updates and changes with CSAF/SECAF,
        as required.
        1.2.2.3. Maintain the capability to continuously monitor and process reporting
        information from Jabber, email, phone, and SKIWeb.
        1.2.2.4. Distribute information received to HAF/Secretary of the Air Force (SAF)
        agencies.
     1.2.3. HQ Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Command Center will:
        1.2.3.1. Report all 24 AF/CC declared communications/computer systems intrusions
        (single or multiple installation) via OPREP-3 to the AF Watch.
        1.2.3.2. Identify and report communication           outages/failures   affecting multiple
        installations via OPREP-3 to the AF Watch.
     1.2.4. MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs will (T-2):
        1.2.4.1. Develop instructions to ensure timely and accurate OPREP-3s are reported
        within established timelines (see Table 3.1).
        1.2.4.2. Review requirements annually to determine operational necessity.
        1.2.4.3. Maintain current Defense Connect Online (DCO) and SKIWeb accounts to
        facilitate OPREP-3 reporting.
        1.2.4.4. Develop procedures to continuously monitor the af.watch Jabber room for
        pertinent information and OPREP-3s. Units will use an audible alert to notify controllers
        that a message has been received for action (T-3).
1.3. Commanders will (T-3) (unless indicated otherwise):
     1.3.1. Ensure timely and accurate reporting for all events/incidents that meet Chairman, Joint
     Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and CSAF reporting criteria for all assigned or attached units, as well
     as events/incidents that occur on or near their installation or affecting mission (see Table
     3.1.) (T-0).
     1.3.2. Ensure HTSAs or MOAs outline OPREP-3 procedures between organizations.
     Agreements will outline procedures to ensure the installation CP is made aware of all
     events/incidents occurring on or affecting their installation. Established HTSAs/MOAs
     should not delay the submission of OPREP-3 reports by CP.
     1.3.3. Ensure that OPREP-3 reports are released by the host wing commander, when host
     installation resources are utilized. Air Reserve Component (ARC) commanders retain
     approval authority until federally mobilized, when host installation resources are not utilized.
        1.3.3.1. USAFE Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS) Commanders are authorized to
        release OPREPs on behalf of the wing commander.
     1.3.4. Ensure events/incidents meeting OPREP-3 reporting criteria (CSAF OPREP-3
     Reports Matrix) are up channeled to the AF Watch (T-1).
        1.3.4.1. Submit an OPREP-3 (Commanders Discretion) when, in the opinion of the
        commander, an event/incident does not fall into a CSAF rule, but is significant enough to
        report to HAF.
AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014                                                                     7


1.4. Wing/Unit CPs will (T-3, unless otherwise directed):
   1.4.1. Ensure procedures are in place to train commanders (wing, group, squadron, tenant,
   sister services, etc.) and First Sergeants on OPREP-3 processes and requirements. Training
   should include as a minimum:
       1.4.1.1. The OPREP-3 System
       1.4.1.2. CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix
       1.4.1.3. Information releasable in OPREP-3s
       1.4.1.4. OPREP-3 timing criteria
       1.4.1.5. Tenant commander responsibilities
   1.4.2. Be responsible for providing commanders the necessary information to facilitate an
   informed decision and submit timely OPREP-3s using the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix.
   1.4.3. Ensure installation/wing commanders are informed of all OPREP-3 reported incidents
   by a tenant organization. Notification of commanders will not delay OPREP-3 submission.
   1.4.4. Maintain and update the OPREP-3 portion of the HTSA or Memorandum of
   Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOU) based on the wing’s scheduled review and IAW
   AFI 25-201 Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures.
   1.4.5. Ensure    that   all certified   controllers  maintain       active   synchronous
   (Jabber)/asynchronous (SKIWeb) accounts to submit OPREP-3.
   1.4.6. Monitor af.watch jabber room continuously (24/7) for Higher Headquarter (HHQ)
   reporting information requests, requirements, and/or notifications (T-2).
   1.4.7. Notify the home-station CP and MAJCOM Command Center of any incidents
   involving that CP’s/command's assets.

                         GENERAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS

2.1. Security Classification and Downgrading Instructions. AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management, provide security classification and downgrading instructions.
     2.1.1. OPREP-3s will be classified according to content(T-0). If OPREP-3s contain any of
     the following content, the report will be classified a minimum of SECRET (T-0):
        2.1.1.1. Indicators of unit readiness data. Data extracted from the Defense Readiness
        Reporting System (DRRS)/Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)
        database is classified by the reporting organization or IAW AFI 10-201, Status of
        Resources and Training System (SORTS) or the CJCSM 3150.02 Series, Global Status of
        Resources and Training System (GSORTS), whichever is higher.
        2.1.1.2. Unit Mission Essential Tasks (MET), as captured in AFI 10-252, Defense
        Readiness Reporting System.
        2.1.1.3. Events/incidents of confirmed or suspected compromise of classified
        information according to content, IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
        Management.
        2.1.1.4. Classify information commensurate with the classification of the equipment,
        incident/event, and governing instructions if not identified above.
     2.1.2. Do not over-classify reports. All reports transmitted over Secure Internet Protocol
     Router Network (SIPRNET) must have proper classification markings (T-0).
2.2. Transmitting Reports During Combat or Combat-Related Operations. When combat
or combat-related operational requirements make speed of delivery paramount, military
commanders may modify transmission of classified information as necessary to meet local
conditions.
2.3. Directed Reporting. AF Watch, when directed by HAF/JS leadership, may direct a unit to
submit an OPREP-3 on a significant event/incident.
     2.3.1. AF Watch may suspend reporting for a unit when they are in a degraded
     communications environment.
2.4. Correction of Reports. Originators will make all corrections identified during
synchronous reporting to the asynchronous report (hard copy) (T-1). Submit corrected reports
through synchronous reporting and obtain AF Watch acknowledgement prior to correcting in an
asynchronous report (T-1). The originator will submit a correction if an error is noticed in
content (e.g., incorrect facts, incorrect timing), after submitting the report (T-1).

                          EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (OPREP-3)

3.1. Subject and Purpose. Air Force Commanders use OPREP-3s to immediately notify
Higher Headquarters (HHQs) of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of DoD,
CJCS, Combatant Command (COCOM), or service- level interests. Prior to
mobilization/activation AF, ANG, and AFRC units will address the AF Watch on all applicable
record copy OPREP-3. CPs will submit the applicable OPREP-3 regardless of whether or not
the event is being reported through other channels (T-0). OPREP-3s do not replace the
requirement for more detailed reports such as the SITREP, and other directorate’s accident or
incident investigation reports. Submitting an OPREP-3 does not change, nor is it a substitute for,
any report required by other directives. Real-world OPREP-3s take priority over exercise events.
3.2. Reporting Categories. CJCSM 3150.03D, Joint Reporting Structure Event and Incident
Reports, categorizes events or incidents according to their nature with a FLAGWORD.
FLAGWORDs (i.e., NUCFLASH, BENT SPEAR) associated with each category aid prompt
processing and distribution of the reports by alerting people to their importance. The following
FLAGWORDs identify reports within the CJCSM 3150.03D:
   3.2.1. PINNACLE (OPREP-3P). This report is used by any unit to provide the National
   Military Command Center (NMCC) and, as appropriate, combatant commands and services,
   with immediate notification of any incident or event where national or international level
   interest is indicated. OPREP-3Ps are not restricted to operational information. Any
   inadvertent, accidental, unauthorized, or unexpected event or incident will be upgraded from
   an OPREP-3B to an OPREP-3P if (T-0):
       3.2.1.1. The occurrence generates a higher level of military action
       3.2.1.2. The occurrence has national-level interest
       3.2.1.3. The occurrence affects international relations and/or is clearly against national
       interests or affects national policy
       3.2.1.4. Causes immediate widespread coverage in news media (national or
       international)
   3.2.2. PINNACLE NUCFLASH (OPREP-3PNF). Used to report an event, accident, or
   incident that could create the risk of a nuclear war. This report has the highest precedence in
   the OPREP-3 reporting structure. Report any of the following as an OPREP-3PNF (T-0):
       3.2.2.1. Ballistic missile launch or space launch
       3.2.2.2. Re-entering space objects
       3.2.2.3. Loss, potential loss, or degradation of U.S. military space capability when the
       loss or degradation is because of actions by a suspected or known hostile source.
       3.2.2.4. Reports of cruise missiles detected and/or launched against the U.S. or U.S.
       interests
       3.2.2.5. Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained incident involving possible detonation
       of a nuclear weapon producing a nuclear yield
10                                                                 AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014


     3.2.2.6. Unauthorized flight, or deviation from an approved flight plan, by a U.S.
     nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of
     another nuclear-capable country
  3.2.3. PINNACLE FRONT BURNER (OPREP-3PFB). Used to report pre-conflict
  occurrence of armed attack, harassment, or hostile action against U.S. forces, territory, or
  interests. After the OPREP-3PFB has been submitted for a specific hostile situation,
  subsequent OPREP-3P reports are not required. Subsequent reporting of significant mission
  degradation or heavy losses, combat events and minor airfield damage resulting from the
  armed attack, harassment, or hostile action is reported in the SITREP.
  3.2.4. PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA). Used to report a U.S. nuclear
  weapon accident that does not create the risk of a nuclear war. Report any of the following
  as an OPREP-3PBA (T-0):
     3.2.4.1. Nuclear detonation of a U.S. nuclear weapon
     3.2.4.2. Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a U.S. nuclear weapon
     3.2.4.3. Radioactive contamination from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component
     3.2.4.4. Jettisoning of a U.S. nuclear weapon or component
     3.2.4.5. Public hazard, actual or implied, from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component
  3.2.5. PINNACLE EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ). Used to report the seizure, theft, or
  loss of a U.S. nuclear weapon.
  3.2.6. PINNACLE EMERGENCY DISABLEMENT (OPREP-3PED). Used for reporting
  operations involving the command disablement or non-violent disablement of U.S. nuclear
  weapons.
  3.2.7. PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV).                          Used to report
  operations involving the emergency evacuation of U.S. nuclear weapons.
  3.2.8. OPREP-3 WHITE PINNACLE (OPREP-3WP). OPREP-3WP is an exercise report
  that contains simulated time-critical information from operating forces to the NMCC and
  COCOMs. OPREP-3WP exercises use OPREP-3P procedures and are downward directed by
  the COCOM to check timeliness of select CPs and other designated Command and Control
  (C2) nodes.
     3.2.8.1. COCOMs designate the units to receive the exercise message and select specific
     exercise start times. Upon receipt of an OPREP-3WP tasking, units are required to
     submit an OPREP-3WP acknowledgement report to the NMCC via synchronous (Jabber)
     means (T-0). The time standard is 20 minutes (T-0).
     3.2.8.2. CPs transmit OPREP-3WPs in the same fashion as OPREP-3Ps. Units will
     transmit an OPREP-3WP to the “af.watch” Jabber room using the format in Figure 3.1.
     (T-1). Upon receipt, AF Watch controllers immediately relay the OPREP-3WP to the
     NMCC “dod_njoic” Jabber room (T-0).

   3.2.9. OPREP-3 BENT SPEAR (OPREP-3BS). Used to report incidents involving U.S.
   nuclear weapons that are of significant interest, but are not categorized as OPREP-3PNF or
   OPREP-3PBA. OPREP-3BSs use the same timing requirements as OPREP-3Ps.
   3.2.10. OPREP-3 FADED GIANT (OPREP-3FG). Used to report nuclear reactor or
   radiological accidents or incidents to the appropriate service headquarters. OPREP-3FGs use
   the same timing requirements as OPREP-3Ps.
   3.2.11. BEELINE (OPREP-3B). Used to report any event or incident that the CSAF has
   deemed reportable in the CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix and/or meets AF-level interest, but
   does not meet national or international level interest requirements
3.3. Reports Guidebook. The Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) of Reports has
the responsibility to maintain the Reports Guidebook. This guide provides a quick reference to
assist CP controllers in submitting OPREP-3s and other reports, as applicable. The Reports
Guidebook will include(T-3):
   3.3.1. Current CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix. The CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix is a
   quick reference list to assist commanders and controllers in determining the level and type of
   report to submit based on events and incidents deemed of interest to the CSAF, CJCS, and
   Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). Due to the need for reporting requirements to be updated
   as operational situations evolve and as AF/A3O or higher directs, the CSAF OPREP-3
   Reports Matrix will be posted on the CP Intelink Site. When the matrix is updated or
   changed, CPs will be notified of changes in a Command and Control Controller Information
   File (C2 CIF).
   3.3.2. The Contact Addressees List, (located on the CP Intelink Sites under Reports Library)
   contains the core recipients for OPREP-3s. The Contact Addressees List has been provided
   to assist during times of system inoperability. Units will ensure that affected HQs receive the
   report, regardless of how the report is transmitted (T-1). During routine operations, units will
   select applicable HQs based on situation, chain of command (COCOM, MAJCOM, etc.), as
   well as “Affected Areas” from the event/incident when adding an event into SKIWeb (T-1).
 12                                                                  AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014


   AF Watch will be selected as an “Affected Area” in SKIWeb on all OPREP-3s (T-1). Units
   may add additional contact information to the Reports Guidebook, as required.
   3.3.3. OPREP-3 Reports Guide. The OPREP-3 Reports Guide (Attachment 2, Figure A2.1.)
   is a list of minimum routine questions that need to be answered when including data into an
   OPREP-3.(T-3)
   3.3.4. Checklists contain step-by-step procedures to ensure required reports are submitted in
   the proper format, within established timelines, and with the correct content.(T-3)
3.4. OPREP-3 Report Timing Requirements. Units will use Table 3.1. for synchronous
(Jabber)/asynchronous (SKIWeb) timing requirements (T-1). When a qualified/certified
specialist must be consulted to determine if an OPREP-3 event/incident has occurred, according
to CSAF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix requirements (e.g., weapons maintenance on a weapons
outage, medical provider for confirmation of death), timing standards will begin from CP
notification of the determination rather than incident, IAW Table 3.1 (T-1).

Table 3.1. Timing Criteria
Type of Report               Synchronous Report/Voice            Asynchronous
                             Report Timing (IAW                  Report/Record Copy Timing
                             Paragraph 3.6.)                     (IAW Paragraph 3.7.)

*PINNACLE                    5 minutes from incident             1 hour from incident
NUCFLASH
PINNACLE/BEELINE             15 minutes from incident  1 hour from AF Watch
                                                       approval time
*NOTE: PINNACLE Nuclear Flash reports are extremely time sensitive and require initial
reporting within 5 minutes of the incident (T-0).
3.5. Report Construction. Units should develop processes that enable the correct and
expedient transmission of reports via synchronous, asynchronous, and alternate means of
communication. Synchronous Reports are transmitted via DCO Chat Client, more commonly
known and referred to as “Jabber”. Asynchronous reports are posted on a SIPRNET blog site
named SKIWeb.
   3.5.1. OPREP-3 Message Subject Line. Regardless of transmission medium, all OPREP-3
   subject lines will be constructed in the following manner (T-1):
       3.5.1.1. Portion Marking. All subject lines will contain a portion marking for the
       classification of the subject line. The subject line portion marking (U, C, S, S/NF, etc.)
       does NOT identify the overall classification of the report, only the subject line (T-0).
       3.5.1.2. Report FLAGWORD (OPREP-3P, OPREP-3PFB, OPREP-3B, etc.).
       3.5.1.3. DTG of Incident. This time should be when the incident occurred, not when the
       incident became reportable. Clarification can always be provided in the narrative to
       explain DTG if incident occurred several days prior to a report. The DTG will not
       change as subsequent reports are submitted.
AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014                                                                        13


     3.5.1.4. Location Event Occurred. This is the location of the incident or where the event
     took place. This may not be the same location as a military installation. Do not narrow
     the location beyond or below city/base level.
     3.5.1.5. Event/Incident and Rule Number. Used to identify the incident listed in CSAF
     OPREP-3 Reports Matrix and the corresponding rule number.
     3.5.1.6. Example Subject Line: (U) OPREP-3B, 251458ZDEC2014, Cheraw, SC,
     Criminal Activity, Rule 9L
  3.5.2. Report Body (Jabber) or Event Text (SKIWeb). The body of the report narrative
  includes the who, what, when, where, how, and operational impact of the incident. In the
  initial report, report as much information as possible that is known at the time. Include new
  information as details unfold. In subsequent reports, do not restate previously stated facts.
  Regardless of transmission medium, all OPREP-3 narrative (event text) will be constructed
  in the following manner (see Figure 3.2. for example) (T-1):
     3.5.2.1. Report Type: Initial, Initial/Final, Follow-Up, Final, and Corrected Reports.
     3.5.2.2. Time and Date: Time of Incident in HHMMZ, DD Mon YY format.
     3.5.2.3. Unit: Include CP Designator for Unit/Wing/Installation submitting the OPREP.
     3.5.2.4. Member: Include member information including age, gender, rank, and military
     status (REGAF or ARC), Unit, etc. Use N/A for reports that do not require an ETIC.
     3.5.2.5. Details: In narrative, sentence case format, include the who, what, when, where,
     and how the event/incident occurred. When aircraft are involved be sure to include
     MDS, tail numbers, assigned units, mission numbers, etc.
     3.5.2.6. Mission Impact/Impairment (if applicable). This section of the report should
     identify how the event or incident impacts the unit/wing/installation mission (individual
     squadron/duty section impact is not required). Use N/A for reports that do not impact
     mission.
     3.5.2.7. Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC): Identify the estimated time a situation
     will end, a weapon system is expected to return to service, or repair will be complete.
     Use N/A for reports that do not require an ETIC.
     3.5.2.8. Point of Contact. This is used after consulting and confirming with the
     appropriate external agency/agencies and informing them that further reports will be
     accomplished through their channels, include agency office symbol and 10-digit DSN
     number. This may be used for Final Reports (including Initial/Finals); use N/A for this
     line for all other report types (Initials/Follow-Ups/Corrections).
 14                                                                    AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014



Figure 3.2. Report Body Example
(U) Initial/Final:
(U) Time and Date: 1458Z, 25 Jan 14
(U) Unit: 20th Fighter Wing
(U) Member(s): 25 y/o male, Capt (REGAF), AFCENT/A4
(U) Details: Member was indicted in December 2013 on two counts of vehicular manslaughter.
Individual plead guilty and will begin a two year prison sentence on 26 January 2014. Local
media attention occurred.
(U) Mission Impact: N/A.
(U) ETIC: N/A
(U) POC: Maj John Hopkins, DSN 123-4567

   3.5.3. Initial and Initial/Final reports. Initial and Initial/Final reports should contain as much
   information as immediately available within established time parameters about an event or
   incident. Both reports will be submitted IAW Paragraph 3.6. An Initial report may only be
   submitted as an Initial/Final report if it contains all of the required information to close the
   report. The AF Watch will ask questions during initial reporting to get clarification and/or
   prompt units to get information required by HHQ to post in the record copy or Follow-Up
   reports. Information requested by AF Watch, MAJCOM, and/or JS during synchronous
   reporting will be provided in an asynchronous report when the information becomes
   available (T-1). Both reports are posted in Jabber prior to posting in SKIWeb (T-1).
       3.5.3.1. If seven calendar days have elapsed from the Initial report and these questions
       are not answered, a Final OPREP-3 will be submitted stating that “No further information
       will be provided through OPREP-3 channels” (T-1). Identify approved points of contact
       (POC), agency/agencies, and contact number(s) (T-1).
       3.5.3.2. The statement “Further reporting through XXX channels.” will only be used
       after consulting and confirming with the appropriate external agency/agencies, that
       further reports will be accomplished through their channels, include agency office symbol
       and contact number. This statement is not a blanket statement. The statement will be
       included in the Event Detail line (T-1).
       3.5.3.3. When events/incidents occur which overlap multiple rule numbers, units will
       combine them and submit one OPREP-3 (T-1). If multiple rule numbers specify different
       types of OPREPs, i.e., BEELINE, PINNACLE, units will submit the highest type report
       (T-1). For OPREP-3s with multiple rule numbers, only one rule number and title will be
       reflected in the subject line; use the most severe incident in the subject line and identify
       additional rule numbers at the end of the Event Detail section of the synchronous
       (Jabber)/asynchronous (SKIWeb) report (i.e., Rules XX, XX and XX also apply.) (T-1).
   3.5.4. Follow-Up Reports. These reports are essential to keep commanders informed of
   developing situations and to provide additional details as they are learned. Follow-Up
   reports will be submitted IAW Paragraph 3.6 (T-1). Follow-Up reports are posted in Jabber
   PRIOR to posting in SKIWeb.
AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014                                                                         15


   3.5.5. Final reports provide required information not previously reported and close
   event/incident reporting. All Final reports will end with the applicable statement, “No
   further information will be provided through OPREP-3 channels” in the Event Detail section
   (T-2). Reports are not authorized to be closed prior to answering questions from the
   querying HHQ element (T-2). Final reports are posted in Jabber PRIOR to posting in
   SKIWeb (T-2).
   3.5.6. Upgrading OPREP-3s. Units will upgrade OPREP-3Bs if follow-up information to an
   event/incident meets the criteria of a higher-level report (e.g., BEELINE to PINNACLE) (T-
   1). In the upgraded Initial report, provide all previously reported information and known
   facts. The DTG for the subject line of the upgraded report will be the time the information
   was received that made the report a PINNACLE (T-1). The upgraded report will reference
   the original report’s DTG (T-1). The original (lower-level) report automatically closes upon
   submission of the upgraded (higher-level) report.
       3.5.6.1. MAJCOM-level reports (e.g., Commander’s Critical Information Requirements
       [CCIR] or equivalent) are not OPREP-3s and will not follow “upgrading OPREP-3”
       guidance (T-1). When information from a MAJCOM report meets OPREP-3 criteria, the
       report will be submitted as an Initial OPREP-3 (T-1).
3.6. Synchronous reporting processes. Synchronous communication is where all parties
involved in the communication are present at the same time (an event). The primary medium for
transmitting all OPREP-3 synchronous reports is SIPRNET Jabber. The alternate means for
submitting a synchronous report is secure phone through the MAJCOM to the AF Watch.
Tertiary means is SIPRNET email. Do not delay the initial Jabber notification to obtain
additional information. The initial Jabber notification time is the time inputted into the system.
Use Follow-Up notifications and reporting to provide additional information as it becomes
available. AF Watch/MAJCOMs assess unit reports for possible higher category reporting
requirements.
   3.6.1. Units submitting an OPREP-3 Jabber report will enter it into the “af.watch” room.
   See Paragraph 3.5. for proper report construction (T-1). Units will be logged in to Jabber as
   “Unit (Rank/Name)” (T-2).
   3.6.2. AF Watch and MAJCOM Command Centers will acknowledge wing/unit reports
   within 5 minutes of the posting (T-2). Acknowledgement can be in any hierarchy order. In
   the event that a HHQ element does not acknowledge within 5 minutes, the wing/unit will
   contact their parent MAJCOM Command Center for assistance (T-2). HHQs will then
   provide acknowledgement through Jabber. AF Watch is the highest level of required
   acknowledgement regardless of report type.
       3.6.2.1. AF Watch will make an initial acknowledgement of “AFSWC Acknowledges
       Receipt, Standby” (T-1). Units will continue to monitor the af.watch room after
       submitting a report until both the MAJCOM and AF Watch have received required
       information (T-1). Units will NOT submit their asynchronous report until cleared by the
       AF Watch (T-1). The AF Watch clears units by entering the phrase: “AF has no further
       questions, post your report in SKIWeb within 1 hour and notify this office once it is
       posted”. This serves as the official AF approval time. Units will make corrections (if
       any), include information requested by AF Watch and MAJCOMs, and post the report in
       SKIWeb (T-1).
 16                                                                   AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014


   3.6.3. AF Watch immediately relays OPREP-3Ps to the NMCC without delay or questions
   (T-0). Once the PINNACLE report is posted, the AF Watch and MAJCOM may ask
   questions or get clarification on the situation.
   3.6.4. Units may submit exercise OPREP-3s to the AF Watch at any time using the
   “AF.Exercise” Jabber room. When mission dictates, the AF Watch attempts to reply to
   exercise messages and provide feedback on reports submitted. All exercise reports must state
   “EXERCISE” at the beginning and end of the report.
3.7. Asynchronous Reports. Asynchronous communication does not require that all parties
involved in the communication be present and available at the same time. Examples of this
include email (the receiver does not have to be logged on when the sender sends the email
message), discussion boards, which allow conversations to evolve and community to develop
over a period of time. Units will submit an asynchronous report using SKIWeb for all OPREP-
3s (T-1).
   3.7.1. Reports should contain (as known at the time) the who, what, when, where, how,
   operational impact, media applicability, and other pertinent information of the event/incident
   being reported based on available information. Units will include any updated information
   gathered after the initial Jabber notification without exceeding the time criteria (T-1). Do not
   delay asynchronous reporting to obtain additional information (T-1).
      3.7.1.1. Appropriate Report Content. While the narrative section of each report must
      clearly convey the details of the incident, reports will not be personally identifiable to an
      individual (T-0). To ensure anonymity, reports may contain:
          3.7.1.1.1. Rank, age, gender, marital status, number and age of dependents, duty
          status (e.g., active duty, ARC [whether on orders or not], DoD civilian status), and
          assigned unit/agency.
          3.7.1.1.2. Names cannot be included in OPREP-3s, except for the following: Name,
          title, and 10-digit DSN number of a POC for a report (Civilian Personnel, Safety,
          SFS, etc.), name of a public figure whose death occurs on an Air Force installation, or
          the name of a deceased/retired AF VIP (i.e., flag officer or Chief Master Sergeant of
          the Air Force [CMSAF]).
          3.7.1.1.3. Aircraft type, tail number, owning unit, aircrew unit and squadron, type
          mission, and mission number for all reports involving AF owned, contracted, or
          operated aircraft.
      3.7.1.2. Inappropriate Report Content. Although the narrative section of each report
      must clearly convey the details of the incident, it will not include (T-1):
          3.7.1.2.1. Any speculation regarding responsibility, failure of equipment or facilities,
          legal liability, or causes (except when the cause of death is known).
          3.7.1.2.2. Quotations or opinions from witnesses or other privileged sources.
          3.7.1.2.3. Use of personally identifiable information to include name (see exceptions
          above), social security number (SSN), or home address. If HHQ requires
          names/SSN, they will request it as an addendum separate from the OPREP-3, and

AFI10-206 11 JUNE 2014                                                                     17


   3.7.2. SKIWeb Corrected reports will be sent when factual data needs to be corrected (T-1).
   Corrected reports should be entered into SKIWeb by selecting the “Add a Blog” feature.
   OPREP-3 Corrected reports should be in sentence case. The first line of the Corrected
   report, in the Event Detail line, should state:             “Correction to OPREP-3 B/P
   DDHHMMZMMMYYYY report”. Retyping the report is not the intent. Include only
   corrected information, but enough to aid the reader in understanding what was corrected.
3.8. Synchronous (Jabber)/Asynchronous (SKIWeb) Outages.
   3.8.1. Jabber Outage:
      3.8.1.1. Notify the next HHQ that has access to Jabber for input (NAF, MAJCOM
      Command Center, AF Watch) (T-1).
      3.8.1.2. In the event of an AF-wide Jabber outage, units will contact their HHQ to
      convene a voice conference with AF Watch (T-1).
   3.8.2. SKIWeb Outage:
      3.8.2.1. If Jabber is functional, post report to Jabber and state that the unit is
      experiencing a SKIWeb outage. The applicable MAJCOM Command Center or AF
      Watch (as applicable to FOA/DRUs) will post the report to SKIWeb. If the SKIWeb
      outage is AF-wide, the wing/unit will upload all reports submitted during the outage to
      SKIWeb upon system return (T-1).
      3.8.2.2. If SKIWeb and Jabber are both NOT functional, the unit will contact their
      MAJCOM to convene a conference with the AF Watch and voice the report (T-1). Once
      the report has been voiced, the unit will follow-up with an email (record copy) on
      SIPRNET to next HHQ that has access to SKIWeb for input (T-1).
      3.8.2.3. If SIPRNET outage is AF-wide, the unit will submit reports via secure telephone
      conference with the MAJCOM and AF Watch (NMCC as required) (T-0). Initial voice
      conferences will cover both the voice and record copy reports. The wing/unit will upload
      all reports submitted during the outage to SKIWeb upon system return (T-1).
   3.8.3. Regardless of the outage, the AF Watch immediately relays all PINNACLE reports to
   the NMCC. For reports requiring voice notification within a 5-minute time limit, the AF
   Watch will connect the NMCC with the reporting unit’s conference (T-0).
3.9. CSAF Special Reporting Items (CSAF-SRI). These are events/incidents that are of
personal interest to the CSAF/SECAF. The AF Watch updates the CSAF OPREP Reporting
Matrix when directed by the CSAF. AF/A3O will distribute a C2 CIF with specific reporting
criteria for the CSAF-SRIs. CSAF-SRIs remain in effect until superseded or rescinded.

                    COMMANDER'S SITUATION REPORT (SITREP)

4.1. Subject and Purpose. To keep the MAJCOMs, services, Joint Staff, and SECDEF
apprised of existing political, military, and operational situations/plans and to keep commanders
advised of a unit’s ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans. The SITREP is a
narrative report that informs and enables higher levels of command to evaluate resources and
prepare for potential effects of ongoing situations. The commander or designated alternate is
responsible for timely and accurate SITREP reporting (T-1).
   4.1.1. Situation reporting will be accomplished for, but not limited to, the following (T-1):
   4.1.2. Involvement in critical national or international situations
   4.1.3. Involvement in natural or manmade disasters and/or emergency-relief efforts
   4.1.4. Significant operational deficiencies that affect mission readiness
   4.1.5. Other activities or ongoing operations to include DSCA. All DSCA events should be
   reported as described in Chapter 6.
   4.1.6. Units receiving aircraft or personnel due to natural disaster evacuations
   4.1.7. When directed by a HHQ (COCOM, JS, HAF, MAJCOM)
4.2. Submitted By. Commanders at all levels will submit SITREPs when on-going events
warrant (T-1).
4.3. Submitted To. SITREPs are provided to the MAJCOM and AF Watch. The AF Watch
transmits SITREPs to the NMCC for JS directed reports. Units follow COCOM guidance when
directed to submit SITREPs to a COCOM (T-1).
4.4. Submission Timing. If submission timing is not directed by HHQ, reports are submitted
daily for the duration of the activity or operation. Unless specified otherwise by a combatant
commander directive, submit reports no later than 0800Z, reflecting data current as of 0600Z (T-
1).
4.5. Submission. The primary means for transmitting SITREPs is via MS Word or Adobe PDF
file in SKIWeb. Units will format the subject line of the SITREP IAW Paragraph 4.7.1 (T-1).
Units will post the SITREP as an attachment to an event (similar to OPREP-3 submission) (T-1).
When posting a SITREP in SKIWeb, units use the subject line of the SITREP in the Event Title
section and copy the Commanders Evaluation (Comments) from the SITREP and paste them into
the Event Text block. The SITREP is added as an attachment.
   4.5.1. After posting the record copy SITREP in SKIWeb, units enter the Subject Line of the
   report in Jabber and state the report has been posted to SKIWeb. Refer to Paragraph 4.7.1.
   for subject line format.
   4.5.2. When primary means are unavailable, transmit reports via SIPRNET email to the
   MAJCOM and AF Watch.

 HURRICANE CONDITION/TROPICAL CYCLONE CONDITIONS OF READINESS
                  (HURCON/TCCOR) REPORTING

5.1. OPREP-3B Hurricane/Tropical Cyclone (Typhoon) Conditions of Readiness
(HURCON/TCCOR). The terms “Hurricane” and “Typhoon” are regional specific names for
strong tropical cyclones with wind speed greater than 74 mph. In the Atlantic Ocean or the
Eastern Pacific Ocean (east of the international dateline) the storm is called a “Hurricane.” In
the Western Pacific Ocean (west of the dateline) the storm is called a “Typhoon.”
5.2. Conditions of readiness are outlined in AFMAN 10-2504; refer to this instruction for
specific HURCON/TCCOR responses for units.
5.3. OPREP-3B initial report will be submitted when a commander directs a change in
readiness condition (T-1). Follow-Up reports will be submitted for each subsequent change and
when the following actions have been directed (T-1).
   5.3.1. Aircraft and/or Personnel Evacuation Decision, The time the decision was made; time
   when evacuation begins; the HURCON/TCCOR status; any updates or reference to the
   evacuation plan. Reported as a Follow-Up report to the OPREP-3 HURCON/ TCCOR
   Change.
   5.3.2. Aircraft and/or Personnel Evacuation Started. The time evacuation began; the
   HURCON/TCCOR status; any updates or references to the evacuation plan. Report the
   status of evacuees and shelter-in-place personnel prior to and after a natural disaster, IAW
   the guidelines in AFI 36-3803, Personnel Accountability in Conjunction with Natural
   Disasters or National Emergencies. Do not initiate a dual/separate report for Aircraft and/or
   Personnel Evacuation. Units will report the evacuation as a Follow-Up report to the Initial
   OPREP-3 HURCON/TCCOR (T-1).
5.3.3. Aircraft and/or Personnel Evacuation Complete. Report the time when all aircraft are at
the designated refuge base; any updates as required. Reported as Follow-Up report.
   5.3.4. Aircraft Reconstitution and/or Personnel Return to home station. Report the time
   when all aircraft have returned to home station. Report when personnel have been cleared to
   return to home station. Reported as Follow-Up or Final once reconstitution is complete.
5.4. General Reporting:
   5.4.1. Each event of the same HURCON/TCCOR is reported as Follow-Up reports rather
   than separate reports.
   5.4.2. Consolidation of Reports. When events outpace the decision process, merge reports
   when possible (i.e., HURCON declaration with evacuation decision). If there are 4 hours or
   more between stages, do not consolidate reports.
   5.4.3. The HURCON/TCCOR reports are exempt from Paragraph 3.5.3.1. “seven-day close-
   out” policy.
   5.4.4. Report templates are provided in Figure 5.1 and 5.2.

                DEFENSE SUPPORT TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES (DSCA)

6.1. Guide for Reporting Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). AF response to civil
authorities will fall into four categories (T-1):
   6.1.1. Defense Support Memorandum (DSM). For routine MOU/A support (Security
   Forces response, paramedic request, fire support, etc.), reports will be submitted on the fifth
   duty day of the new quarter to the AF Watch by MAJCOM/DRU/FOA Command Centers.
   MAJCOM/DRU/FOA Command Centers will determine how the quarterly information is
   compiled from their units. For DSM MOU/As that have the potential to receive national
   news media attention or require a known reimbursement cost associated with directed
   actions, reports will be submitted within 2 hours of initiation of support and every 24 hours
   thereafter until support is complete.
   6.1.2. DEFENSE SUPPORT IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (DSIR). Will be submitted within
   2 hours of initiation of support and every 24 hours thereafter until support is complete.
   6.1.3. Defense Support Presidential Directive (DSPD) to include 10-day rule, will be
   submitted within 6 hours of initiation of support and every 24 hours thereafter until support is
   complete.
   6.1.4. Defense Support National Special (DSNS) Security Event. Will be submitted within 2
   hours of initiation of support and every 24 hours thereafter until support is complete.
6.2. Refer to DoDD 3025. 1, Military Support to Civilian Authorities, DoDD 3025.15,
Military Assistance to Civilian Authorities, and AFI 10-801, Defense Support to Civil
Authorities, for a more detailed description of DSCA events.
   6.2.1. Units report all DSCA (with the exception of routine DSM MOU/A) events via
   SKIWeb, and notify the AF Watch in Jabber that a DSCA has been posted to SKIWeb (T-1).
   6.2.2. Submit a follow up message in SKIWeb as significant changes or circumstances occur
   (T-1).
   6.2.3. Assets utilized for more than 24 hours and/or if media attention occurs, require a
   Follow-Up DSCA report once daily until the DSCA event is terminated or the asset returns to
   home base/installation (T-1).
   6.2.4. If no change has occurred, a blog entry in SKIWeb stating “No changes in last 24
   hours” will be made; Jabber notification is not required for a “No change” update (T-1).
   6.2.5. All DSCA messages will have AF Watch, Air Force National Security Emergency
   Preparedness, and parent MAJCOM selected as an “Affected Area” in SKIWeb (T-1).
   6.2.6. During synchronous (Jabber)/asynchronous (SKIWeb) outages, submit DSCA reports
   IAW Paragraph 3.8.(T-1).
6.3. DSCA Report Format/ Construction. Use template in Figure 6.1. to construct DSCA
reports. All Bolded items will be included in the report body. Units will use “N/A” when
information is not applicable (T-1).

                              CRESCENT EDGE (OPREP-3CE)

7.1. Purpose. Used to immediately notify the Joint Staff, or Air Force, of significant activities
involving Special Access Programs (SAPs) operating IAW AFI 16-701, Special Access
Programs (SAP). Affected unit CPs will submit voice reports through normal CP channels (T-
1). The flag words BEELINE and PINNACLE are used to reference the SAP management level
to be contacted. Regardless of the SAP management level, AF Watch addresses SAF/AAZ (Air
Force Special Access Program Central Office). MAJCOMs establish procedures for contacting
program managers at and below the MAJCOM level.
   7.1.1. The AF OPREP-3CE report allows units operating SAPs to use the operational
   reporting channel to advise their program managers of events or incidents that meet OPREP-
   3 reporting criteria. The OPREP-3CE report is the single reporting channel for all SAP units
   reporting incidents to HHQ. An OPREP-3CE report is submitted when an authorized
   individual from the unit has determined an event or incident involving a SAP warrants
   higher-level awareness. OPREP-3CE voice reports are forwarded through CP channels to
   MAJCOM Command Centers and the AF Watch.
   7.1.2. The unit with the SAP, not the CP, initiates OPREP-3CE reporting. The initiating unit
   notifies the CP of an OPREP-3CE report to be submitted. No program names or incident
   details are included in the report. The CP sends the report up the chain to the appropriate
   level. It is the reporting unit’s responsibility, to determine the level of report to provide all
   information. After report submission CP performs no other action (T-3).
   7.1.3. AF OPREP-3CE will not be reported via synchronous (Jabber)/asynchronous
   (SKIWeb) means (T-1). CPs upchannel OPREP-3CE through voice conference with
   MAJCOM and AF Watch. The only information passed in the voice conference is the name,
   contact number and office symbol of the person initiating the report and contact information
   of the program manager if different from initiator (T-1).
