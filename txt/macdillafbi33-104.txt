           like displays and hands-free operation, are available. The difference between the price of the
           standard equipment configuration and any enhanced equipment will be borne by the customer.

           phone contract. To request new or change in service, a Requirements Document (AF Form

           commander's signature is required in the User’s Approval Authority block of the form. Prior to
           requesting service, contact the 6th Communications Squadron at 8-5000 to receive up-to-date
           purchase options and assistance with the Requirements Document. Accessories to include bat-

           Document approval process via IMPAC card.
           3.1.3.4. Specialized Services: Any service that consumes a finite asset such as Trunk Ports,
           memory intensive feature, etc., will be charged a prorated service charge to offset the cost of
           expanding the asset.
           3.1.3.5. Basic telephone services and equipment are provided to all 6 AMW users at no cost.
           Tenant organizations are required to fund for any and all services not covered by their respec-
           tive host tenant support agreements. New construction projects must fund for premise wiring,
           instruments, and line cards for the telephone switch. All projects requiring communication
           connectivity to the base cable infrastructure must include funding for all communications
           needs. Projects requiring communications outside the scope of the contract must be factored in
           when requesting service for new facilities. The 6 CS acts as the executive agent for communi-
           cation services for newly or projected new constructed facilities.
   3.2. All unofficial (commercial) service is provided by Verizon. This includes all on-base housing.
   Procedures for purchasing service through Verizon may be obtained by contacting the Base Housing
   Office.

4. Limitations/Restrictions. Only representatives of the telephone company or representatives of the
Telephone Systems Team are authorized to alter, move, or make any changes to telephone facilities and
equipment. USSOCOM subscriber equipment alterations or moves will be handled through the USSO-
COM helpdesk at 8-7090.

5. Digging Permits. To help protect the base cable distribution, all personnel will process two copies of
AF Form 103, Base Civil Engineering Work Clearance Request, and provide drawings of the proposed
work site to Cable Maintenance (6 CS/SCMTK) 72 hours (3 duty days) prior to any digging or action that
will disturb the earth at a depth over 4 inches. If work is not started within 30 days of obtaining approval,
the request must be resubmitted.

6. Telephone Directory. Instructions on submission of data for directories as well as distribution are
contained in MACDI 33-111, Base Telephone Directory.

7. Unofficial Long Distance Calls. Under no circumstances will the base telephone system be used to
place unofficial long distance telephone calls or to receive personal collect calls with the intent of avoid-
ing payment of long distance toll charges; nor will personal calls be placed from another number and
billed to an 840-XXXX number. All such instances can be traced to the offending party, and appropriate
actions under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice will be recommended to the appropriate com-
mander.
