                               PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. This publication sets forth policies and establishes procedures either not covered
by AE 190-1/USAFE 31-202, Driver and Vehicle Requirements and the Installation Traffic

conjunction with AFI 31-218(I), AFMAN 31-116 and AE 190-1/USAFE Instruction 31-202.
Realistic "rules of the road" are designed to encourage voluntary compliance with traffic laws
and regulations by all pedestrians and operators of motor vehicles (including automobiles,
motorcycles, motor scooters and mopeds) and bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, and in-line
skates. All pedestrians and operators are personally responsible for obeying traffic rules on all
military installations under the control of the 86 AW. Violation of this code provides a basis for
disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for personnel subject to
its provisions, as well as appropriate action under other regulations and directives of personnel
not subject to the UCMJ.
1.2. Applicability. Operation of motor vehicles is a privilege granted by the 86 AW/CC under
the provisions contained within this code as derived from the German Motor Vehicle Code and
AE 190-1/USAFE Instruction 31-202.

     Police Squadron (569 USFPS) commanders have joint overall responsibility for
     implementing the traffic code for their respective area of operations. Both units are
     responsible for ensuring the traffic code is reviewed annually and updated as needed In
     Accordance With (IAW) AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
     1.3.3. The 86 SFS has responsibility for managing the Reports and Analysis (S5R) function
     for Ramstein Air Base (RAB), as well as the enforcement of the traffic code within the
     confines of RAB.
     1.3.4. The 569 USFPS is responsible for the enforcement of the traffic code on all other Air
     Force military installations in the KMC. In addition, the 569 USFPS is responsible for the
     enforcement of traffic codes for the following areas: Theater Logistics Support Center –
     Europe (TLSC-E) access road from B-37 to the bridge just south of B-40. Sembach Kaserne
     (SK) to include the Main Gate access road (from L-393 to SK Main Gate). RAB East Gate
     access road: L-369 from K-22/Jacob-Pfeifferstrasse traffic circle to RAB East Gate turnoff.
     Any remaining US military facilities in Pirmasens to include: Pirmasens medical depot; K-
     25 from the East Gate traffic circle to the entrance to Rodenbach village (along the perimeter
     fence of the Weilerbach Munitions Storage Area); and all facilities contained on KMC US
     Army Kasernes, Air Force installations, or other geographically separated facilities. The 569
     USFPS is also responsible for managing the S5R function for its area of responsibility as

  outlined above. The 86 SFS is the primary agency for the West Gate access road and the L-
  369/Enhanced Large Vehicle Inspection Site (ELVIS) Gate access road. Pursuant to the
  Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), 569 USFPS personnel have the right to stop
  USAREUR-plated vehicles while traveling on roads outside of U.S. military installations if
  they:
     1.3.4.1. Present a clear and immediate danger to self and/or others (e.g., drunk driving).
     1.3.4.2. Create a severe traffic hazard (e.g., driving the wrong way on an autobahn exit
     ramp).
  1.3.5. The 86th Airlift Wing Safety Office (86 AW/SE) is responsible for initiating activities

 NOTE: This matrix reflects standards established in Air Force and Army guidance that are
 common occurrences in the KMC area. For any other questionable offenses not covered,
 refer to AER 190-1/USAFEI 31-202.
86AWI31-201 13 AUGUST 2012                                                                      9


   2.1.1. Pursuant to AER 190-1/USAFEI 31-202, Chapter 2-11, paragraph a, all persons who
   have a U.S. Forces certificate of license or who operate a POV are understood to have given
   their consent to chemical tests for alcohol or other drugs on their breath or in their blood or
   urine if lawfully stopped apprehended, or cited for any offense allegedly committed while
   driving or otherwise in physical control of a motor vehicle. The chemical test, administered
   by either U.S. Forces or German civil authorities, is sufficient evidence for action.
2.2. Standards. In addition to the standards outlined in AFI 31-218(I) and AFMAN 31-116
(specific AF guidance) governing driving suspensions and revocations, the 86 AW has adopted
the guidance outlined in AER 190-1/USAFEI 31-202 in regards to suspension and revocation
conditions and periods (Ch. 2-14, 2-15), unless otherwise indicated in this instruction.
   2.2.1. Revoking authorities will declare a person ineligible for a U.S. Forces certificate of
   license for at least 90 days for operating a USAREUR-plated vehicle without a valid U.S.
   Forces certificate of license. Guidance for new arrivals to USAFE/USAREUR can be found
   in paragraph 4.1.1.
   2.2.2. Individuals who are stopped for operating a motor vehicle without their issued U.S.
   Forces certificate of license, vehicle registration, or proof of insurance in their possession
   will be issued a fix-it ticket and will have 3 duty days to amend the infraction.
   2.2.3. A minimum of a 15 day suspension of on and off base driving privileges will be
   issued to any individual who knowingly allows a Non-U.S. Forces certificate of licensed
   driver to operate a USAREUR-plated vehicle. This is a discretionary suspension, and can be
   increased to a maximum of 180 days, depending on the circumstances surrounding the
   situation/incident, as determined by the suspending authority.
   2.2.4. A Non-USAREUR licensed operator may operate a USAREUR-plated vehicle while
   accompanied by a U.S. Forces certificate of licensed driver who is annotated on the vehicle
   registration, IAW AER 190-1/USAFEI 31-202, Ch. 4-10, para. a(4). This only applies to
   non-sponsored visitors. These individuals must have valid drivers licenses that are
   recognized by German authorities. All personnel and family stationed in Germany must have
   a U.S. forces certificate of license in order to operate a vehicle.
   2.2.5. Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), and Blood-
   Alcohol Content (BAC) standards detailed in AFI 31-218(I), Ch. 4-11 will be utilized, along
   with suspension guidelines outlined in AER 190-1/USAFEI 31-202, Ch. 2-14 and 2-15.
   When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the
   effective date should be the same as the date of the conviction or seizure of the U.S. Forces
   certificate of license.
   2.2.6. Driving Under the Influence (DUI):
      2.2.6.1. If the percentage is more than 0.05 BrAC (0.5 per mille) but less than 0.08 BrAC
      (0.79 per mille), presume the person may be impaired. This standard may be considered
      with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
      influence of alcohol.
      2.2.6.2. A 90-day suspension of on base driving privileges for the first offense, and a one
      year suspension for a second offense.
   2.2.7. Driving While Intoxicated (DWI):
 10                                                           86AWI31-201 13 AUGUST 2012


       2.2.7.1. If the percentage is 0.08 BrAC (0.79 per mille) or more, or if tests reflect the
       presence of illegal drugs, the person was driving while intoxicated.
       2.2.7.2. A one year revocation of on and off base driving privileges for the first offense
       and a five year revocation for a second offense.
   2.2.8. Driving while a driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension
   or revocation will result in a mandatory 2-year revocation on determination of facts by the
   installation commander or his/her designee. For Army personnel, this will result in a
   mandatory 5-year revocation.
   2.2.9. Refusal to submit to or failure to complete any requested chemical test by authorities
   will result in a mandatory 1-year revocation on determination of facts by the installation
   commander or his/her designee.
   2.2.10. The Installation Commander or designee may impose more stringent periods of
   suspensions as deemed appropriate for the offense(s).
2.3. Reports to the USAREUR Registrar. Any authority who assesses traffic points, or who
suspends, revokes, or declares a person ineligible for a USAREUR Privately Owned Vehicle,
(POV) driver’s license, will immediately report the action to the appropriate S5R. When a
temporary suspension is based on physical or mental disability, the physician’s statement will
accompany the report. For revocations, the individual’s USAREUR POV driver’s license must
accompany the report.
2.4. U. S. Forces Certificate of License Suspension/Revocation Procedures:
   2.4.1. When issuing DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, the patrolman will write
   special instructions on the back of the pink copy which is given to the violator if he/she
   wishes to rebut the ticket. Additionally, the violator will notify their Commander or First
   Sergeant within 24 hours or the next duty day that they have received a ticket. In cases
   involving immediate suspension of driving privileges, the patrolman will issue a Notice of
   Suspension Letter not to exceed 45 days with the DD Form 1408. NOTE: All attempts to
   protect Privacy Act information will be made when issuing a ticket to an unoccupied vehicle.
   2.4.2. SFS/S5R personnel will provide the violator instructions and a template for a written
   rebuttal (See Attachment 1). Inform the violator that their commander must endorse written
   rebuttal for infractions the violator wishes to rebut.
   2.4.3. Unit commanders and first sergeants are notified via email of all traffic tickets given
   to unit members/family members. Commanders’ action is not required for traffic tickets, but
   is required for violations issued as a result of a major or minor traffic accident. Refer to
   chapter 5.5 and 5.6 for major/minor traffic accidents.
   2.4.4. The suspending or revoking authority will evaluate each case to determine appropriate
   action. Only pertinent facts may be used to determine the appropriate action to be taken. An
   individual’s character or service record will not be used to determine action. Once a decision
   is made to impose administrative sanctions, the suspending or revoking authority will:
       2.4.4.1. Suspend the person's driving privileges pending the outcome of rebuttal/appeal
       proceedings.
86AWI31-201 13 AUGUST 2012                                                                      11


      2.4.4.2. Once the rebuttal proceedings are completed, the suspending or revoking
      authority will notify the appropriate S5R. S5R will notify the USAREUR Registry of
      Motor Vehicles (RMV) in writing of the action taken.
          2.4.4.2.1. Do not notify USAREUR RMV when suspending an individual’s on base
          driving privileges.
      2.4.4.3. In cases where the individual is charged with operating a POV with a BAC of
      0.5 mg (0.05 g/100 ml) or more per 1.0 ml (0.10g/l00 ml) of whole blood, or while under
      the influence of any controlled substance, a review must be completed. If a
      determination is made that the person was not operating the POV or the BAC results
      were incorrect or invalid, the individual’s license should be not suspended or revoked.
2.5. Traffic Ticket Rebuttal/Administrative Hearing Procedures:
   2.5.1. Individual must notify S5R within five duty days from the issuance of a suspension
   letter or a traffic ticket to request procedures for submitting a rebuttal package or request an

      warranting a suspension will automatically have the violation applied to their drivers
      record and points will be applied (if applicable).
   2.5.2. S5R will provide the offender with instructions on how to rebut a ticket and how to
   appeal rebuttal results through an administrative hearing. The appeal must be coordinated
   through the individuals unit commander, Division Chief or equivalent. The unit commander

      endorsement is to ensure commander-level involvement.
      2.5.2.2. S5R compiles all documentation (traffic ticket, driving record, statements, etc.)
      and forwards via electronic staff summary sheet to the SFS/CC and 86 AW/JA for review
      and legal opinion. The appeal package is then forwarded to 86 MSG/CD for an
      administrative hearing.
      2.5.2.3. 86 MSG/CD will inform S5R of the decision. S5R will inform offenders unit of
      either the appeal was denied and of effective suspension dates, or if the appeal was

                                   RULES OF THE ROAD

4.1. Overview. Personnel stationed in Germany will not operate their vehicles with stateside
license plates. USAREUR license plates, insurance, and U.S. forces certificate of license are
required prior to operating a vehicle.
   4.1.1. Commanders or their designees may, on a case-by-case basis, grant an exception to
   policy for new arrivals without a U.S. Forces certificate of license to drive only the class of
   vehicles indicated on their stateside drivers license only in Germany for up to 30 days when
   both of the following requirements are met:
       4.1.1.1. The new arrival previously had a U.S. Forces certificate of license or, based on
       his or her position or age, is considered to be mature and responsible.
       4.1.1.2. The new arrival has a valid U.S. drivers license and either an international
       drivers permit or an official German translation of a U.S. drivers license. However, if an
       individual, during the 30-day exception period, takes the drivers examination and fails the
       test, this voids the commander’s exception to policy. The individual will also be
       prohibited from driving until they have passed the required examination.
       4.1.1.3. Refer to AER 190-1/USAFEI 31-202, Ch. 2-1, para. c for specifications
       concerning the exception to policy letter.

   Germany and in possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license may operate a rental or
   government vehicle for up to 30 days. Any TDY over 30 days requires a USAREUR license.
   An international drivers permit is recommended but not mandatory. Personnel may also take
   the driver’s test to obtain a U.S. Forces certificate of license to operate a U.S. Forces-
   registered POV. All TDY members are highly encouraged to watch an orientation video
   provided by 86 VRS, Office of Records and Licensing.
   4.1.3. Individuals who are stopped for operating a motor vehicle without a U.S. forces
   certificate of license, vehicle registration, or proof of insurance in their possession will be
   issued a fix-it ticket and will have 3 duty days to amend the infraction. If the individual is
   operating a vehicle and does not posses a U.S. forces certificate of license, the operator will
   be declared ineligible for a license for at least 90 days.
   4.1.4. All construction projects affecting the flow of traffic on Kapuan Air Station (KAS),

   pedestrians by sounding the horn.
4.3. Traffic Complaints. Traffic tickets will not be issued on any Air Force installation within
the KMC for reported traffic violations that are not verified or witnessed by on-duty SF
personnel. For incidents involving USAREUR plated vehicles occurring on or off the

no fatalities/injuries and when it would be reasonable to assume that the cost to repair any
vehicle/property damage is less than $9999. Operators are responsible for exchanging all
pertinent information. Security Forces may respond to minor traffic accidents if not on higher
priority responses. In cases where they are not able to respond, personnel will be directed to the

   should report the accident to the nearest military law enforcement agency if possible. If it is
   not possible to report it, operators must report the accident immediately upon return. In this
   case members must attempt to get the responding police officer’s name and the name of the
   Police station from which that officer responded.
   5.4.5. Off-base traffic accidents are investigated by German Polizei, and Security Forces

7.1. Purpose and Scope. The Parking Monitor program assists local Security Forces/Military
Police by citing parking violators in the immediate vicinity of their facility. Failure to follow
established procedures outlined in this instruction may lead to removal from the Parking Monitor
Program. Select Parking Monitors (E-5 or above) may be authorized by their commanders to
issue traffic tickets for certain non-moving violations.
   7.1.1. The 86 SFS/S5L has the responsibility of training Parking Monitors within the
   confines of Ramstein Air Base, and the 569 USFPS/S5L has the responsibility of training
   Parking Monitors for all other KMC Air Force installations. The appropriate S5L office is
   responsible for providing Traffic Ticket Books and Abandoned Vehicle Notices to appointed
   Parking Monitors. Each S5L office will also maintain current unit delegation letters on file.
   7.1.2. A facility manager may, in writing, request to be appointed as a parking monitor to
   write parking traffic tickets only at their facility. Only two parking monitors are authorized
   per facility. Facility managers must submit the appointment letter to the appropriate S5L for
   training. Family Housing Area Leaders or Building Leaders issue traffic tickets within their
   assigned areas. Parking monitors must have at least one (1) year retainability in order to be
   appointed.

   returned to S5L and forwarded to the S5R section with a concise typed letter annotating why
   the traffic ticket is to be voided. DO NOT throw the traffic ticket away.
   7.3.2. Parking Monitors will only issue parking traffic tickets in the parking lot(s) for which
   they are authorized. They will not issue traffic tickets in parking lots where they have no
   jurisdiction or authority. The appropriate S5L will brief Parking Monitors on their area of
   responsibility and will ensure traffic tickets issued are issued in the assigned area of
   responsibility.
       7.3.2.1. When issuing DD Form 1408, the Parking Monitor will write special instructions
       on the back of the pink copy for the violator, to contact SFS/S5R if he/she whishes to
       rebut the traffic ticket. The violator will notify their Commander or First Sergeant within
       24 hours or next duty day.
       7.3.2.2. If violators wish to rebut a Parking Monitor’s ticket, he/she will have 5 duty
       days of receipt of the traffic ticket to contact the Security Forces Administration and
       Reports Branch (SFS/S5R) in person, to rebut the traffic ticket. SFS/S5R will obtain a
       written statement from the Parking Monitor who issued the traffic ticket for inclusion in
       the rebuttal package.

MEMORANDUM FOR 86 MSG/CD

FROM: DOE, JOHNNY W., 123-34-5678, 123 ABW

SUBJECT: Traffic Citation Rebuttal

1. I am rebutting citation #C123456, illegal parking/handicapped space. On 18 Aug 02, I
operated my green in color, Honda Civic, License plate #AA-000. I was running a little late and
chose to park in a handicapped parking space in front of the Post Office. I was only parked there
for a short time, and I did not think it would matter at 0230 in the morning. The parking lot was
empty, and I honestly believed this short period of time would not hinder anyone. I am
requesting the citation be voided and cleared from my driving record. Thank you.

2. If you have any questions feel free to call me at 480-XXXX.
