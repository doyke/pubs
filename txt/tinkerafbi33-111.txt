      blueprint.
      3.1.2. Establish a competitive contract using AF FORM 9, Request for Purchase, or CSA
      using AF FORM 1218, Request for Communications Service. Headquarters
      38Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group at Tinker AFB OK, is the only current Air
      Force contracting agency for issuing CSAs. A CSA is needed in areas where a public
      utility commission requires tariffed or regulated services (e.g., central office trunking,
      business lines, foreign exchange [FX] service). Ensure funds are available and certified
      prior to contract award. Use AF FORM 1218 to establish new CSAs or to submit changes
      to existing CSAs.
      3.1.3. Solicit and obtain competitive bids or proposals through designated and
      appropriate procurement channels for all voice services.
      3.1.4. Ensure Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Primary Rate Interface (PRI)
      provisions are included for voice network enterprise connections (local, long distance,
      and DSN) in a competitive contract vehicle or CSA.
      3.1.5. Ensure that the special telephone and voice requirements for people with
      disabilities are addressed according to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1194.23 of
      the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, document, December
      21, 2000 (http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm).

4. Competitive Long Distance Voice Service. When Networx (or its designated replacement)
service is not available (e.g., certain outside the continental United States locations), follow the
guidelines in AFI 33-116, Long-Haul Telecommunications Management, to request competitive
long distance voice service.
5. Long Distance Calls from Base Telephones.
     5.1. Use DSN, not commercial long distance carriers, to call other DOD activities unless
     DSN service is not available in a timely manner. Use the DSN system only for official
     business or when in the best interest of the government. DSN is the first choice for all new
     and existing inter-base voice requirements.
     5.2. Networx and International Direct Distance Dialing (ID3) are authorized commercial
     long distance networks.
     5.3. For verification purposes, document all commercial long distance calls on AF Form
     1072, Authorized Long Distance Telephone Calls. This is only required when personal
     identification number (PINs) are not established or the host base doesn’t have a centralized
     TMS capable of capturing the source Caller ID information for each call.
     5.4. Callers without direct long distance dialing capability must request a control or billing
     account number from their TCO. Give the control or billing account number to the base
     switchboard operator.
     5.5. Program all base telephone switches, including contract-maintained and leased
     telephone switches, to block the use of Networx (or its designated replacement) for calling
     local telephone numbers and chargeable directory assistance telephone numbers (e.g., 411).
     Allow the capability to dial commercial directory assistance numbers to the base switchboard
     operators only.
6. Collect Calls to Air Force Installations. The installation commander makes local guidance
for handling incoming official collect calls. If when the wing commander authorizes acceptance
of collect calls, AF Form 1218 must be submitted by the CSO and/or assigned representative to
obtain authorization to ensure contract vehicle is in place to allow payment for collect calls.
7. Personal Calls over Official Telephones. Commanders and supervisors may allow personal
calls during work hours using official telephones if:
     7.1. The telephone call does not interfere with official duties.
     7.2. The calls do not exceed reasonable duration and frequency, and whenever possible, are
     made during the employee’s personal time such as after-duty hours or lunch periods.
     7.3. The telephone calls serve a legitimate public interest (such as usage reduces time away
     from the work area or improves unit morale).
     7.4. The telephone call does not reflect adversely on DOD or the Air Force (e.g., uses
     involving pornography; unofficial advertising, soliciting, or selling; and discussion of
     classified information).
     7.5. The government does not incur any long distance or per-call charges above and beyond
     normal local charges. Determine normal local charges based upon historical averages.
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                 9


   7.6. Networx (or its designated replacement) can be used for urgent emergency personal
   calls. These calls must be cleared through local commanders and supervisors.
8. Official Telephone Service in Personal Quarters.
   8.1. Title 31, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 1348 (31 U.S.C. 1348), Money And
   Finance; The Budget Process; Appropriations; Limitations, Exceptions, And Penalties;
   Telephone installation and charges, permits certain officials to have government-assigned
   telephones installed and maintained in their quarters, if necessary for national defense
   purposes. Limited telephone service for official use may be provided to those officials. Do
   not delegate the authority to designate these personnel to members below wing commanders
   or equivalent levels. Base such designations on functional position and mission impact.
   8.2. Authority to designate official telephones in personal quarters resides with wing
   commanders.
      8.2.1. See Attachment 2 for conditions and arrangements for official telephone service
      in quarters
      8.2.2. Personnel authorized official telephone service in quarters must provide separate
      personal telephone service at his or her own expense from the local commercial
      telephone company or the government-furnished exchange (Class B service).
      8.2.3. When local, unofficial service is not available or the waiting period for service is
      unacceptable, the 72 ABW/SC may waive the requirements to permit dual usage of the
      official telephone. The user must pay:
   8.3. Flexiplace/Telecommunicating Support to Alternative Work Sites. Public Law (PL)
   104-52, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1996,
   Section 620 (Title 31 U.S.C., Section 1348 note), provides that appropriated funds may be
   used to install telephone lines and necessary equipment, and to pay monthly charges in any
   private residence or private apartment of an employee who is authorized to work at home in
   accordance with guidelines issued by the Office of Personnel Management. The head of the
   department, division, bureau, or office must certify that adequate safeguards against private
   misuse exist, and that the service is necessary for direct support of the agency’s mission.
      8.3.1. Unit commanders, in coordination with the local personnel office, may authorize
      personnel to work at an approved flexiplace location. Unit commanders may also
      authorize the installation of a personal computer, applicable software, modems, fax
      machines, and data lines to support access at the alternate work location (PL 104-52.)
      Unit commanders should work with the supporting communications unit to identify the
      necessary support requirements and restrictions.
      8.3.2. The unit commander authorizing the alternate work location must:
          8.3.2.1. Determine government-provided communications service is necessary for
          direct support of the agency’s mission.
          8.3.2.2. Fund necessary equipment and phone lines needed to support the mission.
          8.3.2.3. Make sure the alternate work location is an economical option to having the
          individual work in the office.
          8.3.2.4. Authorize payment for installation and monthly recurring charges.
 10                                                     TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


          8.3.2.5. Certify that adequate monitoring capability and safeguards against private
          misuse exist. Such certification should accompany a signed employee flexiplace
          agreement.
          8.3.2.6. Account for government-provided equipment on a hand receipt and
          inventory annually.
      8.3.3. After approval, base communications units will work with the requiring activity to
      establish the service and required safeguards.
      8.3.4. Because of the restrictions pertaining to the use of appropriated funds to support
      telephone service in private quarters, requesting unit commanders must certify that
      support requested under this provision is for an approved flexiplace location as defined
      by Air Force personnel guidance. Certification must accompany the communications and
      information systems requirement and be retained by the communications office as long as
      service or equipment is provided to the flexi- place location.
9. Official Calling Card Management and Use.
   9.1. The wing commander approves the use of long-distance telephone calling cards on the
   base. This may be delegated to the Base CSO and/or assigned representative.
   9.2. Cardholders must sign the following statement and calling card/credit card issuers must
   keep the signed statement on file as long as the person has the card:
        “I (NAME) acknowledge receiving telephone calling card number
        (NUMBER) on (DATE). I further acknowledge that this card is for official
        use only. I must safeguard this card from loss and fraudulent or unofficial
        use. My failure to do so may result in disciplinary action and direct billing.
        I agree to return the card to the issuing office when I am transferred,
        separated from the service, or no longer require it to perform my official
        duties.”
   9.3. Calling cards are issued for official use only. Cardholders must not use the calling card
   for any purpose other than official use. Military cardholders that use the card for unofficial
   purposes violate employee may result in administrative disciplinary action under AFI 36-704,
   Discipline and Adverse Action.
   9.4. For random verification and audit purposes, each cardholder must provide the TCO with
   sufficient information to complete AF Form 1072 when requested by the TCO or base
   communications unit.
   9.5. Base CSO may permit using calling cards from home station. The host must fund costs
   according to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
   9.5.1. Long-distance telephone calling cards may be used from home station for official
   calls; user determines need.
   9.6. Issue calling cards to government personnel to make official calls from temporary duty
   (TDY) locations that do not have DSN access. This will minimize calls placed through more
   expensive hotel/ motel private branch exchanges (PBX).
   9.7. All host communications units will develop procedures for issuing and recovering
   official calling cards. Maintain a master list of all calling card users on base.
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                11


   9.8. Ensure steps are added to the base/unit out-processing checklist for turn-in of issued
   calling cards.
10. Air Force Guidance on Voice Mail/Messaging Systems.
   10.1. When procuring new or replacement stand-alone Voice Mail/Messaging Systems
   (VMS), installations will integrate with either the base voice system or the telephone service
   provider.
   10.2. Communications units should evaluate the base-wide requirement for voice mail and
   plan for a centralized solution.
   10.3. When evaluating options for satisfying user needs, the analysis must examine service
   and total cost of ownership to acquire, install, and sustain the system over its expected life
   cycle.
   10.4. 72 ABW/SC can approve a waiver to purchase new or expand existing stand-alone
   VMS when the mission and business case is compelling and documented to be the best value
   to the Air Force.
11. Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB) Instruction on Cellular Telephone (CT) Service.
   11.1. Do not use a regular unclassified CT for Command and Control (C2) purposes.
   11.2. Do not transmit classified information over unsecured CTs. Air Force CTs are subject
   to monitoring.
   11.3. CTs should not be used while driving. It is always advisable to pull off the road when
   it is safe to do so and then place the call after stopping the vehicle.
   11.4. For IA purposes, use a regular telephone (land line) as a first priority when and where
   available. Even though land lines are more secure than CT, all classified communications
   should be discussed on a secure telephone (i.e., secure telephone unit [STU] or secure
   telephone equipment [STE]).
   11.5. Use CT services only when it is the most cost-effective way to provide necessary
   communications or mobility is required.
   11.6. In real world situations, cellular devices are unreliable during contingency or
   emergency operations due to system saturation or physical destruction of commercial
   infrastructure.
   11.7. The 72nd Air Base Wing Communications Directorate provides centralized support for
   wireless communication devices such as mobile telephones, blackberries, air cards and
   mobile hotspots. The Air Force Information Technology Commodity Council (ITCC) has
   established enterprise agreements for the acquisition of cellular devices and services from
   major US providers. The 72 ABW/SCOIP base Personal Wireless Communication Systems
   (PWCS) managers (cellular devices) comply with ITCC strategies and use of enterprise
   agreements for purchase of cellular devices and commercial services.
      11.7.1. The summary of service plan options and rates can be found on the AF Portal,
      Air Force Tab (Enterprise IT Initiatives, IT Commodity Council, Cellular Services and
      Devices, Vendor Rate Plans).

     11.7.2. The following actions are required for the procurement and management of these
     devices to ensure wireless services/plans are optimized:
         11.7.2.1. 72 ABW/SC Director or Designated Representative:
             11.7.2.1.1. Appoints, in writing, a primary and alternate unit PWCS manager
             (cellular devices).
             11.7.2.1.2. Revalidates mission needs for cellular telephones experiencing low or
             zero usage levels.
             11.7.2.1.3. Annually revalidates all unit-owned, PWCS assets to determine if
             existing equipment meets known unit mission requirements.
         11.7.2.2. Unit PWCS managers (cellular devices) will work all wireless
         communications matters through the 72 ABW/SCOIP base PWCS managers (cellular
         devices).
             11.7.2.2.1. Unit PWCS managers (cellular devices) appointment and account
             revalidation letters must be accomplished annually and signed by the organization
             commander/director. The revalidation letter must include a current inventory
             printout to include user and device information.
             11.7.2.2.2. The inventory should be compared with current monthly invoices to
             ensure all devices are appropriately accounted for and identified as assigned to
             current Air Force employees.
             11.7.2.2.3. Annual revalidation letters shall be submitted to 72 ABW/SCOIP
             Blackberry and Cell Phone Service workflow NLT 31 May each year.

     should ensure they are included in the unit service plan.
     11.8.5. Third party applications are not approved for use on any government issued
     blackberry device.
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                              13


  11.9. Organizations will submit TAFB Form 3215-2 for new CT equipment and services, to
  72 ABW/SCOII 3215s workflow. Forms will be forwarded to 72 ABW/SCOIP Blackberry
  and Cell Phone workflow for host base approval, technical solution, and/or processing.
  11.10. Each organization shall establish controls needed to ensure cellular devices are
  justified and documented using the TAFB Form 3215-2 requirements process. Each
  organization shall maintain all approved documentation per AFRIMS Records Disposition
  Schedule in order for the accounts to be easily audited and reviewed. Commanders/Directors
  must provide adequate oversight to ensure approved TAFB Form 3215-2 requirement
  documents are maintained as required by AFRIMS.
  11.11. All Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices (blackberries) with email capability
  shall be entered into the IT Asset Inventory Management System (AIM) for accountability
  and tracking purposes. Commanders/Directors must establish procedures to ensure unit
  PWCS managers maintain hand receipts/user agreements for all wireless devices.
  11.12. Cellular telephones, air cards and hot spots must be accounted for using optional
  methods such as spreadsheets or local databases.
  11.13. All users are required to sign consent to monitoring form/user agreement before being
  issued cellular devices. The signed forms must be retained by the unit PWCS managers
  (cellular devices) until six months after device is no longer in use.
  11.14. When PDA devices are lost, damaged, or destroyed, the organization that has
  possession of the property will initiate a Report of Survey (ROS). Contact your unit ROS
  monitor for instructions.
  11.15. Each user assigned a blackberry is required to have a Blackberry Smart Card Reader
  (SCR). The SCR is required for reading/sending encrypted email and signing email via
  blackberry device.
  11.16. Cellular telephones have become commonplace and service costs have decreased. As
  the distinction between how we use CTs and land line telephones blur, it is important to be
  informed of policy and instructions governing the ‘Personal Use of Official Cellular
  Telephones.’
     11.16.1. The same rules that govern use of other Air Force communications apply to use
     of Air Force CTs. Like land line telephones, Air Force CTs are to be used for official and
     authorized purposes. “Official” purposes include any calls in furtherance of the Air
     Force mission. In addition, subject to local command and supervisor restrictions,
     members are authorized to use CTs to make short infrequent personal calls when
     appropriate under the circumstances.
         11.16.1.1. Examples of appropriate calls include notifying family members of
         changes in schedules, checking on medical, school, or childcare appointments, and
         inquiring as to car repair status.
         11.16.1.2. Emergency calls are always authorized.
         11.16.1.3. Examples of inappropriate calls include obscene or harassing calls, calls
         for commercial gain, to conduct personal commercial activities, or personal calls that
         generate more than minimal charges to the government.
 14                                                     TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


          11.16.1.4. Unit commanders may seek reimbursement for additional costs resulting
          from an individual’s personal use of an Air Force CT. Local limitations and cost
          reimbursement policies will be clearly identified to CT users as part of the original
          issue process by the unit PWCS manager (cellular devices)
             11.16.1.4.1. Wings are authorized to manage the reimbursement process for
             “unauthorized personal use” in the most effective manner, while complying with
             the applicable regulations. Wings may also add a processing fee, for the cost to
             the government in processing the cash collection.
             11.16.1.4.2. Members making inappropriate CT calls are subject to disciplinary
             action even if the call does not cause additional expense. Both the UCMJ and
             Civilian Personnel regulations prohibit and provide punishments for inappropriate
             use of government property regardless of cost to the government.
   11.17. Organizations will pay for wireless devices and services using Government Purchase
   Card (GPC) not to exceed $25,000 per transaction, IAW AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-
   wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program.           Provisions that enable decentralized billing to
   individual units are in place.
   11.18. Cellular telephones used outside the US&P must be host nation approved. Consult the
   72 ABW/SCOIP Spectrum Management offices for guidance.
   11.19. Call detail records/bills associated with CTs will be verified in full. Statistical
   sampling is not allowed. This is initiated to focus the user on the danger of cloned phones
   and resultant illegal calls billed to the Air Force.
12. Air Force Instruction on Customer Premise Equipment Maintenance. All Air Force -
owned voice instruments will comply with the following maintenance guidelines:
   12.1. Authorized modification of voice services. Only the voice systems maintenance
   personnel assigned to the host communications unit are authorized to install, relocate,
   modify, or remove voice instruments and services. Non-communications personnel (i.e.,
   customers) are prohibited according to 18 U.S.C., Section 1362, Communication Lines,
   Stations or Systems:
         “Whoever willfully or maliciously injures or destroys or attempts willfully or
         maliciously to injure or destroy any of the works, property, or material of any
         radio, telegraph, telephone or cable, line, station, or system, or other means of
         communication, operated or controlled by the United States, or used or intended
         to be used for military or civil defense functions of the United States, whether
         constructed or in process of construction, or willfully or maliciously interferes
         in any way with the working or use of any such line, or system, or willfully or
         maliciously obstructs, hinders, or delays the transmission of any
         communication over any such line, or system, shall be fined under this title
         or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.”
   12.2. Voice information system customers will submit TAFB Form 3215-2 requests for
   modification of voice services through the unit TCO for approval and subsequent forwarding
   to the requirements processing section of the communications unit.
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                15


13. Special Telephone Features and Services for Specific Base Activities. See Attachment
3.
14. Voice Service for Geographically Separated Units. Small off-base units, such as Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps detachments, get voice services through the commander of a host
support base. The host support base communications unit activity processes bills using a fund
citation provided by the parent MAJCOM.
15. Unofficial Commercial Telephone/Voice Service.
   15.1. In Quarters:
       15.1.1. The base communications unit may install and maintain unofficial wiring
       infrastructure for dormitories, family housing, visiting airmen’s quarters, visiting
       officers’ quarters, temporary lodging facilities, etc., supporting voice services. In
       addition, they may install and maintain wiring to these activities when unusual conditions
       warrant it. See paragraph A2.4 for restrictions on installing and using appropriated
       funding for family housing.
       15.1.2. At locations without a communications unit, the senior ranking individual
       designates a responsible activity to perform these duties except when the host base
       employs local contract service. The base housing manager reimburses authorized
       expenses incurred by military housing occupants. The base may service billeted facilities
       by a base-awarded contract.
       15.1.3. If the housing manager requires it, occupants must restore all telephone wiring
       and outlets to the original configuration before clearing quarters.
       15.1.4. In order to provide dial-tone access to customers in barracks and other unofficial
       facilities on base, appropriated funds may be expended for maintenance and construction
       of infrastructure connecting such sites and the commercial telecommunications service
       provider’s points of presence. Use military family housing (MFH) appropriated funds to
       pay for housing connectivity. Contact HQ AFNIC/JA on issues related to establishing
       minimum points of presence.
       15.1.5. The individual subscriber must pay for renting, acquiring, and maintaining
       equipment, as well as all usage charges for personal telephone service.
   15.2. In Air Force-Owned Facilities Other Than Quarters:
       15.2.1. Subscribers install and maintain new wiring for unofficial service consistent with
       their organizational policy and instruction.
       15.2.2. The subscriber must acquire authorization to install telephone equipment (see
       AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property), where non-Air
       Force-owned wiring exists in or on Air Force real property.
          15.2.2.1. The base CSO and/or assigned representative coordinates all such requests.
          15.2.2.2. Unless specifically approved, the authorization is a permit for DOD
          subscribers and a revocable license for non-DOD subscribers.
 16                                                     TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


       15.2.3. Unless modified by the real estate document (e.g., lease, out grant, etc.) or
       contract, the base CSO and/or assigned representative maintains all permanently installed
       building wiring that existed in the facility before occupancy by the subscriber.

       commissaries.
   16.2. Class B (Unofficial Telephone Service). Telephone service provided by a DOD
   component when used for personal or unofficial purposes is known as Class B telephone
   service. This includes telephone services provided by government-owned or government-
   leased facilities, or procured under contract or implied agreement, with a commercial
   communications company. These services are made available primarily in overseas
   locations, but there is limited use also in the United States. When you obtain these services
   from the government, the subscriber pays all charges according to Title 10 U.S.C., Section
   2686, Armed Forces; General Military Law, Service, Supply, and Procurement; Real
   Property; Related Personal Property; And Lease Of Non-Excess Property; Utilities and
   services: sale; expansion and extension of systems and facilities; DOD criteria; and this

Section C—Voice Networks and Access Requirements

19. Instruction on Commercial Long Distance Networks. The following applies:
   19.1. When available, the use of the NETWORX (or its designated replacement) network is
   mandatory for DOD and Air Force non-command and control inter-base switched voice
   communications, unless service can be provided on a dedicated common-user system without
   expenditure of appropriated funds to expand the network.
   19.2. Use DISA Circular (DISAC) 310-130-1, Submission of Telecommunication Service
   Requests, to develop and process requests for Networx service (or its designated
   replacement).
   19.3. Send all approved requests for Networx (or its designated replacement) service through
   72 ABW/SCOII circuit actions office prior to forwarding to the appropriate DISA office for

   http://www.disa.mil/About/Policy-Publication-Information/ (.gov/.mil restricted).
   19.4. Government employees are accountable for service and usage of government property.
   The unauthorized use of Networx (or its designated replacement) system for personal or
   unofficial business is a violation. Violators are responsible for paying for the cost of the call,
   the additional DITCO/GSA surcharges, and any local communications unit administrative
   costs incurred Networx (or its designated replacement) Administrators will report violators to
   their respective commander for appropriate disciplinary actions.
20. Instruction on Use of Toll-Free (800, 888, 877 or 866) Numbers. The following applies:
   20.1. Authorized for official business only. Do not advertise toll free numbers to
   unauthorized organizations or personnel to use for “easier” unofficial toll free access to the

   20.5. Area codes 800, 880, 881, 882 are not toll free and are not authorized for toll free
   usage. These codes provide a way to extend toll-free calling beyond the borders of the
   country in which the party paying for the calls resides. These codes are used primarily to
   allow Caribbean callers to reach toll-free numbers in the United States. With this
   arrangement, the caller pays for the international segment of the call (to the US gateway),
   and the called party pays for the remainder.
21. Instruction on Defense Switched Network (DSN) On- or Off-Net Calling. Authorized
Actions:
   21.1. Placing an official call to a DSN operator (base operator) from a commercial network
   and having the operator extend the call over DSN to a DSN number (on-netting).
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                19

   extend the call to a local commercial number (off-netting).
   21.3. The base CSO and/or assigned representative determines local guidance on the off-
   netting of an official DSN call to an official long-distance toll number. The base CSO and/or
   assigned representative is directly responsible for toll charges and determines billing
   procedures, recourse for reimbursement and/or acceptable appropriated fund support for off-
   netting official installation toll calls.
22. Health, Morale, and Welfare (HMW) Calls. HMW calls are authorized over the DSN.
HMW calls are not authorized on government-owned or leased CT, or via the Networx (or its
designated replacement) network. However, satellite phones may be approved for HMW calls
by the Directorate or Detachment Commander on a case-by-case basis.

   deployed may be permitted to participate in the HMW program under procedures established
   by the Base Family Support Center (i.e., as part of “Hearts Apart” or similar programs) and
   the host commander. It is both the deployed commander and the host base commander’s
   responsibility to provide guidance on the limitations and opportunities made available by this
   program.
   22.3. Place DSN HMW calls at routine precedence, normally not to exceed 15 minutes.
   22.4. DSN HMW calls should not exceed a reasonable frequency as designated by the
   installation commander in conjunction with the base CSO and/or assigned representative.

   22.5. On-netting of DSN HMW calls is permissible when placed from within the CONUS as
   part of Family Support “Hearts Apart” or other similar programs.

Section E—Telephone Monitoring and Recording Procedures

23. Categories. Authorization to monitor or record telephone lines is determined by the
purpose of the request or nature of the interception. Three sets of authorizations and procedures
govern monitoring and recording telephone conversations:
   23.1. OPSEC Vulnerability Monitoring. AFPD 33-2, for information on monitoring and
   recording procedures for OPSEC purposes. Headquarters Air Intelligence Agency TMAP
   elements (including its gained reserve units), are the only Air Force organizations authorized
   to conduct TMAP activities.
 20                                                     TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


   23.2. Criminal Investigations. See AFI 71-101, Volume 1, Criminal Investigations, and
   DODD 5505.9, Interception of Wire, Electronic, and Oral Communications for Law
   Enforcement, April 20, 1995, for guidelines on using the interception of telephone services
   for technical surveillance activities supporting law enforcement. Procedures for law
   enforcement activities to request telephone call tracing information, including bomb threats,
   are outlined in DOD O-5505.9-M (FOUO). When authorized, the base CSO and/or assigned
   representative can utilize existing tools (VPS, TMS, etc.) to assist law enforcement personnel
   in tracing malicious or suspicious calls. The base CSO and/or designated representative must
   coordinate with Security Forces and Office of Special Investigations to establish local
   procedures compliant with the above directives.
24. Controlling Monitoring and Recording. Activities monitoring and recording telephone
conversations must:
   24.1. Use acquired information only to accomplish the Air Force or DOD mission.
   24.2. Control access to recorded media.
   24.3. Notify appropriate individuals if a doubt exists that a party is not aware of the
   recording and monitoring practices. Publish recording practices in the base telephone
   directory advising users that use of government telephones constitutes consent by the user to
   COMSEC monitoring.
   24.4. Mark recorded media with the appropriate classification and handle according to
   security directives.
   24.5. Destroy recorded data as soon as possible, consistent with operational need, normally
   within 30 days after recording.
25. Prohibited Monitoring and Recording Activities. You will not:
   25.1. Record conversations for other than information management purposes (meeting
   minutes, action items, technical discussions and/or documentation of key decisions) during
   routine, in garrison operations. All recording activities are prohibited without prior
   notification to all parties of your recording intentions. Incidental monitoring of telephone
   conversations is limited to that necessary to perform quality control checks. When
   monitoring, voice systems personnel must inform all parties of their presence on the line, the
   reason for monitoring, and when they exit the circuit.
   25.2. Monitor telephone conversations to determine whether the communication is for
   official purposes. The policy that DOD telephones are to be used to conduct official business
   is enforced through administrative and management techniques such as analysis or records,
   periodic briefings, and supervisory controls.
   25.3. Use pen registers, or similar equipment, for law enforcement purposes in accordance
   with AFI 71-101, Volume 1, and DODD 5505.9.
26. Requesting Exceptions to Recording Policy. Request waivers to this policy from
SAF/XCIF, 1800 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1800.
27. Unauthorized Monitoring or Recording Devices. The discovery of unauthorized
monitoring or a suspected device is classified SECRET/NOFORN (Not Releasable to Foreign
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                  21


Nationals). If you discover or suspect that individuals are using unauthorized monitoring or
recording devices:
   27.1. Leave the device or wires in place and secure the area to prevent tampering or removal.
   27.2. Notify the nearest AFOSI office by the most secure means available; do this from
   outside the affected area.
   27.3. Do not disseminate information concerning suspected monitoring or recording devices
   without specific authorization of the USAF Technical Surveillance Countermeasures
   (TSCM) Program Administrator at HQ AFOSI. Brief only personnel with a need to know
   and hold these briefings at the local AFOSI office or at a location determined by the USAF
   TSCM Program Administrator.
   27.4. Continue normal activity in the area consistent with essential security precautions.
   27.5. Contact local telephone representatives for assistance only when directed by the wing
   commander or AFOSI personnel.

Section F—Billing for Telephone and Other Commercial Communications Services

28. Verifying Bills. There are many types of commercial communications services that are
billed to the Air Force. The following procedures are designed specifically for telephone service.
Bases should adopt and use these procedures, where applicable, for other commercial services
such as CTs, International Maritime Satellite, etc.
   28.1. Billing and Paying. Federal agencies must pay applicable interest or late charges if
   they do not make payments by due dates. The receiving unit (addressee) must date-stamp all
   telephone company bills immediately on receipt. Use the date-stamp to determine the
   payment due date when a tariff or contract does not show a due date. The CSO and/or a
   designated representative certifies the bill’s accuracy before sending it to the base FSO for
   payment. Each organization’s IMPAC billing official will verify the accuracy of CT bills
   paid using the IMPAC prior to paying the bill. The following guide- lines apply:
       28.1.1. Title 31 U.S.C., Section 3901, Prompt Payment Act.
           28.1.1.1. Submit certified bills to the FSO for payment not later than (NLT) 6
           working days before the due date.
           28.1.1.2. Where a state’s public utilities commission or other regulatory agency has
           approved a late payment tariff, use the tariff due date. You must pay late charges if
           you don’t pay the bill by the due date.
           28.1.1.3. Where you purchase or lease services or equipment under a contract, make
           the payment by the date specified in the contract. When the contract has no tariff or
           contract due date, make the payment NLT 30 days after you receive it. If a bill is not
           date-stamped, make the payment NLT 30 days after the invoice date.
       28.1.2. Networx (or its designated replacement) Billing Procedures. Each CONUS SC,
       must establish a local facility program designator code for each base in coordination with
       the base CSO and/or designated representative. This procedure keeps funding control at
       the user level, with the base CSO and/or assigned representative issuing funding authority
       to the Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) annually.
 22                                                        TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


           28.1.2.1. Billing procedures. Each month the contractor gives the base the call detail
           record (CDR). DITCO gives the CSO and/or assigned representative the customer
           cost and obligation data. The CSO and/or assigned representative has 10 days to
           dispute charges.
               28.1.2.1.1. Given no billing discrepancies, DITCO charges the base using
               transaction for others (TFO) or transaction by others (TBO) procedures.
               28.1.2.1.2. If billing discrepancies do not exceed $1,000, DITCO still charges the
               base using TFO or TBO procedures. DITCO gives the base a credit after resolving
               the dispute.
               28.1.2.1.3. If billing discrepancies are equal to or more than $1,000.
                   28.1.2.1.3.1. DITCO adjusts the base’s bill if they agree the charges are
                   incorrect.
                   28.1.2.1.3.2. The appropriate base authority settles each unresolved
                   discrepancy on a case-by-case basis if DITCO disagrees. Disburse the
                   undisputed amount using TFO or TBO procedures. The base has 60 days to
                   present evidence to DITCO regarding the disputed amount before paying the
                   bill using TFO or TBO procedures.
           28.1.2.2. Resolving Networx (or its designated replacement) CDR disputes. The CSO
           documents disputes not resolved during the 10-day period by preparing an adjustment
           request and sending it to DISA/DITCO/RRA, 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-
           5406. DITCO must receive the adjustment request within 60 days of receiving the
           CDR. Notify the CSO when the parties reach resolution and you make adjustments.
       28.1.3. Collection for Unauthorized Use of Networx (or its designated replacement).
       Compute the cost of all unofficial Networx calls on the basis of the commercial rate of
       the Networx service provider. Also calculate the administrative costs of determining the
       call was unauthorized, plus the cost of processing the collection. If the unit collects the
       cost of the unauthorized call before receiving the bill, the CSO deposits the payment into
       the Appropriation or Suspense Account 57X6500 and transfers funds from the suspense
       account to the appropriation that paid the bill.
29. Processing the Bills. The communications unit (addressee) separates the telephone bills
into groups (i.e., recurring, nonrecurring, Networx [or its designated replacement] long distance
direct-dial or equivalent service, and specialized or dedicated equipment or service) for historical
comparison or verification. The CSO and/or assigned representative will:
   29.1. Certify the voucher (Standard Form [SF] 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and
   Services Other Than Personal) and send to the FSO for processing.
   29.2. Maintain a monthly summary spreadsheet showing the totals of individual monthly
   spread- sheets (including automated or manual spreadsheets) for different types of charges
   (e.g., recurring, Networx [or its designated replacement], tolls).
30. Judgmental Sampling of “Toll” Calls. The CSO and/or assigned representative will
establish local verification procedures to certify bills or categories of bills (e.g., repetitive one-
time service bills for installation, removal, or relocation of instruments) as official. The CSO
and/or assigned representative need not verify every “toll” call. The CSO and/or assigned
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                     23


representative may use other procedures, such as a statistical sampling or historical data, to
satisfy the requirement if they provide a high degree of reliability or certainty that certified calls
were official.
31. Networx. Use a judgmental sampling to verify bills for Networx (or its designated
replacement). The General Services Administration (GSA) is the government’s contracting
agency for the Networx and disburses funds to the contractor. GSA states that the government is
liable for all calls placed over the Networx. The purpose of verification is not to certify the bill
for payment but to protect the system from abuse by collecting payment from those making
unofficial calls. Credit the amount collected to the account that originally paid the bill once a
month DITCO distributes a hard copy of the Networx bill to the communications units. An
electronic copy is also available from DITCO. CSO and/or assigned representative should
automate the process of verifying the bill.
32. Verifying Other Charges, Credits, Local Service, and Equipment Charges (Recurring
and Nonrecurring Charges). At some bases, the telephone bill includes bulk message unit
charges for directory assistance calls, dial 99 accesses, and interzones calls. Handle these charges
as an additional cost to the city trunk bill. The base CSO and/or designated representative (not
the billing activity) compares charges for billed local service and equipment with government
records and CSAs or other contracts.
   32.1. Comparing Billing. Use the date and nature of the service to compare items charged to
   the authorization document. The base CSO and/or designated representative (not the billing
   activity):
       32.1.1. Compares dates on the “explanation of other charges and credits” with the dates
       shown on the corresponding authorization document (e.g., Department of Defense [DD]
       Form 1367, Commercial Communication Work Order and AF Form 9).
       32.1.2. Compares nonrecurring and monthly recurring charges with those authorized on
       the corresponding authorization document (contract or DD Form 428, Communication
       Service Authorization).
       32.1.3. Compares fractional charges and credits for service started or discontinued
       (nonrecurring charges) based on monthly rates.
   32.2. Correcting Differences. To correct differences in entries on the “explanation of other
   charges and credits:”
       32.2.1. Enter the appropriate charge and the date of changes if the authorization
       document is incorrect.
       32.2.2. Return the authorization document to the issuing agency with a letter explaining
       the required correction if the contract is wrong.
33. Verifying Commercial Long Distance Calls, Networx or Equivalent Charges With AF
Form 1072 or AF Form 649, Verification of Long Distance Telephone Calls.
   33.1. Unofficial Toll Calls. The Air Force will not pay for unofficial toll calls placed from
   official telephones except over the Networx (or its designated replacement). For unofficial
   toll calls, the base:
 24                                                      TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


       33.1.1. Communications unit tries to find out who placed the unauthorized calls, and if
       necessary, asks the telephone company for help.
       33.1.2. Communications unit helps unit commanders identify those making unofficial
       calls and gives a list of these individuals to the FSO for collection. The list includes
       name, social security number, unit of assignment, date of the call, city and number called,
       and amount owed. Ensure Title 5 U.S.C., Section 552a, Privacy Act of 1974, procedures
       are followed.
       33.1.3. The FSO collects the unofficial total charge and deposits payment into Suspense
       Account 57X6500 and sends a copy of DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, to the
       billing activity.
       33.1.4. Billing activity cites the amount collected and the suspense account on the next
       payment voucher.
       33.1.5. Refers remaining unidentified calls to a telephone company representative. The
       referral document includes a written statement that investigation prohibits payment
       because the calls were unauthorized and that the Air Force judges that further
       investigation or collection efforts are not justified.
   33.2. Class B Service Billing. The base CSO sends the certified billing statement and Class
   B billing information to the base FSO for processing.
       33.2.1. The FSO collects charges for the toll calls in Suspense Account 57X6500 and
       cites the suspense account for the next payment voucher to the telephone company.
       33.2.2. The billing activity cites this suspense account when preparing the payment
       voucher to pay the telephone company.
34. Adjusting Billing Errors. The billing activity advises the commercial telephone company
of billing errors.
   34.1. Resolving Discrepancies. The billing activity promptly resolves billing discrepancies
   in favor of the government. Contact the contracting officer for resolution when you cannot
   correct discrepancies.
   34.2. Correcting Billing Errors. The billing activity deletes or corrects incorrect billing with
   the agreement of the commercial telephone company. The billing activity initials each
   deletion or correction before paying. If the clerk cannot get the telephone company to orally
   agree to change a charge, the CSO certifies only the undisputed portion of the bill.
35. Sending Bills to the Financial Service Office (FSO). The billing activity:
   35.1. Prepares SF 1034 for the total amount paid against each contract number and has the
   base CSO certify the voucher for payment.
   35.2. Enters the amount to pay for telephone services from appropriated funds. Does not
   include Federal tax. Shows State tax as a separate item. Enters the grand total.
   35.3. Enters the appropriate contract number and date in the column headed “Number and
   Date of Order.”
   35.4. Enters the basic agreement number in the “Contract Number” block and the 4-digit
   authorization number and date from the “Authorization Number and Date” block of the DD
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                   25


   Form 428, in the column headed “Number and Date of Order” where a CSA is the
   contracting authority.
   35.5. Forwards one copy of the CSO-certified SF 1034 to the contracting office that issued
   the CSA and puts one copy in a suspense file until the base FSO pays the bill. Unless
   substantial differences occur between the amount shown on the SF 1034 and the amount
   actually paid, the contracting office will use the certified SF 1034 to effect contract reporting
   requirements. If substantial differences occur, a copy of the SF 1034 indicating what was
   actually paid will be furnished to the contracting officer to permit corrections. In lieu of
   individual SF 1034 vouchers, Tinker Air Force base may consolidate monthly payment data,
   electronically or hard copy, and forward the data to the contracting officer.
   35.6. Keeps the commercial telephone company bills and supporting documentation with the
   file copy of the SF 1034. Disposes of voucher and documentation according to Records
   Disposition Schedule. If a telephone company issues more than one bill with the same
   address, lists all of the bills on one SF 1034.
   35.7. This process does not apply to bills paid with the IMPAC.
36. Certifying Payment on Standard Form (SF) 1034.
   36.1. For toll calls, the base CSO or a designated representative certifies all calls.
   36.2. The wing commander or deputy commander for resources designates a certifying
   officer on DD Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record-Authorized Signature. Do
   not delegate this authority. File a DD Form 577 for anyone authorized to sign the payment
   voucher.
   36.3. Alternate Payment Procedure:
       36.3.1. When an automated system prints the SF 1034, or if the CSO and/or assigned
       representative wants to pass the billing information through electronic means to the
       Defense Accounting Office (DAO), the CSO signs a transmittal letter stating the amount
       for payment is correct.
       36.3.2. The DAO prepares the payment voucher using the automated accounting system
       and attaches the letter from the CSO and/or assigned representative.
       36.3.3. The CSO and/or assigned representative continues to maintain the backup files.
       36.3.4. Send only the original and two copies of the first page of the telephone bill with
       the correct amount entered.
       36.3.5. Contact your DAO for further information concerning the automated accounting
       system process.
37. Charges for Base Telephone Services. See Attachment 4.
38. Installation and Identification of Modem, Fax, and Secure Voice (Analog)
Lines. Organizations at all levels will ensure all Remote Access Server numbers and authorized
existing and newly installed modem, fax, and secure voice analog lines (STU-III, STE, Future
Narrow Band Digital Terminal, etc.) are identified and submitted to the host base CSO and
MAJCOM NOSC for loading into the VPS platform. Any of the above lines not identified by the
base may result in their automatic disconnection by the VPS platform.

39. Password Procedures. (See TINKERAFBI33-202 Network Security).
   39.1. Password Composition and Length. When technically feasible, the password must
   meet the requirements required by TAFBI33-202. When not capable of meeting these
   requirements, all passwords will meet as many of the individual requirements as possible.
   39.2. Password Change Rate. To protect against unknown threats, the maximum lifetime of
   a password must be no greater than 90 days.
   39.3. Change all passwords as soon as possible (maximum within one duty day) if a
   password com- promise is suspected or confirmed. Remove a password as soon as possible
   (maximum within one duty day) if a user’s access is removed due to punitive action or via
   commander’s request.
   39.4. Disable/suspend a password as soon as possible (maximum within three duty days) if a
   user no longer requires access for a period greater than 90 days (e.g., TDY).
   39.5. Remove the user name and password immediately when a person no longer requires
   access for the performance of their job (e.g., permanent change of station, moves to another
   section, discharged). Ensure all root or administrative-level passwords are changed when a
   previous system administrator with this access departs for any reason.
   39.6. Password Grace Period. Password grace period is the number of logins into the system
   after a password has expired. The password grace period must be set to three where
   technically feasible. This forces the user to change their password after three grace period
   logins or be locked out of the system until the voice systems security administrator can
   reinstate them.
   39.7. Password Security. Do not write down passwords or store them in any easily
   accessible location (e.g., a function key). Do not share individual passwords.
40. Voice Messaging/Mail System (VMS) Security.
   40.1. Protect all individual voice mailboxes with a personal identification number (PIN) (4-
   digit minimum).
   40.2. Change default PIN numbers, if appropriate, when user changes.
   40.3. Do not use obvious or trivial PIN numbers (e.g., the phone extension, social security
   number, easily guessed numeric combinations such as “1234” or “6543”).
   40.4. Never program PIN numbers into auto dial buttons located on phones.
   40.5. Never have a greeting or announcement that states you will accept third party/collect
   calls.
   40.6. If users notice any strange messages on their voice mail box or if a greeting has been
   changed for unknown reasons, contact the Branch IA office and NOSC VPS administrator to
   assess impact of potential toll fraud.
   40.7. Do not create voice mailboxes before they are needed. Deactivate unassigned voice
   mailboxes.
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                 27



  40.8. If capable, lock out consecutive unsuccessful attempts to enter a voice mailbox.
  40.9. Do not allow “thru-dial” or external transfers to any outside line or trunk (this includes
  local commercial and toll free numbers). If capable, ensure the VMS restricts “thru-dial” or
  local dialing to a fixed length (e.g., limit VMS to 7-digit intra-base, Class-C, dialing).

Terms
911 Service—Emergency service for subscribers. A central control desk takes the call and
notifies appropriate local government agencies. Usually a state or local government agency
provides this service with charges collected from telephone subscribers. In many cases, the state
or local government levies this charge as a tax and the telephone company serves as the billing
agent.
Certification—The process by which a communications and information system is evaluated for
satisfaction of requirements for interoperability, compatibility, and integration. Verified
confirmation of telephone service charges.
TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013                                                                   31


Classes of Telephone Service—DOD has established criteria for classifying telephone service
within military departments. Classify Air Force telephones served by either government-owned
or commercial voice systems as official (Classes A, C, and D) or unofficial (Class B). The class
of service code is a two-or more character alphanumeric code. The first character indicates
whether the line is for official or unofficial use. The second character indicates the billing mode.
The third character indicates subcategories of service.
Communications Common Carrier—Companies that the                        Federal   Communications
Commission authorizes to provide telecommunications services.
Communications and Information Systems Officer (CSO)—The               of ficer    responsible
for communications and information systems and functions at any Air Force organizational level.
At base level, the “base CSO” is the commander of the communications unit responsible for
carrying out base systems duties, including management of the base-wide command, control,
communications, and computers (C4) infrastructure. At MAJCOM level, the “MAJCOM CSO”
is designated by the MAJCOM commander and is responsible for overall management of
MAJCOMs communications and Information assets. For detailed functions and responsibilities
refer to AFI 33-101, Commanders Guidance and Responsibilities.
Communications Service Authorization (CSA) (DD Form 428)—A contractual vehicle to
obtain telecommunications services regulated by a public utilities commission when issued
against a basic agreement. These telecommunications services are typically provided only to the
local exchange carrier. Examples are central office trunks, full business lines, and FX services.
Defense Information System Network (DISN)—An enhanced long-haul telecommunications
infrastructure that supports a full range of communications services—voice, video, and data—to
the warfighter and to organizations which support the warfighter.
Defense Switched Network (DSN)—1. A telecommunications system that provides switched,
end-to-end, common-user, and dedicated telephone service for the DOD. The DSN provides
rapid and low-cost long-haul, voice, data, and secure voice telecommunications for C4 users. 2.
A component of the Defense Information System Network t h at ha ndl es DOD switched voice,
data, and video communications. Also called “DSN.” See also “Defense Information System
Network.”
Defense Switched Network (DSN) On— or Off-Net Calling—Official telephone calls over the
DSN system that extend calls to and from local commercial telephone numbers.
Enhanced 911 (E911) Service—Emergency service providing both ANI and Automatic
Location Identification information to emergency response centers.
Key System—A local telecommunications system normally installed in end-user buildings
which have telephones with multiple buttons permitting (requiring) the user to directly select
central office telephone and intercom lines.
Pre—wiring—Procuring and installing communications and information wiring as an integral
part of major facility construction and alteration projects. The current engineering and
construction technical letters on pre-wiring and communication and information requirements
provide specifics.
Telephone Control Officer (TCO)—Individual who authorizes and controls long distance
telephone toll calls within a unit.

Toll Call—A call to any location outside the local service area; a long distance call.
Unofficial Commercial Telephone Service—Telephone serv ice that directly connects private
telephones to a commercial telephone exchange. Not required for conduct of official business.
This includes telephone service in military housing, non-appropriated fund facilities, commercial
activities, and other facilities.
Voice System—hardware or software designed to send and receive voice signals across a
network that provides customer voice services. Voice systems include circuit-switched and
packet-switched systems.

                                         Attachment 2
 CONDITIONS FOR OFFICIAL TELEPHONE SERVICE IN PERSONAL QUARTERS

A2.1. Designate only positions requiring immediate communications response for C2.
Accomplish installation of telephone service in quarters only to meet the C2 needs of the
organizational mission, and not for the convenience of the occupant. Maintain written
designation on file in the activity that provides the service.
A2.2. Provide official service with either direct lines to the base telephone switchboard or Class
C lines. Provide DSN access if mission essential. Class A telephone service that provides local
off-base or commercial long distance telephone service is not authorized.
A2.3. You may use multi-line instruments to terminate official and unofficial lines in approved
quarters.
   A2.3.1. The serving communications unit provides this service.
   A2.3.2. The occupant of the quarters bears any cost for the multi-line instrument that
   exceeds the cost of providing approved official service.
   A2.3.3. Use a government-owned instrument when it provides the lowest cost to the
   government.
   A2.3.4. In calculating lowest cost, consider the costs of reworking cable, removing and
   replacing instruments, purchasing instruments, etc., for current and future occupants.
A2.4. According to law and Air Force housing policy, all operating costs and any repair or
maintenance of family housing structures will be funded solely from the family housing
operation and maintenance accounts. The only exception is for communications equipment that
is readily removable and required by the occupants to perform their mission (e.g., Red Phone).
MFH is responsible for funding any equipment permanently affixed to the family housing
structures or installed in family housing areas. Installation of communications equipment into
quarters is subject to very strict Congressionally imposed limits; consult with local finance and
legal staff prior to installing communications equipment. Examples of permanently affixed
assets include underground cabling and premise wiring for lines.

      SPECIAL TELEPHONE FEATURES AND SERVICES FOR SPECIFIC BASE
                             ACTIVITIES

A3.1. Telephone Service for Government Employee Labor Unions. CJCSI 6215.01B
provides guidance on the condition for providing DSN access to labor unions. Access to DSN is
not normally provided to labor unions and is not routinely authorized in contract documents.
The basis for supporting a request must be a clearly operational, military-related function.
AFNIC cannot grant DSN access; a waiver granting access must come from DISA. The wing
commander determines which labor unions meet the definition. Labor unions that do not fit this
definition pay Class B-2 rates for telephone service, reimbursable long distance telephone
service.
A3.2. Telephone Service for Public Schools. Public schools normally use commercial
telephone service on Air Force installations. The school reimburses the government for the cost
of Class B services.
A3.3. Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS). This service is
provided by the Office of the Manager, National Communications System that supports federal,
state, local government, industry, and non-profit organization personnel in performing their
National Security and Emergency Preparedness missions. GETS provides emergency access and
priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the Public Switched Telephone
Network. It is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation during which the
probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has
significantly decreased. GETS will not preempt public traffic, nor are there levels of precedence
in GETS. A GETS card contains the universal access number and a PIN.
   A3.3.1. It is highly encouraged that each base incorporate GETS into their wing/base
   command post, disaster support group, and other mission critical operation centers. As a
   minimum, Wing/CC, Wing Command Center, Commanders of the Ops and Maintenance
   Groups, and the local Communications Directorate Commanders should have access to a
   GETS card.
   A3.3.2. Wing/base POCs are responsible for submitting GETS requirements through their
   MAJCOM functions for GETS access and PIN. It is the responsibility of the local base
   GETS POC (appointed by local Communications Directorate Commanders) to educate users
   on GETS procedures.
   A3.3.2.1. Provide 72 ABW/SCOII with a copy of the base Government Emergency Tele-
   communications Service (GETS) program base Point Of Contact (POC).
   A3.3.3. GETS is accessed through a universal access number 1-710-NCS-GETS (1-710-
   627-4387) using common telephone equipment such as a standard desk set, STU-III,
   facsimile, modem, or wire- less phone. A prompt will direct the entry of your PIN and the
   telephone number. Once you have been authenticated as a valid user, your call is identified
   as National Security and/or Emergency Pre- paredness type call and receives special
   treatment.
   A3.3.4. For more in-depth information and ordering procedures see the GETS Web site at
   http://gets.ncs.gov.

                                         Attachment 4
                    CHARGES FOR BASE TELEPHONE SERVICES

A4.1. Base Responsibilities. Communications Directorates are responsible for providing a
basic telephone instrument to base users (depending on user, i.e., special C2, C2, or common);
services that have special instrument requirements may be the user’s responsibility, if deemed
outside the scope of a basic telephone instrument.
A4.2. Class A Service. See Attachment 1 for definition. Monthly charges for Class A
telephone service provided from government-owned or commercially-leased voice information
system are:
   A4.2.1. Class A-1. Provide Class A-1 service without cost to Air Force activity users.
   Accumulate monthly toll and other specialized communications charges to Air Force tenant
   units not directly sup- porting the host base mission and send them to the local FSO for
   reimbursement by the tenant unit to the host base (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1).
   A4.2.2. Class A-2.
       A4.2.2.1. DOD tenants directly supporting the host base mission receive Class A-2
       service with- out cost.
       A4.2.2.2. DOD tenants not directly supporting the host base mission (including ARC)
       receive basic Class A-2 service without cost. Accumulate monthly toll and other
       specialized communications charges and send them to the local FSO for reimbursement
       by the tenant unit to the host base (see AFI 65-601, Volume 1).
       A4.2.2.3. MWRS activities that do not receive communications support according to
       paragraph A3.14, reimburse the Air Force for the service. Use the same rates as the
       commercial carrier serving the installation. Station lines cost at least $14 per month and
       each station termination in the community costs at least $3.50. Compute all other
       charges, such as installation, miscellaneous, and special equipment charges, using the
       same procedures as for Class B telephone service.
   A4.2.3. Class A-3. The rates for Class A-3 service are the same as those paid by the
   installation to the commercial carrier. Station lines cost at least $14 per month and each
   station termination in the com- munity costs at least $3.50, plus all other charges (tolls,
   installation, relocation, and specialized equipment charges based on local telephone company
   tariffs for United States bases [including Hawaii and Alaska]). Installation and relocation
   charges for overseas bases are the same as Class B. The user pays additional costs for
   facilities such as trunks, tie lines, toll terminals, and incidental operation or maintenance
   personnel.
   A4.2.4. Class A-4. Provide telephone service for the Defense Commissary Agency retail
   sales stores according to paragraph A3.12 Charges for reimbursable service are the same as
   for Class A-2 ser- vice.
A4.3. 911 or Enhanced 911 Service.
   A4.3.1. The United States and its instrumentalities are constitutionally exempt from direct
   taxation by state and local governments. Oftentimes, service charges billed for emergency
 36                                                      TINKERAFBI33-111 18 APRIL 2013


   services (i.e., 911 calls) are actually direct taxes that the Air Force is not authorized to pay
   (billed as a surcharge by the telephone company and remitted to the taxing authority). What
   the charge is labeled is not a sufficient indicator of whether it is a tax or proper service
   charge. Generally, emergency notification service charges are:
       A4.3.1.1. Proper and payable if imposed by a telephone company for its own services
       and duly permitted by the tariff.
       A4.3.1.2. Improper when the state or local government actually imposes the charge and
       merely uses the telephone company as a collection agent. In such cases, notify the
       telephone company that the United States Government is constitutionally exempt from
       the 911 service fee and cannot legally pay the fee.
   A4.3.2. If it is unclear whether the charge is a fee or a tax, contact the staff judge advocate,
   base legal office, MAJCOM, or comptroller for guidance.
   A4.3.3. This guidance does not apply to fees for private telephone service for on-base
   residents. If base housing is in an area where the base provides fire, police, and other
   emergency services, resi- dents may challenge the emergency notification service charge.
   However, because telephone service to on-base residents is a private contract between the
   subscriber and the telephone company, on-base residents cannot claim exemption from the
   charge on the basis of sovereign immunity.
A4.4. Class B Service. See Attachment 1 for definition. DOD Comptroller establishes rates
for Class B telephone services covered in this instruction on an annual basis. These charges
apply when government-owned or commercial voice systems provide Class B service.
   A4.4.1. Class B Installation, Activation, and Relocation Charges. The installation,
   activation, and relocation charges for Class B stations apply regardless of whether previous
   wiring or other telephone connecting devices are available. Installation, activation, and
   relocation charges for external miscellaneous devices (e.g., jacks, buzzers, and gongs) are the

         A4.4.3.3.3. Four-party service. Applicants selecting four-party service pay the
         monthly rate shown, regardless of the “line fill.” The line fill may fluctuate from one

  applies.
  A4.4.5. Class B Supplemental Service and Equipment. The user pays the costs for facilities
  and ser- vices beyond those covered by the standard rates, including:
     A4.4.5.1. Miscellaneous equipment and special features. Charges for miscellaneous
     equipment such as single line telephone instruments, external ringers, flashing lamps, and
     other station accessories are the same as those charged for similar services by the nearest
     United States-owned and -operated telephone company. Charges for special features and
     services provided from the base telephone switch such as three-way calling, call waiting,
     call forwarding, and other features are the same as those from the nearest United States-
     owned and -operated telephone company. This charge applies to all classes of unofficial
     service.
  A4.4.6. Long Distance Calls. The subscriber of the Class B station originating the call pays
  the cost of unofficial long distance calls. The cost is consistent with telephone company
  charges. Do not use the Networx (or its designated replacement) for unofficial calls, even on
  a reimbursable basis. The CSO must make sure subscribers can place commercial long
  distance calls at the bases where Class B service is provided.

  Revenue Code; Miscellaneous Excise Taxes; Facilities And Services; Special Provisions
  Applicable to Services and Facilities Taxes; Exemption for United States and possessions).
  Apply Federal taxes on billing for local and long distance service contractors; commissioned
  officers’ and NCO open messes, and similar activities. Personal long distance service from
  tax-exempt agencies is taxable. Do not collect Federal taxes on billing to the ARC and
  Federal credit unions, which were granted an exemption under 26 U.S.C., Section 4293.
  Collect Federal taxes from service clubs and base exchange activities. Installation and
  relocation charges are not subject to Federal taxes.

      charges are incurred, except when the wing commander requires advance payment.
      Prorate advance payments when service begins after the start of the billing period.
      A4.4.9.2. Billing long distance calls. Bill long distance service charges to Class B
      subscribers with the first regular monthly bill after receiving the commercial telephone
      company bill for the service. Long distance telephone charges do not require advance
      deposits.
      A4.4.9.3. Billing local calls. The standard rates for Class B service apply regardless of
      whether the telephone company furnishes local service at a flat or measured rate. The
      standard rates entitle the Class B subscriber to make local calls without additional charge.
      EXCEPTIONS: When message unit charges apply and when ANI equipment can identify
      the individual subscriber station making the call, bill message unit charges to the user.
      A4.4.9.4. Prorating charges. When a subscriber receives service for only a part of the
      monthly billing period, or when a service outage exceeds 24 hours, prorate the charge.
      Prorate bills according to the approved tariff or prorating procedures of the local
      telephone company. The subscriber service outage period begins when the subscriber
      reports the outage and ends when the telephone company restores service.
      A4.4.9.5. Recurring charges. Bill charges for supplemental services and equipment to the
      user at local telephone company rates. Bill supplemental service and equipment charges
      for a part of the billing period to the subscriber at the full monthly rate and do not prorate.
      A4.4.9.6. Collecting. The FSO collects charges from users of Class B telephone service.
      Wing commanders may institute a payroll-deduction plan to pay for Class B telephone
      service.
      A4.4.9.7. Depositing money received for services. Account for money received for
      telephone service as public funds according to prescribed Air Force policies and
      procedures for reimbursement to appropriated funds.
A4.5. Class C Service. See Attachment 1 for definition. The conditions and arrangements for
providing Class A service from either a government-owned or a commercial voice information
system also apply to providing Class C service. Charges for Class C service are:
   A4.5.1. Class C-1. Same as Class A-1.
   A4.5.2. Class C-2. No cost to the subscriber except that toll and other specialized
   communications charges to DOD tenants not directly supporting the host base mission
   accumulate monthly and are sent to the local FSO for possible reimbursement to the Air
   Force. Defense Commissary Agency facilities and retail sales stores in CONUS must
   reimburse the government for communications sup- port at the rate of $4 per month for each
   station line termination and $2.50 for each extension station line termination. Charges for
   installation, moves, and special and miscellaneous equipment are additional. Compute
   installation and relocation charges in the same manner as for Class B telephone installation
   and relocation.
   A4.5.3. Class C-3. Same as Class C-2 except for installation, relocation, and specialized
   equipment charges which are determined by local telephone tariffs for bases in CONUS,
   Hawaii, and Alaska, and determined by Class B charges.
   A4.5.4. Class C-4. Same as Class C-2 except for the troop issue function of the commissary.
