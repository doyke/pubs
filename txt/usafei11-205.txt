1. General. The European Central Altitude Reservation Facility (EUCARF), located at
Ramstein Air Base, Germany, is designated the single DoD point of contact for coordinating
altitude reservation requests within the following geographical areas:        Europe, the
Mediterranean, Santa Maria, Shanwick and Reykjavik oceanic areas. EUCARF is a coordinating
agency only, having no jurisdiction over the airspace concerned. EUCARF is under the
functional control and guidance of the C2ISR Operations Division (HQ USAFE/A3C).
2. Policy.
     2.1. An ALTRV will normally be requested when:
        2.1.1. Aircraft are required to operate within specified altitudes/flight levels, areas, or
        time frames with less than prescribed standard separation between aircraft.
        2.1.2. It is in the interest of operations security to minimize exposure of sensitive
        operations and communications related to command and control of forces involved.
        Note: Coordinate exceptions to reporting procedures that are deemed essential for
        preserving operations security with EUCARF.
     2.2. Altitude reservations will not be requested if the mission involved can be otherwise
     accommodated according to normal flight planning and air traffic control procedures.
     2.3. Apply provisions of this publication with due consideration for the total civil and
     military requirement throughout the navigable airspace.
     2.4. An altitude reservation is not necessary for operations that are normally conducted in
     airspace expressly designated for a special activity, that is, restricted areas, published fixed
     refueling anchors, etc. However, in accordance with standing operational agreements,
     requests for the Italian, Greek, and/or Maltese refueling corridors shall be coordinated thru
     EUCARF.
     2.5. Coordinate with EUCARF for all Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Air Force level, or high
     priority missions that may require extensive ATC support.
USAFEI11-205 8 AUGUST 2012                                                                     3


  2.6. Forward ALTRV APREQs to EUCARF for processing according to lead time
  requirements and filing procedures in this publication for all missions originating from,
  transiting, or terminating in the EUCARF AOR. If the mission originates, transits, or
  terminates in the FAA Central Altitude Reservation Function’s (CARF) area, include FAA
  CARF, Warrenton, VA as an addressee; 7-AWA-CARF@faa.gov. If the mission originates
  in Canadian airspace, include either Airspace Reservation Unit East (ARE), ARE Gander NF
  CN; atlareqx@navcanada.ca or Airspace Reservation Unit West (ARW), ARW Edmonton
  CN; YEGGA_ARW@navcanada.ca as an addressee.
  2.7. An approved altitude reservation is an ATC clearance and must be complied with.
  Departure and arrival instructions may vary due to existing traffic conditions. Note: The
  altitude reservation cannot be substituted for the route of flight in the ICAO flight plan. The
  complete route of flight must be included in DD Form 1801, item 15 or ICAO Flight Plan.
  The ALTRV can be included in item 18, Other Information, by stating, “via approved
  ALTRV from (start ALTRV point) until (end ALTRV point).”
  2.8. When ALTRV APREQs submitted to EUCARF conflict with each other, EUCARF will
  inform the appropriate mission planners of the conflict and recommend solutions. Normally,
  when resolving a conflict, missions with higher precedence will be afforded priority over
  lower classification missions. Additionally, EUCARF may negotiate mutually acceptable
  changes in times, routings, or altitudes. If these recommendations are unacceptable, it will
  become the responsibility of the requesters concerned to resolve the conflict and resubmit
  their request to EUCARF for processing.
  2.9. The order of precedence is designed to facilitate the handling of airspace user
  requirements. Mission requests received by EUCARF that do not indicate mission priority,
  will be assumed to be Class Seven and processed as such. The military organization
  requesting an altitude reservation will assign the appropriate order of precedence class
  number in accordance with FAA Order JO 7610.4 Special Operations:
     2.9.1. Class One - Aircraft implementing peacetime national emergency plans as well as
     missile activities authorized by approved and pre-coordinated procedures or letters of
     agreement. ALTRV APREQ should be filed as far ahead of departure/estimated time of
     launch as practicable.
     2.9.2. Class Two - Aircraft engaged in search and rescue operations. ALTRV APREQ
     should be filed as far ahead of takeoff as practicable.
     2.9.3. Class Three - Aircraft engaged in emergency air evacuation, hurricane operations,
     WX RECON or other operations involving the safety of lives or property. ALTRV
     APREQ should be filed as far ahead of takeoff as practicable.
     2.9.4. Class Four - Deployments at the direction of JCS in support of an exercise or
     large-scale mission and fulfilling an unseen requirement. The deployment should be
     essential to the success of the exercise or mission. ALTRV APREQ should be filed as far
     ahead of departure as practicable.
     2.9.5. Class Five - Aircraft engaged in important peacetime service, joint or
     unified/specified command exercises or missions. Notification of application of this
     priority must be received from the appropriate military headquarters.
 4                                                              USAFEI11-205 8 AUGUST 2012


        2.9.6. Class Six - Aircraft engaged in a large-scale mission directed by a major
        command headquarters.
        2.9.7. Class Seven - Aircraft engaged in evaluation type operations or overseas
        deployment.
        2.9.8. Class Eight - Aircraft engaged in missions directed by specified air forces or
        commands, aircraft engaged in other training exercises, and all other aircraft requesting
        ALTRVs.
     2.10. To allow EUCARF sufficient time to process requests, de-conflict missions, and
     submit APREQs to host nation air traffic authorities within established lead times, all
     requests should be submitted to EUCARF no later than 7 duty days prior to the requested
     departure date (8 duty days for missions requesting use of the Greek corridors). Short notice
     requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and will be dependent upon individual
     country lead time requirements and mission precedence level. Note: Individual country lead
     time requirements are established by Letters of Agreement and Memorandums of
     Understanding between EUCARF and host nation ATC authorities. Contact EUCARF for
     specific country lead time requirements.
     2.11. A 2-hour AVANA will normally be assigned to accommodate last minute maintenance
     or weather delays. Requests for AVANA extensions will be handled on a case-by-case basis
     and are dependent on the countries affected.
     2.12. If mission delays beyond the approved timeframes are anticipated, rescheduling should
     be based on 24-hour increments added to the original estimated time of departure (ETD).
     This will enable EUCARF to ensure ALTRVs are appropriately separated and allow
     adequate time for all host nation authorities to issue NOTAMs and/or notify affected ATC
     agencies. Indefinite delays on ALTRV APREQs are not authorized. Missions may request 2
     delays to their original APREQ. Missions that delay more than twice must meet all affected
     country lead times. Note: Each 7-duty day delay is authorized 2 additional delays.
     2.13. When aircraft are unable to depart with the main ALTRV, an “ALPHA” mission may
     be requested with only one duty day notice (2 duty days for France and Italy). ALPHA
     missions are defined as derivatives of the primary mission and as such utilize same call signs,
     points of origin, routes, altitudes, and destinations as coordinated in the original mission.
     ALPHA missions will have no slip capability, and as such, will have to meet 7-duty day lead
     time if unable to depart on the first requested/approved date.
     2.14. Derivatives of primary missions that do not meet the criteria of an ALPHA shall be
     identified as “BRAVO”, “CHARLIE”, etc and must meet 7-duty day lead time requirement.
3. Responsibilities:
     3.1. Flying units requesting ALTRVs will:
        3.1.1. File ALTRV APREQs according to the policies and format in this publication.
        Ensure host nation routing policies are adhered to prior to submitting an ALTRV APREQ
        to EUCARF.
USAFEI11-205 8 AUGUST 2012                                                                    5


     3.1.2. Designate a primary and alternate project officer as the point of contact for
     coordinating ALTRVs with local departure control agencies, radar approach controls
     (RAPCON), air traffic control centers (ARTCC), area control centers (ACC), and
     EUCARF.
     3.1.3. Ensure that a conflict does not exist between two or more ALTRVs originating
     from the same organization or headquarters.
     3.1.4. Coordinate with EUCARF, by phone, if a major change occurs that does not meet
     required lead-times, immediately followed by submitting the requested change in writing.
     3.1.5. Request the minimum amount of airspace consistent with safety and
     accomplishment of mission objectives.
     3.1.6. Ensure approval to transit prohibited, restricted, and danger areas or other special
     use airspace, has been obtained.
     3.1.7. Ensure that appropriate overflight and diplomatic clearances have been obtained
     IAW the appropriate Foreign Clearance Guide. Note: Requesting an ALTRV does not
     eliminate the pilot’s responsibility to obtain diplomatic clearances or file flight plans.
     Failure to follow guidelines in the Foreign Clearance Guide may result in disapproval of
     your flight. EUCARF does not coordinate diplomatic clearances.
     3.1.8. Notify EUCARF immediately if mission fails to depart within the approved
     ALTRV AVANA, mission aborts, or if changes are made in call signs or number of
     aircraft involved.
     3.1.9. Ensure that competent military authority has indicated acceptance of
     responsibilities for separation between aircraft when less than current ICAO separation
     standards are employed.
     3.1.10. If a classified APREQ is necessary for mission security, the mission name, route,
     altitude, and timing must be declassified in order to complete coordination with host
     nation authorities. If an APREQ is transmitted encrypt for transmission only (EFTO),
     include the statement “EFTO may be dropped for ATC coordination,” in the remarks
     section of the APREQ. Note: Contact EUCARF for additional assistance with classified
     missions.
  3.2. EUCARF will:
     3.2.1. Review all ALTRV APREQs to ensure completeness, and compliance with host
     nation routing and lead time policies.
     3.2.2. Resolve, through coordination with mission planners or ATC facilities, conflicts
     between altitude reservations.
     3.2.3. Coordinate with and solicit approval for military altitude reservations from United
     States and host nation air traffic control agencies.
     3.2.4. Ensure messages are declassified prior to submission for host nation approval.
     EUCARF cannot coordinate classified or “UNCLAS EFTO” APREQs with host nation
     air traffic authorities. Note: Contact EUCARF for assistance with classified missions.

        3.2.5. Forward approved ALTRVs to appropriate agencies at least 1 duty day before
        departure unless otherwise coordinated. Project Officers shall be notified of disapproved
        ALTRVs as soon as possible.
        3.2.6. Disseminate altitude reservation cancellations, mission abort notices, or delay
        messages to affected agencies.
        3.2.7. Negotiate directly with host nation authorities or intermediary agencies as
        necessary to facilitate the coordination and processing of altitude reservations.
4. Procedures.
     4.1. Filing. Filing ALTRV APREQs with EUCARF may be accomplished by:
        4.1.1. E-mail: mailto: EUCARF@ramstein.af.mil (preferred method).

     4.2. Moving Reservation Format. Units requesting ALTRVs will prepare APREQs,
     indicating mission name and order of precedence in subject of message, and forward to
     EUCARF, in the following format. (See Attachments 1 and 2 for examples, contents and
     abbreviations.) Note: The example formats are required for use in submitting ALTRV
     requests to EUCARF only and shall not be used when filing the DD Form 1801, DoD
     International Flight Plan, or ICAO Flight Plan, which must use standard ICAO format
     according to General Planning, DoD Flight Information Publication, Chapter 4.
        4.2.1. Item A - Call Sign(s).
        4.2.2. Item B - Number and type(s) of aircraft, including equipment suffix(es).
        4.2.3. Item C - Departure base(s).       (ZZZZ may be used for classified departure
        locations)
        4.2.4. Item D - Route and control information for ALTRV portion of the mission to
        include:
           4.2.4.1. Altitude/flight level and point at which ALTRV begins. Include Departure
           Procedures if appropriate.
           4.2.4.2. Elapsed time from departure to the first check point or control point and
           cumulative elapsed times to each successive point in ALTRV route of flight.
           4.2.4.3. Route of flight defined by fixes, coordinates Latitude (LAT)/Longitude
           (LONG), or radial/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) from navigational aids
           (United States airspace only). Flight Information Region/Upper Information Region
           (FIR/UIR) boundaries, and border crossings from one nation’s airspace to another
           must be identified.
           4.2.4.4. For climb, descent, and compress actions, indicate where the altitude change
           will commence and the point where the altitude/flight level (level-off point) will be
           reached. Shanwick Oceanic Area Center (OAC) requires LAT/LONG level-off
           points. The altitude change follows the point where it commences.
            EXAMPLE: 5000N 0800W 0331 CLMB FL270 LVLOF BY OMOKO 0346.

Terms
Altitude Reservation (ALTRV)— Airspace of specified dimensions, coordinated in advance
with appropriate air traffic control agencies to facilitate an inflexible concept of air operations.
ALTRVs are normally employed when: A) A number of aircraft must be moved with less
separation between aircraft than is allowed by standard air traffic control (ATC) criteria. B) A
number of aircraft must operate within prescribed altitudes, timing or areas. C) Required for
special missions, which cannot be accommodated within the normal framework of the air traffic
control system.
Moving Reservation— ALTRV that advances coincident with flight progress of the mission.
Stationary Reservation— ALTRV that encompasses air operations in fixed airspace of
specified dimensions. Stationary reservations may include flight test of weapons systems
(rocket, missile or drone operations), aerial refueling, reconnaissance, aircraft carrier or
antisubmarine operations, etc.
Altitude Reservation Approval (ALTRV APVL)— Authorization (by the appropriate
authorities) to conduct an air operation within an ALTRV. An ALTRV APVL may include the
departure, enroute and arrival phases of flight. In areas of adequate ATC radar coverage (central
Europe), the approved ALTRV will receive priority ATC handling for requested times, routes,
and altitudes. In areas of no radar coverage, the approved ALTRV will generally be protected by
an international Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). Note: Missions enroute to a NOTAM ALTRV
will not normally be “cleared” into that airspace by ATC since the airspace is already “reserved”
for the mission.
Individual Flight Plan Formation— More than one aircraft operating by prior arrangement on
the same route/track as a single aircraft with regard to altitude, navigation, and position
reporting, and all aircraft contained within 1 mile of each other.
Cell Formation— A number of aircraft operating on the same route/track within an approved
ALTRV, longitudinally contained within 1 minute flying time of each other, laterally contained
within route width to be protected, and normally not using more than 3,000 consecutive feet of
altitude. The cell leader will make position reports for the cell formation at each required
reporting point.
Stream Formation— A number of aircraft operating on the same route/track within an
approved ALTRV that incorporates up to 15 minutes of longitudinal spacing between aircraft,
laterally contained within the route width to be protected and normally not using more than 3,000
feet of consecutive altitude. The first and last aircraft in a stream formation will normally make
position reports at each required reporting point and will indicate position in the formation.
Approval Request (APREQ). ALTRV APREQ— Altitude Reservation Approval Request.
Altitude Reservation Approval Void For Aircraft Not Airborne By (AVANA) Coordinated
Universal Time. AVANA (UTC)— ALTRV APVL Void for Aircraft Not Airborne by (time).
Interval Between Aircraft in Stream Formation—(IBASF), (normally specified in minutes).

Individual Flight Plan From this Point—(IFPFP). Filed according to Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Order or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) directives and
annotated in the approved altitude reservation. Note: IFPFP routes must be filed on DD Form
1801, DoD International Flight Plan, or ICAO Flight Plan, according to General Planning,
DoD Flight Information Publication, Chapter 4.
