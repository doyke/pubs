Exchange Service Station or Aero Club are excluded.
2. Procedures. The 375th Security Forces Squadron Commander has designated Scott AFB
Mascoutah gate as the primary entry/exit point for all petroleum transport vehicles. If the
Mascoutah gate cannot be opened by the security forces, the Shiloh gate is the alternate
entry/exit point. In either case, a law enforcement official must authorize the vehicle to enter the
installation. DLA-E tank truck contractors are authorized normal delivery times Monday
through Friday, 0800 to 1500 daily. Deliveries during weekend days and holidays are not
normal, but may be scheduled if needed with notification made to security forces. All petroleum
transport vehicles are directed to proceed as prearranged to Building 560, 375th Logistics
Readiness Squadron Fuels Bulk Storage Area, or Building 5036, 126th Air Refueling Wing (Air
National Guard) Fuels Flight, to await further instructions.
3. Fuels Storage personnel. The fuels storage personnel will inspect all vehicles upon arrival
for product compliance and reinspect compartments before departure. They will annotate
arrival/departure times on at least two shipping documents by placing signatures and recorded
times in appropriate blocks verifying receipt of product. One copy of the document will be
retained by Fuels Management Office and the other copy will be provided to the petroleum
transport operator.
