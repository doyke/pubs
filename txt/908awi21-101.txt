tus and are away from home station procedures for transferring aircraft to a depot or contract facility. This
instruction emphasizes readiness and support to Air Expeditionary Forces and applies to all personnel
assigned to the 908 AW. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847 Recommendation for Change of Publication as
prescribed by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Program (FMP). Route AF Form 847 to the 908 MXG/
MXM at Maxwell AFB AL. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this pub-
lication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN
33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

              NMC AIRCRAFT OPERATING ON AN AMC-DIRECTED MISSION

A2.1. Aircraft operating on AMC-directed missions are under the command and control of AMC through
the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and will be provided maintenance repair support, if needed,
through the 18 AF TACC/XOCL. For both agencies to fulfill their commitments to ensuring global com-
mand and control and maintenance support, it is imperative aircraft commanders provide timely reporting
of mission and aircraft discrepancies. Listed below are actions required of aircraft commanders and
MEGP to help affect the repair and recovery of NMC aircraft.

A2.2. At an AMC base or AMC operating location:
   A2.2.1. Utilize available AMC resources to analyze and trouble-shoot the maintenance discrepancy.
   Ensure all repair action is properly documented in the AFTO Form 781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission
   Flight Data Document.
   A2.2.2. Aircraft Commander will contact 18 AF TACC/XOCL and advise them of the NMC mainte-
   nance discrepancy. 18 AF TACC/XOCL is responsible for coordinating maintenance support for the
   repair and recovery of your NMC aircraft.
   A2.2.3. MEGPs will contact the 908 MOC, provide them with the G081 GEOLOC code, and inform
   them of NMC aircraft discrepancy and 18 AF TACC/XOCL’s plan, if available, to repair it. The 908
   MOC will notify 908 MXG and 908 OG of the current situation and aircraft status. If the 908 MOC is
   not operating, MEGPs will contact the 908 Command Post (CP) which will assume this responsibility
   and perform the tasking of the 908 MOC. If both 908 MOC and 908 CP are unavailable, the MEGPs
   will contact the 908 MXG/CC or 908 OG/CC directly.
   A2.2.4. Aircraft Commander will coordinate aircrew options with 18 AF TACC/XOCL and inform
   908 OG/CC.
   A2.2.5. MEGPs will coordinate aircraft parts requisitions and/or the need for a MRT through 18 AF
   TACC/XOCL and relay this information to the 908 MOC.

A2.3. At a non-AMC base:
   A2.3.1. Utilize existing maintenance support to analyze and repair a maintenance discrepancy, if pos-
   sible.
   A2.3.2. Aircraft Commander will contact 18 AF TACC/XOCL and advise them of the NMC discrep-
   ancy. 18 AF TACC/XOCL is responsible for coordinating the maintenance support for the repair and
   recovery of your aircraft.
   A2.3.3. MEGPs will contact the 908 MOC, provide them with the G081 station GEOLOC code, and
   inform them of the NMC aircraft discrepancy and 18 AF TACC/XOCL’s plan, if available, to repair it.
   The 908 MOC will notify 908 MXG and 908 OG of the current situation and aircraft status. If the 908
   MOC is not operating, MEGPs will contact the 908 CP which will assume this responsibility and per-
   form the tasking of the 908 MOC. If both 908 MOC and 908 CP are unavailable, the MEGPs will con-
   tact the 908 MXG/CC or 908 OG/CC directly.

    A2.3.4. Aircraft Commander will coordinate aircrew options with 18 AF TACC/XOCL and inform
    908 OG/CC.
    A2.3.5. MEGPs will coordinate aircraft parts requisition and/or MRT support through 18 AF TACC/
    XOCL and relay this information to the 908 MOC.

                (NMC) AIRCRAFT OPERATING ON A UNIT FUNDED MISSION

A3.1. Aircraft operating on unit-funded missions are controlled through AFRC/A3OC. If an aircraft is
NMC on a unit-funded mission, the home unit’s responsibility is to facilitate and fund the repair of the air-
craft. This does not mean, however, the unit will not receive assistance from AMC or other transient
maintenance. The assistance may be simply more limited or a lower AMC priority. Listed are the require-
ments of aircraft commanders and MEGPs to help effect the repair and recovery of NMC aircraft on
unit-funded missions.

A3.2. At an AMC base or operating location:
   A3.2.1. Utilize available resources to analyze and repair the maintenance discrepancy. Ensure all
   repair action is properly documented on the AFTO Form 781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
   Document. Provide the authorized maintenance repair fund cite or AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authori-
   zation to the base operating agency. Generally, if the repair parts are readily available and cost less
   than $20,000.00, the host base will not ask for a fund cite or an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authoriza-
   tion. Provide it when asked and document this on the mission set-up work.
   A3.2.2. Aircraft Commander will contact the 908 SOF (after duty hours contact 908 CP) and inform
   them of the NMC maintenance discrepancy. MEGPs will contact 908 MOC, inform them of the nature
   of the discrepancy and GO81 GEOLOC code. 908 MOC will notify the 908 MXG/CC to develop a
   repair and return plan. If the 908 MOC is not operating, MEGPs will contact the 908 CP which will
   assume this responsibility and perform the tasking of the 908 MOC. If both 908 MOC and 908 CP are
   unavailable, the MEGPs will contact the 908 MXG/CC or 908 OG/CC directly.
   A3.2.3. Aircraft Commander will coordinate aircrew options with 908 OG/CC. For some malfunc-
   tions, where there is a lengthy ETIC, it may be more prudent to secure the aircraft and ensure all per-
   sonnel return to Maxwell AFB via commercial or military transportation. 908 MXG/CC will
   determine if MEGPs will remain with the aircraft.
   A3.2.4. If determined MEGPs can repair aircraft, all parts requisitions will go through 908 MSL via
   908 MOC. If after duty hours, contact 908 CP for supply stand-by assistance.
   A3.2.5. Contact AFRC/A3OC and advise them of your NMC status and the plan, if known, to recover
   the aircraft.

A3.3. At a non-AMC base operating facility:
   A3.3.1. Utilize existing maintenance support; analyze and repair a maintenance discrepancy if possi-
   ble.
   A3.3.2. Aircraft Commander will contact the 908 SOF (after duty hours contact 908 CP) and inform
   them of the NMC maintenance discrepancy. MEGPs will contact 908 MOC, inform them of the nature
   of the discrepancy and GO81 GEOLOC code. 908 MOC will notify 908 MXG/CC to develop a repair
   and return plan. If the 908 MOC is not operating, MEGPs will contact the 908 CP which will assume
   this responsibility and perform the tasking of the 908 MOC. If both 908 MOC and 908 CP are unavail-
   able, the MEGPs will contact the 908 MXG/CC or 908 OG/CC directly.

    A3.3.3. Aircraft Commander will coordinate aircrew options with the 908 OG/ CC. For some mal-
    functions, where there is a lengthy ETIC, it may be more prudent to secure the aircraft and ensure all
    personnel return to Maxwell AFB via commercial or military transportation. 908 MXG/CC will deter-
    mine if MEGPs will remain with the aircraft.
    A3.3.4. Contact AFRC/A3OC and advise them of your NMC status and the plan, if known, to recover
    the aircraft.
