                   INSPECTOR GENERAL (IG) COMPLAINT
                                                           AND
                FRAUD, WASTE & ABUSE (FWA) PROGRAM
The role of the personal complaint (IG) and FWA program is to help the commanders
discover and correct problems affecting the productivity and morale of assigned personnel.
Members can use any level in the IG system to address issues; but are strongly encouraged
to exhaust their chain of command first, and then give the local IG an opportunity to help.
Members are protected by federal law from reprisal for complaining to commanders, IG,
or congressmen.
