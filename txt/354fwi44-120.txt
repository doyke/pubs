1. RANDOM URINALYSIS DRUG TESTING AT THE INSTALLATION MAIN GATE
    1.1. Only the Commander, 354th Fighter Wing (354 FW/CC) or designee will authorize
    random urinalysis drug testing selection of personnel at the installation’s main gate referred
    to as a ―gate sweep‖. The 354 FW/CC or designee will:
       1.1.1. Include the Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager (DRPM) and 354th
       Fighter Wing Judge Advocate (FW/JA) during the planning process of a gate sweep and
       provide a copy of the Execution Order (EXORD) to the DRPM in order to ensure
       appropriate resources are available.
       1.1.2. Determine the date/time(s) for a gate sweep, which is not to be announced prior to
       the event. Only the 354 FW/CC, designee and DRPM/Drug Testing Program
       Administrative Manager (DTPAM) will have knowledge of the details.
       1.1.3. Select method of random testing for all U.S. active duty personnel to include
       active duty personnel on temporary duty (TDY) at Eielson Air Force Base.
       1.1.4. Ensure all notifications are made to the DRPM/DTPAM in strict confidence and
       provide pertinent data to facilitate arrangement of sufficient manpower in concert with
       DRPM.
       1.1.5. Ensure the mission of the 354th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) is not impacted
       during a gate sweep. At no time will random entry point urinalysis drug screenings
       interfere with the duties and responsibilities of posted 354 SFS members.
       1.1.6. Ensure, in conjunction with DDRPM, the collection, storage, and processing of
       specimens are executed IAW AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing Program
    1.2. Gate sweep urinalysis testing will utilize the following procedures:
       1.2.1. 354 FW/CC or designee, in conjunction with DDRPM, will assign monitors at the
       gate to issue instructions for ―Conducting a gate sweep on Eielson Air Force Base.‖
       (Attachment 2)
       1.2.2. The monitors will retrieve the military identification card from each active duty
       military member in the selected vehicle for the purpose of collecting information.
       1.2.3. The monitors will complete all of the information on the ―Gate Sweep Drug
       Urinalysis Selection and Screening Order‖ (Attachment 3) for each active duty military
       member. Each active duty military member will then sign the 1st endorsement on the
       order.
       1.2.4. The monitors will complete a ―Gate Sweep Drug Urinalysis Selection and
       Screening Log‖ (Attachment 4) with one entry for each selected active duty military
       member to include name, grade, social security number, and organization. The member
       will then sign the log.
       1.2.5. In the event the service member is not in possession of the military identification
       card, the service member will provide another form of personal identification. The 354
       SFS will be the authority to determine acceptable alternate forms of identification. In the
354FWI44-120 17 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                  3


     event the service member does not have any identification, 354 SFS will consult with 354
     FW/JA for guidance.
     1.2.6. The monitor will issue the signed gate sweep drug urinalysis selection and
     screening order to each selected active duty military member and direct them to the
     collection site immediately. The monitor will retain the signed log.
     1.2.7. Active duty military members will report to the designated collection facility with
     their signed gate sweep drug urinalysis selection and screening orders and military
     identification card or acceptable alternate form of identification as determined by 354
     SFS. The 354 SFS will coordinate testing through DRPM after consulting with 354
     FW/JA for those active duty members without identification.
     1.2.8. At the end of the specified gate sweep inspection period, the monitor will report to
     the collection site and provide the DRPM with the completed gate sweep drug urinalysis
     selection and screening log. The DRPM/DTPAM will match the information provided
     on the sign-in log with the signed orders collected at the site as well as the urine samples
     provided. Any shortfalls or discrepancies will be reported to the individual's commander
     and 354 FW/JA for action.
  1.3. The 354 FW/JA will ensure a representative is available (either on-site or on call) to
  provide legal guidance to the 354 FW/CC or designee, DRPM, and 354 SFS during the
  notification and collection process.
  1.4. The DRPM or designee will report all cases of suspected adulteration and refusals to
  submit the required specimen to the active duty service member’s unit commander and 354
  FW/JA. Commanders are required to investigate and take disciplinary action as appropriate.
2. RECALL OF BASE PERSONNEL FOR INSPECTION TESTING
  2.1. At the 354 FW/CC or designee’s discretion, any unit(s) and/or percentage of unit(s) may
  be directed for drug urinalysis testing. The 354 FW/CC or designee will:
     2.1.1. Include the DRPM and 354 FW/JA during the initial planning process of the base
     personnel recall and will ensure the DRPM has a copy of the EXORD. This will ensure
     appropriate resources are allocated. The 354 FW/JA will provide legal advice during the
     initial planning process.
     2.1.2. Exclude all military members to include 354 FW/JA from the remaining planning
     process so that only the 354 FW/CC or designee and the DRPM/DTPAM will know,
     prior to the testing, the date and time of testing. DRPM should have adequate
     notification to allocate appropriate resources, materials, and personnel.
  2.2. Personnel randomly selected for inspection testing will be selected by the Air Force
  Drug Testing Program (AFDTP) unless 100% unit sweep is requested.
     2.2.1. After the DRPM/DTPAM has completed the random selection, the AFDTP
     product will be placed in a sealed envelope and secured in the Drug Demand Reduction
     Program (DDRP) secured storage until the time to proceed with the recall.
  2.3. Once the recall begins, the DRPM will notify the 354 FW/CC or designee that one of
  the units has been randomly selected for inspection testing.

       2.3.1. The 354 FW/CC or designee will contact the group commander of the selected
       unit and notify him/her that one of his/her units has been randomly selected for inspection
       testing and recall of personnel in the selected unit is necessary. The 354 FW/CC or
       designee can delegate the authority to the DRPM to notify the group commander of the
       selection.
       2.3.2. The group commander will receive, via encrypted e-mail, the information
       pertaining to the selected unit and members with an attached list of trusted agents and a
       letter of instruction detailing the notification process.
       2.3.3. Group commanders will comply with the instructions outlined in the letter,
       ―Instruction for Base Recall Urinalysis Testing‖ (Attachment 5) and will proceed to
       notify the unit commander of their random selection. Group commanders can delegate
       the authority to the DRPM to send, via encrypted e-mail the notification to the unit
       commander and trusted agents with the names of the active duty service members
       randomly selected for inspection testing.
       2.3.4. Upon receipt of the notification letters, the trusted agents will have their unit
       commander properly sign the letters as they notify the active duty members selected for
       the inspection testing.
       2.3.5. Upon completion of the notification process, the trusted agents will send a status
       report, via encrypted e-mail, accounting for all selected active duty members to the
       DRPM/DTPAM.
           2.3.5.1. Active duty members who are deployed or are TDY from Eielson will have a
           ―Return To Duty‖ date entered into the AFDTP software and will test upon return
           IAW AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing Program. Commanders can include this in
           their EXORD.
           2.3.5.2. Active duty members that have recently left Eielson for a Permanent Change
           of Station, were discharged, retired or separated from the Air Force will have the test
           cancelled in the AFDTP with a specific cancellation comment.
       2.3.6. After testing is completed, the DRPM/ DTPAM will match the trusted agents’
       status report with the number of notification letters and samples collected at the DDRP
       testing site. Any discrepancies, cases of suspected adulteration, and refusals to submit
       the required specimen will be reported to the unit commander and the 354 FW/JA.
       Commanders are required to investigate the discrepancies and take disciplinary action as
       appropriate.
    2.4. The 354 FW/JA will ensure a representative is available (either on-site or on call) to
    provide legal guidance to the DRPM and commanders during the notification and collection
    process of base recall personnel urinalysis drug screenings.
