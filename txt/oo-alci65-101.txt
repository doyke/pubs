1. General Information.
   1.1. A reorganization is herein defined as a change to the approved structure of
   organizational elements or realignment of duties and responsibilities that would create a
   change to positions or organizational entities. It includes changes in mission responsibilities
   from one organization element to another, and the realignment of positions at flight-level or
   above. After proper notifications IAW Article 33 of the Master Labor Agreement, and
   approval of the realignment takes place, implementation may begin. As a result of the
   implementation of Depot Maintenance Accounting Production System (DMAPS),
   reorganizations of RCCs must be accomplished on a limited basis. The optimum time for
   reorganization is during the budget cycle to be effective at the beginning of a fiscal year. If
   there is a critical need to reorganize during the year of execution, the reorganizations will be
 2                                                              OO-ALCI65-101 13 MAY 2013


     effective at the beginning of a quarter. The planning for RCC reorganizations must be
     accomplished 90 to 120-days before the effective date of the reorganization.
        1.1.1. The OO-ALC Financial Management Office (OO-ALC/FM) has overall program
        management responsibilities and is the designated OPR for RCC management within the
        OO-ALC.
2. RCC Reorganization Procedures.
     2.1. Squadron OPR must submit a letter signed by the squadron chief to OO-ALC/FM
     requesting approval for reorganization a minimum 90 days prior to the effective date of the
     RCC change, or prior to the budget cycle for new RCCs. The justification and advantages of
     the RCC requested changes must be addressed in the letter. A minimum of 5,000 annual
     production hours will be required for approval of a new RCC; a waiver may be submitted in
     special circumstances and will be reviewed by OO-ALC/FM on a case-by-case basis. If OO-
     ALC/FM approves the reorganization, the squadron making the approved RCC changes must
     appoint and provide a knowledgeable monitor and alternate monitor to spearhead the RCC
     changes with OO-ALC\FM and 75th Air Base Wing Information Technology Directorate (75
     ABW/SCPLM), usually a planner or planner supervisor. The squadron requesting the
     reorganization will be the lead point of contact (POC) for the duration of the project. When
     approval is granted, OO-ALC/FM will notify Air Force Sustainment Center Cost Accounting
     Office (AFSC/FZRD) operating location (OL) Financial Management Hill (FZH) so the
     systems maintenance can begin. OO-ALC/FM will send a copy of the letter with an
     authorized signature and annotate ‘Approved’ on it to the 75 ABW/SCPLM. The requesting
     organization’s POC will then be advised to complete the RCC Reorganization Package found
     at https://hill.eis.af.mil/75ABWSC/CFP/default.aspx, and return it to 75 ABW/SCPLM,
     who will forward it to each of the system OPRs for review. If there is a need for further
     discussion, 75 ABW/SCPLM will schedule a meeting to discuss requirements and assign
     taskings. If the package is in order and there are no further concerns, a meeting will not be
     necessary. OPRs will coordinate actions specific to each of their systems and begin their
     processes in a synchronized manner. Requestor will receive notification when their
     reorganization is complete. NOTE: Planners and schedulers are responsible for inputs that
     they can currently perform (i.e., updating planner and schedule address tables).
     2.2. The following procedures pertain to workloading, planning, scheduling, material
     support, cost accounting, funds management, resource advisors, manpower specialist and
     managers.
        2.2.1. Systems Impacts. All systems must be sequentially file maintained to accept the
        new RCCs. This is critical so that the RCC will be effective, workload can be inducted,
        and costs can be captured properly.
            2.2.1.1. Depot Maintenance Workload and Program Control System G004C. The
            squadron OPR must provide the required system data to OO-ALC Workload Review
            Office (OO-ALC/OBW) and OO-ALC/FM.
            2.2.1.2. Cost Production Performance Module (HO33) and Budget and Target
            Module (BTM). After the new RCCs have been approved by OO-ALC/FM, the
            group financial managers must build an organization structure and budget for the new
            RCCs. This must be a coordinated effort with OO-ALC/FM. Once the budget has
OO-ALCI65-101 13 MAY 2013                                                                  3


        been built, OO-ALC/FM must notify AFSC/FZRD OL FZH to establish the new
        RCCs in Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS). A new RCC
        cannot be added to BTM until it is approved by OO-ALC/FM.
        2.2.1.3. RCCs Skill Code System (RSCS). The squadron OPR will provide the new
        skill codes if applicable to 75 ABW/SCPLM.
        2.2.1.4. DIFMS. The new RCCs in DIFMS will be established by OO-ALC/FMRD.
        This can only be accomplished after the RCCs have a budget built in BTM. DIFMS
        requires overhead, general and administrative application rates be developed for each
        RCC. These rates are developed in the budget process. NOTE: Skill codes cannot
        be entered into RSCS until RCCs have been loaded into DIFMS.
        2.2.1.5. Job Order Production Master System (G004L). The planners, schedulers
        and/or workloaders must update the planner and scheduler address table. NOTE:
        This has to occur before the Exchangeable Production System (G402A) OPR can
        proceed.
        2.2.1.6. Inventory Tracking System (ITS/G337). All affected production numbers
        must be changed in ITS/G337 to reflect the applicable RCC changes.
        2.2.1.7. Depot Maintenance Material Support System (G005M). The name of the
        responsible planner and the production organization planning technician code
        (POPTC) needs to be provided to the system OPR. The planner can input a
        Secondary Item Requirements System (D200) request and establish a production
        number in G005M once it has been established in G004L. When RCCs change, the
        losing planner is responsible for maintaining G005M and transferring workload to the
        gaining planner POPTC.
        2.2.1.8. Labor Standard Data System(E046B). The planners must update the new
        RCC to the affected current labor standards in E046B. Ensure skill codes have been
        entered into the RSCS in order for E046B to function properly. Facility codes must
        be maintained in E046B for the affected RCCs changes.
        2.2.1.9. Stock Control and Distribution System (D035K). The D035K OPR must
        update the backorders and awaiting parts assets to reflect the new RCCs with
        information from the RCC Reorganization Package.
        2.2.1.10. Equipment Depreciation. Equipment accounts must be established for the
        new RCCs and the equipment records updated. Plant account numbers must be
        provided to OO-ALC/FM Capital Investment Program monitor for RCC changes in
        DIFMS.
        2.2.1.11. Navair Industrial Material Management System and Automated Bill of
        Material. The planner working with the material support personnel, must provide to
        the functional system OPR the old RCC, the new RCC for both direct and indirect,
        the building station number, effective date of the new RCC, and the Standard Base
        Supply System (SBSS/D002A) organization codes.
        2.2.1.12. Time and Attendance (TAA) System. The squadron OPR must provide the
        TAA OPR a list of the employees that will be assigned to the new RCC. NOTE: If
        the old RCC is being deleted, it must also be provided.
 4                                                            OO-ALCI65-101 13 MAY 2013


            2.2.1.13. Defense Civilian Payroll System (DCPS). The squadron OPR must
            determine if all organization changes were properly updated in DCPS from the
            personnel system. If not, the squadron OPR must contact the customer service
            representative to have all required changes made within DCPS.
            2.2.1.14. Facility Equipment Maintenance (D130).         Planners and equipment
            custodians will provide the old/new production RCCs, the old/new organization
            RCCs, the associated job order numbers, the precision measurement equipment
            laboratory monitor name and phone number, and the mailing address to the system
            OPR so the equipment records will be accurate based on the reorganization.
            2.2.1.15. Execution and Prioritization of Repair Support System D087X
            (EXPRESS). Squadron OPR will provide the new production scheduling section
            designators and associated national stock number to the system OPR to load the
            EXPRESS data table.
            2.2.1.16. Material Processing System D230 (MPS). Squadron OPR must provide the
            new RCCs and material inventory control code to the MPS OPR so file updates can
            be accomplished.
            2.2.1.17. SBSS/D002A. Equipment custodians are responsible for updating the
            equipment accounts within SBSS/D002A. Squadron OPR must coordinate the new
            RCCs with the equipment custodians.
            2.2.1.18. Computer Associates-Dispatch On-Line Viewing. Squadron OPR must
            identify the computer generated report requirements in each system so functional
            address symbols and RCCs data can be changed. This requirement must be
            accomplished so hard copy product distribution can be maintained.
            2.2.1.19. G402A. The Squadron OPR must update all of the function codes and
            symbols.
            2.2.1.20. DMAPS Data Store and Conversion Engine. Notify the OPR of the old
            RCC, new RCC, production number, and POPTC changes if rolling to that level.
            2.2.1.21. Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling Subsystem (G097A).
            DMAPS sends changes and the planners change the design codes to match DMAPS.
            2.2.1.22. Operational Readiness Analysis. Notify the OPR of national stock numbers
            for reparable items that are not consumable (unless that need exists), old and new
            scheduling designators, and old and new mailing addresses.
3. Manpower Section.
     3.1. The squadron OPR will notify OO-ALC Management Operations Office (OO-
     ALC/OBM) analyst of the proposed organizational changes a minimum 90 days prior to the
     required effective date of the organizational changes, or prior to the budget cycle for new
     RCCs.
     3.2. The squadron OPR will provide the Organizational Change Request (OCR) information
     to the OO-ALC/OBM analyst that is needed to complete the required portions of the package
     that are applicable depending on the level of the organizational change. This includes a
     mission statement, old office symbol, new office symbol, old organization title, new
OO-ALCI65-101 13 MAY 2013                                                                      5


  organization title, building the organization will be located in, phone number, fax number,
  and also the affected authorizations/positions.
  3.3. When determining the new RCC and new organization office symbols, every effort will
  be made to ensure that the two reasonably correlate. The OO-ALC/OBM analyst will
  prepare the applicable portions of the OCR package and cover letters addressed to AFSC
  Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Training, OL Hill, and Manpower and Organization
  Division (AFSC DPH/DPB), submit it for coordination through the group requesting the
  changes. If the organization changes are at the squadron-level and above, final approval is
  required from Air Force Sustainment Center (HQ-AFSC), Air Force Materiel Command
  (HQ-AFMC) and HQ Air Force (HQ-AF), the OO-ALC commander/vice director or deputy
  director must sign the cover letter. If the changes are at the flight-level and below, the AFSC
  OL DPH/DPB Division Chief may approve the package.
  3.4. The organization may not receive mail, reassign employees or function as though the
  changes have been made until the OO-ALC/OBM analyst is notified of the approval.
     3.4.1. AFSC OL DPH/DPB follows their own process and notifies the HQ-AFMC
     systems OPR to change the Unit Manning Document (UMD) System and Defense
     Personnel Systems OPR to build the new organizations in the Modern Defense Civilian
     Personnel Data System (MDCPDS), and the base post office to ensure proper mail
     delivery. Once the organizational changes have been created to the UMD and MDCPDS,
     the OO-ALC/OBM analyst will submit an Authorization Change Request to the AFSC
     OL DPH/DPB manpower analyst. This ensures the authorizations reflect the changes and
     initiates the request for personnel actions to realign the employees to the correct office
     symbols in MDCPDS.
