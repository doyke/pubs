1.5.2.3. (Added) Releasing SORTS Data to the Public. Requests for SORTS information will be
coordinated through HQ AFGSC/A3CR prior to release. Include in the package the data to be
released in the format intended for disclosure, the date, time and database snapshot used or the
timeframe of the compiled data and the medium or forum and date of disclosure. However, if any
portion of the requested data is denied or request cites the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
process through the FOIA Office. FOIA Office will coordinate through HQ AFGSC/A3CR, who
in turn will coordinate with the AF Operational Readiness Division (HQ AF/A3OR). Approval
will be for the specified data and event only.
1.6.8.1. (Added) Major equipment authorized (MEPSA), report the number of aircraft or missiles
identified in the Part 2 of the units DOC Statement, not the number tasked in OPLANS.
1.6.8.2. (Added) Reporting Crew Location and Status (MEQLOCN) data (aviation and missile
units only). This data does not drive unit C-level. The reported data will reflect the unit’s status

1.11.8.2. Ensures DOC statement listed UTCs are aligned with unit UTC availability provided by
the FAM and documented in the AFGSC extract of the Air Force Wide-UTC Availability
System (UTC Availability Listing). Documentation of UTC availability in the WMP system is a
valid wartime tasking for worldwide contingencies regardless of whether or not a unit is sourced
with a particular UTC in a deliberate plan. Unit UTC availability, provided by the staff FAM and
documented in the UTC Availability Listing extract, constitutes tasking. Units should be
manned, trained and equipped to maintain the tasked capability. Therefore, unit UTC availability
documented in the AFGSC UTC Availability Listing extract is the basis for DOC statement
listed UTCs.
1.11.10.1.3. Wing SORTS managers will attend the ACC SORTS Managers course within 6
months of appointment as the Wing SORTS manager. This class is unit funded but scheduled
through the AFGSC/A3CR office.

AF/A3OR approval to use an electronically created replica in place of the AF IMT 723, DOC
Statement.
1.11.11.1.2.1. Unit commanders select unit SORTS monitors on the basis of unit mission and
SORTS measured area/report preparation knowledge. Unit monitors shall have sufficient
retainability to establish continuity and consistency within the unit SORTS program. SORTS
reports are a commander responsibility and will not be delayed due to unavailability of SORTS
monitors.
1.11.11.1.2.2. Provide an MFR signed by the unit commander with the name, rank, office
symbol, signature, clearance, and phone number of all individuals trained in SORTS to the SRO.

1.11.11.1.5. Unit Commanders indicate SORTS data approval by signing the SORTS reports, to
include remarks worksheets prior to submission to the Wing SORTS Manager.
1.11.11.1.6. Within three duty days of notification by the SRO that the unit SORTS report has
been processed and requires review, commanders will indicate review of the monthly SORTS
report by signing and dating a GSORTS database product provided by the SRO (e.g., Speed of
Light Retrieval). Return a copy of the signed report to the SRO for records. Unit commanders
will ensure SORTS monitors correct any SORTS errors found during review within 24 hours.
1.11.11.1.8. Unit commanders must sign and date DOC statement upon initial review (prior to
first report transmission), annual review, and/or new DOC statement receipt.
1.11.11.1.8.3. (Added) The deputy commander or designated alternate(s) on G-series orders may
sign the DOC statement if the commander is deployed or unavailable for more than 30 days.

have been directed to report on civilians.
1.11.12.1.2. Training will be conducted between measured units and Direct Support Unit (DSU)
annually or upon SORTS monitor position change. Training will consist of explaining the
personnel and equipment requirements between the measured units and the DSU as stated on the
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Documentation of unit training will be maintained by the
monitor.
1.11.12.1.3. Ensures worksheets along with DOC statement reportable data are provided to the
measured unit monitor within the measured units reporting timeline.
1.11.12.1.4. MOAs will be written between DSUs and the measured units which they support (an
example MOA can be found at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?
Filter=OO-OP-AC-35), and will identify the resources provided and how those resources will
be allocated. MOAs must be reviewed annually.
2.4.1. HQ AFGSC/A3CR will send a weekly message to SROs notifying AFGSC units with a
RICDA and/or CADAT date older than 30 days. Wing SROs will ensure delinquent reports are
updated within 24 hours.
2.8. Unit’s with personnel or equipment on an Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotation will not
count those personnel or equipment as available. For equipment that is deployed do not show
the condition in the RAS/IT program. Clear the line so the equipment condition is not reported
at 100 percent. For personnel a mandatory PRRES remark using the following example will be
present in all SORTS reports. This remark provides a brief explanation of the units Personnel
level and provides progressive get well dates.
Authorized/Assigned/Available (Total Personnel)
       145/125/85     125-85=40 (40 personnel unavailable)
Authorized/Assigned/Available
       65/47/39       47-39=8 (8 personnel unavailable)
PRRES Example: P-4 Due to shortage of enlisted maintenance personnel. Total personnel
unavailable 40/30 personnel deployed/5 personnel on medical profiles/5 personnel in upgrade
training (UGT). Critical personnel unavailable 8/4 personnel on medical profiles/2 personnel in
UGT/2 personnel deployed. Forecast to P-3 is 30 Dec 09. Forecast to P-2 is 30 Jan 10. GWD to
P-1 is 28 Feb 10.
Note: If the unit has no shortages the PRRES remark will state, “Unit has no shortages in Total
or Critical personnel”.
2.11.11.2 Commanders will not assess their unit C-level up at any time. Commanders may
assess down if they believe the data that is reflected by the C-level does not match the current
state of their unit. The intent of this guidance is to ensure the HAF and AFGSC have the most
accurate picture of the state of readiness of each unit.

3.1.2.5. CPASG Remark. For units that are reporting personnel packets in addition to the normal
personnel remarks, report the assigned, available, required and percentage numbers for each
packet in the remark labeled “CPASG”.
3.3.2. Critical Personnel Percentage. Units use one of two methods for computing critical
personnel percentages; the single percentage computation method or the multiple percentage
computation method. The method used is derived from Table 3.1. for each unit type not located
in AFI 10-201. If the entries in Table 3.1., columns B and/or C are separated by commas only,
the single percentage computation method is used. If the entries in Table 3.1., columns B and C
include semicolons, the multiple percentage computation method is used. Calculate critical
personnel using the following rules:
