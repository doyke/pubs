Numbers, numbers, numbers – how many/how big/what percentage/$value.

Minimize ―white space‖ – remove fluff – replace long words – purge dead words: a, and, the,
that, use ―&‖, ―/‖, ―M‖, ―K‖, ―+‖.

Arrange bullets carefully – right category – group subjectively.

Check/re-check spelling – shorten words sparingly.
