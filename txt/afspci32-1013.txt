                                            Chapter 1

                                           OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose The purpose of this instruction is to address Air Force Civil Engineering (AFCE)
changes resulting from adoption of the Asset Management (AM) philosophy and concept in the
AF Civil Engineer Transformation. It establishes accountability and reduces or eliminates
fragmentation of infrastructure activity responsibilities throughout AFSPC civil engineering
organizations. This instruction also implements the Activity Management Plan (AMP) process,
which is to identify, prioritize, advocate, and resource requirements for effective life-cycle
management. The goal is to provide installations tools to develop solid, defendable programs
based on asset management principles which are transparent, defendable, and replicable.
1.2. Background
     1.2.1. AM takes a broader, more holistic view of AF facility and infrastructure assets, how
     they should be integrated, and what service or support they are intended to provide. It goes
     well beyond the CE AM flight, engaging especially the Programs, Operations, and Resources
     flights. Ultimately, the AM approach will integrate functional stovepipes, strengthen resource
     advocacy, and optimize resource allocation.
        1.2.1.1. While AM has become a central part of CE culture, specific duties regarding the
        cradle-to-grave ownership component of the AM concept have not previously been
        identified in AFSPC guidance. This instruction addresses accountability for infrastructure
        activities and systems at the installation and MAJCOM level.
        1.2.1.2. To provide the mission support for which CE is responsible, facilities,
        infrastructure, and other assets must perform effectively. Activities, such as 'provide
        electrical power,' are important, if not critical, components of AFSPC missions. These
        activities are made up of physical assets, such as transmission lines. Accountability at the
        activity level is necessary to ensure assets are not nearing unanticipated failure and are
        providing the activity or service required by AF missions. Through accountability or
        activity “ownership,” CE will achieve a primary focus on the successful delivery of the
        activity to the AF customer. Thus, the Activity Ownership concept continues to ingrain
        AM into AFSPC‟s CE organizational structure.
     1.2.2. Relationship to Previous Organizational Structure
        1.2.2.1. Transforming into an activity ownership model will take significant time and
        effort at all levels. One of the major changes CE has come through is the realignment of
        the Maintenance Engineering functions. Although the formal Maintenance Engineering
        element is no longer used, the functions of the element still exist and are not only
        required but essential to optimizing resources, both personnel and financial.
        1.2.2.2. Under the previous AFCE organization, the Maintenance Engineering element
        provided project expertise, infrastructure program management, non-design drafting,
        service and utility contract management, and oversaw administration of the recurring
        work program including work analysis and improvement.
1.3. Asset Management and Activity Ownership Concept
AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011                                                                        5


   1.3.1. Operating installations and facilities requires employing a sustainable asset
   management approach using common levels of service by implementing AMPs for built and
   natural assets. This approach integrates requirements to deliver installation support services
   needed for mission execution, provides the capability to advocate for resources, and then
   supports allocation of the necessary resources to provide, operate, maintain, and protect
   facilities, infrastructure, and installations required for effective mission support worldwide at
   their lowest lifecycle cost.
   1.3.2. AFSPC is required to provide and retain the optimum number of installations and
   facilities necessary to effectively support Air Force missions and people at the lowest life-
   cycle cost and in a sustainable way.
   1.3.3. AFSPC will conduct its installations and facilities activities according to applicable
   laws, regulations, Federal policies, international treaties, and host-nation agreements.
   1.3.4. AFSPC will determine appropriate levels of investment for installations and facilities.
   1.3.5. To achieve AFPD 32-10 requirements, AMPs at both HQ AFSPC and installation
   levels have been created, along with AMP manager designations, using a spiral development
   approach. This instruction accomplishes the next spiral iteration by developing roles and
   responsibilities for accountable positions in the CE structure at both HQ AFSPC and
   installation levels. Eventually every activity will have a comprehensive operations,
   maintenance, and investment strategy developed and advocated. Only with accountability of
   individual activities can stakeholders be brought together to make better short- and long-
   term decisions regarding facility investments.
   1.3.6. The AFSPC Activity Owner (AO) is an individual responsible and accountable for
   this comprehensive management of a designated activity to ensure delivery of high quality
   services to support the mission. The AO will work with AMP managers and Program
   Element Monitors (PEM)s across HQ AFSPC divisions or squadron flights and build
   effective teams within AFSPC CE organizations.
1.4. Asset/Activity Management Plan Process and Activity Ownership
   1.4.1. The five Base or MAJCOM Activity Management Plans (Utilities, Transportation,
   Facilities, Natural Infrastructure and Waste Management) and the respective Comprehensive
   Asset Management Plans at installation or MAJCOM level provide interim tools for AOs.
   These tools include access to legacy databases (Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES),
   Enterprise Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health Management Information System
   (EESOH-MIS), etc.), and an action plan to resolve issues. Activity Management Plans
   (AMPs) are effectively data warehouses, giving AOs visibility of multi-year resource
   requirements, prioritized issues, etc. AMP process requirements are specified in the
   HAF/A7C AMP Playbook on the Air Force Civil Engineering Portal website.
   1.4.2. HQ AFSPC/A4/7 will manage the AFSPC AMP program through the Asset
   Management Integrated Working Group (AMIWG). The charter of the AMIWG will
   designate managers for each MAJCOM AMP (MAMP) as well as the overall MAJCOM
   Comprehensive Asset Management Plan (MCAMP). The AMIWG will be the forum for
   bringing AOs and PEMs together to develop and prioritize programs. The AMIWG will
   develop integrated priority lists (IPLs) for all PPBE submittals (POM, Execution Plan, Initial
   Distribution, Year-end, etc.).

    1.4.3. BCEs will designate managers for each Base AMP (BAMP) as well as their respective
    Base Comprehensive Asset Management Plan (BCAMP). Maintenance of BAMPs,
    BCAMPs, MAMPs and the AFSPC MCAMP will be IAW the AMP Playbook.
AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011                                                                      7


                                           Chapter 2

                         ACTIVITY OWNERSHIP OBJECTIVES

2.1. Overview of Activity Ownership.
   2.1.1. The AO is a professional-level (four-year degreed engineer, program manager, or
   equivalent) within the HQ AFSPC A4/7 directorate or installation civil engineer squadron
   who manages an activity from “cradle to grave.” This individual is responsible for the
   overall lifecycle operation, maintenance, repair, compliance, sustainment, and
   recapitalization of the given activity, within the resource constraints on the organization.
   He/she assembles and utilizes an IPT across the CE organization to assess the activity,
   identify requirements, and effectively plan, program, budget, and execute resources
   necessary for optimal lifecycle operation of the activity. The AO ensures the activity meets
   or exceeds all key performance indicators (when established) to deliver optimal service. An
   AO prioritizes projects within the respective activity, identifying and working to resolve
   issues.
2.2. HQ AFSPC Activity Ownership
   2.2.1. HQ AFSPC AOs and activity team members will be appointed from Asset
   Management, Plans and Programs, and Operations divisions as specified in Chapter 4.
   Activity team members provide the AO with functional support from the other two divisions,
   depending on the division location of the AO. At the HQ AFSPC level, they will provide
   assistance to their installation counterparts, and consolidate activity requirements. HQ
   AFSPC AOs will be highly knowledgeable on their activities, interfacing with higher
   headquarters, AF Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and private industry to optimize activities.
   They identify and implement activity optimization opportunities (incorporate opportunity
   assessments into the activity inventory/assessments). Some program areas extend outside the
   HQ AFSPC/A4/7 organization; AOs may expand the activity teams as needed.
   2.2.2. HQ AFSPC/A4/7 AOs will ensure activity inventory, condition, performance, and
   operational risk assessments at a frequency determined by the HQ AFSPC AMIWG or HAF
   AFAMP Managers/SMEs. They will validate requirements generated by the installation AOs
   and identify additional support requirements as necessary.
   2.2.3. HQ AFSPC AOs will review associated HQ AFSPC AMP products, ensuring activity
   projects are accurately captured and mapped to the correct AMP.
   2.2.4. Each Air Force Program Element (PE) is assigned a single PEM to act as the focal
   point for that PE. A PEM is usually assigned from within the Secretariat or Air Staff, based
   on the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for that PE. HQ AF/A8PE is the approval
   authority and the AF point of contact for all PE actions. PE documentation is maintained in
   the AF FYDP Structure Management System (AF FSMS). PEMs establish accounts in this
   web based system and are the AF POC for all PE actions. PEMs are primary advocates for
   their PEs, addressing issues and coordinating functional concerns across various staffs. Air
   Staff PEMs are expected to be the subject matter expert at the Air Staff level on their PEs. In
   conjunction with the Mission/Mission Support Panels, they prepare and update various
   planning, programming, and budgeting documents within the PPBE process. MAJCOMs
   have corresponding PEMs, and HQ AFSPC PEMs are supported in turn by respective AOs.
 8                                                                AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011


     2.2.5. HQ AFSPC AOs integrate activity requirements in the Planning, Programming,
     Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. HQ AFSPC AOs assist in ensuring requirements
     are built at the installations. They prioritize requirements, then assist the PEMs in developing
     an Integrated Priority List for each Program Element Code (PEC) for the applicable FY. All
     HQ AFSPC AOs will develop program requirements consistent with the guidance in this
     AFSPCI.
     2.2.6. The PEM, in partnership with the AO, is accountable for funds distribution and
     execution. The PEM will prepare and distribute policy and guidance to installations and HQ
     AFSPC AOs for developing the following year‟s program, including PEM-centric execution
     instructions (customized to individual programs), focus programs, score cards, execution,
     ACES programming and data calls, and milestones. AOs need to provide activity-specific
     goals and guidance to the PEM as part of the PEM annual guidance.
2.3. Installation Activity Ownership
     2.3.1. Installation AOs will be appointed in CE organizations as specified in Chapter 4, to
     allow manpower validation at the needed level. Base Civil Engineers (BCEs) may request
     variations due to special circumstances from HQ AFSPC/A4/7. For example, at a base with
     few facilities and significant steam/natural gas distribution, facility HVAC may be more
     appropriate with the Facility AO than Mechanical AO. AO general responsibilities are
     covered in Chapter 3. Installation AOs build and prioritize requirements incorporating
     lifecycle management solutions into existing business processes. AOs integrate activity
     requirements in the PPBE process and project execution and management.
     2.3.2. AOs as IPT leaders are responsible for maintaining activity environmental
     compliance. They are supported in this responsibility by CEAN.
2.4. Specific Objectives for HQ AFSPC and Installation Activity Ownership
     2.4.1. Objectives for the AO include development and management of comprehensive
     maintenance, repair and revitalization program for a designated activity. This includes
     ongoing inventory and assessment. The deliverable/product will be a comprehensive
     maintenance, repair and revitalization program for the activity with requirements planned,
     programmed, and executed in time of need. The AO manages a “program” that is transparent
     and understood by all team members, advocating for necessary resources from Facility
     Operations (FO), Sustainment, Restoration, Modernization, and Demolition (SRM-D),
     Military Construction (MILCON), Environmental Quality (EQ), and Housing program
     elements. The AO participates in (multiple, if necessary) AMP builds.
2.5. Requirements Programming by HQ AFSPC and Installation Activity Owners
     2.5.1. AOs either ensure multi-year programming of requirements or program themselves
     their activities requirements in ACES, Interim Work Information Management System
     (IWIMS), or Next Generation Information Technology (NexGen IT). While planning should
     be for a complete lifecycle of system components, programming is focused on a discrete
     timeframe. The original AM vision called for a 10-year programming timeframe. However,
     this changed to a FYDP+2 timeframe. FYDP+2 ensures consistency with the Integrated Data
     Call, supports development of accurate Facility Condition Index (FCI)/Q-Rating scores and
     provides the critical underlying data that supports our defense of facility/infrastructure
     funding through the AF Corporate Structure.
AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011                                                                   9


  2.5.2. There are many known needs that can be programmed including ongoing service
  contracts, utility costs, and contracted plans accomplished on specific intervals. AOs review
  these requirements and plan for as many as required in the 10 year window. This will become
  easier as CE introduces IT tools that include lifecycle predictive models.
  2.5.3. AO FYDP+2 programming is "unconstrained." This means programming
  requirements for a particular year regardless of cost. However, the best overall programs
  establish somewhat stable funding level needs over the FYDP+2 timeframe. The intent is not
  to constrain programming requirements based on historical funding levels but to be aware of
  funding challenges across the AF while working to invest dollars in those requirements that
  are the most critical to the AF mission. Aligning work over the FYDP+2 period (where
  mission needs and risk allow) improves planning and the ability to predict what and when
  work can be accomplished.

                                           Chapter 4

                 ACTIVITY OWNER ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. The Activity Owner
   4.1.1. Designation as an AO does not preclude other duties, but provides a mindset for the
   individual of activity accountability. For example, AOs may also be compliance media leads
   in CEAN. Supervisors should take into account the potential tenure of individuals assigned
   AO duties, as the intent is to have AOs acquire extensive knowledge of their particular
   activity which is developed over time.
   4.1.2. Specific activities and activity ownership assignments are identified in Chapter 5.
4.2. The Integrated Process Team (IPT)
   4.2.1. Per AFPD 32-10 MAJCOM and Installation commanders shall: “Conduct installations
   and facilities matters through a multifunctional team approach using asset management
   principles and common levels of service.” The AO will be the leader of each AO IPT,
   intended to ensure integration and collaboration across respective organizations. The IPT will
   include members from at least the operations, programming, and asset management
   functions. An AO may also be a supervisor due to other duties, but direct supervision is not
   inherently a part of activity ownership.
4.3. AO Skill Sets
   4.3.1. AOs require the knowledge and technical skill sets to ensure an effective system
   inventory and assessment program, develop a management plan (i.e., requirements and
   execution plan by FY), and identify activity requirements to meet an AF Common Level of
   Service. They must ensure the activity‟s FYDP+2 requirements are accurately identified in
   the appropriate system (ACES-PM, IWIMS, EESOH-MIS, NexGen IT), even if they must
   program themselves. AOs validate and prioritize activity requirements to support PPBE
   timelines, advocate for activity requirements, and ensure execution of activity-related
   projects. Required skill sets include technical competency in the designated activity, and
   expertise in PPBE, program management, and IWIMS, ACES, EESOH-MIS and NexGen IT
   database programming. The AO IPT, because it contains programming, asset management,
   and operations personnel, can provide much of its own training. Where necessary, the AO
   will seek additional training through supervisory channels.
4.4. AO Responsibilities
   4.4.1. Provide, Operate, Maintain, Restore and Protect the Activity to Support the Mission.
   4.4.2. An AO is the individual who has been assigned ultimate responsibility for an activity.
   Resources from a number of areas across functional and programmatic lines are required to
   effectively manage activities. The AO is responsible for gathering information and providing
   CE leadership (installation or HQ AFSPC respectively) his/her recommendations on the
   resources required to meet operational objectives. Since no one person can know all the
   details of a activity and its operations, the AO must rely on an IPT to effectively and
   efficiently manage a system. HQ AFSPC and installation AOs, where applicable, have
   responsibilities that include, but are not limited to:
AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011                                                                  13


     4.4.2.1. Ensure condition assessments are conducted and analyze results. Record and
     maintain results of assessments in official records, to provide continuity for personnel
     changes as well as documentation of system conditions.
     4.4.2.2. Ensure FYDP+2 requirements are programmed in coordination with PEMs and
     functional managers. Ultimately the AF goal is a 10-year program. The 10-year criteria
     does not preclude longer range programming as some infrastructure replacement cycles
     are greater.
     4.4.2.3. Prepare IPLs in support of PEMs and integration within applicable Program
     Elements. Advocate for execution year funding by communicating activity priorities and
     mission impact to affected PEMs.
     4.4.2.4. Analyze activity performance and prepare lifecycle cost comparisons.
     4.4.2.5. Identify activity operational risks and opportunities for improvement.
     4.4.2.6. Ensure activity performance (common levels of service, selecting Key
     Performance Indicators (KPIs), etc.). AOs will use, but are not limited to, AMP
     performance targets as activity performance indicators.
     4.4.2.7. Conduct activity performance management reviews at least quarterly, or more
     often as determined by CE leadership.
     4.4.2.8. Centralize or strategically source activity contract management where effective
     and efficient.
     4.4.2.9. Ensure management of an efficient Recurring Work Program (when applicable).
     4.4.2.10. Conduct work analysis and methods improvement.
     4.4.2.11. Ensure completion of project execution responsibilities, including design, cost
     estimating, coordinating with Contracting, evaluating proposals, project inspection and
     quality assurance, project milestone reporting, and completion of real property tasks
     including use of the form DD 1354, "Transfer and Acceptance of Real Property."
     4.4.2.12. Ensure appropriate problem resolution has occurred and that activity issues are
     addressed and communicated accordingly.
     4.4.2.13. Coordinate and be aware of all changes to the activity. Ensure accuracy of data
     management activities (ACES, IWIMS, EESOH-MIS, NexGen IT, etc.).
     4.4.2.14. Ensure geospatial data for the activity is captured in installation GIS or CADD.
     The Geo-database should include applicable Functional Data Layers (FDL) pertaining to
     the activity within the Functional Data Set (FDS) and should conform with Spatial Data
     Standards for Facilities, Infrastructure, and Environment (SDSFIE).
     4.4.2.15. Communicate changes, improvements, and other important information about
     the activity as needed to affected parties (CE leadership, Facilities Board, etc.).
     4.4.2.16. Review and support management of the budget throughout the activity's
     lifecycle.
     4.4.2.17. Understand common environmental requirements related to the activity and
     ensure environmental coordination is initiated through the necessary environmental
 14                                                             AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011


      media manager. The AO must incorporate, implement and document necessary
      environmental requirements for work efforts within their assigned activity or its
      components. The AOs are responsible, within their roles as IPT leaders, for assuring
      environmental compliance for their assigned activity.
4.5. Infrastructure Plans
   4.5.1. AOs create and maintain FYDP+2 infrastructure plans required by PAD 07-02,
   Implementation of The Civil Engineer Transporation Plan, and                    AFI 32-10140,
   Programming and Resourcing Appropriated Fund Facilities Operations Requirements. PAD
   07-02 infrastructure plans are listed in Chapter 5 of this AFSPCI in each AO section. These
   plans assess infrastructure conditions, evaluate repair options, establish repair or replacement
   cycles, and establish repair/replacement priorities. The requirement is not for additional
   stand-alone documents, but a “plan” that results in a comprehensive FYDP+2 program in
   IWIMS, ACES-PM or NexGen IT. The AO may use AMP programs to assist in this task.
AFSPCI32-1013 22 JULY 2011                                                                      15

Accountability— Accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for
actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance, and
implementation within the scope of the employment position and encompassing the obligation to
report, explain, and be answerable for resulting consequences.
Activity— 1) A particular (or group of services) that an organization provides. 2) A specific
action or process undertaken by a government to convert resources to products or services
(outputs). Examples of activities are provide electrical power, provide unaccompanied housing,
etc.
Activity Owner— The individual who has been assigned ultimate responsibility for a system or
systems at the HQ AFSPC or installation level.

Activity Ownership— A mindset of accountability for the successful long term operation of a
system in providing an activity.
Asset— Anything having monetary value. A DoD asset is any item of economic value owned by
a DoD Component or held in a fiduciary capacity under the control of a DoD Component. The
item may be physical in nature (tangible) or a DoD Component may have a right to control the
item (intangible). The value of a DoD asset is expressed in terms of its acquisition cost and
control of the asset by particular DoD Component must be the result of a past transaction or
event.
Business Continuity Plan— A practical logistical plan for how an organization will recover and
restore partially or completely interrupted urgent/critical/essential functions within a
predetermined time after a disaster or extended disruption.
Facility Investment Metric (FIM)— The corporate Air Force program for identifying and
advocating R&M funds for non-recurring/non-scheduled repair (EEIC 522) and minor
construction (EEIC 529) projects funded in O&M Program Element (PE) ***76. Projects are
given a FIM rating based on the facilities current impact on the Wing‟s (or tenant‟s) primary
mission. Ratings are Critical, Degraded, and Essential and are defined in AFI 32-1032, A4.2.5.
The recommended FIM rating for R&M projects is assigned by the Civil Engineering project
programmer in accordance with AFI 32-1032, and based on the user‟s input.
Facility Sustainment Model (FSM)— An Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) program to
provide resources for maintenance (EEIC 521) and recurring, scheduled repair (EEIC 524)
activities necessary to keep a typical inventory of facilities in good working order over their
service life. Sustainment is funded in PE ***78. It includes regularly scheduled adjustments and
inspections, preventative maintenance tasks, and emergency response and service calls for minor
repair. It also includes major repairs or replacement of facility components that are expected to
occur periodically throughout the facility lifecycle. This work includes regular roof replacement,
refinishing wall surfaces, repairing and replacing electrical, heating, and cooling systems,
replacing tile and carpeting, and similar types of recurring work.
Integrated Priority List— A term commonly used in CE organizations to describe a list of
infrastructure projects in order of importance, but requires clear communication as to what
funding categories are included (means different things to different people).
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design— an internationally recognized green
building certification system, providing third-party verification that a building or community was
designed and built using strategies aimed at improving performance across the following metrics:
energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental
quality, and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.
Responsibility (as it relates to Activity Ownership)— Accountable to the BCE leadership for
provision of the activity to the customer, as long as needed. Accountability is limited by scope of
duties of the employed position.
System— 1) A group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements forming a complex
whole. 2) A functionally related group of elements, especially: A group of interacting
mechanical or electrical components; or a network of structures as for travel, or distribution. 3)
The end-to-end delivery of intended outputs that are needed to satisfy mission requirements.

                  PROGRAM ELEMENT AND RELATED ACTIVITIES

A2.1. The AF manages funds by Program Elements (PEs) with Program Element Monitors
(PEMs) at HAF and MAJCOM levels. In some cases there are multiple systems under a PE,
while in other cases there are multiple PEs within a system. Regardless, AFI 16-501 makes the
PEM a Subject Matter Expert for the PE.
A2.2. At HQ AFSPC, Activity Owners support the PEMs with expertise, and assist the PEMs in
prioritizing requirements within the PEs.
