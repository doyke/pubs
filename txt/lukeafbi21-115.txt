      IMPORTANT: Classified or explosive items must be demilitarized prior to turn in to DRMS, Tucson
      representative. All other items from the aircraft wreckage do not need to be individually demilitarized if they
      are to be turned in as part of the wreckage. DRMS, Tucson representative will make the demilitarization a
      "condition of sale." If an item from the aircraft wreckage is turned in separately verify item demilitarization
      requirements in-accordance-with DoD 4160.21-M-1. Demilitarization may need to be accomplished by the
      owning agency. Contact DRMS, Tucson representative for turn-in requirements and, if demilitarization is
      required, Bioenvironmental Engineering for a hazard evaluation.
