Figure 2.2. Typical 27 inch Under-floor Section.




Note: The area beneath the raised floor grid is shown in three (3) horizontal layers each approximately
9 inches deep. Level ―A‖ extends downward from the underside of the raised flooring approximately 9
inches. Level ―B‖ continues beneath level ―A‖ to the depth of approximately 18 inches. Level ―C‖
continues beneath level ―B‖ to the concrete sub-floor, approximately 27 inches below the raised floor.

Level ―A‖ is reserved for power wireways and receptacles.

Level ―B‖ is reserved for signal cable conveyances.

Level ―C‖ is reserved for ground extensions, power distribution in conduits (feeders from main to
subpanels and from wireways to receptacles) and administrative communications cables routed in ―D‖
rings.

When installing site preparation requiring deviation from the above standard, a waiver is required.
Transitions between levels to avoid obstructions may be made without a waiver.
       2.4.1.2. Penetration Requirement. Raised-floor openings shall be reinforced per
       manufacturer’s recommendations to preserve floor-loading characteristics and to prevent
       adverse impacts to the Air Conditioning (AC) system. Raised-floor cutouts shall be
       sealed with an approved material to prevent dusting of the exposed concrete core and
       lined with a material suitable to cover exposed sharp edges and provide protection to
       cable or other hardware passing through the opening. (Rubber-coated flex conduit may
       be used without this lining, as the conduit will provide adequate protection.) All
       openings shall be sealed with an UL-listed material, applied per manufacturer's
       specifications, to prevent degradation of the AC system (i.e., intumescent composite
50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     9


      sheet with putty, putty alone, fire sealant expanding foam, or other Air Force approved
      material). The use of a properly applied UL-sealant will ensure AC pressure is not
      adversely impacted. Neoprene (synthetic rubber) is not an acceptable material. Figure
      2.3 depicts a typical treatment of edges on a raised-floor opening. Figure 2.4 depicts the
      installation of a typical composite sheet material.
      2.4.1.3. Reconstruction. In the event that maintenance or work is performed that
      requires the raised-floor system to be disrupted, it is the responsibility of the performing
      agency to return the raised-floor system back to its original configuration immediately
      after the work is complete.

Figure 2.4. Typical Composite Sheet Installation.




Notes:
1. Any rubber inserts that exist are to be removed from the cable opening.
2. If possible arrange cables together. If cables cannot be arranged together, leave them in place.
3. Sheet should be cut to overlap the cable opening by two inches if possible. The cable holes in the
sheet should be cut a minimum of one inch larger than necessary to allow for future cable expansion.
4. Install ―F‖ trim around the perimeter of the cable opening as shown above. Trim is held down with
pop rivets or screws. Adhesive is an alternative.
5. Place composite sheet foil side down inside the ―F‖ trim slot with a bead of moldable putty applied
around the edges. To seal EMI or RFI racks use a silicone adhesive to secure composite sheet to the
bottom of the rack.
6. Apply the dense foam tape around all the rough cut-out edges to protect the cable.
7. After the composite sheet is in place fill all remaining openings/gaps with moldable putty to obtain a
snug fit around the cables and complete the seal.

   2.4.2. Firewall Penetrations. Installing agencies are responsible for ensuring that firewall
   integrity is maintained when penetrating for communications or power cables. There are
   three approved methods to penetrate unshielded firewalls: Multi-Cable Transit (MCT)
   devices, Compression Fittings, and Conduit Penetrations. These methods are described
   below:
       2.4.2.1. Multi-Cable Transit. The Nelson Electric Supply MCT (also known as Nelson
       Window) is an example of MCT penetration device permitted at SAFB. Other MCTs
       that meet the rating of the penetrated firewall may be used. MCTs are normally rated for
       a two-hour firewall. At SAFB, the primary use of MCT is to provide cable penetration
       between the vertical and horizontal cable chases. Additionally, MCTs may be used when
       penetrating through a gypsum firewall where numerous cable changes are anticipated. All
       penetrations must be capped by the installing or removing agency when not in use.
       2.4.2.2. Compression Fitting (CF). The Crouse-Hinds Sealing Gasket Assembly and the
       Service Entrance Cable Connector are examples of CFs permitted at SAFB. Other CFs
       that have a one-hour fire rating may be used. CFs are used for penetrating metal
       windows located between the horizontal cable chases and the under-floor areas of the
       modules/rooms. Flame Seal II Putty, manufactured by Nelson Electric Supply, or
       equivalent, shall be used at the fitting if a complete seal cannot be accomplished. The
       manufacturer’s instructions shall be followed when using CFs.
       2.4.2.3. Conduit Penetration (CP). Only rigid conduit or electrical metallic tubing
       (EMT), as specified in this document, shall be used. CPs are used for penetrations
       through gypsum firewall. The procedures for making and sealing these penetrations are:
           2.4.2.3.1. Cut a hole in the firewall approximately one-inch larger than the diameter
           of the conduit.
           2.4.2.3.2. Pack fiberglass insulation into the gap around the conduit.
           2.4.2.3.3. Use tape to hold the fiberglass insulation in place. Putty or caulk over the
           tape to complete the seal.
Note: For under-floor firewall penetrations, Flame Seal II Putty may be used as a substitute for the
fiberglass, tape, and putty/caulk as described above.
           2.4.2.3.4. Use Flame Seal II Putty, or equivalent, to completely seal around the
           cables in one end of the rigid conduit or electrical metallic tubing.
Note: For under-floor firewall penetrations, Flame Seal II Putty may be used as a substitute for the
fiberglass, tape, and putty/caulk as described above.
   2.4.3. Additional Requirements For Penetrating Firewalls. Shielded modules were
   provided in building 400 during the Consolidated Space Operations Center (CSOC)
   activation. Current 50 SW operations located on SAFB do not require EMSEC-shielded
   modules. Maintenance of the existing shields, shield doors and shield effectiveness testing is
   not required. Individual programs must meet Telecommunications Electronics Material
   Protected from Emanating Spurious Transmissions (TEMPEST) requirements IAW Air
   Force Cryptologic Support Center (AFCSC) guidance. The following sections describe
   penetrations through shielded modules.
 12                                                          50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010


       2.4.3.1. Unused Penetrations. Unused penetrations made by means of a wave guide,
       bulkhead connector or other device shall be capped or covered to prevent loss of under-
       floor cooling air.
   2.4.4. Shielded Area Penetration Criteria. Cables that penetrate a shielded area shall do
   so in a way that shall minimally degrade the physical integrity of the shield. Every
   penetration shall have its design submitted to the Configuration Management Office for
   review and approval prior to installation. Installations shall comply with National Fire
   Protection Association (NFPA) 70, Article 300.21, AFSSI 7702 and NFPA 75.

Section 2F—Mechanical System Standard

2.6. General. This section provides an overview of environmental systems. Environmental
systems are controlled by BCE.        Coordinate all installations which may impact the
environmental systems with BCE.
   2.6.1. Interior Environmental Condition. Data-processing equipment areas are provided
   with A controlled internal environment to meet equipment operating specifications and
   ensure reliable equipment operation.    The module areas in building 400 and 700 use
   pressurized, raised-floor plenum systems to deliver cooling air for specific data-processing
   equipment. Technical equipment in other areas normally receive cooling air from overhead
   systems.
      2.6.1.1. Environmental Parameters.      Air conditioning systems in data-processing
      equipment areas are provided to satisfy equipment cooling requirements rather than
      creature comfort and shall maintain the environmental parameters as required to support
      installed equipment.
      2.6.1.2. Due to the criticality of airflow in building 400 and 700 modules, only two floor
      tiles shall be removed at any given time for access to under-floor areas in modules that
      support an operational mission. This constraint may be relaxed if suitable air dams are
50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   15


      approved by BCE or if non-impact to under-floor cooling in the module can be
      demonstrated
   2.6.2. Under-floor Air Distribution System.
      2.6.2.1. General Description. Conditioned air is supplied by a combination of variable
      air-volume overhead and under-floor air-handling units.             Computer room air
      conditioning units are used only where the capacity of the under-floor air-handling unit is
      not adequate. Airflow from an under-floor plenum varies in response to a thermostat;
      air-volume controlled pneumatic or electrically operated dampers on the floor air
      registers as described in 2.6.2.4.
   2.6.3. Fire Suppression, Detection and Alarm Systems and Devices.
      2.6.3.1. General Description. In general, current fire suppression is provided by wet-
      pipe sprinkler systems or by the use of air-supervised, dry, pre-action sprinkler systems.
      Class 2 standpipe hose stations provide additional fire suppression capability. All work
      affecting fire suppression, detection and alarm systems and devices must be approved by
      BCE. All new system installations shall be wet pipe only, and existing pre-action
      systems will be converted to wet pipe with future projects.
      2.6.3.2. Sprinkler System Alterations. Alterations or extensions to existing sprinkler
      systems in any area shall be in strict accordance with NFPA 13, Standard for the
      Installation of Sprinkler Systems. Sprinkler heads proposed for installation or relocation
      shall be equivalent in model, type, rating and style to those in the surrounding area.
      Suspension of new cross-mains, branch lines or sprinkler heads shall also be IAW NFPA
      13.
      2.6.3.3. Detection/Alarm System.
          2.6.3.3.1. Alterations. Renovations or additions to detection and alarm systems shall
          be made in strict accordance with NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code.
          2.6.3.3.2. Affected Devices. As area expansions or renovations take place, including
          changes to floor-to-ceiling partition walls and systems furniture, consideration must
          be given to the necessity of relocating or installing any of the following:
             2.6.3.3.2.1. Emergency Power Off or Air Power Off switches.
             2.6.3.3.2.2. Emergency Egress Lighting.
             2.6.3.3.2.3. Sprinkler Heads.
             2.6.3.3.2.4. Heat and smoke detectors.
             2.6.3.3.2.5. Fire alarm pull stations.

           31Z-10-22, Electrical Power Systems For Telecommunications Facilities.
           2.7.1.2.2. Distribution System. In the TPS – 48 Volt DC system, power is distributed
           from rack mounted main panels to rack mounted sub-panels via an approved raceway.
           From sub-panels, individual negative (–) and positive (+) conductors are brought via
           an approved raceway to end communication equipment loads for direct connection, or
           to fused distribution units within the communication equipment racks.
           2.7.1.2.3. System Characteristics.   The 48-Volt DC power characteristics are as
           follows:
              2.7.1.2.3.1. Nominal Voltage: 54 Volts DC, rectifier float voltage (normally
              supplies power load requirements and battery charging) 52 Volts DC, battery
              voltage – fully charged (supplies backup power load requirements)
              2.7.1.2.3.2. Circuit wiring is 2-wire; negative (–) and positive (+).
   2.7.2. Technical Support Power System (TSPS) (Non-Technical Power) Characteristics.
       2.7.2.1. General Description.    The TSPS supplies electrical power to the essential
       facility loads. The normal power source is the local commercial utility. Standby Class B
       diesel generators provide backup utility power. The standby system is capable of
       meeting the power requirements of all critical and essential loads. Under-floor receptacles
       will be twist lock type.

       2.7.5.3. Sizing/Loading Policy for 60Hz Systems (TPS and TSPS).           To ensure
       standardization of the NEC interpretations for sizing and loading the TPS and TSPS
       panels, the following criteria shall apply:
           2.7.5.3.1. Panel main breakers shall be sized at a minimum of 125 percent of total
           nameplate load connected to the panel.
           2.7.5.3.2. Panel distribution breakers shall be sized at a minimum of 125 percent of
           the connected nameplate loads.
           2.7.5.3.3. Distribution breakers from the main panel to the sub-panels shall be rated
           equal to or greater than the sub-panel main breaker (i.e., a minimum of 125 percent of
           the nameplate loads on the sub-panel).
           2.7.5.3.4. When additional power is required and the criteria of 2.7.5.3.1 – 2.7.5.3.3
           would be violated; a baseline determined by measurements may be applied in place of
           nameplate loads. The baseline shall be established by measuring the maximum
           continuous amps on each phase and the neutral conductors for at least 15 days. A
           new load may be added to a baselined panel if the new load (nameplate or measured
           load from an identical installation) plus the established baseline amps does not exceed

       provided with grounding configurations as described below.
   2.8.2. Grounding Design.
       2.8.2.1. Conductors. All safety grounding conductors shall be insulated; colored green,
       green with yellow stripe, or marked green at each end; and sized IAW National Electric
       Code (NEC) Table 250.122.
Exception: Cable Tray Systems, see paragraph 2.8.5.
22                                                       50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010


     2.8.2.2. Connections. Bolting or screws able to maintain 1200-to-1500 psi between
     contact surfaces, or welding at the termination shall connect the grounding conductor.
  2.8.3. Derived AC Systems.
     2.8.3.1. Grounded Neutral Conductor Bonding. The neutral of all derived AC systems
     shall be bonded to ground with an insulated conductor the same size or larger than the
     largest service or secondary conductor or #4 AWG, whichever is greater. Derived AC
     systems shall have their neutrals bonded at one point only; at the ―XO‖ of the separately
     derived source or at the first system disconnect.
     2.8.3.2. Isolated Ground Bus. Any isolated ground bus shall be independently connected
     to ground at the neutral-ground bond of the separately derived system or at the ground
     bus at the first disconnect of the separately derived system.
     2.8.3.3. Green-Wire Bus and Grounding. A safety, green-wire ground bus is required in
     each power distribution panel. If multiple ground buses are installed in the panel they
     shall be bonded together. This bonding shall be accomplished with a properly sized
     copper ground conductor. The enclosure shall not be used as a bonding conductor. All
     power feeders and branch circuits shall be installed with a safety green-wire grounding
     conductor run with the phase and neutral conductors. The copper safety green-wire
     grounding conductor shall be sized IAW NEC Table 250.122 and/or Military Handbook
     (MIL-HDBK)-419, Grounding, Bonding and Shielding for Electronic Equipment and
     Facilities, Table 1.21. Aluminum or copper-clad aluminum wire shall not be used.

     2.8.6.1. Requirement. The use of an Equipotential Ground Plane (EGP) has eliminated
     the need for specialized grounding systems. An EGP eliminates large differences in
     potential across the ground plane, whereas the use of specialized grounding systems can
     increase these differences. Specialized grounding systems should be avoided and
     consideration given to converting specialized systems to an EGP. If conversion to an
     EGP system is not possible, the specialized system design must be reviewed by 50
50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   23

       provided for grounding. When an EGP is installed, the RED and BLACK grounding
       panels/plates shall be electrically connected to each other and to the EGP.
       2.8.7.3. Equipotential Grounding Plane (EGP) Applications. Per MIL-HDBK-419,
       where new grounding systems are to be installed or where the grounding system is to be
       converted from an existing Single-Earth Ground Point (SEGP) to an EGP, the installing
       agency must ensure the following:
          2.8.7.3.1. The EGP scheme shall satisfy high                  and    low    frequency
          communications/electronics equipment applications.
          2.8.7.3.2. Communications-Electronics equipment shall be grounded to the EGP
          IAW the requirements of AF TO 31-10-24, Installation Practices: Communications
          Systems Grounding, Bonding, and Shielding.

  2.9.6. General Installation Guidelines.
     2.9.6.1. Routing in Cable Trays.
         2.9.6.1.1. All metallic communications cables shall be installed in separate
         RED/BLACK cable conveyance devices.
         2.9.6.1.2. Cables shall be installed parallel and in an orderly fashion to permit the
         maximum number to be installed in each section of tray. Where cable transitions are
         made, cables shall be installed without tension. Cables shall be free from sharp bends
         and kinks.
         2.9.6.1.3. All cables routed in the under-floor space or suspended from ceilings shall
         be installed in an approved conveyance. The distance from the conveyance to the
         raised-floor penetration shall not exceed a three-foot horizontal run.
         2.9.6.1.4. Cables installed where the raised-floor height is one foot or less may be
         laid on the subfloor surface provided the surface is free of objects that could damage
         the cable. Cable trays are not required in these areas; however, RED/BLACK
         separation shall be maintained.
         2.9.6.1.5. While installing cables, the pulling tension of a fiber optic cable shall not
         exceed the manufacturer’s rated maximum tensile loading of the cable being installed.
         Fiber optic cable shall not be bent beyond the rated minimum bend radius of the cable
         being installed. A fiber optic service loop shall not exceed five feet on each end.

        2.9.6.1.6. For data and communication cables at a security level of TOP SECRET
        and above, TPS/TSPS power cables shall not be installed in the same conveyance
        device, to include the same ceiling, floor or wall penetrations. Prefabricated
        combination power and communications cables are not authorized at any security
        level.
     2.9.6.2. Cable Termination Methods. Cables shall be terminated according to standard
     installation practices. The following guidelines apply:
        2.9.6.2.1. All cables shall be terminated in connectors, terminal boards or barrier
        strips. Cable conductors shall be fanned out to match the terminals to which they are
        attached. Spare conductors shall be cut to a length sufficient to reach any contact and
        laced into the same bundle with the active conductors. Spare coaxial cables shall be
        terminated with their characteristic impedance on one end and to a bulkhead or
        equivalent connector on the source electronic rack.
        2.9.6.2.2. All cables shall be supported at the termination points to remove connector
        and cable strain IAW TO 31-10-2, Air Force Communications Command (E-1
        Standard) Standard Installation Practices Fanning and Forming Conductors for
        Ground C-E Equipment. Terminal devices shall be the kind that supports the wire at
        the insulation. Spare conductors in excess of the connector pins in potted connectors
        shall be cut back. All cable ties used to restrain wire bundles or cables shall have
        their excess tails cut off and all sharp edges removed.
        2.9.6.2.3. Spare conductors that penetrate a shielded enclosure shall be grounded
        within the enclosure.
        2.9.6.2.4. All standard wires that connect to equipment with screw terminals shall be
        terminated with an insulated terminal lug. Crimp-on terminals shall be installed with
        a tool approved by the terminal manufacturer.
        2.9.6.2.5. Shields and drain wires that are not required to be connected at the
        equipment shall be cut off close to the cable and taped. The shrink-on ID sleeve may
        be positioned to insulate the shield end instead of tape, provided the sleeve
        completely insulates the end of the cable.
        2.9.6.2.6. The installing agency shall install terminal boxes as close to the equipment
        as practical. Boxes shall accept appropriate incoming and outgoing communications
        and shall have the volume required by the NEC for the number of conductors
        enclosed. A minimum of 20 percent spare terminal board strips shall be provided in
        each box.
     2.9.6.3. Tray Fill Considerations. Cable lengths shall be selected to minimize excess
     cable in the trays and cable wireway. For runs between buildings and building modules
     service loops for fiber optic cable shall be no greater than five feet at each end. Copper,
     when installed and fanned correctly, should not need service loops. The maximum cross-
     sectional area fill rates shall be IAW TO 31-10-13, Table 1.3.
        2.9.6.3.1. Service loops shall not be put in cable trays or on the floor. Cable shall be

     2.9.6.4. Cable Splicing.
        2.9.6.4.1. Metallic Cable. Lengths of cable shall be continuous and without splices
        between termination points. When required, the only cable-to-cable interconnection
        permitted shall be by connecting cables that have been terminated in either multi-pin
        or coaxial connectors. Interconnections shall be moisture resistant and continue all
        electrical and mechanical characteristics of the cable. In-line connectors for both
        multiconductor and coaxial cables shall be covered with an appropriate insulating
        sleeve (i.e., heat-shrink tubing). Complete integrity of the cable shielding shall be
        maintained. When metallic cables are extended in this manner, the requirements
        defined in the following sections shall apply.
            2.9.6.4.1.1. Insulation of an in-line connector shall be by installation of a section
            of heat-shrink tubing over the connector. The tubing manufacturer’s Installation
            Specifications shall be used to shrink the tubing down to an even fit over the full
            connector run. Tubing shall be of the correct size to shrink snugly over the full
            length of the installation. The tube shall extend at least two inches beyond the
            connector at each end.
        2.9.6.4.2. Fiber Optic Cable. Specific installation procedures for fiber cable splicing
        shall be fusion type. (Reference TO 31-10-34, Joint Services Command Control
        Communications and Computer Systems Engineering and Installation Fiber Optic
        Communication Cables and Connectors).
            2.9.6.4.2.1. Vendors have varying procedures for fiber cleaving, fiber end
            preparation and connector-to-fiber mating. Procedures for SAFB shall be IAW
            TO 31-10-34.
            2.9.6.4.2.2. Installation, conveyance, and termination of fiber optic cables shall
            be done IAW TO 31-10-34 to protect individual fiber strands from damage and
            provide appropriate strain relief.
  2.9.7. Cable Marking. Cable labels shall meet size, location and information content as
  listed in TO 31-10-13, paragraph 1.13.
     2.9.7.1. Cable Labeling Requirements. Cable labels will be placed on the cables at the
     time of installation, whether or not the cables have been terminated. Each cable shall be
     identified at the time of installation by number and letter combinations using permanently
     attached markers. Cables shall be marked with the cable designator at both ends, inside
     manholes and junction boxes, and within 12 inches of entry and exit from multi-cable
     transits, waveguides, wall penetrations, and enclosures. (See Figure 2.9).
        2.9.7.1.1. If interduct flexible conduit is used, cable designators of cables routed
        through the conduit shall be marked on the outside of the interduct conduit. Cable
        conveyance enclosures that do not allow visual verification of cables shall have an
        attached tag that lists the cables contained therein. If the cable is fiber optic, the
        words ―Fiber Optic Cable‖ shall be labeled next to the cable designator. This
        requirement shall be waived if the cable has been marked ―Fiber Optics‖ by the
        manufacturer at the time the cable was built. Where the ends of the cable are not
        visible or accessible, the labels shall be affixed to the cables down line at the first
        place where access can be achieved.
30                                                       50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010


        2.9.7.1.2. The Start Equipment Reference Designator (SERD) and the End
        Equipment Reference Designator (EERD) shall be marked at each end of the cables
        on the same labels as the Cable ID number. Cable markers shall be of non-
        conductive material. Figure 2-9 illustrates the required cable marking and Figure 2-
        10 illustrates the marking locations.
     2.9.7.2. Intra-Rack Equipment. Cables that do not leave a rack are not required to be
     marked. Marking of such cables is up to the discretion of the installer. If the installer
     uses a cable management number, it must be documented with I/MAR documentation
     and entered into the Cable Management Database.
        2.9.7.2.1. Cable management will provide cable designators and labels when
        requested.
        2.9.7.2.2. Equipment such as stand-alone desktop computers that have cables to
        connect components of a system such as mouse, keyboard etc., need not be marked
        unless the cabling runs through the cable tray system. Cables that provide external
        connectivity (i.e. LAN cables) shall be labeled appropriately.
     2.9.7.3. Attaching Devices. An identification label shall be attached to each cable by
     means of non-metallic attaching devices such as polyethylene tubing, nylon label ties,
     self-laminating adhesive vinyl, silicone rubber sleeving, or synthetic resin sleeving.
     2.9.7.4. Cable Marking Tape. If existing cables are to be re-labeled and shrink tubing
     cannot be used, the label shall be attached using tape.
     2.9.7.5. ID Tag Marking. Markings shall be of sufficient size and spacing to be legible,
     and of a color that contrasts with the material on which it is marked. All markings shall
     be permanent. Any of the following methods may be used:
        2.9.7.5.1. Permanent ink stamping.
        2.9.7.5.2. Paint stenciling.
        2.9.7.5.3. Typing/hand-printing (covered with a suitable protective material).

Section 2J—Cable Conveyance Devices

2.10. General. This section defines specific conveyance device requirements. All locations
shall comply with the requirements of AFSSI 7702.
   2.10.1. RED and BLACK Conveyances. Separate RED and BLACK conveyances have
   been installed, as required, to provide raceways for fiber optic and metallic communications
   cables. Between buildings on SAFB, conveyances have been installed in the utilidor and in
   the underground manhole and duct bank system to distribute BLACK communications
   cables.
   2.10.2. Cable Trays. Cable trays shall be installed in a pattern that provides optimum
   coverage of the module and minimizes cable lengths. Generally, cable trays shall be installed
   parallel to air-conditioning ducts to minimize obstruction to the installation of cables. RED
   communications cable trays shall be separated from BLACK trays as required by AFSSI
   7702. The physical separation required between RED and BLACK metallic cables shall not
   be met by physically separating cable within the same cable tray.
       2.10.2.1. Tray Types. Tray types, material, installation and grounding shall be IAW TO
       31-10-24 and paragraph 2.8.5.1 of this publication.
       2.10.2.2. Anchoring. Trays shall be rigidly anchored to the facility at intervals not
       exceeding the manufacturer’s recommended specifications for loads of 75 pounds per
       linear foot or 8 feet, whichever is less, in one of the following methods:
50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     33


         2.10.2.2.1. When installed on the floor, trays shall be bonded to the floor with an
         approved adhesive or power-actuated devices such as ―redheads‖.
         2.10.2.2.2. When the trays are suspended below the raised floor, they shall be rigidly
         supported to the floor pedestals using an approved unistrut/clamp system.
         2.10.2.2.3. When suspended in other locations such as the cable chases, the trays
         shall be supported via an approved beam clamp, threaded-rod, and unistrut system.
     2.10.2.3. Tray Marking. The installer shall mark Cable trays at the time of installation,
     with a number assigned by Cable Management. Marking shall occur at intersections,
     corners, and at intervals of 10 feet or less. Trays shall be marked on the top and sides.
         2.10.2.3.1. BLACK Communications Cable Trays. Cable trays that are dedicated to
         BLACK communications cables shall be visibly labeled ―UNCLASSIFIED CABLES
         ONLY‖ at intervals not to exceed six feet. The cable tray installer shall perform
         labeling at the time of installation. See Figure 2.11 for a typical unclassified cable
         tray label.
         2.10.2.3.2. Fiber Optic Cable Trays. Cable trays that contain or are dedicated to fiber
         optic cables shall be visibly labeled ―CAUTION FIBER OPTIC CABLES‖ at
         intervals not to exceed six feet. Labeling shall be performed at the time of cable tray
         installation by the installing agency or by the agency adding fiber optic cable(s) to
         existing trays. See Figure 2.12 for a typical fiber optic tray label.
         2.10.2.3.3. Mark all RED distribution facilities except conduit carrying a RED signal
         ground feeder external to the building within the inspectable space. Use a 1-inch
         wide strip of red tape or red paint at intervals of approximately 1-1/2 meters. This
         applies to copper and fiber lines. IAW AFSSI 7702, paragraph 10.49.5.4.1.
  2.10.3. Conduit. In under-floor areas and above the ceilings, rigid metal conduit or
  electrical metallic tubing (EMT) may be used to provide conveyances for metallic and fiber
  optic communications cables. All RED/BLACK separation requirements shall be observed
  in the installation of these conduits. To protect cables routed above-floor, flexible metal or
  non-metal conduit (maximum total length of six feet) may be used to transition from floor
  penetrations to equipment that is not installed in racks. In the cable chases, utilidor, manhole
  system, and cable tray system, non-metallic flexible conduit may be used to provide
  additional protection to cables that transition out of standard cable conveyances, provided it
  meets fire code. Flexible conduit shall not be installed in cable trays or in a manner that shall
  obstruct cable tray fill capacity.
     2.10.3.1. Rigid Metal and EMT Conduit. Conduit shall be in compliance with Section
     H, Grounding Standards. Setscrew type couplings shall not be used. Rigid metal conduit
     and EMT used as cable conveyances and supported by floor stanchions shall be bonded at
     one end to the cable tray ground or the facility ground. Installations that are not
     supported by floor stanchions and that consist of more than one section shall be bonded at
     both ends to the facility ground.
         2.10.3.1.1. Metal Conduit. Metal conduit installed above ceilings shall be installed,
         bonded, and grounded IAW MIL-STD-188-124B, paragraphs 5.1.1.2.4.1 and
         5.1.1.2.4.2.
 34                                                          50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010


       2.10.3.2. Flexible Metal Conduit. Flexible metal conduit shall be securely anchored
       within one foot of each end and at intervals not to exceed 4.5 feet, even if terminated into
       a fixture or equipment. Vertical installations of flexible metallic conduit inside walls
       may exceed six feet in length, and the 4.5-foot support requirement does not apply. In no
       case shall conduit be used as a safety ground. All flexible conduit shall be grounded to
       facility ground at each end, except where the conduit terminates in a box or equipment
       that is grounded. When used in potentially damp areas, flexible conduit shall be used
       with THHN, damp/dry rated ground conductors.
       2.10.3.3. Conduit Marking. Conduit that is installed as a cable conveyance rather than
       for transition protection shall be marked with a number assigned by Cable Management.
       Marking shall be accomplished at the time of initial installation by the installer. If an
       installing agency installs a cable in an unmarked conduit, that agency shall mark the
       conduit with a number obtained from Cable Management. Marking shall occur at each
       end and at intervals not to exceed 5 feet. Refer to Cable Management for acceptable
       marking methods.
           2.10.3.3.1. Cable Management issues four different types of conduit numbers. Three
           of the numbers depict the security classification levels of the cables that run through
           the conduits. The fourth type of number depicts the special type of cable running
           through the conduit. All conduits are labeled with a five digit alphanumeric number
           that begins with the letter ―R‖. The second letter will have an ―N‖ for classified
           (RED), a ―J‖ for unclassified (Black), an ―L‖ for Top Secret, or an ―S‖ for Fiber
           Optic Only, which includes both Red and Black fiber cables. The third letter and the
           following two numbers of the five-digit number are consecutive counting indicators
           only and have no other significance.

Section 2K—Miscellaneous Installation Requirements

2.11. General. Miscellaneous installation standards not covered in other sections are defined.
   2.11.1. Special Design Considerations. Modifications to areas under configuration
   management shall comply with NEC Article 645.2.
   2.11.2. Safety. Those agencies responsible for the installation of equipment and changes to
   areas under configuration management shall comply with the industrial safety accident
   prevention and safety and health programs defined in AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational
   and Environmental Safety and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
   Standards, as applicable. These same agencies shall coordinate with the Configuration
   Management Office in advance whenever dangerous materials are either shipped or hand-
   carried onto the site. This includes (but is not limited to) materials such as explosive charges,
   shots for thermite welding, and toxic or flammable gases. All such dangerous materials shall
   be stored in a designated area and in approved containers. Control of this material shall be
   the sole responsibility of each agency using the material.
       2.11.2.1. Safety Aspects of Fiber Optics. During fiber optics installation activities,
       personnel shall be protected from levels of optical radiation that may be damaging to the
       eyes and from direct injury by fibers, particularly to the human eye or skin.
50SWI33-105 15 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     35


          2.11.2.1.1. Optical Radiation. It is possible that the human eye can be damaged by
          the optical radiation from a fiber at particular power levels. If personnel must work
          with fibers that are emitting optical radiation, proper eye protection shall be observed.
          At all terminations and connections along an optical fiber length, a tag or sticker shall
          be placed as a warning of the presence of potentially harmful optical radiation. All
          terminations and connectors not in use shall be capped.

Figure 2.12. Fiber Optic Cable Tray Label (Black on Yellow).




          2.11.2.1.2. Direct Injury. There is a risk of direct injury to the eye from small
          lengths or particles of fiber, particularly during cleaving operations. All personnel
          shall follow prescribed safety measures when cutting fiber optic cables. Protective
          eye shields shall be worn during cleaving or joining operations. Care shall also be
          taken to avoid glass fiber penetrating the skin. Due to the strength and small size of
          glass fiber, skin penetration can occur quite easily. Personnel performing termination
          or maintenance tasks on fiber optic cables shall clean all work areas.
      2.11.2.2. Welding, Cutting, Brazing and Open Flame Soldering. Before commencing
      welding, brazing, cutting or open flame soldering operations, an AF Form 592, USAF

       Welding, Cutting and Brazing Permit, shall be obtained from the SAFB Fire Department
       (50 CES/CEFI), located in building 717. Contractors are reminded that welding, cutting
       and brazing shall be accomplished according to OSHA 1910.252, General Requirements
       or OSHA 1926.350, Gas Welding and Cutting, as applicable.
   2.11.3. Raised Floor Tile Removal and Reinstallation. When accessing the area under a
   raised floor, take care not to disturb the floor level adjustment. The following guidelines and
   safety procedures apply to removing raised floor tiles and stringers:
       2.11.3.1. Safety Procedures for Raised Floor Openings.
           2.11.3.1.1. Remove all carpet squares on the raised floor to be opened. If carpet
           squares cannot be removed, the carpet squares shall be folded back and taped or
           clamped so the entire raised floor to be opened is visible.
           2.11.3.1.2. An individual must constantly attend the raised-floor opening when
           possible. If an attendant is not being used, visible barriers or blaze orange traffic
           cones are to be utilized. Barriers near each corner of the raised-floor opening are
           recommended. Use of brightly colored safety tape to connect each barrier is also
           recommended. Barriers must be in place when the raised floor is opened. Carpet
           shall be replaced to cover the raised floor after closing.
Note: A maximum of two floor tiles per module may be removed at any given time when working in an
operational module where under-floor air distribution system is required for equipment cooling.
           2.11.3.1.3. Paragraphs above do not apply to raised-floor openings during site
           preparation or renovation activities (large jobs). For site preparation, the entire work
           area shall be restricted to site preparation workers and individuals requiring entrance
           for official activities. Workers, surveillance, and visiting personnel, shall be required
           to receive a safety briefing from the onsite supervisor, prior to entry. This briefing
           shall consist of identification of all hazardous conditions and special precautions
           being employed.
Note: The floor tiles and carpet tiles both have installation arrows on the bottom. These arrows shall
point west in the installed position.
   2.11.4. Initial Under-floor Site Preparation (No Above-Floor Equipment).
       2.11.4.1. Floor Tile and Stringer Removal.
       2.11.4.2. Removal of contiguous floor tiles and associated stringers is permitted where
       no more than one 90-degree bend is formed by an open-floor area.
       2.11.4.3. An open-floor area formed by the removal of contiguous floor tiles and
       associated stringers shall have a maximum width of one floor tile.
   2.11.5. Site Preparation Involving Above-Floor Equipment.
       2.11.5.1. Floor Tile and Stringer Removal.
           2.11.5.1.1. Remove no more than ten contiguous floor tiles. If ten contiguous floor
           tiles are removed, no stringers may be removed.

       entirety. This requirement is not intended to force the removal of installations that have
       planned specific uses in the future, but is meant to limit unnecessary congestion in the
       building. Site preparation left in place for future use shall be tagged at the receptacle
       end; signal conduit shall be tagged at both ends. Cables will be pulled as far back to the
       mod access window as possible, coiled up neatly on the floor and tie wrapped. The tag
       shall be placed at the end of the cable. The tag shall be marked with the following
       information; Reserved for future growth, date removed, expected re-use date, project
       name, point of contact, organization and phone number. The door schedule shall be
       marked ―Spare‖. The agency requiring the site preparation shall install the tags. The tags
       will be procured from the Cable Management Office, in bldg. 400, room 208.
       2.11.6.2. Receptacle Removal. Unused receptacles below the raised floor, including the
       wire and conduit, and shall be removed. Removal of the circuit breaker is optional. If the
       circuit breaker is removed, a blank spacer shall be installed in the vacant space and the
       door schedule shall be updated IAW paragraph 2.7.5.6.1. Unused openings in ―J-boxes‖
       or wireways shall be closed.
       2.11.6.3. Cable Removal. When removing equipment, be sure to remove all attached
       signal cables from the trays and conduits under the raised floor, above the ceilings, or in
       the walls.       DO NOT ABANDON THESE CABLES—REMOVE THEM
       COMPLETELY FROM THE PREMISES
   2.11.7. Work Site Cleanliness. Equipment shall be protected from damage by debris of any
   kind, including dust, shavings or grindings from metal, wood, concrete or plastic. Care shall
   be taken not to allow such materials to enter the under-floor air plenum.

Section A2A—Cable designator
A2.1. A cable is a bound or sheathed group of individually insulated conductors, either metallic
or fiber optic identified with a cable designator. The cable designator is the unique number used
to identify a cable connecting between two (and only two) equipment items. All cables shall be
identified as outlined below.
   A2.1.1. The Cable Designator is a six or seven digit alpha-numeric and shall be constructed
   as follows:
The first character (Commodity Code) of the cable designator is always ―W‖. The second through sixth
characters are the Sequence Element, consisting of a single capital letter followed by four digits to
uniquely designate a single cable. A seventh character shall be added, ―S‖ to designate spare. This
requirement shall also apply to all conductors in a cable when they are ―fanned out‖ within an assembly,
and shall include all spare conductors, which shall be identified by the word ―spare‖ in place of the
specific sub-assembly/connector identification. A typical Cable Designator: W A7351.
   A2.1.2. Cable Designators are assigned or provided by the Cable Management Office.
Section A2B—Equipment Reference Designator
A2.2. All equipment identified by 2.5.1.6. shall be given a unique Equipment Reference
Designator consisting of the facility (building) number, module number, room number, and
station (equipment) number, elevation number, shelf or slot, and jack number. This number shall
appear, in full, on all installed equipment. The equipment reference designator shall be
controlled and issued by Configuration Management Office TAIDS personnel. Any changes or
exceptions must be coordinated with the Configuration Management Office TAIDS Section,
fully documented, and approved by the Configuration Management Office.
   A2.2.1. The EQUIPMENT REFERENCE DESIGNATOR shall be constructed as follows.
       A2.2.1.1. The Building number is the four-character designator assigned to each facility
       as recorded on the approved site plan. Presently assigned facility codes are listed in
       Section D.
   A2.2.1.2. The Module number is the three-character designator assigned to each module on
   the approved Operations building floor plans. For other facilities with no designated module
   numbers, these three positions shall contain ―000.‖
       A2.2.1.3. The Room number is the three-character designator assigned to each room of a
       facility, as shown on the approved floor plans. Where no room number is assigned
       within an Operations building module, or where a facility contains only one room, these
       three positions shall contain ―001.‖
       A2.2.1.4. The Station (equipment) number is the three-character location designator
       assigned to each item of equipment in a room or module. The station (equipment)
       number is taken from existing equipment on the TAIDS drawings. For new installations,
       equipment numbers shall be obtained per paragraph A2.2. The station (equipment)
       number MUST appear in all equipment reference designations.
