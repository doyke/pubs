1. Objectives. The objective of this instruction is to standardize procedures for accomplishing
aircrew debriefing. An aggressive debriefing program is an essential factor to ensure that
debriefing of the aircrew discrepancies are accurately reported and documented promptly.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Debriefing is a team effort in coordination with aircrew, operations, debriefer /crew
     chief, expediter, MOC, Plans & Scheduling (P&S), Analysis, work center specialists and
     Quality Assurance.
     2.2. AMXS will be responsible for the debriefing of aircrew. A selected debriefer/crew
     chief will be responsible for debriefing the aircrew and ensuring that discrepancies are
     properly transferred from the aircraft Air Force Technical Order Form (AFTO) 781A,
     Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, to the Maintenance Information System
     (MIS) via MOC or Aircraft Sortie Debrief Discrepancies sheet (in the event the MIS is
     down) and will be completed in their entirety. The crew chief will initiate the Job Control
     Number (JCN) from the JCN numbers maintained in the AFTO Forms 781 binder.
     Debriefer/crew chief will forward a copy of the AFTO 781A, AFTO 781H, Aerospace
     Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance and the AFTO 781, Aircrew Mission/Flight Data
     Document to MOC for discrepancy and sortie length input into the Automated Debrief
     function in the MIS. If the MIS is down, the debriefer/crew chief will enter all discrepancies
     on the sortie debrief discrepancy sheet and forward to MOC with the forms listed above.
     MOC will load the debrief when system function is restored. MOC will initial the AFTO
     781 after MIS input and forward to operations. If required, MOC will then notify the
     appropriate specialist work center.
     2.3. Quality Assurance in hangar 305, second floor (room 207), flight line side, will debrief
     Functional Check Flight (FCF) and Acceptable Check Flight (ACF). Supplemental
     personnel (crew chief and specialists) may be required to answer questions by the aircrew.
     Maintenance Quality Assurance (MXQ) will audit clarity and thoroughness of discrepancies
     and assure complete annotation by the aircrew. MXQ will assign job numbers to all
     discrepancies discovered and will forward a copy of the AFTO 781A and/or the completed
     sortie debrief discrepancy sheet to MOC for input into the Maintenance Information System
     (MIS). Refer to 910 AWI 21-106.
     2.4. The Production Superintendent will ensure that the aircrew and debriefer/crew chief
     have completed all required forms. This will ensure good data being retrieved for
     maintenance purposes. The MOC will also ensure that all pertinent data on the forms is
     complete prior to entry into the MIS.
     2.5. The Senior Maintenance Officer (SMO) determines the location for the debriefing.
     Primary location will be the expediter or pro super vehicle.
3. Qualifications.
     3.1. Personnel performing debriefing requirements must be qualified on the weapons system
     and capable of documenting all required forms in a complete and accurate manner, and be
     knowledgeable of the Aircraft Sortie Debrief Discrepancies sheet, Red X Criteria Table
     (AFRCSUP1 to T.O. 00-20-1) and the Maintenance Information System (MIS) for input of
     discrepancies from the aircrew. They must be thoroughly familiar with 910 AWI’s, AFI 21-
     101 and AFRCSUP1, Chapter 4, para 4.8, AFI 21-103 and AFRCSUP1, Equipment
910AWI21-300 23 JUNE 2010                                                                           3


   Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, T.O. 1C-130H-2-00FR-00-1, Fault Reporting
   Manual (FRM) and T.O. 3-1-6, Restriction Against Flight of Aircraft With Known Prop
   Difficulties.
4. Debriefing Requirements.
   4.1. Sorties returning with maintenance discrepancies will be debriefed with the applicable
   line event number from the flying schedule and documented on the Aircraft Sortie Debrief
   Discrepancies sheet if the MIS is down.
   4.2. Regardless of status, ― debriefing is normally conducted at the termination of each sortie
   or abort.‖ If this is not possible due to time issues or a sortie is terminated at another station,
   multiple sorties may be accomplished during one debriefing. If the primary aircraft breaks
   and the spare is used, the primary aircraft must be debriefed.
   4.3. Aircraft Commanders must ensure they, or other designated aircrew member, write a
   thorough and accurate description on the AFTO 781A of the discrepancies noted by all of the
   crewmembers. The debriefer/crew chief must also ensure that the appropriate Fault
   Reporting Code is annotated in the discrepancy block immediately following the
   discrepancy. Then the aircrew will perform a face-to-face debrief of the discrepancies with
   the debriefer/crew chief and technicians, if required. The Aircraft Commander must review
   and initial the AFTO 781 for accuracy, prior to leaving the form with the debriefer, at the
   time of debrief.
5. Procedures.
   5.1. Primary debriefing will be accomplished at the aircraft in the expediter or pro super
   vehicle by a designated aircrew member, debriefer or crew chief and specialists required.
      5.1.1. If an aircraft is worked between flights and the specialist has a JCN, the Aircraft
      sortie debrief sheet is initiated by AMXS so that no data is excluded. The debrief sheet is
      then maintained in AMXS and completed following the last flight of the day. The AFTO
      Form 781 will be pulled and forwarded to MOC for input into the MIS at the end of each
      sortie. After MIS input, the form will be forwarded to operations.
   5.2. Air or Ground Aborts, In-Flight Emergencies (IFE) and Incidents That Occur on the
   Aircraft:
      5.2.1. Air Abort – Termination of flight due to a malfunction that occurred after take off
      and before completion of the primary or alternate mission. Air Abort for systems
      malfunctions is grounding (render aircraft Non-Mission Capable (NMC) after landing)
      and should show as such.
      5.2.2. In-flight Emergency (IFE) – An airborne aircraft that encounters a situation or
      emergency that results in an IFE being declared by the aircrew. It is not considered a
      deviation, but will be recorded and information provided to the Analysis Section. NOTE:
      Air Abort and IFE is not the same thing. Sometimes a declared IFE leads to termination
      of a mission where an Air Abort should be documented. Final determination is made by
      the aircrew.
      5.2.3. Ground Abort –Event after crew show time that prevents a ―
                                                                      crew ready‖ aircraft
      from becoming airborne.
4                                                                  910AWI21-300 23 JUNE 2010


       5.2.4. The aircrew determines whether it’s an Abort (air and/or ground). Deviation to an
       aircrew decision will be discussed with the aircrew.
       5.2.5. The expediter will notify MOC of an Air/Ground Abort/IFE/Incident. The crew
       chief enters the Air/Ground Abort in red in the appropriate block of the AFTO 781A and
       also on the aircraft debrief discrepancy sheet.
       5.2.6. The expediter will notify MOC of the Air/Ground Abort/IFE/Incident and, will
       ensure that the debriefer/crew chief has entered the Air/Ground Abort discrepancies into
       the AFTO 781A. If during normal duty hours MOC will notify the appropriate work
       center of the Air/Ground Abort so that the work center technicians can debrief the
       aircrew.
       5.2.7. The MOC will ensure that the discrepancies are documented and entered into the
       MIS to identify the Air/Ground Abort. Also, MOC will forward to Quality Assurance
       (MXQ), Air or Ground Aborts IFEs and Incidents that occur on the aircraft. MXQ will
       then call the section and establish a contact point for the Air/Ground
       Aborts/IFEs/Incident and work with the technician.
    5.3. Repeat discrepancies are those that occur on the next sortie or attempted sortie after a
    corrective action has been accomplished and the aircrew notes the same discrepancy. A
    recurring discrepancy occurs on the second through fifth sortie or attempted sortie. The
    MOC will notify the expediter of a repeat/recurring discrepancy, and the crew chief enters
    the repeat/recurring in red in the appropriate block of the AFTO Forms 781A.
       5.3.1. In-flight check does not nullify a repeat/recurring discrepancy if it returns.
       5.3.2. MOC will forward the automated sortie debrief G081 product that has
       repeat/recurring write-ups and include the previous debrief that identified the like
       discrepancy to MXQ. MXQ will then call the section and establish a contact point for the
       repeat/recurring and work with the technician.
    5.4. MOC will ensure all in-flight engine shutdown data is documented in the MIS (screen
    #9023 and 9050).
    5.5. Cannot Duplicate (CND) are discrepancies that cannot be duplicated by maintenance
    during troubleshooting procedures and/or operational checkout of the system or systems.
       5.5.1. If the discrepancy is signed off as a CND after its first flight then flies again and
       the discrepancy returns, management and the affected section need to review the problem
       for possible upgrade to a red X.
       5.5.2. MOC will forward CND write-ups to MXQ. MXQ will then call the section and
       establish a contact point for the CND and work with the technician.
    5.6. Debriefer/crew chief informs the expediter who then calls MOC. Below are some
    malfunctions that may occur and need to be debriefed accordingly. During MIS input of
    discrepancies (i.e., airdrop malfunction (AFJI 13-210), flight control malfunction, engine
    power loss, inadvertent explosive mishap, DOPP (910 AWI 21-103) and Foreign Object
    Dropped damage and lost tool (910 AWI 21-102/105), MOC will forward a copy of the
    discrepancies to Quality Assurance. MXQ will then call the section and/or operations and
    establish a contact point to work the issue.
910AWI21-300 23 JUNE 2010                                                                        5


   5.7. Discrepancies discovered and repaired off-station, and not entered into the MIS, will be
   annotated on an Aircraft Sortie Debrief Discrepancy sheet, to include the corrective action,
   date completed, action taken code, how mal code and four character station code of
   accomplishing base. Upon return to HOMESTATION, the crew chief will forward the
   debrief sheet to MOC. MOC will enter discrepancies and corrective action into the MIS.
   5.8. Aircraft with possible unexploded ordinances (partially ejected flare) will be directed to
   a remote secure area where an evacuation of the aircraft can take place. After a thorough
   inspection of the aircraft by the Wing Safety Office and Munitions personnel, if a ―      hung
   flare‖ condition is determined, impoundment of the Aircraft will be initiated as per 910 AWI
   21-105. Follow the procedures of 910 AWI 21-102, Explosive Loaded Aircraft Procedures,
   paragraph 5.3.3 for the proper removal procedures for the ― hung flare‖ condition. When all
   safety procedures have been followed, the aircraft can be brought back to the spot and
   maintenance performed. Aircraft debrief will take place at the primary area.
6. Documentation.
   6.1. The debriefer/crew chief will debrief using the aircraft forms and the FRM. Aircraft
   Sortie Debrief Discrepancies sheet will also be used if the MIS is down. All highlighted
   entries will be accomplished on the Aircraft Sortie Debrief Discrepancies sheet. MOC must
   indicate if the discrepancies are repeat/recurring and Air/Ground aborts, IFEs or Incident
   occurrences.
      6.1.1. MOC will maintain on file the last five aircraft debriefs. Files are to be arranged
      by aircraft identification number (ID#) and include the 910th Maintenance Group
      (910MXG) Overprint in record files for the latest five sorties to help identify
      repeat/recurring discrepancies.
   6.2. Job Control Numbers (JCNs) will be assigned to every debrief discrepancy for that
   sortie/flying period. Ten JCNs are assigned to each aircraft for discrepancies debriefed and
   are filed in back of the AFTO 781 binder.
   6.3. Red X Criteria Table (AFRC Sup 1 to T.O. 00-20-1) identifying mandatory
   discrepancies will be maintained in the debrief location. Additional Red Xs will be entered
   in the applicable aircraft AFTO 781A for the following:
      6.3.1. Immediately upon discovery of an unsatisfactory condition serious enough to
      warrant its use.
      6.3.2. An inoperative Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), Cockpit Voice Recorder
      (CVR) or an inoperative acquisition unit is grounding.
      6.3.3. Aircraft involved in propeller system functional difficulties will not be released for
      flight until the cause of the malfunction has been determined, corrective action taken and
      system satisfactorily checked out. Refer to T.O.3-1-6 for more information on this
      subject.
   6.4. MOC will maintain the Maintenance Information System (MIS) to include:
