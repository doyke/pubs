Section A--Introduction
1. Objective. The objective of parachute familiarization training (PFT) is to help students improve the
timeliness of their ejection or bailout from a disabled aircraft by developing confidence in their ability to
survive a parachute descent, control the parachute during descent, and correctly accomplish parachute
landing fall (PLF) and post-PLF requirements.
2. Description of Parasail:
2.1. The major training device used in the PFT program is a specially designed parachute called a parasail.
The parasail is an ascending or gliding parachute designed to incorporate airfoil lifting capabilities. Forward
speed is obtained by a series of ports or slots that exhaust air aft. The parasail is constructed of nylon with
extremely low porosity that permits a high percentage of the escaping air to be diverted out of the parasail,
providing this forward thrust.
2.2. The parasail is towed aloft with a half-ton pickup truck modified with a special tow assembly in the
truck bed.
2.3. Using the parasail, students may be towed to an altitude of approximately 400 feet, then released for a
free parachute descent under carefully controlled conditions. Trainees can perform turns, execute PLFs, and
perform antidrag procedures.
3. Safe-Operating Features of the Parasail:
3.1. The rate of descent can be adjusted from 0 to approximately 16 feet per second by not releasing the
towrope and gradually decelerating the tow vehicle.
3.2. The free rate of descent for a 200-pound student is approximately 16 feet per second with the parasail
compared to 18 feet per second with a personnel parachute.
3.3. The parasail has no oscillation in steady-state descent.
3.4. By controlling the release point for free descent, the landing zone supervisor can direct the student to a
safe landing area.
4. Conducting Training. Using PFT team members and equipment and applying policies and training
procedures prescribed by this instruction, the chief of the aerospace physiology training flight will conduct
PFT for:
4.1. Undergraduate flying training students, including:
4.1.1. Air Force officers in joint specialized undergraduate pilot training (JSUPT).
4                                                                     AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003

4.1.2. Air Force officers in joint specialized undergraduate navigator training (JSUNT), whose major
weapon system will be an ejection seat equipped Air Force aircraft.
4.2. Aircrew members (including flight surgeons) who routinely fly in ejection seat or parachute-equipped
aircraft with the approval of their operations group commander. These students must complete egress
academics, parachute academics, and descent and landing techniques (DLT) training requirements outlined
in AETC Instructor Guide, P-V4A-A-JL-IG.
NOTE: PFT demonstrations are not authorized for local fairs, air shows, Armed Forces Day activities, etc.
5. Medical Clearance. A flight surgeon will determine which students will be allowed training and which
will be medically excused. Before training, ensure a flight surgeon has provided written medical clearance
for all students, as appropriate. Aerospace medicine will ensure medical coverage is provided during parasail
operations.
6. Excusals:
+6.1. The chief of the aerospace physiology training flight may excuse a student from parasail if the student
has a language problem or other factors that could jeopardize his or her safety. The student must, however,
complete the training listed in paragraph 7.
+6.2. Graduates of US military parachute courses (or another country from which the Air Force accepts
physiological training) and students who previously completed parasail in another undergraduate flying
training program may be excused from parasail but must complete the training listed in paragraph 7.

6.3. Record the reason for excusal, excusal authority, and date on the student's AF Form 699, Physiological
Training Record. Additionally, students excused by the flight surgeon or chief of the aerospace physiology
unit will have AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, annotated with reason for excusal, excusal
authority, and date. Place the completed AF Form 4293 in the student’s folder.
6.4. Document all excusals on the physiological training monthly report, as required by AFI 11-403/AETC
Sup 1, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, in the following format:
                   PFT Excusals: 1 Medical
                                     0 OIC/NCOIC
                                     6 Parachute Badge Qualified
                                     2 Previous PFT
7. Proficiency in Parachute Landing Falls (PLF) and Drag Training. Military parachutists and students
who previously completed PFT must demonstrate proficiency in the following parachute procedures:
+7.1. PLFs from the 2- and 4-foot platforms, swing landing trainer (or lateral drift trainer), and suspended
harness.
7.2. Release of parachute on the ground (drag training). Two drags must be accomplished, one on the back
and one on the front.
8. Responsibilities:
8.1. The AETC Surgeon General will provide the technical, fiscal, and administrative supervision required
to conduct the PFT program.
8.2. The commander of each medical treatment facility will provide medical oversight and coordinate with
wing and operations group commanders to ensure compliance with this instruction.
8.3. The chief of the aerospace physiology training flight will provide PFT and ensure instructors are
properly trained for each crew position.
AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003                                                                            5

8.4. The Superintendent/NCOIC, Aerospace Physiology, will manage the flight's local parasail training
program for landing zone supervisor (LZS). He or she will ensure the flight's local operating instructions
outline a well-defined and -documented training program to certify and qualify flight personnel in LZS.
Section B--Requirements
9. Crew Qualifications. Status types are as follows:
9.1. Apprentice Status. Personnel are required to perform crew duties during crew proficiency training or
training demonstrations (no student training) for a minimum of 25 launches per position before being
certified to fill that position during student training.
9.2. Certified Status:
9.2.1. Personnel who have completed apprentice requirements in a specific position must be certified
proficient for monitored student training by the chief of the aerospace physiology training flight.
9.2.2. A qualified instructor will monitor certified personnel during student PFT sessions for at least 100
student launches.
9.2.3. In addition, to be certified as LZS, personnel must be qualified to conduct 2- and 4-foot parachute
landing fall platform, swing landing trainer, and drag training instructor positions, and complete 10 parasail
releases as a jumper.
9.2.4. Truck drivers will attain certified status according to paragraph 33.
9.2.5. Annotate the instructor's AETC Form 717, Parachute Familiarization Training Instructor's
Record, with "Cert" or "C" and the number of launches in the appropriate column and box.
9.3. Qualified Status. Personnel who have completed certified requirements in a specific position must be
qualified proficient for unmonitored student training by the chief of the aerospace physiology training flight.
Truck drivers will attain qualified status according to paragraph 33. Annotate the AETC Form 717 with
"Qual" or "Q" in the appropriate column and box, and use this designation thereafter.
9.4. Requalify Status. Qualified PFT personnel must requalify if 24 months pass without any student or
instructor parasail training experience. Complete requalification by performing that position during 25
launches in either crew proficiency training or training demonstrations (no student training) in any crew
position. Truck drivers will requalify according to paragraph 33. Annotate the requalification on the AETC
Form 717 by using "RQ" (requalified).
10. Training Area. The parasail training area must have a straight run distance of at least 2,500 feet.
Because wind direction varies, a circle with a minimum diameter of 2,500 feet is required. The area must be
free of obstructions that would impede the progress of the tow vehicle, foul the towrope, or injure the
student. The surface must be level and firm to permit acceleration or deceleration of the tow vehicle. Grass
will be cut to 6 inches or less.
NOTE: Approved waivers must be revalidated every 36 months. For initial waiver requests, HQ
AETC/SGPT or a designated representative should inspect the training area.
11. Winds:
+11.1. Wind Limits. Parasail training will not be conducted in steady wind above 15 mph (12 knots) or
gusty winds above 12 mph (10 knots). If wind conditions are approaching these maximums, take a wind
reading with an anemometer or a handheld wind meter before each launch.
11.2. Wind Direction. Use a portable wind tee or sock in the launch area to determine the surface wind line.
12. Student Training Requirement. Each student will:
6                                                                    AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003

12.1. Complete DLT requirements before receiving a parasail tow down or release.
12.2. Demonstrate PLF proficiency on the 2- and 4-foot platforms on the day of the tow down or release. To
maintain student PLF proficiency, the time between teaching DLTs and conducting parasail operations
should be minimized.
12.3. Undergo approximately 10 minutes of instructor directed warm-up exercises prior to DLT training and
parasailing.
+12.4. Complete one tow down and at least one release. The training goal is one tow up, tow down and two
releases. The OIC or NCOIC may waive the second release and consider a student complete with only one
release. Annotate the reason for the waiver of the second release on the student’s AF Form 699; for example,
adverse weather, improper or unsafe PLF, language problem, student safety, weather, injury, operational
time constraints, etc. Students receiving no releases need to be excused per paragraph 6.
12.5. Complete PFT in the preflight phase. NOTE: AETC Syllabus P-V4A-A, T-37 Joint Specialized
Undergraduate Pilot Training, requires completion of PFT in the preflight phase (Phase 1 of JSUPT and
Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training [ENJJPT]). If weather prevents this from occurring, the Aerospace
Physiology Training Flight commander will coordinate with the appropriate flying squadron to obtain a
syllabus waiver and to schedule completion of PFT as early in Phase 2 as possible.
12.6. Have work and rest cycles that correspond to guidelines established in AETCI 48-101, Prevention of
Heat Stress Disorders, with no less than one 15-minute rest after each 2-hour training period (this includes
PFT crewmembers).
13. Student Equipment. A protective helmet, gloves, and boots without zippers are required for each
student in parasail training. The canvas jungle boot is not authorized for PFT. Knee and/or elbow pads are
recommended.
14. Parasail Communication Requirements:
14.1. Two-way radio communication must be maintained between the truck driver, crew chief, and LZS at
all times. The student in the harness must be able to receive radio or megaphone transmissions from the
LZS. If a radio is used to communicate with the student, the frequency must be free of extraneous
transmissions from other agencies. Each student must be briefed on communications-out procedures in the
event radio or megaphone failure occurs during his or her tow.
14.2. Notify the flight surgeon's office or acute care clinic before and after parasail, and ensure direct
communication is available during parasail operations.
15. Equipment. Attachment 2 shows the minimum required and optional equipment to conduct PFT.
Equivalent brands, models, etc., may be substituted.
+16. Personal Equipment for PFT Instructors. This equipment includes flight suits, flight jackets, flight
boots, and gloves. Aerospace physiology units are authorized a special duty uniform for hot weather
operations with local wing concurrence. The summer uniform will consist of a polo shirt, shorts, and a sun
protective hat with rank for officers. Shirt, short, and hat color are determined locally. PFT crewmembers
performing demonstrations, practice parasail jumps, or other parasail duties requiring more protection than
the summer uniform provides will wear flight suit, gloves, and boots.
Section C--Equipment Modification and Application
17. Tow Vehicle (Land):
AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003                                                                          7

17.1. The tow vehicle is a 1/2-ton pickup truck with a V-6 or V-8 engine, automatic transmission, and power
steering. Heavy duty or steel-belted tires should be used. This vehicle will be replaced according to TO 36A-
1-1301, Vehicle Management Index Tile.
17.2. This truck is a general purpose vehicle specifically equipped for PFT. Its use for other purposes is
limited to essential logistic and administrative requirements of the aerospace physiology training flight or
other purposes as approved by the chief of the aerospace physiology training flight.
17.3. The vehicle will be modified as follows:
17.3.1. Bolt the tow assembly (Figure 1) to the truck bed to support a standard helicopter cargo hook (Figure
2). The tow assembly must be located as far forward in the truck bed as possible with the cargo hook along
the vehicle's centerline. NOTE: The using activity must officially request authorization through base-level
transportation before installing any additional equipment or minor modifications according to AFMAN
24-307, Procedures for Vehicle Maintenance Management.

Figure 2. Helicopter Cargo Hook.




17.3.2. The toggle switch will electrically release the cargo hook or manually release by the hook lever.
17.3.3. Place the release operator and observer seats with seat belts behind and adjacent to the truck's
attachment point for the towrope. Place these seats so the driver has an unobstructed view of both the
parasail and the student. Install a roll bar to provide additional safety for the release operator.
17.3.4. Install a sliding rear window or communications port to enable the driver and release operator to
communicate.
17.3.5. Mount one of the radios in the truck for communication between the crew chief at the launch point
and the truck driver or release operator.
17.3.6. When not in use, fit the tow assembly with a vinyl-type cover for protection from weather.
18. Towrope:
+18.1. A 1/2-inch tight-twisted or braided Dacron rope with a minimum of 3,500 pounds tensile strength is
required.
18.2. Cut the towrope to 300 feet for tow ups or tow downs (or 600 feet for releases) and form a 6- to 8-inch
eye in each end. (NOTE: If desired, 600-foot rope lengths can be used for tow ups and tow downs.) Do not
tape splices on rope, wrap strands with nylon cord, or melt end of strands. Number all ropes by attaching a
stamped metal band or a piece of stenciled fabric near each end.
18.3. A portable take-up reel (see Figure 1) can be fabricated for rapid handling and storage of the towrope.
19. Towrope Splicing:
19.1. Towrope Loop (Eye) Construction (Figure 3). The eye splice is used to make the looped ends of the
parasail rope.
AETCI36-2224         7 AUGUST 2003                                                                              9

Figure 3. Towrope Loop (Eye) Construction.




19.1.1. Untwist the strands at the end of the rope for approximately 8 inches. Double the rope back to form a
loop, with the unlaid ends pointing across the lay of the rope. Regard this as the front (step A).
19.1.2. Take the end of strand #2 and tuck it under one of the main strands. Arrange end strand #1 next to
end strand #2 on the loop side across the rope. Place end strand #3 underneath the rope (step B).
19.1.3. Take end strand #1 under another main strand next to the first one, going in where end strand #2
comes out (step C).
19.1.4. Turn the splice over and place end strand #3 under a main strand where end strand #1 comes out. The
#3 strand must go under the main strand against the twist of the rope, as seen in step D.
19.1.5. Ensure all three end strands come out level (at the same point) with each other and are equally
tensioned. Each end strand will be pointing across a main strand in the rope. Lift the next main strand
sufficiently to tuck an end strand under it. Do this at all three positions so that each end strand goes over and
under one main strand. Repeat this procedure at least three times (total of four).
19.1.6. Go around the rope at about the same angle as the twist of the rope, but in the opposite direction of
the twist. (A common error is to splice almost straight down the rope.) When the splice is complete, it can be
rolled smooth between two boards or on the floor beneath the foot.
19.2. Towrope Splice Joints (Figure 4). A short splice is used for joining ropes after a break occurs or after
cutting out damaged areas. If the splice is accomplished properly, it is stronger than the original rope.
19.2.1. To make a short splice untwist both ropes for approximately 8 inches and bring them together so
each end comes into a strand space of the other rope (step A).
19.2.2. For the first splice, it is helpful to tie a string or use masking tape around the strands of one rope. In
this way, half of the splices may be done without the opposite strands interfering (step B).
19.2.3. Take each of the free strand ends over and under a strand of the other rope, working against the twist
(step C), as in the rope loop splice above. Make four complete tucks in this manner.
19.2.4. Remove the temporary string or tape from the other rope strands and make four complete tucks with
these three strands. This total of four tucks on each splice should be sufficient to ensure a strong joint.

Figure 4. Towrope Splice Joints.




20. Tow Yoke. The tow yoke (see Figure 5), fabricated from 3,600-pound tensile strength webbing,
connects the towrope to the parasail risers. The looped end of the towrope fastens to the loop at the apex of
the yoke. The connectors at the ends of the yoke legs fasten to the rings located on the front risers of the
parasail. Number each tow yoke independent of the towrope.
Figure 5. Tow Yoke.




21. Harness. The Pioneer (manufacturer number 3.0694-1/mil P/N P-525) or New England harness is
recommended. PCU-4/P (modified J1) canopy releases will be installed. The Air Force BA22 harness may
also be used as an alternate for this training. Pioneer risers: manufacturer number 3.7832-1/mil. P/N P-
526.
22. Canopy. Pioneer's ascending trainer (manufacturer number 1.137-1/mil P/N P-500-1) is the only
authorized parasail canopy.
AETCI36-2224         7 AUGUST 2003                                                                             11

Section D--Equipment Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair
23. Preuse Inspection. The parachute or fabric shop will inspect new canopies, harnesses, towropes, and
tow yokes. Record inspections on AETC Form 578, Parachute Familiarization Training Equipment
Record, before the first use of these items.
23.1. Inspect new canopies in accordance with TO 14D1-2-411, Trainer, Ascending, paragraph 4-5.
23.2. Check suspension line length according to TO 14D1-2-411, paragraph 4-13. Return canopies with lines
that vary in length more than 4 inches to the manufacturer.
23.3. In addition, the aerospace physiology unit will launch the canopy with a 150-pound weight to check
for line stretch and canopy towing ability.
24. Daily Inspection. Within 24 hours prior to each training period, visually inspect the following items:
canopies, harnesses, tow yokes, ropes, helmets, cargo release hook, and communications equipment. Log
this inspection on AETC Form 578. After daily inspection, date and sign the inspector block. NOTE: The
OIC, NCOIC, or designated representative will accomplish the daily and prelaunch inspections.
25. Periodic Inspections. The parachute or fabric shop will inspect the canopies using TO 14D1-2-411 at
applicable intervals. Harnesses, towropes, and tow yokes will be inspected at 250-launch intervals. Record
inspections on AETC Form 578. Towropes and yokes will be tensile strength tested to a minimum of 2,000
pounds. NOTE: Do not use ropes that have failed tensile strength tests, or require more than two splices.
Ropes may be used for only 1 year from the date they were first used in PFT operations. Tester, seat belt,
NSN 4920-612-9755, located in parachute shops, will be used to inspect towropes. Test all loops, yokes, and
frayed areas, plus each 200 feet of the rope.
26. Repairs:
26.1. Repairs will comply with TO 14D1-2-411.
26.2. Only end tab stitches may be removed when replacing harness hardware. Only the parachute or fabric
shop or the manufacturer may remove and replace stitching.
26.3. Unequal elongation of elastic nylon components is the usual cause of canopy tilt. Send canopies that
develop this characteristic to the parachute or fabric shop, or the manufacturer for repair.
Section E--Training Procedures
27. Method of Training. This section contains detailed descriptions of the techniques and procedures used
in the PFT program. Although these techniques apply to descent with normal personnel canopies, the
method of training is based on the use of the ascending parasail trainer. The PFT program is a two-phase
program consisting of DLT training followed by parasail training.
28. Descent and Landing Techniques (DLT):
28.1. Students will be taught PLFs according to TO 14D1-2-1, Personal Parachutes. Students practice front,
side, and rear landings from the 2- and 4-foot PLF platforms until they are proficient. All students will
demonstrate proficiency by conducting a minimum of one left side, one right side, one front left, one front
right, and one rear left, one rear right for a total of 6 PLFs from the swing landing trainer or the lateral drift
trainer. The instructor ensures the student begins from the correct prepare-to-land position and executes a
proper PLF. The instructor evaluates each student for PLF proficiency.
28.2. Students displaying a lack of proficiency are referred to the OIC, NCOIC, or qualified PLF instructor,
preferably a jump-qualified instructor.
12                                                                     AETCI36-2224         7 AUGUST 2003

28.3. Remedial training should consist of one-on-one instruction and practice to obtain necessary skills.
Students needing remedial training will be afforded every opportunity to obtain PLF proficiency within
scheduling limitations.
29. Parasail Training:
29.1. Students must successfully complete descent and landing techniques according to paragraph 28 before
receiving this phase of training.
29.2. The OIC, NCOIC, LZS, or crew chief will brief students on the following:
29.2.1. The need to continue running during the launch until they are well airborne. Students are not to pull
up their legs when they think they are airborne.
29.2.2. Not to wear boots with zippers or canvas jungle boots. Not to wear or have pens, pencils, sunglasses,
or any other object that may cause injury in flight suit pockets.
29.2.3. Not to make rapid successive turns (may induce oscillation), slip canopy, disconnect rope or yoke, or
open the canopy release safety covers.
29.2.4. The location of the LZS. Instruct students to listen for the LZS’s commands during descent.
29.2.5. The body position on landing: that is, hands over release covers, feet and knees together, knees
slightly bent, toes pointed down, and eyes on the horizon.
29.2.6. The locally developed procedures to follow if the tow truck stops prematurely, the towrope breaks, or
the LZS cannot communicate with the student.
29.2.7. The estimated altitude students may obtain. NOTE: Although the maximum possible altitude may
vary, use one-half the length of the towrope for briefing purposes.
29.3. The OIC, NCOIC, or designated representative will confirm the student's present medical and physical
status.
29.4. After the student briefing, before the first student tow down, and again before the first student release
launch, one or more instructor launches will be made for demonstration and wind-testing (direction and
velocity aloft).
29.5. Students will receive one tow down each before their individual release launch. The tow down
develops student confidence in the equipment and training procedures. Specific techniques to accomplish
correct tow downs vary due to wind conditions, weight of the student, and truck speed. However, ensure
student attains sufficient altitude for the canopy to stabilize above him or her before the PLF. The tow
vehicle will be driven directly into the wind for safety considerations. When performing the tow down, the
truck driver, prior to ground contact by the student, will accomplish the following conditions:
29.5.1. Slack in the rope.
29.5.2. Groundspeed of not more than approximately 8 mph. NOTE: Driver should never let checking
speedometer distract attention from watching the student.
29.5.3. Near vertical suspension under the canopy.
+29.6. Following the tow down, students will receive at least one release tow. The release develops student
confidence in their ability to control the parachute during descent and accomplish an adequate PLF. After
the tow up, the truck driver tows the student to the maximum attainable altitude over the landing zone. Upon
receiving a prearranged signal from the landing zone supervisor, the truck driver stops the truck and the rope
is released from the cargo hook. The landing zone supervisor directs the student to a safe landing area. The
student will turn the parasail appropriately and accomplish a PLF.
AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003                                                                            13

29.7. If the student lands in winds strong enough to keep the canopy inflated and the landing zone supervisor
cannot deflate the canopy, the student should be instructed to execute antidrag procedures. NOTE: Because
of the attached towrope, operating only one release will not deflate the canopy. Therefore, it is possible to
become airborne once again with only one riser attached to the harness.
29.8. The LZS critiques each student after each tow down or release.
Section F--Crew Positions and Duties
30. PFT Team. A PFT team consists of at least the following seven-team members: crew chief, two canopy
assistants, driver, release operator, LZS, and landing zone assistant. If resources are available, a chase
vehicle driver as well as a recorder may also be used to speed training.
31. OIC or NCOIC. The OIC or NCOIC:
31.1. Is responsible for the safe conduct of PFT.
31.2. Monitors crew and student performance at all times as well as environmental conditions affecting
training and safety.
31.3. May perform as another crewmember during DLT or PFT.
32. Release Operator. The release operator is responsible for the safe operation of the release mechanism.
Close coordination between the release operator and truck driver is essential during all phases of a tow.
32.1. Prelaunch. Before each tow, the release operator ensures the release hook is working properly. When
proceeding to starting point, he or she visually inspects the rope from the tow truck for knots or tangles that
can cause excessive localized loads or towrope failure. When attaching the rope to the hook, the release
operator must make certain it is securely locked in
32.2. During Launch. The release operator checks the rope, monitors rope slack, and ensures the crew chief
is holding on to the rope so the student is not jerked forward. During the tow up and while the student is still
running, the release operator focuses attention on the canopy and student. If the student falls during launch,
the release operator must release the rope from the hook to prevent dragging the student. The release
operator will direct the truck driver to stop the truck if the canopy rolls more than 45 degrees during the
launch and the student has not left the ground.
32.3. Tow Downs. The release operator and truck driver control the descent by coordinated signals (either
oral or hand) between each other. The release operator releases the rope only after the canopy has been
collapsed.
32.4. Releases. The release operator and truck driver will end the tow following a prearranged signal from
the landing zone supervisor that the student is over the landing area. The release operator releases the rope
from the cargo hook after the truck comes to a complete stop.
33. Tow Truck Driver. The tow truck driver is responsible for the safe operation of the truck. He or she
must be knowledgeable of the characteristics and limitations of the parasail. The truck driver controls the
speed and direction of the parasail by watching the canopy and keeping the red panels at the bottom. He or
she drives over the selected training site to determine the condition of the field and direction of the run.
There must be coordination between the truck driver and the release operator during the run. The truck
driver must have a minimum of 10 releases as a parasail jumper, and drive a minimum of 25 tow downs and
15 releases in an apprentice status before certified status is granted. The truck driver must meet the
requirements of paragraph 9.3, and have a minimum of 15 releases as a parasail jumper before qualified
status is granted. If a tow vehicle driver (either certified or qualified) goes for more than 6 months without a
student or instructor tow, he or she will be considered noncurrent and will require at least two tow downs
and one release during crew training before towing students.
14                                                                    AETCI36-2224         7 AUGUST 2003

33.1. Prelaunch. The truck driver proceeds to the starting point for the launch and positions the truck facing
the landing zone so the truck driver or release operator can attach the rope to the hook.
33.2. During Launch. The truck driver takes up the slack in the rope when the crew chief and release
operator give the signal. The truck driver starts the launch on a signal from the crew chief while watching
the canopy. If the canopy drifts laterally, the driver holds acceleration to a minimum until the canopy
straightens out. Once optimum speed is attained, the driver must ensure the student does not descend back to
the ground. As the canopy climbs, the driver must not tow the canopy off the wind line and must be on guard
against over towing it. The sign of over towing is the tendency for the canopy to roll off center or the front
edge of the canopy to tuck under.
33.3. Tow Down. The truck driver watches the descent and judges truck movement to position the student
for landing (paragraph 29.5). Just prior to student and ground impact, the driver brings the truck to a full
stop.
33.4. Releases. The truck driver maintains speed and course so the student reaches maximum altitude and
can be released over landing zone. Normally, a signal from the LZS directs the truck driver and release
operator. The truck driver also accomplishes the duties of the chase vehicle when a chase vehicle is not used.
34. Chase Vehicle Driver (Optional). The chase vehicle driver picks up the students and the towrope in the
landing zone and returns them to the launch area after each tow. The chase vehicle driver must be aware of
the wind line and return the towrope to the launch area as close to the wind line as possible. Care must be
taken by the chase vehicle driver not to entangle the landing zone crew while the rope is being realigned.
The chase vehicle should have a radio for communication with the truck driver and crew chief. The chase
vehicle driver is not required to have the minimum 25 experiences in an apprentice status before being used
for student training. However, some previous training in an apprentice status is recommended to ensure
familiarity with PFT procedures.
35. Crew Chief and Canopy Assistants. The crew chief and canopy assistants set up the launch area and
control student training flow. They are responsible for safe operation in the launch area.
35.1. Prelaunch:
35.1.1. The crew chief and canopy assistants lay out the canopy, straighten the suspension lines, and ensure
there is no canopy inversion. They perform the prelaunch inspection.
35.1.2. The canopy assistants hold the canopy and/or suspension lines while the canopy is inflated, and the
crew chief ensures suspension lines are not entangled.
35.1.3. One of the canopy assistants or the crew chief will fit the student in the harness and attach the yoke
to rings on the front risers. The crew chief then double checks, ensuring all connections are firmly closed,
the harness is properly fitted, and the prelaunch inspection was accomplished. He or she reminds the student
of takeoff procedures.
35.2. During Launch. The crew chief will stand in front of the student and prepare to take up slack in the
rope. When the slack in the rope is taken up, the canopy assistants and crew chief prepare for the truck and
student to move forward. The crew chief gives the signal to inflate the canopy. Once the canopy is inflated
and off the ground, he or she makes a final check to ensure suspension lines are straight and untangled and
the canopy is free of damage or defects. The crew chief gives the launch signal after the canopy is inflated
and on the wind line. The signal to the truck driver may vary depending on wind conditions. Examples are
"move out slowly," "hit it," "slow run-up," and "launch." Confusing commands such as "go" and "no" should
not be used. The canopy assistants should coordinate release of canopy in order to maintain a proper launch
without canopy roll.
AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003                                                                         15

35.3. After Launch. The crew chief and canopy assistants stay alert until the student is well airborne and
under the control of the truck driver or release operator. The crew chief will be prepared to give a
prearranged signal (for example, "abort" or "tow-down") to the truck driver or release operator if any hazard
is noted.
36. Landing Zone Supervisor (LZS). The LZS may be any officer, superintendent or NCOIC of aerospace
physiology, any jump-qualified individual, or any individual with a five-skill level who has qualified in the
LZS position as described in paragraph 9. The LZS is responsible for all communications with the student
once the student is undertow. The LZS informs the release operator and driver when to start tow down or
release and ensures the student has the proper body position for the PLF. The LZS makes or observes the
demonstration release to determine the approximate landing site and general wind conditions.
36.1. Prelaunch. The LZS ensures the landing zone is free of obstructions and safe for student launch. He or
she confirms radio or megaphone communication with the student prior to each launch.
36.2. During Tow. The LZS signals the truck driver when student should be towed down or released, as
appropriate.
36.3. Tow Down. The LZS coaches the student into the proper prepare-to-land position (that is, hands over
the release covers, eyes on the horizon, feet and knees together, and toes pointed slightly downward). The
LZS helps deflate the canopy, when required, and prepares the equipment and student for return to the
launch area. He or she critiques individual student performance after each landing.
36.4. Releases. The LZS directs the student to the landing zone with appropriate turns. He or she should
avoid having the student make hard turns within approximately 50 feet of the ground. After the student
completes the final turn, the landing zone supervisor again coaches the student into the proper prepare-to-
land position. He or she helps deflate the canopy, if required, and prepares the equipment and student for
return to the launch area. The landing zone supervisor critiques individual student performance after each
landing.
37. Landing Zone Assistant. The landing zone assistant helps the LZS as needed, deflates the canopy when
required, and prepares the parasail equipment for return to the launch area. He or she does not require the
minimum 25 launches in an apprentice status before accomplishing student training. However, some
previous training in an apprentice status (without students) is recommended to ensure familiarity with
procedures.
38. Recorder. The recorder ensures all necessary information is recorded on AETC Form 768, Parachute
Familiarization Training Record, for each tow. He or she also may assist the launch area crew with
student management and prelaunch equipment inspections. This person does not require the minimum 25
launches in an apprentice status before accomplishing student training. However, some previous training in
an apprentice status is recommended to ensure familiarity with PFT procedures.
Section G--Use of Forms (Records and Reports)
39. General Instructions. Forms in this section may either be typed or handwritten, as long as they are neat

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates interim change (IC) 2003-1, which further defines excusals from parasail and
parasail ground training (paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2); allows the use of the lateral drift trainer in lieu of the
swing landing trainer, when available (paragraph 7.1); redefines wind limits (paragraph 11.1); clarifies the
intent to have the student complete two parasail releases or document the reason for not completing a second
release (paragraph 12.4); defines alternate summer uniform for parasail operations (paragraph 16); and
expands the definition of acceptable tow ropes (paragraph 18.1). A + indicates revision from the previous
edition. See the last attachment of this publication (IC 2003-1) for the complete IC.
6.1. The chief of the aerospace physiology training flight may excuse a student from parasail if the student
has a language problem or other factors that could jeopardize his or her safety. The student must, however,
complete the training listed in paragraph 7.
6.2. Graduates of US military parachute courses (or another country from which the Air Force accepts
physiological training) and students who previously completed parasail in another undergraduate flying
training program may be excused from parasail but must complete the training listed in paragraph 7.
7.1. PLFs from the 2- and 4-foot platforms, swing landing trainer (or lateral drift trainer), and suspended
harness.
11.1. Wind Limits. Parasail training will not be conducted in steady wind above 15 mph (12 knots) or gusty
winds above 12 mph (10 knots). If wind conditions are approaching these maximums, take a wind reading
with an anemometer or a handheld wind meter before each launch.
12.4. Complete one tow down and at least one release. The training goal is one tow up, tow down and two
releases. The OIC or NCOIC may waive the second release and consider a student complete with only one
release. Annotate the reason for the waiver of the second release on the student’s AF Form 699; for example,
adverse weather, improper or unsafe PLF, language problem, student safety, weather, injury, operational
time constraints, etc. Students receiving no releases need to be excused per paragraph 6.
16. Personal Equipment for PFT Instructors. This equipment includes flight suits, flight jackets, flight
boots, and gloves. Aerospace physiology units are authorized a special duty uniform for hot weather
operations with local wing concurrence. The summer uniform will consist of a polo shirt, shorts, and a sun
protective hat with rank for officers. Shirt, short, and hat color are determined locally. PFT crewmembers
performing demonstrations, practice parasail jumps, or other parasail duties requiring more protection than
the summer uniform provides will wear flight suit, gloves, and boots.
18.1. A 1/2-inch tight-twisted or braided Dacron rope with a minimum of 3,500 pounds tensile strength is
required.
AETCI36-2224        7 AUGUST 2003                                                                          25

29.6. Following the tow down, students will receive at least one release tow. The release develops student
confidence in their ability to control the parachute during descent and accomplish an adequate PLF. After
the tow up, the truck driver tows the student to the maximum attainable altitude over the landing zone. Upon
receiving a prearranged signal from the landing zone supervisor, the truck driver stops the truck and the rope
is released from the cargo hook. The landing zone supervisor directs the student to a safe landing area. The
student will turn the parasail appropriately and accomplish a PLF.
