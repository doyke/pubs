       1.1.1.1. Pull the jacket files approximately one week before start of deployment of all
       aircraft tagged to deploy, including the spares, and start collecting the aircraft related
       paperwork from Aircrew Flight Equipment, Engine Management, Non-Destructive
       Inspection (NDI), Egress, Armament Shop, Fuel Shop, Weight and Balance binder
       from Quality Assurance and Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 95, Significant

       Put all the pulled DD Form 2861 in this folder. 301 MOF PS&D will put an Air
       Force (AF) Form 614, Charge-Out Record, in the folder showing that the jacket file is
       signed out to the deployed location with the aircraft. Also 301 MOF PS&D will put
       an AF Form 614 in the folder where the AFTO Form 95 folder is kept.
       1.1.1.4. Complete an AFTO Form 290, Aerospace Vehicle Delivery Receipt, making
       sure to annotate the airframe hours of the aircraft on it and have either the Production
       Superintendent or Section Chief sign it at the bottom. Make a copy of the signed
       AFTO Form 290 and place it in the two pocket folder created for home station. Place
       the original in the front pocket of the jacket file. Wrap the jacket file in a plastic bag,
       seal it with tape and turn it over to the Production Superintendent or Section Chief.
    1.1.2. The Production Superintendent or Section Chief will take the jacket file(s) and put
    it in each aircraft travel pod. The jacket files will not be packed with the cargo until the
    last possible moment to ensure all paperwork is filed before deployment.
       1.1.2.1. If a spare jet is utilized the jacket file will be hand carried to deployed
       location by the Maintenance Officer in Charge.
       1.1.2.2. Upon arrival at the deployed location, jacket files will be turned over to the
       deployed location PS&D section.
    1.1.3. While aircraft are deployed, home station 301 MOF PS&D will get the
    accumulated airframe hours from the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) 174
    Screen (Sortie Recap Inquiry) the day after each flight.
       1.1.3.1. If there is no IMDS availability at a deployed location, the deployed PS&D
       will forward information to home station 301 MOF PS&D via secure phone system or
       secure internet system for input into IMDS.
       1.1.3.2. Home station 301 MOF PS&D will coordinate with the home station 457th
       Fighter Squadron (457 FS) Operations Technicians each week to verify flying hours
       are being documented accurately for deployed aircraft.
    1.1.4. Jacket files will return to home station along with the cargo, the same way they
    were processed for deployment. Upon return, jacket files will be turned-in to the 301
    MOF PS&D office as soon as possible.
    1.1.5. 301 MOF PS&D personnel at the deployed location debrief section will bring
    copies of the AFTO Form 781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, back

      Sortie Recap Report.
   1.2. When aircraft is deployed for under 30 days, the following procedures will be
   implemented:
      1.2.1. Jacket files will not deploy with the aircraft. Deployed 301 MOF PS&D personnel
      will fax copies of the AFTO Form 781 back to home station 301 MOF PS&D on a daily
      basis.
      1.2.2. Home station 301 MOF PS&D will print a copy of the Sortie Recap Report out of
      IMDS to file with the AFTO Form 781 received from deployed location. Coordination
      with 457 FS Operations Technicians to verify weekly flying hours match will continue as
      normal.
2. Procedures for Depot Inputs:
   2.1. When an aircraft is taken to Depot at Hill Air Force Base for major maintenance the
   following procedures will be followed:
      2.1.1. 301 MOF PS&D will:
          2.1.1.1. Pull the jacket file approximately two days before aircraft is due to depart for
          Depot and start collecting the related aircraft paperwork from Aircrew Flight

          showing that the jacket file is signed out to Depot with the aircraft. Also place an AF
          Form 614 in the folder where the AFTO Form 95 is normally kept.
          2.1.1.4. Complete an AFTO Form 290, making sure to annotate the airframe hours of
          the aircraft on it and have the pilot sign at the bottom. After the pilot signs the form,
          make a copy and put the original in the front pocket of the jacket file. Wrap the

      2.1.2. Once the aircraft arrives at Depot the pilot will turn the jacket file over to the
      Depot Documentation Office (DDO).
      2.1.3. When the aircraft is ready to return back to home station the pilot will pick-up the
      jacket file from the DDO and return the jacket file to the 301 MOF PS&D immediately
