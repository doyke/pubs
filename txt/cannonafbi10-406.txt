1. General.
     1.1. Purpose. The processes outlined in this OI validates Mission Support Requests (MSRs)
     received by the 27 SOW. In addition, it ensures that both wing training objectives and
     supported unit requirements are satisfied and that a sustainable operations tempo is
     maintained. The goal is to enable coordination throughout the wing for efficient and effective
     asset allocation and early commitment deconfliction.
     1.2. Mission Support Requests. Demands for support from 27 SOW assets far exceed the
     capability of the resources assigned to the wing. Missions are tasked on an established
     priority basis. Outside agencies must submit support requests on a timely basis to ensure the
     proper validation procedures can be completed.
     1.3. Wing Scheduling. Wing Operations Scheduling, 27 SOW/XPO, is the single point of
     contact for agencies to request support. XPO manages the scheduling process and produces
     the consolidated wing schedule also known as the Wing Commit Calendar. Requests for
     support can originate from various sources but will eventually all flow to XPO. XPO
     reviews all MSRs, prioritizes them per Wing Commander’s guidance, and develops support
     recommendations in coordination with Unit Planning Representatives (UPRs). Issues and
     conflicts are identified by XPO and presented at the weekly scheduling meetings to the
     Group and Wing leadership for resolution. Any questions can be directed to 27 SOW/XPO
     at DSN 681-2292.
     1.4. Wing Plans. 27th Special Operations Wing Plans and Programs (27 SOW/XPP) is
     designated the lead planning agency for theater contingency and exercise plans, special
     missions contingency and exercise plans, foreign and inter-service exchanges to include
     Coalition SOF Familiarization Exercises, Foreign Dignitary visits and small unit exchanges,
     disaster relief contingency and exercise planning, and all other planning activities as directed
     by 27 SOW/CC. For a more in-depth description of Wing Plans responsibilities, refer to
     Cannon AFBI 10-405. Any questions can be directed to 27 SOW/XPO at DSN 681-2292.
2. Commander’s Guidance. All MSRs will be approved or disapproved by the 27 SOW/CC,
or his designated alternate, based on mission priorities and unit training requirements.
CANNONAFBI10-406 21 MAY 2012                                                                   3


3. Wing Commit Calendar.
   3.1. Wing Commit Calendar. The Wing Commit Calendar is a comprehensive database that
   provides wing leadership with an overview of all known Mission Support Requests and
   commitments. As requests are processed through the wing IAW this OI, 27 SOW/XPO will
   update the commit calendar to reflect the current status. The Wing Commit Calendar is
   available to all agencies within the wing through the base Non-Secure Internet Protocol
   Routing Network (NIPRNet). Classified missions are tracked on the Secure Internet Protocol
   Routing Network (SIPRNet) version of the Wing Commit Calendar. See Attachment 3 for a
   detailed breakdown of the Commit Calendar.
   3.2. The Wing Commit Calendar is also on the 27 SOW SharePoint and can be accessed at:
   https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/27SOW_XP/XPO/default.aspx. The classified version of the
   Wing Commit Calendar can be accessed on SIPRNet XPP SharePoint site.
   3.3. Wing Commit Calendar Changes. 27 SOW/XPO is the OPR for changes to the Wing
   Commit Calendar. XPP is the OPR for changes to the classified Wing Commit Calendar.
   Forward recommended changes and improvements to the 27 SOW/XPO organizational
   inbox.
4. Mission Support Request Procedures.
   4.1. Types of Requests. Submit all MSRs IAW procedures outlined in this section. Informal
   coordination is encouraged at all levels of the process, however, an informal agreement is not
   a substitute for the established request, validation, and scheduling process.
   4.2. Suspenses. All MSRs will be submitted to 27 SOW/XPO no later than 21 days
   before the first date of execution. MSRs submitted within 21 days of execution must
   follow the procedures in paragraph 4.4. Submit all HAR/TAR MSRs three months in
   advance and all rotator MSRs six months in advance.
   4.3. Request Submission Guidance. MSRs will be submitted to 27 SOW/XPO via the
   procedures prescribed below. 27 SOW/XPO will enter all requests in the Wing Commit
   Calendar and distribute the request(s) to the appropriate unit(s) for coordination.
      4.3.1. Air Asset Allocation Conference (AAAC) Events. Joint Special Operations
      Command (JSOC) training events are scheduled through the AAAC held bi-monthly at Ft
      Bragg. MSRs for these events are listed in the AAAC ―flimsy‖ document. Copies of this
      document may be obtained by contacting 27 SOW/XPO. 27 SOW/XPP will track these
      events on the classified Wing Commit Calendar. AAAC events are not detailed on a
      SOCOM Form 111, however additional 27 SOW support (SOFLIFT requests primarily)
      may be submitted via Form 111. 27 SOW/XPO will track AAAC support events on the
      unclassified Wing Commit Calendar. See Attachment 8, 27 SOW AAAC Coordination
      Cycle.
      4.3.2. SOCOM Events. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) events are scheduled
      using the SOCOM Form 111, Attachment 4. These MSRs are routed through the
      requesting unit’s chain-of-command to SOCOM. The requests are then validated and
      loaded on the SOCOM Portal. The 623 AOC is notified of the MSR, who in-turn
      validates the MSR against the current AFSOC AOD. Finally, the 623 AOC sends the
      MSRs to 27 SOW/XPO for coordination. This is the approved process for SOCOM
4                                                         CANNONAFBI10-406 21 MAY 2012


       components and outside agencies to utilize AFSOC air assets. Contact 27 SOW/XPO for
       additional information. Additionally, the 623 AOC attends the quarterly Joint Air Asset
       Allocation Conference (JAAAC), during which future SOCOM events are discussed and
       coordinated. See Attachment 7, 27 SOW Form 111 Coordination Process.
       4.3.3. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercises, JFCOM exercises, COCOM exercises and
       Coalition Special Operations Forces Subject Matter Expert Exchange (CSOF SMEE)
       support requests are sent to HQ AFSOC and staffed through A3TJ. AFSOC/A3TJ will
       send the support request to the 623 AOC who, in turn, will coordinate with 27
       SOW/XPO and 27 SOW/XPP per the previously established procedures.
       4.3.4. All requests for aircraft tests, trial installations, Time Compliance Technical Order
       (TCTO) verifications/validations, kit proofing, and other HHQ directed maintenance
       activities are submitted by HQ AFSOC via an HQ AFSOC Form 5 (see Attachment 6),
       HQ AFSOC Aircraft Support Request through 623 AOC/SPDP to 27 SOW/XPO.
       4.3.5. Distinguished Visitor (DV) support requests, external unit (i.e. non 27 SOW
       assigned) visit requests and external static support requests are validated and scheduled
       on a case by case basis using the Form 111 process. 27 SOW/XPO will provide guidance
       with regard to proper routing of the Form 111.
       4.3.6. 27 SOW agencies and all Cannon AFB (CAFB) tenant units (i.e. Have Ace West)
       submit all MSRs directly to 27 SOW/XPO.
       4.3.7. Requests for use of the Melrose Range will be documented on a 27 SOW Form
       111R, Attachment 5. This form will help 27 SOW/XP, 27 SOSS/OSR and 27
       SOSS/OSO manage which units have priority use of the range facility. It also serves as a
       situational awareness tool helping aircrew to deconflict between ground party training on
       the range.
           4.3.7.1. 27 SOW Form 111R will be provided to 27 SOW/XPO NLT 21 days prior to
           execution. XPO will provide to 27 SOSS/OSO NLT 14 days prior to execution.
    4.4. Short Notice Requests. An MSR submitted within 21 days of execution will be
    considered a short notice request. 27 SOW/XPO will enter the request into the Wing
    Commit Calendar and the review process will occur immediately via telephone and email.
    27 SOW/XPO will make the initial notification to 27 SOG, 27 SOMXG, and the appropriate
    operations squadron from which the asset is being requested. The squadron fulfilling the
    MSR will then ensure that cross-group coordination continues to take place. If a
    CANNONAFB Form 1 is required for a support request made within 10 days, the
    instructions in paragraph 6.5 will be followed.
    4.5. Base Support Requests. 27 SOW units hosting off-station aircraft or personnel
    conducting training at Cannon AFB and/or that require support above and beyond transient
    alert services must coordinate their base support requests through 27 SOW/XPO (DSN: 681-
    2292). Transient aircrew or group personnel conducting tactical operations in the local flying
    area must receive a Local Area Orientation briefing from Group Current Operations (27
    SOSS/OSO, DSN: 681-6281). AFSOCI 21-165 and CAFBI 11-201 are additional
    regulations that can be found on Group Current Ops SharePoint site:
    https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/27SOSS/OSO/Pubs. Additionally, aircrew or group personnel
    conducting operations on Melrose Range must receive a Strange Users Briefing from 27
CANNONAFBI10-406 21 MAY 2012                                                                 5


   SOSS/OSR (DSN: 681-1422) prior to operating on the range. XPO will provide wing
   oversight/tracking and inclusion on the Commit Calendar as required. Additionally, 27
   SOW/XPO will forward the request to 27 SOW/XPP, who will coordinate the request with
   all affected base agencies. 27 SOW/XPO will present requests for final approval to the
   WG/CC at the Wing Commit Briefing. Requirements for Cannon AFB support requests or
   unit hosting requirements are contained in the ―CAFB Support Request and Hosting
   Checklist‖ available at https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/27SOW_XP/XPP/.
5. Wing Scheduling Cycle.
   5.1. Weekly Coordination Timeline. The timeline encompasses a total of 10 days, starting
   on Wednesday and ending on the following Friday. Even though the timeline encompasses
   10 days, a new cycle begins each Wednesday.
      5.1.1. Support Request Deadline. On Wednesday at 0900L (Day 1) is the cutoff for
      MSRs to be considered in the new cycle. Short notice requests will be coordinated as per
      paragraph 4.4. 27 SOW/XPO will perform an initial review of all requests, validate and
      prioritize them and enter all potentially supportable missions into the Wing Commit
      Calendar.
      5.1.2. Wing Operations Internal Commit Meeting. On Wednesday at 1000L (Day 1), 27
      SOW/XPO will perform an initial review of all support requests in preparation for the
      following week’s 27 SOG/SOMXG Commit Meeting. The meeting is chaired by the 27
      SOW/XP Deputy Director. Attendees will be XPO, XPP and XPR.
      5.1.3. Wing Operations Squadron Planners Meeting. On Wednesday at 1100L (Day 1),
      27 SOW/XPO will chair the Wing Operations Squadron Planners Meeting. Attendees
      include representatives from the following organizations: 27 SOW/XPP, 27 SOSS/OSO,
      27 SOG flying squadrons, and 27 SOMXG. The purpose of the meeting is to distribute
      new support requests and briefly review any Wing Commit Calendar events of interest.
      5.1.4. SOG/SOMXG Commit Meeting. On Tuesday (Day 7), the SOG/SOMXG
      Commit Meeting is held in the 27 SOMXG conference room following the
      SOG/SOMXG Scheduling Meeting, currently held at 0845L. It is chaired by the 27
      SOG/CC, or his designee, and facilitated by 27 SOW/XPO. Attendees include
      representatives from the following organizations: 27 SOMXG, 27 SOSS/OSO, 27
      SOSS/OSJ and 27 SOG flying squadron operations officers or their designated UPRs.
      The purpose of the meeting is to review all new MSRs or requests that are in coordination
      ―CRD,‖ or ―INCRD2.‖ The meeting will review the next three months on the Wing
      Commit Calendar. If the SOG and SOMXG support a request, the mission will go tasked
      ―TSKD.‖ If it is non-supported, the mission will go ―NS‖ or will be modified as
      necessary per SOG/SOMXG guidance. In order to provide a timely response to
      requestors and keep stability in the scheduling process, ―INCRD2‖ missions will
      typically only be reviewed three times before going non-supported. Attending UPRs will
      identify mission commanders, squadron planners, training priorities, windows of
      availability, LIMFACS, and shortfalls.
      5.1.5. SOW/CC Commit Brief. NLT Friday at 0900L (Day 10), XPO will provide a brief
      to the 27 SOW/CC identifying Form 1 requests, newly tasked missions, recommended
      non-supported requests, and identify unresolved issues. In addition, previously
 6                                                          CANNONAFBI10-406 21 MAY 2012


        coordinated/briefed Form 1s will be presented for signature with applicable changes
        noted.
6. 27 SOW Form 1, Execution Order and Executive Summary.
     6.1. A 27 SOW/CC signed CANNONAFB Form 1 constitutes an approved execution order
     and represents mission launch authority. A Form 1 is required for all missions not
     terminating at CAFB, as well as for missions originating outside the local area. Unless
     otherwise directed, the unit with the preponderance of air assets executing the mission is
     required to complete the Form 1. Back-to-back missions may be combined on a single Form
     1 provided adequate details are given for each portion of the entire mission. A Form 1 is not
     required for out-and-backs or flights to/from scheduled depot-level maintenance, nor is a
     Form 1 required for any single-ship mission arriving/departing to/from a Department of
     Defense (DoD) airfield. The Form 1 also serves as an executive summary for wing
     leadership. Once signed, the original Form 1 will be maintained by 27 SOW/XPO and a
     copy will be maintained by the OPR for that particular mission. The mission commander
     (MC) should also obtain a signed copy of the Form 1 prior to mission execution.
     6.2. If there is a significant change to a 27 SOW/CC approved Form 1 (i.e., supporting an
     additional SOCOM Form 111 request, change to Remain-Over-Night (RON) location, or
     change to execution dates), the unit must submit an updated Form 1 detailing the change of
     mission and ensure an updated Force Protection Assessment has been accomplished. If there
     is a modification to the route of flight (i.e. Fuel Stops), but the RON location did not change,
     the squadron may receive verbal approval from the 27 SOG/CC prior to departing Cannon
     AFB.
     6.3. Force Protection (FP). Units will coordinate with 27 SOW Force Protection (FP) to
     accomplish a force protection assessment and annotate these findings on Form 1. Unit
     commanders are responsible for meeting the FP requirements or have a mitigation plan in
     place. The mitigation plan will also be annotated on the Form 1.
     6.4. Form 1 Process. See Attachment 2, Commit Calendar & Form 1 Computer Access, for
     instructions.
        6.4.1. Once 27 SOW/XPO enters the mission request into the Wing Commit Calendar,
        the Form 1 may be completed by the MC/OPR on the 27 SOW/XPO SharePoint
        Webpage. Most of the pertinent information required to fill out the Form 1 is available
        on the original USSOCOM Form 111, which is also located on the 27 SOW/XPO
        SharePoint Webpage.
        6.4.2. The MC/OPR will complete the Form 1 (to include SOG/CC signature or
        designee) no later than 10 days prior to departure. Forms not completed within the 10
        day requirement must follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 6.5. A mission does
        not need to be tasked before completion of the Form 1. Once the Form 1 is completed
        by the flying squadron, it is sent to FP via email from SharePoint.
        6.4.3. After FP finishes their review, they send the Form 1 back to the flying squadron
        via email from SharePoint, marked as ―Draft.‖ Once the squadron receives the Form 1
        from FP, it is staffed for approval from squadron leadership. The Form 1 is marked as
        ―Approval Routing‖ and routed via SharePoint to the for SOG/CC signature. When
        signed by the SOG/CC, the Form 1 will be marked as ―Final.‖ 27 SOW/XPO then prints
CANNONAFBI10-406 21 MAY 2012                                                                     7


       the Form 1 for Wing Commander approval during the weekly Commit Briefing, if
       required by policy.
   6.5. Forms 1 Submitted Within 10 Days. Unless otherwise directed, if a Form 1 is
   submitted for mission execution within 10 days, the requesting squadron will include
   justification for the late submittal of the Form 1.
   6.6. Disposition Instructions. 27 SOW/XPO will post the signed Forms 1 to the Wing
   Commit Calendar and notify the requesting unit. Signed Forms 1 will be disposed of in
   accordance with the Records Disposition Schedule.
7. Responsibilities.
   7.1. Wing Operations Scheduling (27 SOW/XPO) will:
       7.1.1. Maintain the Wing Commit Calendar.
       7.1.2. Manage the wing scheduling process. This includes hosting/facilitating the 27
       SOW/XPO Internal Scheduling Meeting, SOG/SOMXG Commit Meeting, and Wing
       Commit Briefing.
       7.1.3. Receive, review, and validate all MSRs. Coordinate short notice requests with 27
       SOG, 27 SOMXG, 27 SOMSG, and present to the Wing CC for tasking. Notify 623
       AOC and/or requesting units on the status of their MSR.
       7.1.4. Identify the impact of contingency operations on the Wing Commit Calendar and
       coordinate changes.
       7.1.5. Forward any requests for squadron visits, tours, or briefings to appropriate wing
       agency.
   7.2. Unit Planning Representatives (UPRs):
       7.2.1. Brief unit leadership on the details of new MRSs and changes to requests.
       7.2.2. Brief affected squadron planners to keep them aware of new MSRs and changes to
       requests.
       7.2.3. Coordinate with the requesting unit and other UPRs as required.
       7.2.4. Ensure their unit planners obtain key planning data and provide that data to XP.
       7.2.5. Immediately notify 27 SOW/XPO of potential conflicts.
       7.2.6. Immediately notify 27SOW/XPO of aircraft availability issues and potential
       conflicts.
   7.3. Mission Commanders (MCs):
       7.3.1. The 9 Mar 2011 letter signed by 23 AF/CC stipulates that the 623 AOC/SPDP will
       nominate a lead Wing for the each above-wing-level (AWL) event who will supply the
       MC for that event (See Attachment 9). Mission Commanders from the 1 SOW may act
       as the AFSOC Mission Commander when the 27 SOW and the 1 SOW are supporting the
       same exercise.
       7.3.2. Further guidance on Mission Commander’s responsibilities and tools for Mission
       Commanders can be found at the USAFSOS website. You must register for an account.

    The site will be updated with a MC Handbook coming in the summer of 2012. Mission
    commanders will adhere to guidelines in CAFBI 10-405, Wing Operations Plan
    regarding requirements and suspense.
