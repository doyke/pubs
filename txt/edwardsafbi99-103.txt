SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been revised, including instruction number change, to reflect changes to
organizations. This version reflects the changes made as a result of the AFMC 5 Center
construct reorganization: the re-designation of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), as the
Air Force Test Center (AFTC) and identification of the 412 TW as the organization responsible
for testing and reporting on developmental testing at Edwards AFB and associated units.
Primary changes include removing AFFTC organization references and replacing with 412 TW
organization and the removal of options for higher level report approval at the AFTC level.
Definition for Test Complete Letters and Safety-of-Flight release letters were added to progress
report section. Test Pilot School reporting requirements and responsibilities were added. Minor
typographical errors were fixed.

1. General.
     1.1. There are three major categories of reports: 1) those intended primarily for Test
     Enterprise use, such as handbooks and technical information memoranda, 2) technical reports
     intended primarily for external customers with a secondary use by the Test Enterprise as
     historical documentation, and 3) Test Pilot School (TPS) Test Management Project (TMP)
     reports that are primarily produced in support of curriculum requirements but may also be
     distributed to external customers.
     1.2. The 412 TW has established a set of standard TR products to provide the primary
     customer (herein referred to as the System Program Office [SPO]) as well as weapon system
     users and other stakeholders with value-added, decision-quality technical information as soon
     as practical and as economically as possible. The purpose and advantage of a standard set of
     products are to avoid inventing new products and new formats with every new project. These
     standardized products are designed to satisfy the immediate need for information of decision
     makers throughout the acquisition community as well as to provide final developmental test
     and evaluation (DT&E) documentation, as specified in chapters 3 and 7 of AFI 99-103.
EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                 3


   1.3. In accordance with AFI 99-103, the responsible test organization (RTO) and SPO
   mutually establish report schedules in test and evaluation (T&E) plans based on designated
   milestones and decision reviews. It is not just the SPO that has an interest in 412 TW
   reports. Other stakeholders, such as AFOTEC, user commands (ACC, AETC, AMC), reserve
   units, prime contractors, other AFMC test organizations, OSD offices, the AFTC, and other
   testers and system users have an interest in receiving relevant, high quality technical test and
   evaluation results from DT&E projects in a timely manner for supporting critical acquisition
   decisions. The RTO is responsible for timely submission of all reports. However, the time
   limits specified below are considered the 412 TW’s customary and expected practice when
   designated the RTO. The time limits below support the general reporting policy given in AFI
   99-103 that “test reports must be timely, factual, concise, and tailored to the needs of
   decision makers.” It is every 412 TW organization’s responsibility to support this policy and
   prevent delays in report generation. This will require Combined Test Force (CTF)
   discussions with the SPO to properly schedule analysis and reporting efforts with the same
   emphasis as is placed on properly scheduling test execution.
2. Policy.
   2.1. The overriding policy at 412 TW is to provide the SPO and other stakeholders with
   correct, value-added technical information based on an independent evaluation as soon as
   practical and as economically as possible. Technical reports will be accomplished for all
   USAF tests for which the 412 TW is RTO, unless specifically exempted by the 412 TW
   Technical Director (412 TW/CT) as documented in the statement of capability or in cases
   where the 412 TW has no technical involvement as determined by the 412 TW Technical
   Director. Technical reports may also be issued when a 412 TW organization is a participating
   test organization (PTO) and for which the RTO or SPO requests a 412 TW analysis or
   evaluation. The nominal timeline for report delivery is within 42 calendar days after final test
   execution (usually the final flight). Reporting plans that deliver final reports more than 60
   days after final execution must be approved by the 412 TW/CT.
   2.2. The reporting requirements, SPO need date and program milestone(s) supported will be
   clearly defined in statements of capability (SOC) and subsequent test planning documents.
   The SOCs will include estimates for resources needed to keep analysis and reporting tasks on
   schedule.
   2.3. The selection of reporting products at the 412 TW is specified in this instruction (see
   attachment 2). Each product is designed to deliver a result to the customer for decision
   making and risk management. At the conclusion of a test project, a TR, which may include
   the test results presented in previous reports, is submitted to the customer, Defense Technical
   Information Center (DTIC), the AFTC History Office (AFTC/HO) and others per the
   customer approved distribution list. This TR documents the 412 TW’s final position,
   conclusions, and recommendations for a given test.
       2.3.1. Deficiency reports (DR) are an action tool to propose enhancements to, or to drive
       the correction of, a specific deficiency on Air Force materiel. Details on Air Force
       deficiency documentation are contained in technical order (T.O.) 00-35D-54, USAF
       Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution, as well as EAFBI 99-224, Test
       Center Deficiency Reporting.
4                                                  EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013


       2.3.2. Progress reports (PR) (e.g., quick-looks, daily flight reports, etc.) are periodic
       assessments of the status of the project and do not replace the requirement for a technical
       report at project completion. The PR may be accomplished in any format as agreed to
       between the CTF and the customer.
           2.3.2.1. Test Complete Letters (TCL) and Safety-of-Flight Letters (SOFL) both fall
           in the PR category and are intended to assist in meeting the customers' needs in a
           timely and consistent manner. Test Complete Letters contain no analysis, subjective
           assessments, ratings, conclusions and/or recommendations. Safety-of-Flight Letters
           are released external to the squadron (i.e. release recommendation for training). They
           are both signed by the applicable squadron commander and coordinated with the 412
           OG Commander prior to being sent to the customer.
       2.3.3. Technical information handbooks (TIH) and technical information memorandums
       (TIM) are intended primarily for Test Enterprise use to document processes, provide
       instruction, or archive important technical information for engineering reference. These
       documents may also be used to document the detailed data or analysis used to
       substantiate recommendations to system models or flight manual charts. Depending on
       the intended use, the distribution of these types of documents may be adjusted. These
       documents will be submitted to DTIC unless specifically exempted by the 412 TW
       Commander. These documents will also be distributed to the AFTC History Office
       (AFTC/HO) and 412 TW/CT.
       2.3.4. Preliminary report of results (PRR) is a quick-reaction report to transmit principal
       test and evaluation findings to the customer in management terms from a management
       perspective. These documents are short and do not contain large amounts of
       substantiating data. PRRs must be submitted to DTIC and therefore are potentially
       available to qualified requesters from government and industry. All PRRs comply with
       the coordination processes specified in this Instruction as well as format and preparation
       guidelines specified in the AFFTC-TIH-09-01, The Author’s Guide to Writing AFFTC
       Technical Reports.
       2.3.5. Recommendation to proceed/not to proceed to Operational Test and Evaluation
       (OT&E) and Capability Releases are accomplished to inform the SPO of the system’s
       readiness for OT&E or operational capability. These are accomplished in accordance
       with AFI 99-103 and may be in either PRR or TR format. The 412 TW does not
       normally unilaterally certify a test item for OT&E. The 412 TW submits these
       recommendations to the SPO in support of a certification by higher Air Force authority.
       2.3.6. Technical report (TR) is the 412 TW’s final report at the end of a test project that
       formally documents the 412 TW’s position on a test item. The TR may also be used as an
       interim report when more testing and/or analysis are anticipated at a later date but the
       SPO wants a partial answer immediately. The TR may be any length and usually contains
       substantiating data. Final TRs must be submitted to DTIC and therefore are potentially
       available to qualified requesters from government and industry. All TRs comply with the
       format and coordination processes specified in this Instruction and AFFTC-TIH-09-01.
    2.4. System Program Offices will not coordinate on or approve 412 TW reports.
EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                 5


   2.5. Each project’s data analysis, evaluation, and report production status will be briefed to
   412 TW leadership at the CTF’s PMR meeting and at the Engineering Council meeting as
   requested.
       2.5.1. To support the weekly Engineering Council meeting and the PMR briefing, each
       CTF will hold periodic internal status meetings to assess each project’s progress of data
       analysis, evaluation, and report production. The chief engineer, all engineering leads, and
       a lead pilot/crewmember will attend. Report co-leads (functional flight chief or technical
       expert and the CTF chief engineer), authors (engineers, pilots/crewmembers, and others,
       as appropriate) and technical editing staff will provide input for these meetings and attend
       when requested. The status of data analysis, evaluation and report production for each
       project will be addressed, and schedules and required support will be adjusted as
       required.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. The overall process of preparing, approving, and publishing reports requires a team

     reports generated from a Test Management Project. This process will emulate the CTF
     process (para 3.8 above) with the TPS Technical Director serving as the RIPT chairman.
     The normal form of the final test report for a TMP will be TIM and will be reviewed
     internally by a RIPT composed of TPS/CT, appropriate TPS branch chief(s), staff
     advisors, and the student test team. These reports will be approved for publication by the
EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013                                                               11


       TPS Commandant and will be distributed to a limited audience. For those TMP reports
       that warrant, in the determination of TPS/CT, publication as a TR, the process described
       in this OI will be followed and the report will be approved by 412 TW/CT or his
       designee. Criteria that could result in a TIM being elevated to TR-status include customer
       requirements and/or significant technical or operational results warranting wider spread
       dissemination.
4. Procedures. Figure 1 presents the overall report writing process.
   4.1. Initiating the Reporting Process.
       4.1.1. Identifying Initial Reporting Requirements. Attachment 2 contains a listing of the
       types of reports published by the 412 TW. The 412th TMG will relay the requirement and
       scope for project reporting to the SPO during the SOC process as determined by the
       appropriate CTF chief engineer and respective engineering organization. The details at
       this point are typically fairly high level and would involve the number, type, and required
       distribution date for each report. Providing timely TRs to support acquisition decisions is
       the goal. A PRR should not be planned as the supporting documentation for acquisition
       decisions. A PRR can be planned to support incremental development recommendations
       between major test phases of a project.
 12                                             EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013


Figure 1. 412TW Technical Reporting Process




      4.1.2. Establishing the Report IPT. An RIPT will be assigned for each PRR or TR, and
      membership on the RIPT will be determined during the test plan technical review. The
      RIPT co-leads will be the CTF chief engineer and a functional flight chief or technical
EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013                                                            13


     expert. Other members of the RIPT will include the primary author, other authors as
     required, the primary author’s lead at the CTF, a test team operator (pilot, load master,
     etc.) and a technical editor/writer. Other personnel may be assigned to the RIPT as
     appropriate.
     4.1.3. Finalizing Report Requirements. The primary author, in conjunction with the CTF
     chief engineer, will work with the SPO to reaffirm the reporting requirements during the
     test planning phase, prior to test plan approval. Once agreement has been reached with
     the SPO, the primary author will present the agreed upon format and content to the RIPT
     co-leads for their concurrence and update the TOC network as required. Reference
     AFFTC-TIH-09-01 for format details.
     4.1.4. Establishing Milestones. The event that initiates the reporting process is the test
     plan technical review/approval. The key milestone used to determine the required report
     delivery date will be established with the SPO to support program acquisition milestones
     and included in the TOC project schedule (or the agreed-upon project schedule for
     projects not using TOC). This will normally be based on the date of the last test. The
     goal for all report products at the 412 TW is to meet the customer’s requirements by
     providing a report as quickly as practical after the last test event. Consequently, the
     report completion date will be established as the SPO delivery date or 42 calendar days,
     whichever is earlier.
         4.1.4.1. The key internal milestones to be modeled in the TOC project schedule are:
         test plan and technical adequacy letter (TAL) approval, data analysis process
         validation, initial RIPT meeting, each periodic PMR, last test event, coordination
         meeting completion, 412 TW/CC approval, and report distribution completion.
         4.1.4.2. Each report will have the agreed upon delivery date modeled in the schedule
         as a Customer Milestone (CMS), unless waived by the Test Wing Technical Director.
         4.1.4.3. Progress of the report will be tracked from the time the schedule is approved
         using both the milestone report and the TR delivery date trend chart.
     4.1.5. Obtaining Guidance and Support. As soon as practical, the primary author will
     contact the Technical Publications Office to obtain the following: a report number; a
     standard distribution list (which will include as a minimum DTIC, AFTC/HO and 412
     TW/CT); and information related to report distribution statements. This process will
     generally be initiated as soon as the test plan has been completed and approved. The
     Technical Publications Office will provide all report numbers for TIHs and TIMs, PRRs,
     and TRs. The standard distribution list must be scrutinized for program applicability and
     modified with SPO approval as required.
  4.2. Writing the Report.
     4.2.1. Shortly after test plan approval, the RIPT co-leads and primary author will hold
     the initial RIPT meeting to lay out the plan, schedule, and milestones for reporting.
     4.2.2. Prior to the start of test execution, the authors and RIPT co-leads will develop a
     report outline which meets the needs of the customer and that will document the results
     of the tests against the objectives. Test plan sections may be used to satisfy outlined
14                                                 EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013


     sections of the report. The authors and technical editing staff will work to draft these
     report sections at this time.
     4.2.3. Throughout test execution, project personnel will perform data analysis and
     evaluation, ensure DRs are written in a timely manner, as appropriate, and provide the
     primary author and technical editor written updates to the report for their area(s) of
     responsibility.
     4.2.4. Periodically, the CTF chief engineer will brief each project’s data analysis,
     evaluation, and report production status at the weekly Engineering Council meeting and
     at their CTF’s PMR meeting.
     4.2.5. Periodically during the test execution phase, the RIPT will meet to review and
     update the draft report.
     4.2.6. Shortly after the last test event, or if a PRR is required prior to test completion, the
     primary author and technical editor/writer will complete the report in preparation for the
     coordination meeting.
     4.2.7. Extensions to Milestones. All reasonable management efforts will be exhausted to
     ensure meeting the 42 day timeline and the report distribution due date (CMS), the date
     promised to the customer in the TOC schedule. In the event of extenuating
     circumstances, milestones may be changed and a report extension would be considered
     when the RIPT believes it will miss the CMS. If the report CMS cannot be met, the
     project manager with the director of projects and RIPT co-leads will coordinate with the
     SPO to determine if a project rebaseline is required.
  4.3. Report Coordination and Approval. All 412 TW report products will receive a technical
  and editorial review.
     4.3.1. RIPT Coordination. The RIPT will not release the report for coordination at the
     coordination meeting until they feel it is a complete and ‘quality’ document.
         4.3.1.1. The technical editor/writer will distribute the completed report to
         coordination meeting members.
         4.3.1.2. The RIPT co-leads will chair the coordination meeting where the RIPT and
         other reviewers will provide their comments/changes for real-time update of the
         report, as appropriate.
         4.3.1.3. The authors and chief engineer will sign the signature page of the report at
         the coordination meeting or a subsequent coordination/approval will be scheduled.
     4.3.2. Final Review and Approval.
         4.3.2.1. After the coordination meeting, the primary author and technical
         editor/writer will revise the report and send it to the Technical Publications Office for
         printing.
         4.3.2.2. Once the report has been prepared for final review and the RIPT has released
         the coordinated version, final review and approval is accomplished primarily to
         ensure the report represents a valid, acceptable 412 TW position on the test issues and
         findings. As a goal, review and approval should not exceed 5 days. Staff functions
EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                15


           will maintain approval layers at the essential minimum. See attachment 2 for the
           appropriate final approval of each type of report.
           4.3.2.3. The Technical Publications Office will schedule the report approval meeting
           (RAM) per request of the RIPT on the 412 TW/CT calendar, send out the meeting
           announcement, and deliver the report to RAM members.
           4.3.2.4. The 412 TW/CT (or designee) will chair the RAM, ensure report is ready for
           release, and sign the report.
           4.3.2.5. The primary author and technical editor/writer will incorporate RAM
           changes, if any, and send the finalized report to the Technical Publications Office.
       4.3.3. Printing. The Technical Publications Office will deliver a print-quality copy of the
       report or electronic media copy, along with a Defense Automated Printing Service
       (DAPS) CL5604/48 (Rev. 9-97), Automated Printing Request, to DAPS/RF in sufficient
       time to complete printing within 10 calendar days. Local printing either at the CTF or
       utilizing EAFB Graphics Office may be performed as an alternate to DAPS. The
       Technical Publications Office will track printing status.
       4.3.4. Distribution. Immediately after approval of a report, either the primary author or
       Technical Publications Office will submit a signed copy to the SPO. The Technical
       Publications Office will make formal distribution of the remaining printed copies in
       accordance with the distribution list approved by the SPO. The report must be submitted
       to STINFO for distribution to DTIC.
       4.3.5. Tracking Report Status. The Technical Publications Office will serve as the
       central point for compiling and tracking status of PRRs and TRs using the report metric
       products available. The Technical Publications Office will provide periodic summaries of
       report status as directed by 412 TW/CT.
5. Training. The 412 TENG will be responsible for ensuring adequate training of the reporting
process is provided to all appropriate personnel. This includes authors, functional and operational
supervisors, and the Technical Publications Office.
6. 412TW Technical Report Products.
   6.1. Technical Report (TR).
       6.1.1. The TR presents the final and official position of the 412 TW on the test item.
       6.1.2. The TR may be any length, including very short. The format/content is described
       in AFFTC TIH-09-01.
       6.1.3. A TR should be used to periodically report ‘testing to date’ when it is known a
       project is going to last several years.
   6.2. Preliminary Report of Results (PRR).
       6.2.1. The PRR will be used in circumstances where immediate information is needed to
       support a major program decision.
       6.2.2. There are two PRR formats, the briefing PRR and the memorandum PRR, as
       described in AFFTC TIH0901.
 16                                                EDWARDSAFBI99-103 29 AUGUST 2013


       6.2.3. A PRR presents preliminary results and analysis to decision makers and is oriented
       toward management issues. Important engineering information may be included in
       summary form if required for the understanding of the briefing.
       6.2.4. A PRR is written with the understanding that it will be used for making a critical
       management decision in a time-frame that does not allow for complete analysis or the
       writing of a full technical report. Therefore, only that portion of the analysis that is
       complete should be presented, and limitations on the preliminary results, if any, must be
       clearly stated.
       6.2.5. The words ‘Preliminary and Results’ are important and intentional. The final
       report on the subject matter will be published at a later date. New data or more analysis
       may change the preliminary results and, therefore, the conclusions and recommendations
       in the final report may be other than was initially expected from the ‘preliminary results’.
       6.2.6. If there is sufficient time to do a complete analysis and write a report, then a PRR
       is not accomplished.
       6.2.7. A briefing, such as progress report, or status report may be given to the SPO
       whenever the SPO requests it. Those briefings are not a PRR.
7. FOIA and Distribution Statements. Distribution statements are not in themselves authority
to withhold unclassified technical data from public disclosure. Such determinations are the
responsibility of the controlling DoD office and will be made in accordance with DoD Directive
5400, The DoD Freedom of information Act Program. Personnel must be aware the distribution
statement may not apply to FOIA and must be aware of FOIA exemptions, DOD Regulation
5400.7_AFMAN 33-302. The Edwards AFB FOIA Requester Service Center processes the
release of scientific and technical information requested under the FOIA in accordance with
governing regulations and instructions.

AFSO21. AFSO21 is an improvement model customized to the unique environment of the
USAF which leverages improvement methods from various sources such as; Lean, Six Sigma,
Theory of Constraints, and Business Process Reengineering. AFSO21 is a transformational
initiative empowering all Airmen to eliminate waste from every end—to-end process.
AFSO21 Rapid Improvement Event (RIE).—A Lean Process improvement tool consisting of
a small team charted with a specific project scope requiring process improvement within a short
timeframe, usually in less than one week.
Combined Test Force (CTF). A CTF is a test force made up of representatives from 412 TW,
participating test organizations, AFOTEC, using and support commands, contractors, and
possibly other military services. A CTF is organized for each system undergoing test and
evaluation (T&E). CTFs are responsible for all aspects of planning, coordinating, managing,
flight operations, safety, testing and reporting of T&E, and support of IOT&E and follow—on
test and evaluation (FOT&E) test programs. Typical of the major test programs for which CTFs
have been formed at the 412 TW are the Global Power Bomber, Global Power Fighters, Global
Reach, F-22, Joint Strike Fighter, and Test Operations. (For IOT&E and FOT&E definitions,
refer to the Defense Acquisition University Glossary: Acronyms and Terms).
Report Integrated Product Team (RIPT).—The RIPT consists of personnel responsible for a
project’s report production.
Statement of Capability (SOC).—The SOC is the 412 TW response to a customer's test support
request. The SOC document, approved by 412 TW/TMG, is the 412 TW's commitment to
provide the customer the necessary resources, along with the cost estimate and schedule for the
requested support.
Technical Adequacy Letter (TAL). The TAL is a memorandum for record prepared by the
flight chief or technical expert that chaired the technical review board (TRB) to document the
results of the technical review, IAW AFFTCI 99-1, Test Plans. The TAL is approved by the
Test Wing Technical Director (TW/CT) when they approve the test/safety package.
Test and Evaluation (T&E). This is the process by which a system or components are exercised
and results analyzed to provide performance related information. The information has many uses
including risk identification and risk mitigation and empirical data to validate models and
simulations. T&E enables an assessment of the attainment of technical performance,
specifications, system maturity, and military utility to determine whether systems are
operationally effective, suitable and survivable for intended use, and/or lethal. There are three
distinct types of T&E defined in statute or regulation: Developmental Test and Evaluation
(DT&E), Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), and Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E).
(For definitions of these T&E types, refer to the Defense Acquisition University Glossary:
Acronyms and Terms).
Theory of Constraints Project Management (TOC PM).—TOC PM is the project planning,
scheduling, and management tool used by the 412th Test Wing.
