The Air Force Chief of Safety Outstanding Achievement Award for Ground Safety, Category II,

education programs trained more than 2,500 base personnel in a myriad of supervisory,
motorcycle, and traffic safety subjects. Relevant world-wide, safety personnel supported safety
programs and investigations in five countries, including the only United States military ground
safety expert during humanitarian relief operations in the earthquake-damaged country of Haiti.
Absolute professionals, their multi-faceted awareness program resulted in wing personnel safely
navigating the 101 Critical Days of Summer and every major holiday.             The distinctive
accomplishments of the men and women of the 2d Special Operations Wing reflect great credit
upon themselves, Air Force Special Operations Command, and the United States Air Force.

period, Captain Doe served as 23rd Air Refueling Wing, Chief of Flight Safety for 60 KC-135
aircraft, four flying squadrons, and over 400 aircrew members. Through superior program
management, he led his office to garner an “Excellent” rating in the February 2011 Headquarters
Air Mobility Command Unit Compliance Inspection. Additionally, Captain Doe further
distinguished himself when he established a fully functioning group safety office, while serving
as Chief of Safety for the 455th Air Expeditionary Group. While deployed, he facilitated the
