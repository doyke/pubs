                          Changes to AETCI 36-2203, 12 August 2009

1.2.1.1.1. Training requests for foreign military/international students will require foreign
disclosure review of requested training course or courses. Air Force Security Assistance
Training (AFSAT) will notify AETC/A3T Workflow of new foreign military training
requirements and requests for training courses where a Military Articles and Services List
(MASL) number has not been assigned.
*1.2.1.1.2. The AETC/A3T Training Pipeline Manager (TPM) will contact appropriate TM for
the requested course or courses.
1.2.1.1.3. TM will coordinate foreign disclosure review in accordance with paragraph 3.5.2.6.2.
*1.2.1.1.4. Training wing/group personnel will notify the AETC/A3T TPM of any requests for
training directly from a foreign source or Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT). The
TPM will validate training request with AFSAT.
1.2.3. Responsibilities: Training group or wing ensures foreign disclosure review is
accomplished if requirement to train foreign military/international students exists.
*1.4.2. Type 2, AETC Special Training. Formal training of a one-time or limited (1 year or
less) nature; conducted by AETC instructors at an Air Force base, other military location, or
contractor's location; normally used to train personnel to operate and maintain new weapons or
systems. Type 2 courses require all course control documents (POI, Lesson Plans, Course Chart,
Course Training Standards), measurement plan, and measurement devices, a Risk Management
(RM) assessment (see paragraph 3.5.2.11.3.1), and a foreign disclosure review, if international
students will be trained (see paragraph 3.5.2.6). They do not require a CTP, do not earn
manpower, and can be used to rapidly stand up a course when in-house resources are available.
*2.1.3. CRE development time is within 8 weeks (40 workdays) from the tasking meeting or
memo. Requesting agencies must submit a complete set of training requirements when
requesting a CRE. Delays will increase CRE production time.
*2.3.3. Local MO-provided manpower requirement estimates, for instructors, maintenance
personnel, training development personnel, training overhead support, BOS, and SMY for
courses that earn manpower or have a SMY bill. A SMY annualizes an authorization dedicated
to student coverage. SMY is a method to account for pipeline or PCS course lost duty time for
students who are in formal school training, part of the Air Force end strength, and are not yet
available for operational unit duty. SMY tracking is used to determine personnel pay, housing
and support. See AETCI 38-202, Education and Technical Training Manpower, for additional
information.
*2.3.4. Estimate of training equipment, training spares, support equipment (test equipment and
special tools), and contractor logistics support. Include as much information as possible, to
include computer hardware and software requirements. Note: Ensure life cycle maintenance,
sustainment, and replacement costs are included in the estimate.
2.3.12. Media and cost/benefit analysis for new or changing instructional technology application
requirements estimates (including IMI, Type 6 DL, or ITV). See AETCI 36-2208, Technical and
Basic Military Training Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) and Distance Learning (DL),
for additional information.
*2.4. Coordinating CREs. The TM or designated representative develops the CRE when
tasked by HQ AETC/A3T TPM, accomplishes local coordination, and forwards it to the TPM.
The TM coordinates with base civil engineer if there are facility issues. The TPM will
coordinate the CRE with HQ AETC/A1MRT (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) and HQ
AETC/A3RB for review and approval. Allow 30 working days for HQ AETC coordination.
Note: Ensure the local trainer/equipment maintenance activity is included as part of the local
coordination.
*2.5.1. If the course can be funded within the TRW, the TM develops the CTP according to
Chapter 3 and submits the documentation accordingly. If not, the TM forwards the CRE to the
wing/group RM and info-copies 2 AF/TTOC. The RM confirms nonavailability of local support,
obtains wing/group approval, and returns the CRE to the TM. The TM emails the CRE to the
TPM. The TPM will coordinate the CRE with HQ AETC/A3RB and HQ AETC/A1MRT for
validation of resource estimate. Medical courses are coordinated with HQ AETC/SGU. HQ
AETC/A1MRT validates the manpower requirements, and HQ AETC/A3RB computes the
remaining funding obligations and generates the CRE Part II. The CRE Part II includes
headquarters-level computed costs (e.g., TDY-to-school, instructor and SMY, etc.) and displays
the total resource bill for AFCFM review. The HQ AETC TPM (HQ AETC SGU for medical
courses) forwards the CRE to the AFCFM for resourcing. The TPM will establish an expiration
date for the CRE. The expiration date will consider the POM cycle, MILCON needs, and AETC
annual manpower (instructor) pricing cycle.
*2.5.2. The AFCFM notifies the TPM (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) if funding is
available. The TPM (TPM and HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) notifies the TM. The
AFCFM contacts the TPM (HQ AETC/SGU for medical courses) concerning the status of the
request. At minimum, the TPM will follow up with the AFCFM for a quarterly status check
until the CRE is funded or the expiration date. The TPM will update the TM and 2 AF.
3.1.3. The CTP outlines actions necessary to bring training on line, including those relative to
security, foreign disclosure restrictions, course documents, student scheduling, instructional
materials, manpower and personnel, facilities, and equipment for minimum and maximum
training capabilities. For information on developing official manpower documents, go to AFKN
on the AF Portal, select the AF COP link, and then the manpower and personnel link.
*3.2. When to Develop a CTP or Abbreviated Training Plan (ATP): Note: Prior to
developing CTP/ATP, TRGs will work with local manpower to determine if proposed changes
impact manpower requirements and local logistics and maintenance organizations to verify if
proposed changes impact AETC programmed training operations support and/or sustainment
costs.
*3.2.1. Develop a CTP for new courses, major changes (see Attachment 1 for definition) to
existing courses, and when transferring courses from one base to another.
*3.2.2. Develop an ATP for minor changes (see Attachment 1 for definition) to existing courses
impacting resources and/or manpower requirements or when adding motivational training.
*3.2.2.1. The ATP includes a summary of changes and all updated annexes.
3.5.1.2.5. Foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign military/international students are to be
trained. Example: “Foreign Disclosure: This course contains information which may not be
disclosed to international students without proper authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure
memorandum in the Security Annex for further information.”
3.5.1.4. Total Programmed Entries and Scheduling Constraints. Specify total programmed
entries for the FY when the course will be implemented, and briefly describe class or student
scheduling constraints, such as group sizes or minimum interval. Use TRQI requirements,
including NPS student programmed attrition, as the total programmed entries baseline. If foreign
military/international students will be trained, include a foreign disclosure memorandum as part
of the Security Annex. Describe in this section other actions necessary to accommodate foreign
military/international students (such as computer access authorization processes).
3.5.2.6. Security Annex. Provides for control of classified information used in a course. Annex
also provides guidance and authority disclosure of classified military information (CMI) and/or
controlled unclassified military information (CUMI) to foreign military/international students.
Foreign disclosure guidance and authority is provided by the wing FDO as part of the foreign
disclosure review.
3.5.2.6.1. The foreign disclosure review process (para. 3.5.2.6.2.) will be accomplished on any
new course or any existing course during revision or change if foreign military/international
students are to be trained.
3.5.2.6.1.1. For revisions or changes to existing courses, TM will review the Program Guidance
Letter/Program Technical Training (PGL/PTT) for MX20 quota and historical records for any
instance of foreign students being trained on other than MX20 quotas (previous 5 years and
outyears). TM will also check ETCA for a MASL number assigned to the current course.
3.5.2.6.1.2. If no MX20 quota or instance of foreign students being trained appears in the history
or outyears, a foreign disclosure review is not required.
3.5.2.6.1.3. If MX20 quotas are found in PGL/PTT, instances of foreign students being trained
appear in the history, or a MASL number is assigned, include foreign disclosure review as part of
CTP/ATP.
3.5.2.6.2. Foreign Disclosure Review Process (see Attachment 17)
3.5.2.6.2.1. TM will coordinate with the Wing FDO to conduct review of course material for
foreign disclosure restrictions.
3.5.2.6.2.2. TM provides the wing FDO with a copy of the CTP narrative describing the target
audience for the course, the plan of instruction, and the course equipment listing (AETC Form
120). For course revisions or changes, include a summary memorandum identifying new
information, equipment, applications, etc., included as part of the revision or change.
3.5.2.6.2.3. Wing FDO, working with TM and course subject matter experts (SME), will review
course material and compare with appropriate Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL)
to determine any disclosure restrictions.
3.5.2.6.2.4. Wing FDO will issue a disclosure memorandum in accordance with AFI 16-201, Air
Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program, identifying specific disclosure
restrictions based on DDL to AFSAT FDO, with copy to AETC/IAD FDO, and TM.
3.5.2.6.2.5. AFSAT FDO (or AETC/IAD FDO in absence of AFSAT FDO) will review
disclosure memorandum and provide concurrence on disclosure restrictions back to wing FDO.
Wing FDO will notify TM memorandum approved by AFSAT. Note: If AFSAT nonconcurs,
AFSAT and wing FDO will resolve any issues. Wing FDO will provide corrected and approved
memorandum to TM and AETC/IAD.
3.5.2.6.2.6. TM will include disclosure memorandum in CTP Security Annex. For courses not
requiring training plans; e.g., Type 2, file the disclosure memorandum in the course record set. If
new information has been added or changes made to the course after memorandum is issued, the
TM will coordinate with the Wing FDO to review new material and/or changes. Wing FDO will
update the memorandum, as applicable, and coordinate the updated memorandum with AFSAT
FDO and AETC/IAD FDO. TM will update the memorandum in the CTP Security Annex or
course record set, as applicable. Note: When AFSAT assigns an approved MASL number to the
course, TM will annotate the MASL number on the memorandum in the CTP Security Annex or
course record set, as applicable. Pen and ink annotations are acceptable.
3.5.2.6.2.7. TM will include a foreign disclosure disclaimer in course data section of the CTP.
Reference paragraph 3.5.1.2.5. for a sample disclaimer.
3.5.2.6.2.8. TM, working with TDE, will ensure POI instructional guidance includes a foreign
disclosure disclaimer for each lesson, where appropriate. Example: “This lesson contains
information which may not be disclosed to international students without proper authorization.
Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the Security Annex of the Course Training Plan
for further information.”
3.10.7.6. Ensure foreign disclosure review process is accomplished and foreign disclosure
memorandum is included in CTP Security Annex or course record set, as applicable, if foreign
military/international students are to be trained.
*4.4.6.3.3. Use SME input to list job tasks under each duty. Subtasks may also be listed. To
help ensure complete coverage, compare the initial SME grouping of tasks to the STS and task
matching in the OSR training extract STS factor printout.
*4.4.6.3.4. Use OSR data, when available, to determine which tasks are performed at each AFS
skill level. Consider including tasks performed or knowledge required by 30 percent or more of
the personnel in each AFS skill level. For specialties where 30 percent is unrealistic, establish an
alternate cutoff point, and maintain supporting rationale in the STS record set folder.
*4.4.6.3.5. Use OSR data to determine if because of task difficulty, safety factors, or training
emphasis ratings, tasks performed by less than 30 percent should be included in the list. Include
in the STS column 1, regardless of percent performing.
*4.4.6.3.6. Use SME AFS knowledge to organize and list column 1 duties and tasks for OJT
use.
*4.4.6.3.7. Provide rationale (OSR data, evaluation feedback, or user input) as to support STS
column 1 entries. TMs will retain the data with the course record set so that others, such as new
course personnel, understand the course content rationale, and as the basis to develop course
objectives. Training decision rationale can be documented in the STS factor printout.
*6.1.1. Formal measurement/assessment is required in all courses. Formal measurement
includes, but is not limited to, written tests, performance tests, and progress checks. When
measuring learning in the affective domain, alternative measurement/assessment may be
developed. These include, but are not limited to, team building activities, case studies,
simulations, and open-ended question assessments.
*6.1.2. To graduate, each student must successfully pass all formal measurement devices. An
exception would be a performance objective or written measurement not taken because of a
documented training deficiency. Instructors may grant international students additional time to
complete measurement devices when language difficulties dictate.
6.10.4. Ensure measurement devices include a foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign
military/international students are to be trained. Example: “This document contains information
which may not be disclosed to international students without proper authorization. Refer to the
foreign disclosure memorandum in the Security Annex of the Course Training Plan for further
information.”
7.2.4.8. Include foreign disclosure disclaimer if foreign military/international students are to be
trained. Example: “This course contains information which may not be disclosed to
international students without proper authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum
in the Security Annex of the Course Training Plan for further information.”
7.5.8. Ensure foreign disclosure disclaimer is included on the course chart, as applicable.
*8.1.1.6. Training material and resource conservation.
*8.1.1.9. Sexual harassment and assault reporting, professional and unprofessional relationships,
and hazing.
*8.1.1.9.1. Describe required standards of conduct for trainees, faculty, and staff. Ensure
AETCI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, is included as part of the
student instructional material. Refer to AETCI 36-2909 for examples of professional and
unprofessional relationships between trainees, faculty, and staff. Encourage students to follow
the chain of command to resolve issues, where practical. If the unprofessional conduct involves
someone in the student’s chain of command, inform students they may go to the next higher
level (e.g., instructor supervisor, flight commander/chief, squadron commander, or group
commander) or appropriate outside office or agency to report it. Encourage students to report
sexual assault in accordance with AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
Program. Identify support and investigative agencies, their contact numbers, and hotlines
available to students and trainees who need assistance in resolving issues.
*8.1.1.9.2. Ensure the Lesson Plan Part II includes the following statement under sexual
harassment and assault reporting: “Victims of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault in
training environments are provided confidential access to victim support services. Victims will
be afforded the necessary time for recovery and opportunity to make up training missed during
the recovery period. Training may be made up through either special individualized assistance
(SIA) or washback/recycle. How training will be made up will be determined by the instructor
supervisor with the best interests of the student in mind and based on the amount of training that
has been missed, complexity of the training, and other relevant factors.”
*8.2.5.1.5. Air Force Doctrine. Air Force instructors (active duty and civilian) will introduce
Air Force basic doctrine, as referenced in AFDD 1, Air Force Basic Doctrine, Organization, and
Command, to Air Force students in all initial skills courses. Throughout the course, instructors
will “weave in” information about basic doctrine, using AFDD 1 and active learning techniques.
These techniques include, but are not limited to, guided discussion, two-way stories, simulations,
past experiences, and case studies. Instructors will use their discretion as to the technique to be
used and optimum time to inject Air Force basic doctrine. Refer to AFI 10-1301, Air Force
Doctrine, for additional information.
*8.2.5.1.6. Energy Conservation. Where appropriate, weave principles of energy conservation
throughout the curriculum in all courses. Guide students in recognizing correct and incorrect
applications of energy conservation in the workplace and on the job. Focus on the application of
energy conservation principles applicable to AFSC specific job tasks and responsibilities. Use
active learning techniques such as modeling, one-way stories, guided discussions, two-way
stories, simulations, personal experiences, and case studies. Instructors will use their discretion
as to the technique to be used.
8.2.5.5. Include foreign disclosure disclaimer in POI instructional guidance for each lesson,
where appropriate. Example: “This lesson contains information which may not be disclosed to
international students without proper authorization. Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum
in the Security Annex of the Course Training Plan for further information.”
*8.2.13. When two or more courses have identical contents (piggyback courses or an MTT),
identify in a separate memo which is the mother course and which piggyback courses will be
taught using the parent course documents. Initial skills piggyback courses attended by both Air
Force officer and enlisted personnel require separate TTMS course builds and flow. Advanced
and supplemental courses attended by both officer and enlisted personnel do not require separate
course numbers or course builds. Identify the course based on the predominant type of student
attending.
8.3. POI Responsibilities. The training group or designated level within the group: Provides
POI development guidance, expertise, and oversight; ensures foreign disclosure disclaimer is
included in POI instructional guidance, where appropriate; prints and distributes POIs; approves
new/revised POIs and POI changes prior to use (curriculum manager is 982 TRG authority);
maintains electronic or paper POI record sets (it is not necessary to maintain a copy of a
published document and camera-ready copy of the same document).
*8.7.3.4. Personalized LP information is accurate, applicable, adequate, and personalized
content is consistent with Air Force core values, policy, and guidance. Ensure training programs
containing content on radicalism, cultural awareness, and counterterrorism exhibit cultural
sensitivity and respect for religion.
*8.7.9. An LP is not required for units of instruction or objectives presented by a guest lecturer
(a person not affiliated with the course). However, a list of objectives is required. Note: Review
guest lecturer materials prior to presentation to ensure consistency with Air Force core values,
policy, and guidance.
*8.7.10. For courses taught entirely by guest lecturers, prepare a brief outline of the points the
lecturer is expected to cover. Also, prepare an alternate plan for use in the lecturer’s absence.
Note: Review guest lecturer materials prior to presentation to ensure consistency with Air Force
core values, policy, and guidance.
*8.8. LP Responsibilities. TRGs will:
*8.8.1. Provide LP development guidance, expertise, and oversight.
*8.8.2. Ensure LP content is consistent with Air Force core values, policy, and guidance.
Training programs containing content on radicalism, cultural awareness, and counterterrorism
must exhibit cultural sensitivity and respect for religion. Note: Provide this guidance to guest
lecturers and review guest lecturer materials prior to their presentation to ensure consistency with
Air Force core values, policy, and guidance.
*8.8.3. Specify coordination and approval procedures.
*8.8.4. Establish LP currency control procedures and maintain all LP record sets.
9.4.11.3. Annotate record if foreign disclosure restrictions apply.
9.5.1.1. Requests for AETC training materials by a foreign government must be coordinated
through the TPM. The TPM will coordinate with the Wing FDO and/or AETC/IA FDO.
9.5.1.2. Wing FDO will work with the TM to ensure appropriate foreign disclosure statements
are applied to course materials released to international students and foreign governments.
Appropriate disclosure statements will be applied to student instructional materials given to
international students prior to beginning class.
*9.5.1.2.1. The following disclosure statement will be stamped or typed on the front or cover
page of training materials containing CMI or CUMI in accordance with AFI 16-201, paragraph
4.4.2.2.,: “This information is furnished on the condition that it will not be released to another
nation without specific authority of the Department of the Air Force of the United States, that it
will be used for military purposes only, that individual or corporate rights originating in the
information, whether patented or not, will be respected, that the recipient will report promptly to
the United States any known or suspected compromise, and that the information will be provided
substantially the same degree of security afforded it by the Department of Defense of the United
States. Also, regardless of any other markings on the document, it will not be downgraded or
declassified without written approval of the originating US agency.”
9.5.1.2.2. The following statement will be included at the beginning of electronic media CMI or
CUMI in accordance with AFI 16-201, paragraph 4.4.2.3.,: “This information is furnished on the
condition that it will be given substantially the same degree of security protection given to it by
the United States and will not be released to another nation without United States Air Force
authorization.”
9.5.1.2.3. The following disclosure statement will be conspicuously displayed at the front or
beginning of disclosed unclassified information related to general theory and principles which do
not have any handling restrictions, control, access, and/or distribution limitations in accordance
with AFI 16-201, paragraph 4.7.,: “This briefing, presentation, or document is for information
only. No US Government commitment to sell, loan, lease, co-develop or co-produce defense
articles or provide defense services is implied or intended.”
9.8.2.9. Foreign disclosure disclaimer, where applicable. Example: “This document contains
information which may not be disclosed to international students without proper authorization.
Refer to the foreign disclosure memorandum in the Security Annex of the Course Training Plan
for further information.”
*10.2.4. Mother course validation validates piggyback course if the piggyback course has not
changed.
*Chapter 13
*LOW FLOW COURSE REVIEW
*13.1. Purpose. The low flow course review verifies courses entering fewer than 75 Air Force
students in the FY are cost effective and can be fully justified. Consider mother/piggyback
courses together.
*13.2. Procedures:
*13.2.1. TM conducts the review annually on all low flow courses during the last quarter of the
FY (July – September) and submits a report to HQ AETC/A3T TPM. Note: For courses in
validation when a low flow course review is due, conduct the review as part of the validation
process.
*13.2.2. Report will include the following information:
*13.2.2.1. Course purpose such as initial skills, advanced or supplemental training.
*13.2.2.2. Requirement for course. Examples: Legal, AF required certification, SEI,
assignment, etc.
*13.2.2.3. Criticality of skill/knowledge.
*13.2.2.4. Actual student entries for the previous FY.
*13.2.2.5. Actual student entries to date for the current FY.
*13.2.2.6. Scheduled entries for the current FY.
*13.2.2.7. Scheduled entries for the next FY.
*13.2.2.8. Manpower. Instructors assigned per UMD; family grouped instructors and fractional
cost, if applicable. Note: Provide FAC and OSC for manpower authorizations.
*13.2.2.9. Equipment. Dedicated equipment, equipment cross utilized with other courses, and
equipment maintenance costs.
*13.2.2.10. Facilities. Standard facilities needed, specialized facilities needed, facilities cross
utilized with other courses.
*13.2.2.11. O&M costs (Bench stock, expendable supplies, fuel, etc.).
*13.2.2.12. Possible alternate training methodology for all or part of course.
*13.2.2.13. Recommendation to discontinue, revise, or maintain course in current state. Provide
rationale to support recommendation.
*13.2.3. The TPM reviews the report, calculates applicable TDY-to-school costs using HQ
AETC/A3R data, and prepares command recommendation memorandum for HQ AETC/A3T
signature.
*13.2.4. The TPM forwards the signed memorandum to the AFCFM with a courtesy copy to 2
AF/TTOC, HQ AETC/SGU (for medical courses), and AFSAT (if international students trained).
*13.2.4.1. If AFCFM concurs with recommendation, the TPM will notify the TM of decision
and task TM to discontinue the course, as applicable.
*13.2.4.2. If AFCFM nonconcurs with recommendation, the TPM will evaluate the AFCFM’s
justification, resolve any issues, and notify the TM of the final disposition of the course within
60 calendar days.
*13.3. Responsibilities.
*13.3.1. HQ AETC/A3T will:
*13.3.1.1. Review recommendation and forward command recommendation on disposition of
course to AFCFM.
*13.3.1.2. Evaluate AFCFM nonconcurrence and resolve any issues with AFCFM.
*13.3.2. The TRG or designated level will:
*13.3.2.1. Establish an annual low flow course review program.
*13.3.2.2. Submit reports to HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
*15.1. Purpose. The annual review of technical training (ARTT) provides a thorough, periodic
review of all courses within each officer and enlisted specialty’s continuum of training. The
ARTT is designed to generate an in-depth look at all courses across all skill levels to ensure they
include only relevant skills and knowledge, do not unnecessarily duplicate training, and satisfy
customer requirements. The ARTT is accomplished using a team concept with team members
knowledgeable in training processes and procedures. The ARTT team should include instructor
supervisors, course supervisors, equipment account custodians, TDE personnel, instructional
technology unit specialists, TMs, training evaluators, training resource specialists, flight chiefs,
and TRS commanders. A team does not need each of these members, but a typical team will
include those experience types. Note: BMT conducts a triennial review, following the same
rules on a 3-year cycle.
*15.2.2. Scrutinize the TS, CC, POI, LP, resident training materials, student measurement,
FEQs, and course validation data (if available) to determine if courses meet customer
requirements; whether training is unnecessarily duplicated; if course material depth and breadth
expands from one skill level to the next; whether courses maintain a clear relationship with
others in the same family group; and whether courses are still needed. Review course equipment
lists to ensure equipment supports training objectives. TMs will review TPS data entries for all
courses under review to ensure parameters in TPS match the CTP. Also, review the CTP and
any applicable ATPs to ensure consistent and accurate information within the documents. If
course trains international students, ensure foreign disclosure memorandum is current for latest
course revision/change.

*Maltreatment (Physical)—Deleted.
*Maltreatment (Verbal)—Deleted.
*Student Man-Year—Manpower resource used to compensate for lost duty time due to training
(initial skills pipeline and PCS course students only). Refer to AETCI 38-202 for additional
information.
*Support Equipment—Equipment items that enhance training and provide indirect support of
training objectives.
*Training Equipment—Equipment items necessary to meet training objectives, usually items
students are being trained to use, maintain, or operate.
*A3.2. Step 1. Develop a CTP for new courses, major changes to existing courses, or when
transferring courses from one base to another. If parameters remain the same, the gaining TM
makes TPS changes, the losing TM discontinues the old course, and the gaining TM loads the
new parameters. Note: Use an abbreviated plan for minor changes to existing course impacting
resources and/or manpower requirements or when adding motivational training.
A3.4. Step 3. The TM assembles the CTP (including planned implementation date), coordinates
with all base agencies according to local established guidelines, and forwards to the TRG
resources chief. Note: TM ensures foreign disclosure completed and memorandum is included
in CTP if international students are to be trained. TMs should follow up with applicable
agencies as necessary to encourage timely response and to meet established CTP processing
timelines.

*EQUIPMENT RESOURCES AVAILABILITY DECISION LOGIC NARRATIVE
*Note: Use this narrative process to identify and locate equipment resources necessary to
conduct training. Training is not implemented until equipment requirements have been
resourced and the training plan has been certified.
*A4.1. TRS.
*A4.1.1. TM identifies equipment requirements on AETC Form 120.
*A4.1.2. TM forwards a copy of the AETC Form 120 to the equipment custodian to confirm
equipment is on-hand in TRS or identifies any shortages.
*A4.1.2.1. If the equipment is available in the TRS, the TM completes the CTP logistics annex.
*A4.1.2.2. If equipment is not available in the TRS, the TM contacts the TRSS POC to check on
equipment availability in the TRG or TRW.
*A4.2. TRG or TRW.
*A4.2.1. If the equipment is available in the TRG or TRW, the TRSS POC instructs the TM to
proceed with developing the equipment annex.
*A4.2.2. If the equipment is not available, the TM contacts the TPM (HQ AETC/SGU for
medical courses) to check AETC equipment availability, and courtesy-copies the TRSS POC.
HQ AETC/SGU queries other MAJCOMs and AETC bases for medical course equipment
requirements.
*A4.3. AETC.
*A4.3.1. If the equipment is available in AETC, the TPM notifies the TM, with courtesy copy to
the TRSS, providing supply information. The TM uses this information to develop the logistics
annex.
*A4.3.2. If the equipment is not available in AETC, the TPM solicits HQ Air Force Materiel
Command (AFMC) assistance.
*A4.4. AFMC.
*A4.4.1. If the equipment is available in AFMC, the TPM instructs the TM to develop the
logistics annex using this information.
*A4.4.2. If the equipment is not available in AFMC, the TPM will contact the AFCFM for
assistance.
*A4.5. AFCFM.
*A4.5.1. The AFCFM will query the major command (MAJCOM) functional managers for
equipment and/or funding requirements.
*A4.5.2. If the equipment and/or funding is available from another MAJCOM, the AFCFM
makes the equipment/funds available and notifies the TPM. The TPM notifies the TM to
develop the logistics annex with this information.
*A4.5.3. If the equipment and/or funding is not available, the AFCFM, TPM, HQ AETC/A3R,
and TM look for alternatives or workarounds. The AFCFM, TPM and HQ AETC/A3R will
coordinate the out-of-cycle funding training requests through AF/A1PT. Training is not
implemented until resourced or workarounds/alternatives are coordinated and the training plan
certified.
*A4.5.4. When equipment or funding becomes available, the TPM notifies the TM to develop
the logistics annex with this information. The TM develops the logistics annex, based on
requirements identified on AETC Form 120.

                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Training Data Systems. The technical training management system (TTMS) is a data
system used to track student progress through Air Force technical training courses. TTMS data
flows to the training planning system (TPS) and on to the personnel data system (PDS). TTMS
consists of many databases, two of which (student management database and course design and
development database) are critical to accurately report student data to those interfaced systems
(TPS and PDS). Course design parameters flow to the student management database and feed
other data systems. For this reason, data entered into the course design and development database
must accurately reflect course parameters. Career development courses (CDC) and specialized
courses (SC), and student records are managed in the course development, student
administration, and registrar system.
     1.1.1. TTMS and TPS. Where installed and operational, use TTMS and TPS for all
     unclassified training related functions, including course development and delivery, instructor
     and student management, resource management, and product evaluation. Enter all
     unclassified course information necessary to complete adequate student accounting when
     developing courses that include classified information in the TTMS course design and
     development database. TTMS and TPS automated products may be administratively edited
     for such formatting issues as line spacing, white space, and font size. Changes that affect
     course parameters are not permitted. Forms generated electronically by these systems may be
     used in lieu of prescribed forms (except AETC Form 150, Field Evaluation and Examination
     Answer Sheet [OCR], and AETC Form 1200, OMR Classroom Answer Sheet). Locally
     developed automated information systems will not duplicate functionality found in TTMS
     and TPS.
     1.1.2. ETCA. The education and training course announcements (ETCA) site,
     https://www.my.af.mil/etcacourses/, includes specific major command (MAJCOM)
     information for formal training courses conducted or managed by MAJCOMs and field
     operating agencies (FOA). The ETCA includes courses conducted or administered by the Air
     Force and reserve forces, and serves as a reference for the Air Force, DoD, other military
     services, government agencies, and security assistance programs. Course personnel use
     ETCA maintainer to maintain information displayed in ETCA. All technical training course
     announcements in ETCA will include the following note: NOTE: Ensure AETC/FMAM has
     coordinated on all AETC formal training course changes that affect courses added/deleted,
     course length/location changes, or excess baggage or travel directions (any change that has a
     potential financial impact).
        1.1.2.1. ETCA Maintainer. Training managers (TM) will maintain current, correct,
        updated course point of contact (POC) and general information on the ETCA Web site.
        TMs will use ETCA maintainer, the ETCA software user manual, and procedures on the
        ETCA Web site to initiate, maintain, and remove course announcements. Review and
        update course announcements annually, as required, during the annual review of
        technical training (ARTT). Whether or not announcement changes are required during the
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                   9


       ARTT, TMs will check the ―update‖ button so that the ―last changed‖ date will update.
       Note: HQ AETC/A3PZ requires the ―last changed‖ date as a quality review measure.
1.2. Training Requirements. The major training requirement areas are initial operation and
maintenance of new or changing systems; replacement personnel to operate, maintain, and
support existing systems; and personnel in various specialties to be trained for administrative,
management, and service functions. All nonprior service (NPS) enlisted personnel attend basic
military training (BMT) prior to entering specialty training. Required training includes basic
military knowledge, knowledge of principles in a scientific or technical area, and complex
operational and maintenance tasks. Specialty training includes initial, advanced, lateral,
supplemental, special, and field training. Note: The BMT Review Committee (if out of cycle,
HQ USAF/DPE) determines BMT training requirements. The 737 TRG commander approves the
curriculum design.
   1.2.1. AETC provides both initial skills and supplemental training, based on needs and
   requirements established by other agencies. Statements of training requirements identify how
   many people will be required, the fiscal year (FY) training will be required, what skill each
   person must possess, and when each person will be needed. AETC provides formal training
   using the most cost-effective instructional methods available without compromising quality
   or standardization of job performance.
       1.2.1.1. HQ USAF identifies the trained personnel requirements (TPR) each enlisted Air
       Force specialty (AFS) needs to maintain operational manning requirements. Air Staff
       provides AETC with the numbers of nonprior service (NPS), prior service (PS) and
       retrainee students, by FY, to meet the TPR. Similar information is identified for officer
       training. AETC also accommodates training requests from Air Force major commands
       (MAJCOM), ANG, AFRC, other U.S. military services, foreign military students, and
       other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
       1.2.1.2. AETC also receives training requests for non-initial skills training. Using
       agencies must submit their training requests annually to Air Staff. Air Force Form 898,
       Field Training Requirements Scheduling Document, is used to identify Type 4 training
       requirements (prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Volume1, Training Development, Delivery and
       Evaluation). Type 6 Distance Learning (DL) requirements are identified through annual
       screening (data call) initiated by Air Staff concurrently with the Mission Readiness
       Training Program (MRTP) screening.
       1.2.1.3. Together, the TPR and the above training requests make up total student training
       requirements for AETC initial skills and non-initial skills courses.
   1.2.2. TMs schedule training requirements in TPS. Program control documents (PCD) are
   developed as reports from TPS data. HQ AETC/A3P uses PCDs in response to established
   training requirements. These documents specify the required number of entries and graduates
   for all types of formal training, as well as class entry date schedules and sizes. PCDs also
   provide data needed to derive instructor and other training support requirements.
1.3. Course Implementation and Modification. Submit new or modified BMT training
requirements through MAJCOMs for BMT Triennial Review Committee approval. Out of cycle
requirements go through HQ AETC/A3T to HQ USAF/A1DL for approval.
 10                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


     1.3.1. Courses that must be restructured for the international community, and requirements
     for a new weapon system, new equipment or new personnel, drive new course
     implementation. Modifying an existing course, however, is the most common action.
     Classification changes, occupational survey reports (OSR), field evaluation questionnaire
     summaries (FEQS) and faculty and staff analyses result in existing course modifications.
         1.3.1.1. Where TTMS is installed and operational, use the course design and
         development database for all unclassified new courses and revisions, including those that
         are less than a 20 percent change. Include training standards (TS), course charts (CC),
         plans of instruction (POIs), lesson plans (LPs) to the teaching step level, and AETC Form
         120, Training Equipment List.
         1.3.1.2. When using the course design and development database to develop courses that
         include classified information, enter only unclassified block and course titles.
         1.3.1.3. When a course is revised, design and develop the entire course in the course
         design and development software and move to the student management database. The
         data in the course design and development database and the student management
         database must mirror each other, except minor changes (which must be added to the
         databases no later than the next major change).

Notes:
1. Excludes minor typographical or grammatical corrections, and minor plan of instruction
(POI), lesson plan (LP), study guide/workbook, or measurement device technical additions or
deletions.
2. A major revision (For Non Enlisted/Officer Initial Skills courses) is a 20 percent change
(including reductions) in course content and/or course length. Resequencing objectives or
blocks, without changing content, does not constitute a 20 percent revision.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     11


3. For EIS/OIS courses (AB, AL, AQ, OB, OL, OP, OQ in position 3 and 4 of the course
number) that require any changes to the course content and/or course length a new PDS code is
not required.
4. For EIS/OIS (AB, AL, AQ, OB, OL, OP, OQ in position 3 and 4 of the course number)
courses a ―new course‖ is defined as a change to the 5 digit enlisted or 4 digit officer AFSC
identifier within the course number, i.e. E3ABR2E231-00AA, E3OZR13M3-00MA
(EXAMPLE-New PDS code required when E3ABR2E231-XXXX changes to E3ABR3D031-
XXXX).
5. New PDS code is not required for EIS/OIS (AB, AL, AQ, OB, OL, OP, OQ in position 3 and
4 of the course number) course Major Revisions; positions 12-15 of course number will be
changed accordingly to identify course changes, typically position 15 incrementally to identify
revisions i.e. E3ABR3D031-00AA changes to E3ABR3D031-00AB.
   1.3.2. The decision to implement a new course or modify an existing one comes from a
   utilization and training workshop (U&TW), training planning team (TPT) or other directive
   conference, or service test or other types of feedback. See AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, Air Force
   Training Program Career Field Education and Training, for U&TW procedures. U&TWs
   are conducted to identify AFS education and training needs, to develop and review AFS
   training programs, and to develop the career field education and training plan (CFETP).
   TPTs and other conferences are convened to identify training requirements for courses not
   covered by a CFETP. Such conferences normally result in major changes to one or more
   courses that support an AFS. The Air Force career field manager (AFCFM) and the HQ
   AETC training staff officer (TPM) co-chair a U&TW, and the AETC TM hosts it. U&TWs
   normally include the career development course (CDC) writer, MAJCOM representatives,
   the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) resource manager (RM), the TM, training
   development element (TDE) representatives, a system program office representative (if
   appropriate), an AU/A4L representative, a training evaluation representative, an instructional
   technology representative, subject matter experts (SME), an Occupational Measurement
   Squadron representative, and a local manpower representative. They consider utilization
   patterns, the specialty training standard (STS) or the course training standard (CTS), the
   CFETP, existing training, and new or outdated technology to define a new or revised STS,
   CTS, or CFETP that would dictate the need for a new or modified course. The AETC TPM
   and TM will incorporate taskings and associated suspense dates in the U&TW minutes.
   1.3.3. Customer feedback (without a U&TW) may drive existing course modification, as
   long as STS/CTS requirements are met. To add or delete line items or to change knowledge
   or proficiency codes, AETC TMs will submit recommended changes to the AETC TPM who
   coordinates with and secures approval from the AFCFM. CTS/STS line items will not be
   changed without full coordination or U&TW action. Coordinate joint service course changes
   according to AFI 36-2230(I), Interservice Training. TMs maintain AFCFM coordination and
   proposed course change approval documentation.
   1.3.4. Once new or modified training standards (TS) are levied, or direction to develop or
   modify a course is established, the AETC TM manages training development and
   implementation, and identifies resources needed to bring training online. The AETC TM
   develops the course resource estimate (CRE) and/or course training plan (CTP), which
   includes start-up costs, base operating support (BOS), manpower, student man-years (SMY),
 12                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   class schedules, equipment, maintenance support, facilities, environmental impacts, course
   materials, and delivery media.
1.4. Formal Technical Training Course Types. The 15 types of formal training described in
paragraphs 1.4.1 through 1.4.15 are used singularly or in varying combinations to meet Air Force
training needs. For information on the course numbering system go to AETC/A3PV Technical
Training Policy COP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AE-
ED-00-79
Note: All types 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, A, C, W and M courses require a Training Standard, Course
Chart, Plan of Instruction (POI), Lesson Plans, Measurement Plan, and measurement devices.
   1.4.1. Type 1, Special Contract Training. One-time or limited nature; contracted with
   civilian industrial or educational institutions; includes commercial off-the-shelf courses;
   normally used to train selected personnel to operate and maintain new systems. Often
   personnel in training are initial cadre and AETC instructors who, upon completion of Type 1
   training, return to their technical training wing (TRW) or training group (TRG) to develop
   AETC courses. See AETCI 36-2219, Type 1 Training, for specific information.
   1.4.2. Type 2, AETC Special Training. Formal training of a one-time or limited (1 year or
   less) nature; conducted by AETC instructors at an Air Force base, other military location, or
   contractor's location; normally used to train personnel to operate and maintain new weapons
   or systems. Type 2 courses require all course control documents (POI, Lesson Plans, Course
   Chart, Course Training Standards, measurement plan, and measurement devices) and a Risk
   Management (RM) assessment (see paragraph 3.5.2.11.3.1). They do not require a CTP, do
   not earn manpower, and can be used to rapidly stand up a course when in-house resources are
   available.
   1.4.3. Type 3, Resident Regular Training. AFS-centered training of a continuing nature;
   conducted at an AETC base, location, or station. It includes courses designed for initial
   training, retraining from one AFS to another, training on special or new equipment and
   procedures, advancement within an AFS, and initial skill multiphased AFSC awarding
   courses.
   1.4.4. Type 4, Field Training:
       1.4.4.1. Technical training conducted at operational locations may be delivered by a field
       training detachment (FTD) or a field training team (FTT).
       1.4.4.2. The FTD mission is to qualify personnel on new equipment and in new
       techniques and procedures, increase personnel skill and knowledge, acquaint personnel
       with specific systems, keep personnel up to date on training concepts and requirements,
       and maintain individuals at given proficiency levels. An FTD may use the area concept to
       provide direct training support. This concept provides field training to more than one
       base, location or station using the capability of a single FTD.
       1.4.4.3. FTTs are teams of FTD instructors who conduct training at an operational base
       using that base‘s facilities. Mobile training sets may be used. Teams normally include
       trainers, training aids, and operational equipment designed for field use but used to
       support maintenance training.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     13


   1.4.5. Type 5, Training by Other U. S. Government Agencies (Excludes Interservice
   Training Review Organizations [ITRO]). Not consolidated, collocated or an executive
   agent; is conducted by an Army, Navy, Air Force agency or unit other than AETC, or other
   government agencies inside or outside of the Department of Defense (DoD).
   1.4.6. Type 6, DL. Formal training developed by a TRW, TRG, or a contractor; for export
   to students at bases of assignment; designed for students to learn without AETC course-
   qualified instructor on-site expertise. See AETCI 36-2208, Job Site Training, for specific DL
   information, and AETCI 36-2209, Development and Maintenance of Interactive Multimedia
   Instruction (IMI), and AFI 36-2201, Volume 4, Managing Advanced Distributed Learning
   (ADL), for information on interactive courseware development.
   1.4.7. Type 7, Mobile Training Team (MTT). AETC instructors from organizations that
   typically provide Types 2, 3 and 7 training, who conduct training at an operational base using
   that base‘s facilities. Mobile training sets may be used, and usually consist of trainers,
   training aids, and operational equipment designed for field use but used to support training.
   1.4.8. Type 8, ITRO. Consolidated course with the Air Force as lead service. Course
   faculty includes fair share instructor representation from participating services and the host
   service, and usually a mixture of service personnel who teach the course.
   1.4.9. Type 9, ITRO. Consolidated course with another service as lead. Course faculty
   includes fair share instructor representation from participating services and the host service,
   and usually a mixture of service personnel who teach the course.
   1.4.10. Type A. DoD executive agent course with the Air Force as lead.
   1.4.11. Type B. DoD executive agent course with other than the Air Force as lead. Air
   Force students attend these courses on a quota basis.
   1.4.12. Type C, ITRO. Air Force collocated – an Air Force course on another service
   installation.
   1.4.13. Type D, ITRO. Other service collocated – another service course on an Air Force
   installation.
   1.4.14. Type W, Wartime Training Course. Course focus is on different tasks and/or
   equipment trained for a wartime scenario; the wartime version of a course will have a
   different course number and require a separate build in the course design and development
   database. The wartime course must flow to the student management database no later than
   (NLT) 30 days prior to the initial class start date.
   1.4.15. Type M, Basic Military Training. Initial Air Force entry training The BMT
   mission is to transform civilian recruits into disciplined, dedicated, physically fit Airmen who
   have an expeditionary mind-set, foundational knowledge and skill in fundamental combat
   and mission related tasks required of all Airmen, and are committed to values required for
   success as Airmen warriors in the United States Air Force.
1.5. Specialty Training. Specialty training is a planned, but primarily informal, training
program designed to qualify officers and enlisted members to perform in an AFS through self-
study, formal and informal courses, and job proficiency training. See AFI 36-2201, Volume 1.
 14                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   1.5.1. Job Proficiency Training. Job proficiency training is informal training achieved
   while working in a duty assignment under the supervision of a qualified person. See AFI 36-
   2201, Volume 3.
   1.5.2. Career Knowledge Development. The specialty training program is based on the
   premise that trainees need certain knowledge to develop the versatility and flexibility
   required to transition from one kind of equipment or system to another. This knowledge is
   not related to specific equipment or systems, but to mastering principles and theory, and to
   developing fundamental understanding. Applying this knowledge to specific job assignment
   tasks develops job proficiency. For enlisted personnel, the key to career knowledge is
   carefully planned and developed technical training materials called CDCs.
   1.5.3. CDCs. In the Airman's specialty training process, CDCs provide the subject and task
   knowledge for a given AFS skill level. Additionally, CDCs may be used as study references
   in support of the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). As implied, airmen acquire
   the knowledge required for a particular AFS skill level through self-study of the relevant
   CDCs. After completing all CDC volumes, Airmen take a course examination (CE) that
   measures required knowledge comprehension. CDCs may be used as prerequisite material for
   other informal training. CDCs are required at the discretion of the AFCFM. The STS controls
   CDC content.
1.6. FTD Operation:
   1.6.1. FTDs provide Type 2, 3 and 4 training for host bases and MAJCOMs as described in
   AFI 36-2201, Volume 1.
   1.6.2. Each detachment or team is associated with particular weapon systems and support
   equipment. Teams qualify personnel on new equipment, techniques, and procedures;
   acquaint personnel with specific systems; and keep personnel informed of changing concepts
   and needs. FTDs offer instruction in aircraft, small missiles, avionics, armament, engines,
   accessories and other skills and tasks as requested by the host and approved by 982 TRG.
1.7. Community College of the Air Force. The Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)
is a multi-campus, federally chartered institution. CCAF confers the Associate of Applied
Science degree as part of Air University (AU), which is accredited through the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS/COC). CCAF was created
to meet Air Force enlisted personnel educational needs, including those of Air National Guard
members and Air Force Reserve Command Categories A and B enlisted members. It is the first,
and only, military agency with the authority to award associate degrees to enlisted members.
1.8. Instructional System Development:
   1.8.1. Comply with instructional system development (ISD) procedures and guidelines as
   outlined in AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development, and AFH 36-2235,
   Information for Designers of Instructional Systems. Use ISD to develop and revise all
   technical training and BMT instruction. Use the ISD process to ensure the most effective,
   high quality training development. HQ AETC/A3I provides guidance on applying ISD to
   technical training. Guidance is also available on advanced distance learning (ADL) and
   sharable content object reference model (SCORM) specifications and standards.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 15


     1.8.1.1. Training programs are designed to meet user requirements and maximize
     training resource use. To determine the most effective, cost-efficient method of
     instruction, conduct a front end analysis, including media and cost benefit analysis, in
     accordance with AFH 36-2235, AETCI 36-2208, and AETCI 36-2209. Consider various
     methods of training delivery, including IMI, distance learning, and technology insertions,
     during all course development projects and major revisions (see AETCI 36-2208 and
     AETCI 36-2209 for more information).
     1.8.1.2. Develop and deliver performance-based training as much as possible.
  1.8.2. Responsible organizations are as follows:
     1.8.2.1. HQ AETC/A3I establishes command ISD policy and procedures (See AFMAN
     36-2234 and AFH 36-2235).
     1.8.2.2. TRG, TRW and numbered air force (NAF) standardization and evaluation
     offices, in conjunction with the HQ AETC/IG, evaluate technical training and BMT
     compliance with ISD guidelines.
     1.8.2.3. TRG or designated level:
         1.8.2.3.1. Use ISD to develop and revise training.
         1.8.2.3.2. Determine the most cost-effective method to satisfy training requirements.
         Work with HQ AETC/A3T TPM to identify possible alternative training methods to
         satisfy unfunded training requirements.
         1.8.2.3.3. Develop a process to document important ISD application decisions,
         constraints and assumptions, to enable managers and future developers to reconstruct
         significant course design decision points. Use the course design and development
         database management plan (where TTMS is installed) to guide the course
         development process and meet customer need dates.

                                           Chapter 2

                         COURSE RESOURCE ESTIMATE (CRE)

2.1. CRE Description. A CRE is the initial vehicle used to seek training resource funding. It
includes resources required to initiate and sustain training through the future years defense
program (FYDP). See example, Attachment 2.
   2.1.1. TMs submit draft CREs to the command TPM as the first document in the course
   control document (CCD) chain. The CRE is an accurate estimate for, and foundation upon
   which to build, the CTP, but it is not in finite budget detail. A CRE is submitted prior to CTP
   submission. Refining resource requirements occurs as the CTP is finalized.
   2.1.2. A CTP should be developed while the CRE is in coordination. HQ AETC/A1MRT
   and A3RB process the CRE as a draft annex. Following manpower validation, HQ
   AETC/A1MRT and A3RB notify the TPM (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) that
   resources have been identified. If resources have been identified or are available from other
   sources, the TPM approves the CRE and requests a CTP from the TM.
   2.1.3. CRE development time is normally 30-90 days from the time the requirement is
   identified. Requesting agencies must submit a complete set of training requirements when
   requesting a CRE. Delays will increase CRE production time.
2.2. When To Develop a CRE. When an event results in course resource requirement changes,
HQ AETC/A3T tasks the TM to develop the CRE in order to begin resourcing requirements.
CREs generated for any other reason must first be coordinated with the TPM. The CRE could be
developed before the U&TW, once clear requirements are identified. It should present alternative
course design and delivery methodologies based on the known requirements and a media and
cost/benefit analysis. The CRE will be vetted through the U&TW process, and selected options
will be coordinated with HQ AETC. CRE coordination POCs normally include the local
manpower office (MO), HQ AETC/A3T, HQ AETC/A3R (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical
training), HQ AETC/A1MRT, and the AFCFM. HQ AETC A7CP is the AETC facility
requirements office of primary responsibility (OPR). Note: Submit a CRE only if additional
resources are required. TMs will develop CTPs according to guidance in Chapter 3, and forward
to the proper offices for approval and certification. Type 4 courses are resourced according to
AFI 65-601, Volume 1, and are not required to complete a CRE.
2.3. What To Include in the CRE. The CRE contains the following information NOTE:
When developing estimations for paragraphs 2.3.1 through 2.3.12, refer to Chapter 3:
   2.3.1. Reason to develop new training or change existing training, such as an approved
   change to Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD)/Air Force Enlisted
   Classification Directory (AFECD), or AFMAN 36-2109, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air
   Force and Senior Enlisted Advisor Programs; new mission; new systems and equipment;
   AFCFM/MAJCOM functional manager-driven requirements resulting in a CFETP change;
   U&TW; FEQS; OSR; other AETC course evaluations.
   2.3.2. Estimated classroom/lab (C/L) instructor hours, course length, shift group limit,
   programmed group size, minimum group size, maximum group size, expansion group size,
   washbacks, and total programmed entries changes.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     17


   2.3.3. MO-provided manpower requirement estimates, for instructors, maintenance
   personnel, training development personnel, training overhead support, BOS, and SMY for
   courses that earn manpower or have an SMY bill. An SMY annualizes an authorization
   dedicated to student coverage. SMY is a method to account for pipeline or PCS course lost
   duty time for students who are in formal school training, part of the Air Force end strength,
   and are not yet available for operational unit duty. SMY tracking is used to determine
   personnel pay, housing and support. To compute student man-years, multiply student entries
   by course length (in days), then divide by 246 (training days in a year). If calculating SMYs
   for ITRO courses, divide by 250. Coverage is applicable to nonprior service (AJ10), military
   training/BMT/OTS (AJ20), nonprior service follow-on (AJ30), officer accessions (AM10),
   prior service enlisted (AJ1K), Pararescue (PJ)/combat control (CCT) pipeline (A1LP),
   National Call to Service Initiative (AJ11), PJ officer (A2LP), and follow-on training/982
   TRG programs (AJ40). Coverage also applies to training requester quota identifier (TRQI)
   codes (other than those previously mentioned), beginning with "A" for students who attend a
   course of 100 days or more (does not apply to Type 7 courses).
   2.3.4. Estimate of training equipment, training spares, support equipment (test equipment
   and special tools), and contractor logistics support. Include as much information as possible,
   to include computer hardware and software requirements.
   2.3.5. Facility requirement estimates, including classroom and laboratory, housing,
   specialized space, and administrative space needs, as well as other known additional space
   and special needs such as electricity, floor loading, security, local area network server, proxy
   or cable run requirements, TEMPEST, air-conditioning, and door, ceiling, and hallway
   dimensions. See AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for additional information.
   2.3.6. Funding requirement estimates, including funds for media, instructional technology
   applications, training and support equipment, new facilities or current facility modifications,
   course/curriculum development or implementation manpower, course supplies, commercial
   publications, spares support, projected temporary duty (TDY) costs, depot level repairable
   (DLR) funding and contractor support (such as equipment maintenance). Address estimates
   for each fiscal year as well as FYDP sustainment.
   2.3.7. Estimate of any non-AETC support required. Information from system training plans,
   memoranda of agreement, and logistics support memoranda would provide required support.
   2.3.8. Estimate training standard impact.
   2.3.9. Estimate course chart impact.
   2.3.10. Course security classification and proposed instructional design.
   2.3.11. Any known environmental impacts and/or change to current environmental
   assessments.
   2.3.12. Media and cost/benefit analysis for new or changing instructional technology
   application requirements estimates (including IMI, Type 6 DL, or ITV).
Note: Information outlined in paragraphs 2.3.1 through 2.3.12 that impacts resources will be
included in a narrative and attached to the CRE summary.
2.4. Coordinating CREs. The TM or designated representative develops the CRE when tasked
by AETC/A3T (paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3), accomplishes local coordination, and forwards it to the
 18                                                      AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


TPM, HQ AETC/AIMRT (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) and HQ AETC/A3R for
review and approval, with a courtesy-copy to 2 AF/TTOC. Coordinate with wing civil engineer
if there are facility issues. Allow 30 days for HQ AETC coordination. Submit CTP to HQ AETC
once resources are obtained.
2.5. CRE Funding Flow:
   2.5.1. If the course can be funded within the TRW, the TM develops the CTP according to
   Chapter 3 and submits the documentation accordingly. If not, the TM forwards the CRE to
   the wing/group RM and info-copies 2 AF/TTOC. The RM confirms nonavailability of local
   support and forwards the CRE to the wing/group for approval. The TM emails the CRE to
   the TPM, HQ AETC/A3R (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) and HQ AETC/A1MRT.
   HQ AETC/A1MRT validates the manpower requirements, and HQ AETC/A3RB computes
   the remaining funding obligations and generates the CRE Part II. The CRE Part II includes
   headquarters-level computed costs (e.g., TDY-to-school, instructor and SMY, etc.) and
   displays the total resource bill for AFCFM review. The HQ AETC TPM (HQ AETC SGNU
   for medical courses) forwards the draft CRE to the AFCFM for resourcing.
   2.5.2. The AFCFM notifies the TPM (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) if MAJCOM
   functional manager funding is available. The TPM (TPM and HQ AETC/SGNU for medical
   courses) notifies the TM. If funding is not available, the AFCFM forwards the CRE to HQ
   AF/A1PT and HQ AF/A1MT for funding and priority consideration. The AFCFM contacts
   the TPM (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) concerning the status of the request. At
   minimum, the TPM will follow up with the AFCFM for a quarterly status check until the
   CRE is funded or the need date expires. The TPM will update the TM and 2 AF.
   2.5.3. If Air Staff approves funding, the AFCFM contacts the TPM (HQ AETC/SGNU for
   medical courses). The TPM (TPM and HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) instructs the
   TM to proceed with CTP development, and courtesy-copies HQ AETC/A1MRT, HQ
   AETC/A3R/ and 2 AF/TTOC. If funding is not available, the AFCFM, TPM, HQ
   AETC/A3R (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses), and TM initiate an out-of-cycle
   request, or look for workarounds until the CTP can be developed. A CTP will not be
   approved without workarounds/alternatives that satisfy the funding requirements.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     19


                                            Chapter 3

                              COURSE TRAINING PLAN(CTP)

3.1. Description. A CTP provides the overall foundation for planning, programming, and
implementing training within the training course parameters, such as facilities, equipment,
manpower, etc. based on the student training requirements for the year it is to be implemented.
The CTP contains the proposed course content outline and delineates the resources required to
conduct training. It is a refined and accurate statement of resources required to support a course.
Revisions are tracked in the course design and development database.
   3.1.1. If piggyback courses exist, ensure they are identified in the CTP narrative, and include
   their course numbers. Piggyback courses must be reflected on the mother course‘s CC and
   the manpower pricing record.
   3.1.2. To minimize CTP development time lag, TMs or designated representatives are
   encouraged to initiate and fill out pertinent CTP information simultaneously with CRE
   development.
   3.1.3. The CTP outlines actions necessary to bring training on line, including those relative
   to security, course documents, student scheduling, instructional materials, manpower and
   personnel, facilities, and equipment for minimum and maximum training capabilities. For
   information on developing official manpower documents, go to AFKN on the AF Portal,
   select the AF COP link, and then the manpower and personnel link.
3.2. When To Develop a CTP/Abbreviated Training Plan:
   3.2.1. Develop a CTP for new courses, and major course changes if changes affect course
   parameters or resources by a cumulative 20 percent or more (see Terms, Attachment 1).
   3.2.2. Develop an abbreviated training plan (ATP) for minor course changes if the changes
   do not affect resources; when finalizing a CC or manpower standard after completing course
   validation that does not significantly alter the course; when adding motivational training
   (MT); or when making changes to finalized courses. An ATP is not required if changes to a
   CC and manpower standard affect nothing except status from tentative to final. Notify the
   TRW/MO that there are no changes to the course chart or manpower standard. Type 6 and
   self-paced course length adjustments that are due to validation are considered minor and
   require only an ATP.
       3.2.2.1. The ATP includes a summary of changes and all updated annexes. AETC Form
       120 changes that affect actual training resources or support equipment will be submitted
       in an ATP. Stock number or equipment custodian changes, typographical or grammatical
       error corrections, nomenclature changes, on-hand quantity changes need not be submitted
       through an ATP. Incorporate those changes into the next ATP or CTP.
       3.2.2.2. TMs will provide an electronic CTP or ATP, if possible, to the local manpower
       office. Prior to submission to HQ AETC/A1MRT for processing, the TPM will ensure
       HQ AETC/A3I coordinates on all CTP and ATPs that involve interservice training,
       especially for ITRO consolidated courses.
 20                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   3.2.3. CTPs are required for all Type 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, C, M, and W courses (see Attachment
   12). Type 5, A, B, and D may require CTPs, under the following conditions:
       3.2.3.1. ITRO courses that consume SMYs (see paragraph 2.3.3.1.) but do not earn
       AETC instructors or affect other AETC resources must have CTPs that include a
       narrative and the SMY calculation sheet developed by the local MO. That calculation
       sheet will include C/L instructor hours, course length-manpower days, course length-
       manpower hours, shift group limit, programmed group size, minimum group size,
       maximum group size, expansion group size and any minimum manning or washbacks.
       Courses that fall into this category are usually taught at DoD schools and instructors are
       not provided by AETC.
       3.2.3.2. ITRO courses that earn AETC instructors but do not consume SMYs must have
       CTPs with a manpower annex.
       3.2.3.3. CTPs are not required for Type 5 courses that do not consume SMYs or AETC
       instructors, or affect AETC resources. However, a course that did not initially earn
       AETC instructors or impact AETC resources may develop an instructor impact after the
       student number reaches a certain level. When that happens, AETC manpower receives an
       instructor bill from the host service. Manpower will then notify the TPM (HQ
       AETC/SGNU for medical courses) and the TRW/MO that a CTP is required, and the
       TPM will notify the TM. TRGs have 30 working days from the date notified to submit
       the Type 5 CTP. Manpower will not pay the bill until the CTP is submitted, validated,
       and certified. Note: Anytime there is a specific manpower requirement, such as specific
       grade or AFSC, identified in a memorandum of agreement (MOA) or a memorandum of
       understanding (MOU), include the MOA or MOU as part of the CTP.
       3.2.3.4. An ITRO course that earns AETC instructors, consumes SMYs, and/or impacts
       AETC resources requires complete manpower annexes with appropriate documentation,
       according to AETCI 38-202, Education and Technical Training Manpower.
       3.2.3.5. A CTP is also required when a course transfers from one base to another. If
       parameters remain the same, the TM makes the changes in TPS, the losing TM
       discontinues the old course, and the gaining TM loads the new parameters.
       3.2.3.6. The BMT CTP does not require a manpower annex. Manpower requirements are
       earned by an Air Force manpower standard (AFMS).
   3.2.4. TMs should not delay the development process over lack of an approved TS. Use a
   tentative TS in the original plan and update it later with the approved TS. Refer to
   Attachment 3, development and approval flow chart; Attachment 4, equipment resources
   flow chart; and Attachment 5, manpower resources process, when developing CTPs.
3.3. Coordination. When necessary resource support cannot be resolved at the TRW,
coordinate annexes according to Attachment 3, Attachment 4, and Attachment 5. Applicable
CTS proficiency levels will be slashed (/) until programmed resources are available. BMT will
not postpone new CTS implementation while waiting for programmed resource requirements.
3.4. CTP Approval, Certification, and Activation:
   3.4.1. The TRG commander or designated representative approves the CTP after the
   applicable wing or group agencies have reviewed and approved all annexes. Approval
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 21


   signifies that all applicable local agencies have reviewed and approved their respective
   portions of the CTP, and that resources required to support the planned implementation date
   have been identified. Note: Training plans containing the use of MT must be routed through
   the TRW/CC and 2 AF/CC prior to sending to AETC/A3T for certification by HQ
   AETC/A2/3/10.
   3.4.2. HQ AETC/A3T/A3R/A3Z/ as applicable is the final training plan certification
   authority except for training plans that include the use of MT, and 982 TRG type 4 training
   courses. HQ AETC certification signifies system support is available for the planned
   implementation date and the CTP complies with all applicable policy. Prior to certification,
   complete the following coordination as applicable; AFPC reviews for officer initial skills
   course impact, HQ AETC/A1MRT validates manpower requirements, HQ AETC/A3RB or
   HQ AETC/SGU (for medical courses or line courses requiring medical support) validates all
   resource issues, and 2 AF/TTOC reviews the training plan for impact to the accession plan
   (enlisted initial skills courses) and class programming. Courses will not be implemented
   until the training plan has been approved and certified.
   3.4.3. AETC/A1MRT will activate courses in TPS after AETC/A3T certifies the CTP.
   3.4.4. Each December, the TM will prepare a package revalidating the applicable
   motivational training plan annex. The annex will include the motivational training worksheet
   developed by the TDE, identifying each unit for which this training is appropriate; approved
   methods; rationale for implementation; and information regarding when and why it will be
   used. The TM will submit the package for TRG and TRW review and approval, and to 2
   AF/TTOC for final endorsement. The TM will send a copy of the annual review and
   approved package to AETC/A3T.
Note: The course must be moved from the TTMS course design and development phase to
student management prior to activation in TPS.
3.5. Format and Content:
   3.5.1. The CTP generally includes an administrative section, narrative, annexes, and
   appendices that justify and support resource requirements and detail plan schedules. Use the
   CTP format in TTMS where course design and development database is installed. Include
   only annexes applicable to the course being created or revised. Where the course design and
   development database is not available, use a locally-established format. A course design and
   development database management plan (CDDDMP) and MAJCOM and host-agency
   coordinated CCDs satisfy 982 TRG Type 4 CTP requirements. The MAJCOM and host-
   agency coordinated CCDs and the applicable STS/CTS, RM annex, CC, POI and an
   approved CTP with manpower annex verified by 82 TRW/MO satisfy 982 TRG Type 3 CTP
   requirements. The following is a guideline:
      3.5.1.1. Narrative. Provides an overview of information in the annexes and appendices.
      It describes planned course rationale, assumptions, and conditions.
      3.5.1.2. Course Data. Include the following information:
          3.5.1.2.1. Reason for developing the training plan, such as a U&TW or FEQS, AFS
          change, or MAJCOM feedback. Include the planned training implementation date.
22                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


        3.5.1.2.2. A brief description of the subject matter, equipment, or system for which
        training will be provided.
        3.5.1.2.3. Course instructional design, as shown on the CC.
        3.5.1.2.4. Course security classification. Include instructional material classification
        and control, if appropriate, and the point in the course at which trainees will require
        security clearance, if required. Note: Course classification will equal the highest
        classification of material or information disseminated to the students.
     3.5.1.3. Course Control Documents:
        3.5.1.3.1. TS. Provide a brief summary of major STS and/or CTS changes that affect
        resources, and current development status (straw man, tentative, final, etc.). If
        resource constraints prevent complete STS or CTS implementation, describe
        constraints and interim and long term action(s) to correct deficiencies. Include
        workarounds and a projected STS or CTS full implementation date. BMT will not
        postpone new CTS implementation while waiting for programmed resource
        requirements. Specific CTS line items are identified with a slash (/) until programmed
        resources are available.
        3.5.1.3.2. Course Chart. Briefly summarize major CC changes that affect resources
        and describe the CC development status. If applicable, summarize the impact on
        Type 3 enlisted and officer initial skill-awarding course wartime course parameters.
        The 982 TRG uses combined CC/TS for Type 4 training courses. For 982 TRG Type
        3 courses, use a CC and STS or CTS.
     3.5.1.4. Total Programmed Entries and Scheduling Constraints. Specify total
     programmed entries for the FY when the course will be implemented, and briefly
     describe class or student scheduling constraints, such as group sizes or minimum interval.
     Use TRQI requirements, including NPS student programmed attrition, as the total
     programmed entries baseline. If international students will be trained, describe what has
     been done to accommodate them (such as foreign disclosure and other computer access
     authorization processes).
     3.5.1.5. Manpower Authorization and Personnel Specifications:
        3.5.1.5.1. Manpower Authorizations. Include the course evaluation data sheet
        (CEDS), which is a brief narrative on manpower required to support, develop, and
        conduct the course (See AETCI 38-202 for the manpower annex process and
        preparation information.). It summarizes manpower annex data, and provides the
        manpower rationale. Work manpower authorizations with local MO and training
        squadron (TRS) resources, as applicable, to ensure availability. Consider SMYs when
        addressing all initial skill courses and all courses that are 100 academic days or
        longer. Technical training group overhead position manpower (such as TMs, training
        developers, training resources, and training evaluators) is based on HQ
        AETC/A1MRT application of the manpower standards, normally applied every 2
        years. HQ AETC/A3T or 2 AF/TTOC may request standards be applied sooner,
        coordinating with HQ AETC/A1M. However, there may be instances when
        manpower authorizations needed support the subsequent increase will be unavailable.
        If that occurs, funded authorizations will be allocated based on current training issue
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 23


        criticality across the groups. Remaining shortfalls will be reviewed for possible
        inclusion in the program objective memorandum (POM).
        3.5.1.5.2. Personnel Specifications. Specify and explain any factors that affect
        personnel selection, such as field experience, security clearances, educational
        requirements, special experience identifiers (SEI), previous training, and physical
        requirements.
     3.5.1.6. Facilities:
        3.5.1.6.1. Training Facilities. Indicate if existing facilities satisfy the training
        requirement. Conversely, indicate when additional training space or modification to
        existing facilities is required. Address cross-utilization of training facilities.
        3.5.1.6.2. Support Facilities. If additional facilities are required, summarize
        requirements. If additional maintenance or student BOS are not required, state that.
     3.5.1.7. Logistics:
        3.5.1.7.1. Summarize actions taken to establish authorizations for equipment required
        to implement and support the course. State whether logistics resources are adequate to
        support the course. Include existing spares, repair parts, support equipment, training
        spares, special or modified tools, maintenance skills and maintenance technical data
        (see logistics annex). If logistics resources are not available, summarize the need and
        how the resources will be acquired. Provide details in the logistics annex. Address
        equipment cross-utilization, and identify equipment utilization agreements for non-
        AETC equipment. Address in the MOA other MAJCOM equipment used.. Use the
        TTMS course design and development database-generated equipment list, or an
        AETC Form 120, Training Equipment List. See Attachment 6 for instructions on
        completing the AETC Form 120. Note: The 982 TRG will use the AETC Form 120A,
        Field Training Equipment List.
        3.5.1.7.2. If applicable, specify exceptions to the established configuration control
        policy, such as modifications needed or not needed.
     3.5.1.8. Instructional Materials. Includes a summary of materials required to support
     the training course.
        3.5.1.8.1. State requirements for such training support data as research, development,
        test, and evaluation manuals; contractor in-house training documents; contractor-
        prepared courses and software; manufacturer's handbooks; preliminary operating and

     3.5.1.9. Comptroller:
24                                                      AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


        3.5.1.9.1. Summarize cost rationale for course instructional design or selected
        medium. TM requests an ITU media and cost/benefit analyses. For course changes,
        show proposed design or medium cost estimate compared to the existing design or
        medium. Use the comparison to determine the most cost-effective and efficient means
        to present information to the students. Include cost comparison for various methods
        of instruction. See paragraph 3.5.2.5. At minimum, consider changes in course length,
        instructor or overhead personnel requirements, facility or space requirements,
        operation and maintenance (O&M) funds use changes, and, if applicable,
        instructional method or design required medium cost changes.
        3.5.1.9.2. Summarize additional procurement appropriation funds required for base-
        funded investment equipment items (573080) (stand-alone items or systems valued at
        $250,000 or more), and O&M appropriation funds (573400). Identify initial and
        phased (quarterly) TDY, contractual services, supplies, and equipment requirements
        by element of expense investment code (EEIC). If alteration or construction funds are
        required, include relative information in this section of the CTP, indicating action
        taken. Reference the FY operating budget in which the funding requirements have
        been or will be included.
        3.5.1.9.3. Comptroller may forward information to HQ AETC/A3RB for inclusion in
        the FYDP execution plan or POM.
     3.5.1.10. Environmental Impact. Environmental impact analysis (EIA) is required for
     new training and proposed course changes that would affect average daily student load,
     number of permanent party personnel, chemical processes or chemical materials, or
     facility additions/construction. AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact
     Analysis, initiates the EIA process, as required by 32 CFR 989, The Environmental
     Impact Analysis Process. An EIA must result in one of the following:
        3.5.1.10.1. AF IMT 813 signed by the chief of the environmental flight indicating the
        proposed action qualifies for a categorical exclusion (CATEX).
        3.5.1.10.2. A finding of no significant impact supporting an environmental
        assessment signed by the chairperson of the appropriate environmental protection
        committee.
        3.5.1.10.3. A record of decision (ROD) supporting an environmental impact
        statement signed by SAF/IE/IEI. To ensure compliance with the National
        Environmental Policy Act, when an EIA is required/conducted, the training plan must
        include a signed CATEX determination, finding of no significant impact, or ROD,
        and AF IMT 813.
     3.5.1.11. Interservice Training. Follow actions required by AFI 36-2230(I). The base
     MO must determine if a proposed or changed interservice course is a DoD, consolidated,
     collocated or quota course, Type 8, 9, A, B, or C. Indicate whether an existing other
     service course will or will not meet Air Force requirements.
     3.5.1.12. Motivational Training. Summarize how motivational training will be used to
     achieve course objectives. Explain why motivational training is necessary and what
     controls are in place to ensure it is properly applied.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                  25


  3.5.2. The training plan development and approval process is described in Attachment 3. See
  Attachment 4 for equipment resources process information, and Attachment 5 for manpower
  resources information. Annexes are critical to training plan development. They provide
  detailed documentation of resource requirements identified in the narrative. Separate unique,
  voluminous, or classified materials from the training plan body and place in annexes.
  Normally, the subject/area authority approves or concurs by signing on that annex. A
  complex annex may be divided into appendices. The following annexes should be included,
  as required:
     3.5.2.1. Course Control Documents. This annex contains the TS and CCs. Include a
     copy of the approved STS or CTS, when available. When there is no approved standard,
     use the tentative STS or CTS. (Note: When the TS is part of a CFETP, only the TS must
     be included.) Also include a copy of the CC, or the tentative CC(s) if necessary.
     3.5.2.2. Manpower Annex. For information on multiple instructor requirements (MIR),
     MIR justification, the manpower annex, the CTP manpower requirements, and AETC
     Form 896, Lockstep/Multitrack Course Evaluation Data, refer to AETCI 38-202. The
     TRW/MO develops and furnishes the manpower data for inclusion in the manpower
     annex. The manpower annex consists of the course manpower standard data and pricing
     record, CEDS, annotated basic authorization (BA) (for nonstandard BA), washback
     calculation sheet/reports (if needed), AETC Form 896, Lockstep/Multitrack Course
     Evaluation Data, (if applicable), and MIR worksheet including MIR justification (if
     needed). MIR requirements will be based on equipment, safety, supervision, and related
     factors determined during the task analysis and validation of the course. Include
     complete minimum manning requirement (MMR) justification in the CEDS. The MO
     and school commander or representative (usually the TM) signs the course priceout. The
     course priceout includes a justification section to document offset use requests from other
     courses or sources, courses being replaced, and BA actions desired. This section is also
     the area to summarize course overall manpower impact. Manpower annex development
     requires cooperation between the MO and TM, with the TM providing new course
     parameter data. Manpower studies and/or data validation may be necessary for an
     accurate determination of necessary manpower resources. Note: See Attachment 5 for
     more information. The BMT CTP is certified without the standard manpower annex.
     BMT manpower authorizations are based on a separate manpower standard (AFMS
     3660XX, Basic Military Training Squadron), coordinated with 37 TRW/MO.
     3.5.2.3. Facilities Annex. Address the following areas, as appropriate:
         3.5.2.3.1. Current facilities.
         3.5.2.3.2. Classroom numbers and sizes.
         3.5.2.3.3. Laboratory numbers and sizes.
         3.5.2.3.4. Enlisted, officer, or civilian housing availability and quantity.
         3.5.2.3.5. Specialized space: Number and size of rooms.
         3.5.2.3.6. Administrative space: Number and size of rooms.
         3.5.2.3.7. Maintenance space.
         3.5.2.3.8. Other support facilities.
26                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


        3.5.2.3.9. Additional space and other special needs (i.e., electricity, floor loading,
        security, IMI, local area network [LAN] servers and proxies and cable runs [overhead
        or wall space], TEMPEST, air-conditioning, and door, ceiling, and hallway
        dimensions).
        3.5.2.3.10. Actions taken to provide additional space requirements.
        3.5.2.3.11. Work to be performed by the base civil engineer, identified on AF IMT
        332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request.
        3.5.2.3.12. O&M projects for existing facilities modification.
        3.5.2.3.13. New construction required.
     3.5.2.4. Logistics Annex. Include training and support equipment, logistics support, and
     communications-computer systems requirements. TMs look for equipment first within
     the squadron, then the TRG and TRW. Consider sharing equipment with other courses or
     using multiple shifts. If equipment is not available on base, the TM should request
     funding via normal wing channels. If time permits, include unfunded requirements in the
     financial plan or budget execution report. Each appendix will be approved by the TRW
     office of collateral responsibility (OCR) that provides related logistics support. Use the
     following appendices to group annex data. Note: Refer to Attachment 4.
        3.5.2.4.1. Appendix 1, Training and Support Equipment. Document training and
        support equipment requirements on AETC Form 120 and include the form in the
        appendix. The completed form is an essential resourcing prerequisite for an initial
        CTP approval/certification. However, once a CTP is certified and outside the CTP
        context, the AETC Form 120 is a living document, subject to minor changes and
        updates to maintain congruence with AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. Include
        non-AETC owned equipment (except 982 TRG). Identify each shortage and describe
        actions to correct the shortage. Include all estimated delivery dates. Refer to AFMAN
        23-110, Volume 2, and the TTMS course design and development database (where
        installed) for instructions on completing AETC Form 120. (Note: For grounded
        instructional aircraft, follow AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming,
        Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination, guidance.) Include all items
        necessary to conduct the course if relocated.
        3.5.2.4.2. Appendix 2, Logistics Support Requirements. Include prime
        maintenance center, authorized spaces, maintenance personnel training requirements,
        technical publications requirements, equipment spares, contract maintenance
        requirements, and any other pertinent logistics support information.
        3.5.2.4.3. Appendix        3,      Communications-Computer               Systems
        Requirements. Describe requirements and actions taken to acquire course automatic
        data communications requirements.
        3.5.2.4.4. Appendix 4, Non-AETC Logistics Support Requirements. Describe
        logistics support required from other sources. Include copies of support agreements,
        MOAs, MOUs and letters that identify what agencies recognize and intend to provide.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                  27


     3.5.2.5. Comptroller Annex. Describe course comptroller support. Include the
     appropriate budget information to enable equipment, spares support, TDY, instructional
     technologies funding.
     3.5.2.6. Security Annex. Provides for control of classified information used in a course.
     3.5.2.7. Interservice Training Review Annex. Describe in detail or attach an
     interservice support agreement, MOU, or MOA, as prescribed by AFI 36-2230(I).
     3.5.2.8. Environmental Assessment Annex. EIA is required for new training or
     proposed course changes that would affect average daily student load, number of
     permanent party personnel, chemical processes or chemical materials, facility additions,
     or new construction. See paragraph 3.5.1.10 for additional information.
     3.5.2.9. Safety Annex. The wing safety office or equivalent (SE) will review and
     coordinate on the Safety Annex. SE will certify MIRs that have been mandated as a risk
     control measure to prevent injury to personnel. Include in this annex a memorandum
     signed by the Chief of Safety or Ground Safety Manager citing applicable safety
     concerns or Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards IAW AETCI
     38-202.
     3.5.2.10. Motivational Training Annex. If motivational training is included in the
     course, procedures must be approved in an annex to the CTP or ATP. The TM will
     summarize how it will be used to achieve course objectives. Explain why motivational
     training is necessary and what controls are in place to ensure it is properly applied.
     Motivational training procedures are only authorized as reflected in this training plan and
     will be reviewed/approved annually by the applicable group, wing, and numbered Air
     Force directors of operations.
     3.5.2.11. Risk Management (RM) Annex. All courses will conduct a formal RM
     assessment for each applicable activity as described in AFPAM 90-902, Risk
     Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools, using the format in attachment 16. Emphasis
     should be placed on known high risk courses as determined by the commander and
     his/her staff. The RM assessment should focus on real or potential conditions that may
     cause mission degradation, injury, illness, death to personnel, or damage/loss of
     equipment or property associated with training activities. Include the RM assessment as
     an annex to the training plan according to the level of specificity outlined in attachment
     16. Battlefield Airmen courses (AFSCs 1C2X1, 1C4X1, 1T2X1, 1W0X2, 13DX, 13LX)
     will use the format at Attachment 16. Include in this annex a memorandum signed by the
     Chief of Safety or Ground Safety Manager citing applicable safety concerns.
        3.5.2.11.1. Type 6 courses are exempt. Exception: If/When courses are conducted
        by a trainer at the receiving unit, an RM assessment is required. In this case the
        assessment must be included as an annex to the CTP/ATP.
        3.5.2.11.2. Sister Service/Other Agency courses are exempt. Note: Review AFI 36-
        2230, Interservice Training, applicable contract, support agreements and MOUs for:
        Types 1, 5, 9, and Type B. If/When unclear whether an RM assessment is required,
        contact AETC/A3PV.
 28                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


          3.5.2.11.3. If the RM assessment identifies no risk/hazards, document an MFR
          stating an assessment was completed and no risks were identified. The MFR must be
          signed by Wing Safety and the Squadron Commander (for GSUs, host base safety
          office applicable).
              3.5.2.11.3.1. For courses requiring training plans, insert the MFR into the RM
              annex. Note: Assessment table/form may be signed by Squadron Commander
              and Wing Safety and take the place of the MFR. For courses not requiring
              training plans; e.g., Type 2, file the signed MFR/assessment table/form in the
              course record set. For courses with Technical Order (TO) based activities, T.O.
              safety and risk management processes should be referenced in the MFR/or RM
              annex as part of the RM assessment; however, a complete RM assessment is still
              required.
              3.5.2.11.3.2. ATP processing solely for the RM Annex will not require
              coordination with HQ AETC/A3R or the local manpower office as long as no
              additional manpower or resources are required and course parameters are not
              changed. Submit ATP from the TRG/CC to AETC/A3T.
3.6. Course Data Requirements. This section establishes responsibility and provides guidance
for assigning AETC technical training course parameters, identifiers and titles.
   3.6.1. TMs will log into the TPS to establish course numbers and a PDS code. See Table 1.1
   to determine when a new PDS code is required. Refer to the online (Air Force Portal) TPS
   software user‘s manual (SUM) under Access Control – Training Manager, and Education,
   and Training Course Announcements (ETCA). The request automatically flows to
   AETC/A3P for approval and new course number and PDS code assignment. When officers
   and enlisted personnel attend a course (piggyback course), separate course numbers and
   course builds are required to ensure accurate student tracking and accounting. TMs will
   update ETCA accordingly.
   3.6.2. Ensure student resourcing includes computation of SMYs, if required. For more
   information on SMYs, see paragraph 2.3.3.
   3.6.3. Personnel will use the ―workflow‖ function under the "maintain course" menu in TPS
   to ensure the next level of coordination is aware of impending action. Using workflow, TMs
   route completed course parameter information (previously the AETC Form 179) to the local
   TRW/MO by setting the course status to "awaiting coordination." If the action is to
   discontinue or delete a course, or to submit a CTP, the TRW/MO coordinates on the request
   by setting the course status to "awaiting certification." HQ AETC/A1MRT or 2 AF/TTOC
   will continue the action depending on the request. Note: See Attachment 5.
3.7. Steps To Bring a New Course Online or Convert to a New Course Number:
   3.7.1. Request course number in TPS. If the new course is replacing an existing course, mark
   the course for auto conversion in TPS. Auto conversion will automatically generate a
   discontinuation date for the course being replaced, and further course discontinuation action
   will not be required.
   3.7.2. The TM in conjunction with the TDE will build the course in the TTMS course design
   and development database. The TM will ensure the CC meets all established criteria.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                  29


   3.7.3. The TM is responsible for coordinating CTP or ATP.
   3.7.4. The TM moves the course from the TTMS course design and development database to
   the TTMS student management database (30 calendar days or more before course start date
   in TTMS and equal to the start date in TPS for major changes that affect the course number
   or PDS code).Before moving a course from the design and development database to the
   student management database, delete student status history from classes that will be
   converted to the new/revised course.. Carefully plan and time the move of a new or revised
   course from the course design and development database to the student management
   database. Pay specific attention to the fact that the course design and development database
   start date (minimum 30 calendar days from the move) will become the revision date, before
   which TTMS will not allow class start dates. If HQ AETC disapproves the CTP (or delays
   approval for an extended period), or the course fails to materialize, the TM will deactivate
   and/or delete the course from the student management database. Users must manually check
   to ensure information is correct and prevent conflicts with other systems. See Attachment 15
   and the course design and development handbook on the TTMS web site for specific
   information required for course transfer to student administration.
   3.7.5. The TM sends the AETC Form 179A, Course Training Schedule for Allocations, to
   the appropriate 2 AF/TTOC program manager to request he or she implement the course, a
   new course be activated or an existing course be converted to the revised course. In addition
   to the request for course conversion and the effective date, the AETC Form 179A will
   include the course revision date in the TTMS student management database, and
   confirmation that the newly revised course is active. Classes cannot be conducted before the
   approved CTP implementation date (not applicable to Type 4 courses).
      3.7.5.1. The TM inputs Type 2 course parameters into TPS, builds the course in the
      TTMS course design and development database, flows the course to the TTMS student
      administration database, and emails the TPM. A training plan is not required. The TPM
      will establish a discontinuation date (no longer than 1 year), notify the 2 AF TTOC
      Program manager to input the discontinuation date into TPS, coordinate with HQ
      AETC/A3R, and email to 2AF to request activation. 2AF will forward request to HQ
      A1MRT. HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the course based on TPM coordinated email.
      3.7.5.2. When a new course is activated online, the TM notifies customers/course users
      and solicits their training requirements.
3.8. Steps To Flow A Course Within 30 Calendar Days of Class Start Date:
   3.8.1. When 2 AF/TTOC implements a new course or course conversion in TTMS, the
   TTMS student management database forces a conversion date a minimum of 30 calendar
   days from implementation. For those isolated but urgent cases when TMs must start or
   convert a course earlier than 30 calendar days, the TM will email AETC/A3P, with a
   courtesy copy to the TRG/CC, to justify and request approval to implement the course at the
   higher urgency level. Because 2 AF/TTOC does not control the 30 day constraint, a waiver is
   required to adjust a course revision date, allowing center-generated classes following course
   conversion implementation (not applicable to Type 4 courses).
   3.8.2. HQ AETC/A3PZ is the waiver approval authority to move courses within the 30-day
   window (not applicable to Type 4 courses).
 30                                                      AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   3.8.3. HQ AETC/A3PZ or a designee notifies the HQ AETC/A5RI TTMS program
   management office (PMO) when a move is approved (not applicable to Type 4 courses).
   3.8.4. HQ AETC/A5RI instructs the TTMS central customer support and local customer
   support to proceed with the move. Note: Local customer support will take direction only
   from HQ AETC/A5RI, the TTMS PMO, or the TTMS central customer support (does not
   apply to Type 4 courses).
3.9. Course Cancellation/Discontinuation. Initiate course cancellation or discontinuation
requests using AETC Form 1, Course Cancellation/Discontinuation. HQ AETC/A3T (HQ
AETC/SGU for medical courses) is the final approval authority. The decision to not implement
a course that has been developed will be considered a cancelled course, requiring HQ
AETC/A3T approval. After HQ AETC/A3T final disposition, the TPM informs the AFCFM and
distributes the completed discontinuation form to the TM, 2 AF/TTOC, HQ AETC/A3R, HQ
AETC/A3TI (ITRO courses only), FMAT, Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT),
and HQ AETC/A1MRT. TMs update ETCA and TTMS accordingly (course cancelation
procedures do not apply to Type 4 courses).
3.10. Responsibilities:
   3.10.1. TRG commanders approve CTPs.
   3.10.2. HQ AETC/A3Tcertifies CTPs, and coordinates changes to courses, course numbers
   and training course data files through Air Force and HQ AETC staff agencies.
   3.10.3. HQ AETC/A3P assigns and maintains, according to TPS, all formal technical
   training course identifiers and PDS codes.
   3.10.4. HQ AETC/A1MR validates the CTP manpower annex, notifies the TPM (HQ
   AETC/SGNU for medical courses) when the pricing record has been validated and informs
   them of the affect on manpower.
   3.10.5. HQ AETC/A3RB reviews for impact and makes a concur/nonconcur
   recommendation to TPM and HQ AETC/A1MRT. A course will not be activated without
   A3RB coordination.
   3.10.6. 2 AF/TTOC develops CTPs and implementation schedules for standardized faculty
   development courses.
   3.10.7. TRG or its designated level prepares training plans and annexes, and maintains an
   electronic or paper-based CTP record set; ensures documents are reviewed and coordinated
   in a timely manner; and .ensures the following process and procedures are followed when
   courses transfer from one TRW or TRG to another:
       3.10.7.1. Obtain the required equipment, training standard, CC, POI and/or syllabus,
       lesson plans, tests, and training materials from the losing site.
       3.10.7.2. Use the TTMS course design and development database (where available) to
       make all TS, CC, and POI changes, according to provisions and exceptions described in
       paragraph 1.1.1. Pen-and-ink changes are allowed to correct administrative errors if
       changes do not affect course resources or content. Input pen-and-ink changes into the
       course design and development database; (such changes do not need to flow to the TTMS
       student management database until the next revision).
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     31


      3.10.7.3. Ensure a current AF Form 813 is on file.
      3.10.7.4. Once HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the course, the TM uses AETC Form 179A
      to notify 2 AF/TTOC when the course is ready to convert. Use TPS to prepare class
      schedules and validate and distribute allocations. The first class start date will be 30 days
      after the conversion date (does not apply to a new course that does not replace an existing
      course).
      3.10.7.5. Follow AETCI 36-2203 procedures and processes to develop, coordinate, and
      approve CTPs and related course management documents (applicable to new or
      transferred courses with resource impacts).
3.11. Timely Submission of CTPs/Annexes:
   3.11.1. Begin developing CTP at least 90 calendar days before the class start date to allow
   time to complete processing, approval, certification and implementation of CTPs (30 days for
   finalization/local processing begins when U&TW determines a training plan is required; 30
   days for HQ AETC validation and certification; and 30 days for course schedule conversion,
   required by PDS).
   3.11.2. CTPs should arrive simultaneously at HQ AETC/A3T and HQ AETC/A1MRT (HQ
   AETC/SGNU for medical courses): The local MO provides CTPs at least60 days before a
   course start date.
   3.11.3. After HQ AETC/A3T certification, HQ AETC/A1MRT activates or modifies courses
   in TPS.
   3.11.4. If CTPs (new or abbreviated) will be included in the next pricing cycle, submit drafts
   to HQ AETC/A1MRT and HQ AETC/A3R at least 60 calendar days before pricing. TRWs
   will be notified of pricing dates at least 90 days before the pricing event.
   3.11.5. If a CTP or annex misses the pricing deadline, the base MO must use the latest
   pricing official entries to reprice the course and resubmit to HQ AETC/A1MRT.

                                           Chapter 4

                    CAREER FIELD TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

4.1. Conducting Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW):
   4.1.1. Use the U&TW process to develop and review AFS or civilian occupational series
   training programs.. The U&TW process exists to develop the architecture for effective life-
   cycle training, which is provided at appropriate points throughout a career path and helps
   ensure that personnel are properly employed. Review AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, for specific
   guidance on U&TW workshops. U&TW checklist use is mandatory. Note: The cryptologic
   and TEMPEST fields incorporate U&TW functions in cryptologic training advisory groups
   and job educational training standards. The BMT triennial review committee reviews Air
   Force BMT graduate performance, military training, military studies, initial enlisted entry
   training, curriculum course training standards, and other special interest item requirements. It
   recommends requirements for a new or revised CTS based on internal or external training
   evaluation and feedback.
   4.1.2. U&TWs may be convened to resolve training or personnel utilization issues.
       4.1.2.1. To prepare for U&TWs TMs and participants review applicable data, such as
       AFS classification, OSRs, AFI 36-2201, Volume 5; customer service information process
       (CSIP) inquiries, graduate assessment surveys (GAS), internal feedback results, and
       FEQSs.
       4.1.2.2. In any meeting that involves a career field restructure include an AFPC/DPSIDC
       representative to provide guidance on the options and limitations involved in a restructure
       or merger.
       4.1.2.3. Include a representative from HQ AU/A4L in any meeting that includes CDC
       issues.
   4.1.3. The TM works with the ITU and TDE to conduct a media and cost/benefit analysis
   when new or revised training requirements are known. The ITU will provide media selection
   guidance.
4.2. Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). The CFETP identifies officer and
enlisted specialty and civilian occupation life cycle education and training requirements by skill
level and/or duty position. AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, includes steps to prepare, coordinate,
approve, publish, issue, announce, and index a CFETP.
4.3. Responsibilities:
   4.3.1. Review officer and enlisted classification description changes and provide
   consolidated reply through the TPM to HQ USAF/A1DL within 30 calendar days; review
   requires comments on any impact on training programs, and the minimum lead time (in
   months) before the change should go into effect.
   4.3.2. Recommend validated requirement for new or revised STSs based on internal or
   external training evaluation and feedback. Any formal course STS item modification must be
   coordinated with the TPM and approved by the AFCFM.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 33


   4.3.3. Plan for and prepare STSs and CTSs to support training requirements established
   during a U&TW and approved by the AFCFM.
   4.3.4. Identify training standard and CFETP additions, changes, and deletions, and provide
   rationale for actions taken. Coordinate training standard change recommendations through
   the TPM to AFCFM (approval authority).
   4.3.5. Host U&TWs held at AETC installations in support of AFCFMs.
   4.3.6. Review and analyze CFETP coordination impact on tentative training standards, and
   prepare final STS. When MAJCOM input will not be included in the final STS or CTS,
   provide rationale through the TPM to AFCFM.
   4.3.7. Inform 2 AF/TTOC and TPM of training issues that require HQ USAF resolution.
   4.3.8. Ensure STS and CTS task items are written to maximize user standard interpretation.
   4.3.9. Determine the most economical and effective methods to satisfy formal training
   requirements.
   4.3.10. Research to determine if alternate methods can satisfy unfunded training
   requirements.
   4.3.11. Provide TPM and 2 AF/TTOC information identifying and justifying unfunded
   training resource requirements (such as resource impact statements) within 3 weeks of a
   U&TW or any major decision that results in additional resource requirements.
   4.3.12. Coordinate with HQ AU/A4L for CDC need dates, and document dates in the
   U&TW minutes.
   4.3.13. Distribute all classified CFETPs according to local special security office (SSO)
   procedures.
   4.3.14. Send recommendations to change, add, or delete published CFETP information to the
   AETC TPM who will coordinate with the AFCFM. The AFCFM will approve or disapprove
   changes and determine if page changes or revisions are necessary.
4.4. Specialty Training Standards (STS). An STS is a contract between AETC and its
customers.
   4.4.1. Requirements. An STS is required in each enlisted CFETP. It identifies core tasks
   and knowledge necessary for AFS career progression and standardizes Air Force training
   requirements. STS use is optional in officer CFETPs. Use the TTMS STS template for new
   courses and revisions.
   4.4.2. Approval. The AFCFM approves an STS only after customer requirement and
   provider (AETC) capability differences are resolved.
   4.4.3. References. Technical references are normally limited to Air Force, DoD, or other
   government publications. Use of commercial publications must be specifically approved by
   the AFCFM.
   4.4.4. Functions. The STS serves the following minimum functions:
      4.4.4.1. Specifically describes the user-command, mission-related training required of
      specialties listed in enlisted and officer classification publications. List tasks and
34                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


     knowledge as either proficiency codes or behavioral statements specific to required tasks
     and knowledge.
     4.4.4.2. Identifies level of training provided in initial skill, wartime, and other AFSC-
     awarding courses, but Does not include generic leadership and management training
     requirements, which are satisfied through officer accession and professional military
     education (PME) programs.
     4.4.4.3. Identifies CDC requirements or study references if CDCs are unavailable.
     4.4.4.4. Identifies upgrade and qualification training, and specialty knowledge test (SKT)
     and student study references.
     4.4.4.5. Reference used by commands to evaluate enlisted formal school graduates.
     4.4.4.6. Identifies minimum AFS OJT requirements for each skill level and/or duty
     position. Provides a foundation for OJT program job qualification standards (JQS) and
     qualification training package (QTP) development Lists OJT training tasks as ―go‖ or
     ―no-go.‖ "Go" means an individual has the proficiency, knowledge, and experience to
     perform tasks without supervision, and meets the task standard.
  4.4.5. STS Preparation. Publish the STS as an integral part of the CFETP.
     4.4.5.1. Tasks. Formal training tasks will not duplicate PME or ancillary training tasks.
     Task proficiency levels should not duplicate other formal training course proficiency
     levels, except CDCs. CDC knowledge proficiency levels may duplicate other courses at
     different skill levels, if different aspects of a topic apply to the different skill levels.
     4.4.5.2. Format. Format is flexible and may vary to fit specialty needs.
     4.4.5.3. Numbering Pages. Number pages as a continuing, integral portion of the
     consecutively numbered CFETP. The proficiency code key is normally the second page
     of the STS. Include the following in the first page:
     4.4.5.4. Heading. The STS number is the Air Force specialty code (AFSC). An "X" in
     the fourth digit indicates the STS covers more than one skill level. List all skill levels
     covered by the STS on the next line. If a shredout is involved, use the shredout (example:
     2A6X1A/C/D/E).
     4.4.5.5. Titles. Use exact titles from AFS descriptions.
     4.4.5.6. Content and Paragraph Numbers. Refer to AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, for STS
     cover page content and number of paragraphs.
     4.4.5.7. Customer Service Information Line (CSIL). Training groups provide a 24-
     hour customer service line to enable graduates‘ supervisors to contact the technical
     training school regarding any concerns. Include the training evaluation branch‘s defense
     switched network (DSN) information on the first page of the STS or CTS. The training
     evaluation branch email address is optional.
  4.4.6. Preparing Training Tasks:
     4.4.6.1. Use notes to cover AFS-unique situations. Example: If ―wartime elements‖ has
     an asterisk, explain in a note.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                    35


     4.4.6.2. During the U&TW or when coordinating a tentative STS, identify line items that
     will continue to be taught during wartime. They may be identified by an asterisk left of
     the paragraph or subparagraph number, in a separate STS column, or as a separate
     attachment to the STS.
     4.4.6.3. In column 1, list the most commonly performed tasks or required knowledge for
     the most current specialty description duties. Complete the list before assigning resident
     training and CDC content proficiency codes.
        4.4.6.3.1. Have SMEs examine each AFS duty, as listed in the specialty summary
        and under duties and responsibilities. If the STS pertains to all 3-skill levels, consider
        the duties in each AFS description. If an OSR is available, list all first job tasks, as
        well as 5- and 7-skill level tasks, according to the analysis extract forwarded with the
        OSR.
        4.4.6.3.2. Use SME input to determine if duties should be added or deleted because
        of job performance requirements changes. Document variations from current
        specialty descriptions, and identify those when coordinating the tentative training
        standard.
        4.4.6.3.3. Use SME input to list job tasks under each duty. Subtasks may also be
        listed. To help ensure complete coverage, compare the initial SME grouping of tasks
        to the STS and task matching in the OSR training extract STS factor printout.
        4.4.6.3.4. Use OSR data, when available, to determine which tasks are performed at
        each AFS skill level. Consider including tasks performed or knowledge required by
        20 percent or more of the personnel in each AFS skill level. For specialties where 20
        percent is unrealistic, establish an alternate cutoff point, and maintain supporting
        rationale in the STS record set folder.
        4.4.6.3.4. Use OSR data to determine if because of task difficulty, safety factors, or
        training emphasis ratings, tasks performed by less than 20 percent should be included
        in the list. Include in the STS column 1, regardless of percent performing.
        4.4.6.3.5. Use SME AFS knowledge to organize and list column 1duties and tasks for
        OJT use.
        4.4.6.3.6. Provide rationale (OSR data, evaluation feedback, or user input) as to
        support STS column 1 entries. TMs will retain the data with the course record set so
        that others, such as new course personnel, understand the course content rationale,
        and as the basis to develop course objectives. Training decision rationale can be
        documented in the STS factor printout.
     4.4.6.4. Write clear task and knowledge statements. The SME and training specialist
     determine how detailed statements will be. List subtasks for complex tasks that segment
     performance and training into subtasks (not teaching steps), but do not divide beyond the
     subtask level. Conversely, task statements that are too general do not provide enough
     information.
        4.4.6.4.1. Do not use subject knowledge statements for task knowledge or
        performance, and do not use task statements for subject knowledge items.
        Performance line items begin with verbs and subject knowledge line items begin with
36                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


        nouns. Note: If closely related tasks are listed separately, but will be taught together,
        code them at the same proficiency level.
        4.4.6.4.2. Begin task statements with action verbs, such as ―operate,‖ ―write,‖ or
        ―clean.‖ Use one verb per task statement (unless an additional verb helps clarify the
        task) to enable the OJT trainer to sign off one task at a time. Two closely related tasks
        that are accomplished simultaneously should be taught simultaneously and can be
        listed as a single line item. Otherwise, list tasks separately.
        4.4.6.4.3. Write active sentences that describe what the person must do to perform a
        task (Example: Use "Calibrate XYZ" rather than "Perform XYZ calibration"). The
        implied subject is understood. Avoid redundant or qualifying phrases, such as "in
        accordance with local directives," "when appropriate," or "as required." Avoid vague
        or ambiguous words, such as "know," "understand," or "determine." Provide two or
        three specific examples for clarification, rather than "and/or" or "etc." Use simple
        statements without qualifiers (Example: Operate power saw" rather than "Operate
        power saw to cut framing timbers" and "Inspect records" rather than "Inspect records
        for completeness and accuracy"). Qualifiers are acceptable if necessary for
        clarification. Avoid task statements that include multiple objects. (Example: "Check
        the fire detection system" rather than "Check the fire detection, extinguishing, and
        overheat warning systems"). Course developers may combine closely related or
        similar tasks when developing course objectives.
     4.4.6.5. When a subject is complex and includes information that is not required for the
     AFS, identify which part of the subject is required. Subject knowledge statements
     identify fundamental and theoretical knowledge required for job performance, such as
     pneudraulic principles or principles of accounting.
        4.4.6.5.1. Subject knowledge statements do not include action verbs unless they are
        necessary to more specifically describe the knowledge requirement. If an action verb
        is necessary, use only one per statement.
        4.4.6.5.2. Avoid ambiguous knowledge statements. Use "Theory of credit" rather
        than "Be familiar with the theory of credit." Avoid multiple subjects or objects. Use
        "Theory of credit" rather than "Theory of debit and credit."
     4.4.6.6. Assign proficiency code levels (unless using behavioral format STS) in the
     appropriate STS column 4 subcolumns to establish resident course and CDC training
     requirements. Do not assign codes to headings. Use OSR data, SME and training
     specialist job knowledge, MAJCOM, CDC writer, and AU/A4L representative input, and
     available resource knowledge to establish requirements.
        4.4.6.6.1. When course resource constraints prevent the formal course or CDC from
        attaining the established training requirement, use dual coding to indicate the current
        training capability. Explain the dual codes in the front of the STS.
            4.4.6.6.1.1. Dual codes indicate the established requirement followed by a slash
            (/) and proficiency level that will be attained under existing constraints.
            (Example: 2b/X [unfunded] or 2b/a [partially funded].) If a task or knowledge
            statement will not be supported by a formal course or CDC, use a dash (-).
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                  37


            4.4.6.6.1.2. Unfunded training requirements written in behavioral statement
            format have "(unfunded)" immediately after the statement. When partially funded,
            include a partial training behavioral statement, enclosed in parentheses,
            immediately after the full requirement statement.
        4.4.6.6.2. Codes in the CDC columns indicate CDC-provided knowledge to support
        upgrade training. In some cases, the CDC cannot provide all career knowledge
        required for upgrade. See paragraph 12.4 for criteria to establish a CDC requirement.
        SKT development support is not justification to establish a CDC requirement.
            4.4.6.6.2.1. CDCs provide career knowledge only. Specialized knowledge (such
            as detailed technical order [TO] procedures, peculiar equipment, or weapons
            systems) is learned through work experience and OJT.
            4.4.6.6.2.2. Do not code an item in the CDC column unless there is an upgrade
            requirement, or need for review material to support an upgrade requirement. List
            task knowledge proficiency codes for task statements and subject knowledge
            codes for knowledge statements.
            4.4.6.6.2.3. Individual task or knowledge codes will be realistic and attainable
            through distance learning education. C-level training is difficult to attain through
            a paper-based CDC, and may require IMI supplements to achieve the desired
            results. Funding may be an issue and should be considered before assigning a C-
            level or higher for CDC requirements. Note: When preparing CDC manuscripts
            for submission to AU/A4L, the CDC writer identifies proficiency codes according
            to established procedures outlined in the AU/A4L Guide for Authors: Standards
            for Course Development, Unit 3. The guide can be found on the AF Portal,
            AU/A4L page, under the writer/manager link.
     4.4.6.7. List training references (TR).
        4.4.6.7.1. When a TR applies to all subparagraphs, list it under the major paragraph.
        There should be a TR for every paragraph and subparagraph.
        4.4.6.7.2. Omit government publication dates, but use the most current reference
        available when you forward the final STS for publication. 4.4.6.7.3. Limit
        commercial or other service publication TRs to those commonly used on the job.
        Underline such references and provide information on how to order them. For
        medical AFSCs, the treatment facility librarian will consolidate requirements and
        submit them through appropriate supply channels. Ensure AFCFM commercial and
        other service publication use. Contact the procurement source or supplying agency to
        confirm commercial and other service publication TRs are available.
  4.4.7. CFETP and STS Changes. The AFCFM ensures the accuracy of CFETPs and STSs.
     4.4.7.1. The AFCFM coordinates with the TPM to determine if a U&TW is required.
     For routine changes, the AFCFM sends a memorandum to notify the appropriate training
     wings and HQ AETC/A3T.
     4.4.7.2. Limit write-in changes to minor additions or corrections. For others, use page
     insert changes (remove and replace pages). Submit both sides of the page for camera-
 38                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


      ready page changes. Use the decimal system to number insert pages. Example: A page
      inserted between pages 4 and 5 is page 4.1).
      4.4.7.3. Do not coordinate with using commands any changes that delete the second code
      of dual-coded elements.
      4.4.7.4. For minor STS cover page alterations, write in changes. Use a page-insert
      change for the cover page only when significant modifications are required.
   4.4.8. STS Responsibilities:
      4.4.8.1. AFCFM. Establishes requirements and format, and ensures STS meets CFETP
      format when incorporated into Part II.
      4.4.8.2. HQ AETC TPM (TPM and HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses). Helps
      TRGs and 2 AF resolve customer request and the TRG capability equipment conflicts.
      4.4.8.3. TRG or designated level:
          4.4.8.3.1. Prepares STS to support current AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
          Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), and coordinates with customers on the CFETP and
          STS.
          4.4.8.3.2. Resolves all issues; submits the STS to TPM and AFCFM to publish and
          distribute.
          4.4.8.3.3. Informs the TPM and 2 AF/TTOC if it is necessary to initiate unfunded
          formal training requirement program decision packages.
          4.4.8.3.4. Recommends STS changes based on internal or external evaluation and
          feedback.
          4.4.8.3.5. Reviews CFETP part IIs annually during the anniversary month. This
          review does not constitute the AFCFM‘s annual CFETP certification. Email the
          review to AFOMS/TE. See Attachment 7 for sample format.
          4.4.8.3.6. Uses AETC Form 23, STS Proficiency Code Key (Final). Develop a
          behavioral statement STS with behavioral statement codes (P, K and pk) as indicated
          in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5.
          4.4.8.3.7. Maintains the STS record sets. The record sets in the TTMS databases,
          where TTMS is installed. maintain electronically or paper-based record sets where
          TTMS is not installed, and for classified STSs.
4.5. Course Training Standard:
   4.5.1. Requirements. A course training standard (CTS) identifies a specific course‘s
   training and proficiency level. as the CTS is a contract between AETC and its customers. The
   CTS is used to identify optional supplemental training requirements, and may also be used to
   identify officer CFETP mandatory and optional course requirements. Use the TTMS CTS
   template for new courses and revisions. The 982 TRG may use a combined CTS and CC for
   system courses/specialty training (not 3-level AFSC awarding courses). The BMT CTS is
   developed according to AFI 36-2201, Volume 5. See Attachment 8 and Attachment 9 for
   format. The 17 TRG, DoD Fire Academy CTS format will be congruent with National Fire
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                  39


  Protection Association (NFPA) standards. CTS items will be major line items from the
  appropriate NFPA standards. Other format variations are permitted with OPR prior approval.
  4.5.2. Delete.
  4.5.3. Format. Use the TTMS CTS template. If TTMS is not available, develop a
  qualitative requirements list according to examples in Attachment 8 and Attachment 9.
  Attachment 8 is a proficiency code CTS sample. Attachment 9 is a behavioral CTS sample.
  Begin numbering on the second page and number pages consecutively. Use the 982 TRG
  curriculum management operating instruction (OI) to develop or revise the combined
  CC/CTS. The BMT CTS includes affective domain training which may not be formally
  measured (see local BMT guidance).
  4.5.4. Cover Page:
     4.5.4.1. Format heading in as shown in Attachment 8 and Attachment 9. All CTS
     headings are flush left. The CTS number is the course number, and it is flush right. Type
     the PDS code in parentheses on the line below the CTS number. Enter the CTS
     publication date (unabbreviated month and year) on the line below the PDS code.
     4.5.4.2. Center the exact course title, all upper case, two spaces below the heading.
     4.5.4.3. See Attachment 8 and Attachment 9 for cover page placement of the TRG
     commander‘s signature element.
     4.5.4.4. See Attachment 8 and Attachment 9 examples of information appropriate for the
     cover page. Do not type a page number on the cover page.
     4.5.4.5. Customer Service Information Line (CSIL). Include the appropriate training
     evaluation branch DSN on the first page. The training evaluation branch e-mail address
     may also be included.
  4.5.5. Qualitative Requirements Instructions:
     4.5.5.1. When necessary for behavioral format CTSs, type distribution on the back of the
     cover page, and number it as page 2. Generally, AETC Form 60, CTS Proficiency Code
     Key, is the second page of the document. A CTS in the behavioral format will not include
     an AETC Form 60; instead, the second page will begin the list of tasks and knowledge, or
     the proficiency codes in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5
     4.5.5.2. Prepare CTS to describe course content. Base tasks and knowledge on applicable
     AFS description analysis (not available for BMT), available OSR data, SME specialty
     knowledge, and MAJCOM requirements. Base task and knowledge statements on
     available source data analysis. Course content will not duplicate PME or ancillary
     training tasks and knowledge (except BMT). Do not duplicate the level of training
     provided in other training courses. Tasks, knowledge items, and proficiency levels will
     prescribe only training available in the course. Coordinate CTS changes that affect
     training through TPM for AFCFM or equivalent approval. To accomplish such changes,
     republish the CTS and generate an ATP/CTP if appropriate. TM documents in the record
     set editorial changes that do not alter course training. Note editorial changes in the TTMS
     database (where installed). Use standards described in paragraphs 4.4.6.4 through 4.4.6.6
     to develop CTS.
40                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


     4.5.5.3. Describe task and knowledge training requirements in the same manner and as
     specifically as those in Attachment 8 and Attachment 9. Include tasks and knowledge
     items that support operational requirements. A CTS is organized in one of two ways: 1)
     by major equipment, subsystem, or work center with the task and knowledge statements
     listed as subparagraphs, or 2) by major tasks with the major equipment, subsystem, or
     work center listed as subparagraphs. Each organization allows realistic proficiency levels
     to be assigned to each entry.
     4.5.5.4. Use proficiency code key scale values of the (unless using behavioral
     statements), to specify the capabilities graduates will have after training. When lack of
     resources affects training, dual-code to show established training requirements versus
     present training capability. When dual-coding, explain the codes on the cover page. TRs
     may be used when advantageous.
     4.5.5.5. The following guidelines apply to behavioral statement CTSs:
         4.5.5.5.1. Use the behavioral statement coding system in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5.
         4.5.5.5.2. Describe observable, measurable skills and knowledge gained from
         training. Clearly state what graduates will be able to do, using specific and objective
         statements that permit easy assessment through the graduate evaluation program
         described in AETCI 36-2201, Technical and Basic Military Training Evaluation. If
         necessary, include conditions and/or standards to clarify the behavior.
         4.5.5.5.3. Each statement should establish a training requirement using verbs that
         describe observable and measurable student behavior. Limit verbs to one action per
         statement unless actions are closely related, such as ―remove and replace.‖ Avoid
         vague, ambiguous words such as "know" or "understand," and meaningless qualifiers
         such as "when appropriate" or "as necessary."
     4.5.5.6. Include a summary of changes at the end of each CTS Attachment 1.
  4.5.6. CTS Responsibilities:
     4.5.6.1. 2 AF/TO will develop, approve publish and distribute CTS for standardized
     faculty development courses; and resolve conflicts between groups and customers prior
     to approval and publication.
     4.5.6.2. TRG or designated level will develop CTS and coordinate with customers;
     resolve conflicts between the group and customers prior to approval and publication;
     approve, publish, and distribute CTS; determine the most cost-effective method to satisfy
     training requirements; evaluate alternative training methods to satisfy unfunded
     requirements; and maintain CTS record sets. Maintain CTS record sets in TTMS, if
     installed. If TTMS is not installed, maintain electronic or paper CTS record sets.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     41


                                            Chapter 5

                                  TRAINING OBJECTIVES

5.1. Description. Student measurement is based on training objectives. Job performance is the
foundation for ISD. Training objectives reflect behaviors, conditions and standards graduates
will demonstrate on the job. Instructional designers write training objectives and select
appropriate learning conditions. Performance objectives are preferred for technical training
courses. However AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors, allows knowledge-
based training that includes written test measurement based on level-of-learning objectives and
samples of behavior. Objectives identify what shall be measured. For guidance, see AFH 36-
2235, Volume 9, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems, Application to Technical
Training; AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development; and AFMAN 36-2236.
   5.1.1. Cover each TS item with one or more objectives. Collectively, objectives satisfy all
   TS course requirements. Tie each objective to TS items it supports. Use discretion when
   closing multiple TS items with a single objective.
   5.1.2. Base objectives on TS task and knowledge statements.
   5.1.3. Behaviors must satisfy TS job knowledge and performance requirements.
5.2. Format. Training objectives should follow a three-part format. Use the TS line item verb
for terminal objectives. The objective standard may be implied. When sampling written tests
are used to measure the objective, knowledge objectives may imply conditions and standards.
The ISD approach is to write objectives that closely reflect job conditions, behaviors, and
standards. If course objectives are written in the affective domain, use relative verbs to describe
the intended behavior. Affective verbs do not describe observable measurable actions for
behavioral objectives. Some affective verbs are: feel, sense, capture, experience, attend,
perceive, allow, clarify, internalize, etc.
   5.2.1. Under conditions, include whatever the student may use to achieve the required
   behavior. Objectives written without conditions imply ―without reference‖ or ―from
   memory.‖
   5.2.2. Use verbs that describe observable, measurable actions for behavior objectives.
   Objectives will reflect graduates‘ on the job behaviors. Do not use the measurement device
   as the object of an action verb. Limit action verbs to one per objective unless actions are
   normally concurrent (such as ―remove and reinstall‖). When possible, use action verbs
   directly from the TS. When a behavioral statement CTS is the TS, terminal objective
   behaviors will mirror the CTS.
   5.2.3. Standards define the proficiency level students must attain to pass the objective (i.e.,
   level of performance that proves the student has achieved job standards). If the objective
   finalizes a TS element, the standard ensures students meet the required proficiency. The
   objective standard may be implied. s When sampling written tests are used to measure the
   objective, knowledge objectives may imply standards. For example, "recognize traffic signs"
   has an implied standard of 100 percent. A graduate would be expected to recognize all traffic
   signs, not just some of them.
 42                                                           AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


       5.2.3.1. Performance objectives written without standards imply performance must be
       without error or assistance, with 100 percent accuracy. However standards may indicate a
       specific time, a degree of accuracy, a required quality, or such standard instructions as ―in
       accordance with‖ at TO checklist.‖
       5.2.3.2. If a progress check and written test are used to measure an objective, the
       standard will reflect the progress check success requirement, and the objective must
       closeout with the progress check. If a sampling written test is the only measurement, the
       standard will be the established minimum passing score, and a standard will not be stated.
5.3. Responsibilities. The TRG or designated level establishes group procedures and provides
guidance, expertise, and oversight for course training objective development. Use the ICIS
course design and development database three-part wizard to build unclassified course objectives
whenever possible.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                    43


                                           Chapter 6

                                STUDENT MEASUREMENT

6.1. Description. Student measurement encompasses a series of measurement instruments that
can be used to meet the needs of technical training courses. Computer-based measurement and
analysis is acceptable and encouraged. Instructors and TDEs should complete a statistical item
analysis for each course test. AFMAN 36-2236 describes analysis methods. Employ appropriate
safeguards including those applicable to computer systems to prevent compromise of
measurement materials. At a minimum, configure computer based and online measurement
systems to block predator computer programs from running during formal online testing; prevent
the use of shortcut keystrokes to accomplish bypassing test security prevent viewing of the
hypertext markup language (html) coding associated with web pages; ensure additional software
programs, such as Web X, are not running in the background during online testing; encrypt test
data to prevent unauthorized access to formal tests; assign proper security profiles and roles for
all levels of users; limit administrative privileges on servers; support secure deployment of
testing software with separate Web servers, application servers, and database servers; prevent
tests from being improperly posted to shared drives; and ensure identification and authorization
of all users.
   6.1.1. To graduate, each student must successfully pass all formal measurement devices,
   including performance tests, written tests and progress checks. An exception would be a
   performance objective or written measurement not taken because of a documented training
   deficiency. Instructors may grant international students additional time to complete
   measurement devices when language difficulties dictate.
   6.1.2. Measurement/assessment is required in all courses.
   6.1.3. Grade performance tests and progress checks by either satisfactory (S), unsatisfactory
   (U), or percentage scores. If a student fails a written measurement, retests and passes, the
   student receives the minimum passing score achievable for the written test. However, all
   scores should be documented because they might provide additional insight into student
   motivation or ability to study and learn. Performance tests and progress checks may be
   graded by either satisfactory (S), unsatisfactory (U), or percentage scores.
   6.1.4. Employ appropriate safeguards including those applicable to computer systems to
   prevent compromise of measurement materials. Administer all measurement, including
   computer based or online, measurement in a controlled (proctored) environment. TRGs will
   develop procedures to store; inventory and control test materials, in print or electronic
   formats, as well as ensuring printed test materials are free of marks that could convey test
   answers. Send tests to other bases using certified mail, approved encrypted electronic transfer
   procedures or password-protected electronic files. Handle classified material according to
   established security procedures.
   6.1.5. Subject matter qualified instructors must certify that students achieve the objectives
   tested.
   6.1.6. When the task knowledge component of a performance objective is not apparent in the
   successful achievement of a performance test or performance progress check, measure the
   knowledge with either a written test or knowledge progress check.
 44                                                           AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   6.1.7. Measurement items will measure the behavior of training objectives as closely as
   possible. Write measurement items using the guidelines in AFH 36-2235, Information for
   Designers of Instructional Systems; AFM 36-2234, Instructional Systems Development; and
   AFM 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors.
6.2. Written Tests. When students successfully achieve the minimum overall passing score on
a written test, it implies they have achieved individual objectives and it provides an acceptable
degree of confidence that they have attained the required knowledge. In addition, written
measurement aids in knowledge retention, acts as a quality control device, and is used to assign
grades. Written tests are not limited to selection type items. They may be essay or supply type,
such as fill in the blank. Maintain a master copy of each test, either electronic or paper-based, to
identify the correct answers, show plan of instruction (POI) objective correlation to each test
item, and identify the approved corrections and changes made in the test. Written tests do not
have to be dated after the POI. Simply annotate the test to indicate the POI it supports. Note:
Reasons for change are documented on AETC Form 668, Test Data; or a test change document
while actual changes are annotated on the test master copy.
   6.2.1. Use a written test to sample each knowledge objective and, when necessary, the
   knowledge components of performance objectives. (See paragraph 7.1.3.3 for guidance on
   the allocation of time for written tests.) If a performance test or performance progress check
   adequately assesses the knowledge components of a performance objective, written test items
   for that objective are not required.
   6.2.2. Establish a minimum passing score of 70 percent or higher for written tests and
   progress checks. Identify minimum passing score in the standardized test instructions given
   to students during the pretest instructional period. The minimum passing score may be
   expressed as either a ratio of whole numbers or a percentage. If a ratio is used, it must meet
   or exceed 70 percent without rounding (i.e., 15 of 21 correct is 71.428 percent). The grade
   posted in the student record will be rounded to the nearest whole number. Decimals of .5 and
   greater are rounded up. In the example above, a score of 71 percent would be posted in the
   student record.
   6.2.3. For ease of scoring, course personnel may use AETC Form 1200, OMR Classroom
   Answer Sheet; AETC Form 26, Standard Answer Sheet (50 Items) and AETC Form 26A,
   Standard Answer Sheet (100 Items); or AETC Form 150, Field Evaluation and Examination
   Answer Sheet, for written tests.
   6.2.4. The difficulty, complexity, criticality, time, and scope of behavior specified by the
   objectives are used to determine the number of test items required to cover each objective.
   Also, time allotted for the testing period impacts the number of test items. Note: When a
   single objective finalizes multiple TS items, ensure the number of questions is sufficient to
   assess student attainment of required knowledge.
   6.2.5. Develop enough test versions (a minimum of two) for each measurement point to
   provide alternate tests in the event of a test compromise or test failure. All test versions will
   have the same number of test items per objective. It is not necessary to maintain alternate test
   versions if the course uses randomly generated computer tests. The passing standard and
   number of test items will be the same for alternate test versions. Avoid duplicate test items if
   possible. If circumstances limit the variety of test items supporting an objective, reword
   items, resequence answers, or scramble items on the alternate version to deter test
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                      45


   compromise. Randomly rotate test versions to ensure each is administered as equally as
   possible.
   6.2.6. Use technical data when required by the objective. Use of technical data is not
   required for a written test unless it is necessarily part of the behavior being measured.
   6.2.7. Score tests and individually inform students of their grades as soon as practical after
   administering a test. Temporarily return scored answer sheets and copies of the test to
   students for their review during the critique process (except video-teletraining and computer-
   based instruction). In BMT, the critique will be accomplished using the test booklets only.
   For Type 6 courses requiring measurement, feedback is managed by the designated test site
   monitor.
       6.2.7.1. Make students aware of the answers to missed questions and clarify
       misunderstandings to enhance learning. In BMT, trainees receive their scores after the
       test critique. For Type 6 courses, the test site monitor may refer students to the
       appropriate TRS for additional feedback.
       6.2.7.2. During the critique, obtain students' opinions as to why questions were missed so
       corrective actions may be taken, if appropriate. Record grades on the student report
       cardin the TTMS; AETC Form 156, Student Training Report; or AETC Form 325,
       Student Accounting and Attendance Record, in accordance with AETCI 36-2215,
       Training Administration. Record test results on AETC Form 668, or in a computer-
       generated test analysis system. For test item analysis application and interpretation see
       AFMAN 36-2236, Chapters 25 or 26. For test analysis, include high-miss test questions
       analysis as a minimum. Examiners make appropriate comments on AETC Form 668 or
       other applicable data collection documents, to include computer forms of documentation.
       Allowances are permitted for use of alternate test analysis for randomly computer
       generated tests.
   6.2.8. Develop standardized instructions for the examiner and examinee.
6.3. Performance Tests. Administer performance tests to evaluate a student's attainment of
skills required by performance objectives. This test is a separate unit of instruction that requires
the student to perform one or more objectives under specified conditions in a formal testing
mode. Performance Tests are administered to evaluate trainee attainment of skills required by
performance objectives and require trainees to perform objective tasks under specified conditions
in a formal testing mode.
   6.3.1. Give performance tests under controlled conditions to measure student
   accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching-learning activity has been
   completed. Use performance tests to measure performance objectives where progress checks
   do not provide an adequate degree of quality control or record of performance.
   6.3.2. Develop standardized instructions for the examiner and examinee to use in
   administering and critiquing the performance test. Include the performance test requirements
   and minimum student grade requirements in TTMS; on the AETC Form 98, Student Progress
   Checklist; or a locally approved checklist.
 46                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   6.3.3. Individually inform each student of his or her grade and critique the student's
   performance as soon as practical after test administration. Record grades in TTMS or on
   AETC Form 156, or AETC Form 325, if TTMS is not available.
   6.3.4. Administer a performance recheck only when a special requirement has been
   identified in the TS or when separate agency certification is required (such as typing or
   coding speed).
   6.3.5. Task certification (when required by the career field) in formal courses may be
   performed by the instructor when students attain performance standards defined in AFI 36-
   2201. Training records will be documented according to AFI 36-2201, Volume 3, Air Force
   Training Program on the Job Training Administration. Only subject matter-qualified
   instructors may initial CFETPs, and they will include ―AETC Instructor‖ after their names in
   the identification block of the students‘ CFETP Part II. Upon course completion, the CFETP
   is provided to the student's gaining organization. This may be accomplished by mail, hand-
   carried by the student, or sent electronically. Note: Not applicable to firefighting training.
6.4. Progress Checks:
   6.4.1. In technical training units, progress checks are formal measurement devices
   administered by the instructor during classroom or laboratory instruction time to assess the
   student's accomplishment of knowledge or performance objectives. These checks provide
   immediate feedback to the student and instructor. Develop checklist items for each
   performance objective assessed by a progress check. When operational aircraft and
   equipment are used for training, the appropriate TO must be used during the progress check.
   In this case, it is not necessary to develop a checklist. For BMT, refer to local guidance for
   accomplishing progress checks. Develop specific instructions for the examiner and examinee
   that details the measurement process to include the meaning of an instructor assist, if used,
   and identifies the minimum passing standard.
      6.4.1.1. A subject matter-qualified instructor determines if the student has successfully
      accomplished the objective and bases that judgment on the behavior observed and the
      standard stated in the objective. The instructor evaluates student performance using the
      applicable checklist or TO.
      6.4.1.2. The instructor checks the student's progress during the teaching-learning
      activity, determines if a student's performance is satisfactory and, if necessary, requires
      the student to repeat all or any portion of the objective needed for successful
      performance.
   6.4.2. Progress checks may be used for knowledge objectives in conjunction with written
   tests and may be used instead of written tests in Types 4, 6, and 7 courses. Progress checks
   will be afforded the same security and control as written tests when used in place of written
   tests or when prior knowledge of the progress check will afford the student an advantage.
   Progress checks that are not compromisable do not need to be controlled.
   6.4.3. Actual accomplishment of progress checks may be delayed until the end of a unit of
   instruction (or WOT for BMT), to allow a check of more than one objective at a time.
   Accomplishment of the performance progress checks being used for certification in mission
   ready Airmen (MRA) courses may be delayed to the next block of instruction (or WOT for
   BMT) to enhance student retention.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     47


   6.4.4. Instructors may return workbooks, exercises, or other material used during progress
   checks to the students after the material has been graded and critiqued, if such material does
   not compromise the progress check.
   6.4.5. Alternate versions of progress checks are not required. However, alternate versions of
   knowledge progress checks are encouraged.
   6.4.6. Record unsatisfactory completion of objectives in the TTMS database in accordance
   with AETCI 36-2215. Unsatisfactory results will be documented in TTMS within 24 hours
   after the failure occurred. When documenting satisfactory completion of a block in the
   database, all objectives in that block are considered passed. At all locations where TTMS is
   operational, use automated products produced by TTMS to track students. Where TTMS is
   unavailable, results may be maintained on AETC Form 667, Criterion Checklist; AETC
   Form 667A, Criterion Checklist; AETC Form 98; or a computer-generated checklist.
   Maintain results of the checklist during the validation phase of training to permit analysis and
   validation of the checklist.
6.5. Appraisals:
   6.5.1. Appraisals are a series of questions and/or projects used to informally check day-to-
   day progress.
   6.5.2. An appraisal may be used to informally assess retention and/or comprehension to
   provide early identification of students who need individual assistance. An appraisal may be
   administered without documenting it in the POI.
   6.5.3. There is no requirement to record grades or control appraisals. Unsuccessful
   completion of appraisals may be used as part of the rationale for student washback or
   elimination, but not for determining the official final grade.
   6.5.4. Conduct appraisals relevant to field trips and visits to places outside the classroom
   environment as soon as practical to determine the continuing value of the trip or visit.
6.6. Group Measurement:
   6.6.1. Ensure an objective that requires group or team performance specifies in the
   conditions that a group or team performs the behavior.
   6.6.2. For group or team activities, rate each member's performance and participation. When
   possible, rotate each member of a group or team to different positions during the
   performance test or progress check. Evaluate students while they are performing in at least
   one active task associated with the objective. Do not assume success merely by observing the
   student reading a procedural document.
   6.6.3. An important BMT training goal is to ensure civilian recruits learn to operate
   effectively as a team. Teamwork is a crucial evaluation element while trainees interact as a
   group or flight.
   6.6.4. Ensure objectives that require group, team or flight performance specifies the
   conditions under which that group, team or flight performs the behavior.
   6.6.5. An subject matter qualified instructor checks trainee progress during the teaching-
   learning activity and determines if trainee performance is satisfactory and, if necessary,
 48                                                           AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   requires him or her to repeat all or any portion of the objective needed for successful
   performance.
   6.6.6. Accomplishment of performance progress check may be delayed until the end of a
   unit of instruction (or WOT for BMT) until the end of the next WOT to enhance trainee
   retention.
   6.6.7. Inform each trainee of his or her grade and critique trainee performance as soon as
   practical after test administration.
6.7. Measurement Plans. A course measurement plan ensures adequate assessment of all
course objectives. The POI meets the requirements for the measurement plan for Type 4 courses.
Use AETC-approved or the current course design and development database measurement plan
template when available. The plan includes such information as the following:
   6.7.1. POI objectives correlated to training standard items and associated proficiency codes.
   6.7.2. Type of measurement (PC = progress check, W = written test, and P = performance
   test) for each objective.
   6.7.3. Written test question numbers correlated to objectives.
   6.7.4. Point at which training standard element is closed out.
   6.7.5. Develop measurement plans using the template generated by TTMS where installed.
6.8. Measurement Validation. Measurement validation ensures each measurement instrument
assesses the course content it is designed to assess and may or may not occur concurrently with
course validation. Data from the first three administrations of each measurement instrument
usually provide sufficient information to complete the validation. This may be extended if
required. Different validation parameters may be established based on student flow. Validation
should be completed in a year. Randomly generated computer test validation is accomplished by
objective rather than by test since each test is different. This is normally completed after four to
six administrations.
   6.8.1. During measurement validation, review measurement data after each administration.
   Annotate comments concerning any test problems on AETC Form 668 or in a computerized
   test analysis system. If the test analysis system has insufficient space, annotate a cross-
   reference to a word processing file.
   6.8.2. Analyze the measurement instrument as defined in AFMAN 36-2236, Chapters 25 or
   26, and the high-miss items (50 percent or more missed), and determine if corrective action is
   required. If the course is under validation, consider the training activities for possible impact.
   6.8.3. Identify deficiencies in measurement items, instruction, training materials, etc., and
   correct as necessary. Record the name of the reviewer and when the review was conducted
   on AETC Form 668 or in a measurement review electronic file.
   6.8.4. During measurement validation, if desired, administer a single test version without test
   rotation, except in the case of a retest.
   6.8.5. Maintain individual student checklist results for the first three administrations of
   performance test and progress checks for validation review. The TDE identifies measurement
   items missed by more than 50 percent of the students during their first attempt, and
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                       49


   documents actions taken to correct deficiencies. Continue to maintain results until the
   deficiencies are corrected.
6.9. Periodic Test Analysis After Measurement Validation:
   6.9.1. The goal of analysis is to help determine whether each test item meets the necessary
   standards of difficulty, reliability, and validity. In other words, does each item effectively and
   objectively measure the degree of student achievement required of that specific learning
   objective? Each statistical figure produced by test item analysis represents a descriptive
   measure of how well each component of each item meets the standard. The goal is to develop
   items with statistical values that will fall within acceptable limits of discrimination and
   difficulty. If high-miss or poorly performing items based on test analysis become evident
   after a measurement device has been validated, review the training activities associated with
   these items to determine the cause. To help isolate the problem, review a composite test
   analysis and trends printout of classes conducted since measurement validation was
   terminated. Take action to reduce or eliminate high-miss or poorly performing items.
   Document the review and actions taken.
   6.9.2. Review a composite analysis of measurement results on AETC Form 668, if
   computerized test analysis is not available. See AFMAN 36-2236, Chapters 25 and 26 for a
   discussion on applying and interpreting test item analysis results. Base frequency of the
   review cycle on student flow. Conduct at least one comprehensive review annually, including
   all data since the last test review, regardless of the number of students taking the test. Annual
   reviews may be conducted concurrently with the ARTT.
   6.9.3. Identify high miss trends and problem questions, and revise questions or instructions
   as necessary.
   6.9.4. Periodically review performance test results. Base frequency of the review cycle on
   student flow. Analyze the high miss items to determine if any corrective action is required
   and document any action taken. Conduct at least one review annually, and maintain the
   record of review and any action taken with the test or in the test cabinet.
   6.9.5. Record the name of the reviewer and when the review was conducted.
6.10. Student Measurement Responsibilities. The TRG or designated level within the group:
   6.10.1. Establishes local measurement procedures.
   6.10.2. Provides staff supervision and surveillance to ensure student measurement is
   implemented and remains consistent with the intent of this instruction.
   6.10.3. Establishes local requirements for measurement device approval, security, validation
   of tests, and periodic test analysis.
 50                                                           AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009

                                      COURSE CHARTS

7.1. Description. The course chart (CC) provides an executive summary of training, outlining
the general structure and content of a course. It also provides course parameters and other course
data to be used for course planning and control. Type 1 should be handled case-by-case. Use the
TTMS CC template where TTMS is installed or AETC Form 449 if TTMS is not available. The
982 TRG may use a combined course chart and course training standard for Type 4 courses.
   7.1.1. An approved course chart is required for Types 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, C, A, W, and M
   courses. Refer to Attachment 10 for an example CC.
   7.1.2. Use the standard training day, except BMT and Type 6 DL. The standard training day
   includes 8 hours of classroom/lab divided into eight 50-minute periods with 10 minutes of
   break time (400 minutes of instruction). It is acceptable to continue training beyond 50
   minutes and accumulate break time if doing so enhances the learning activity. The
   compressed work schedule (CWS) standard training day in use at Keesler AFB is an 8-hour
   training day that includes 445 minutes of instruction and 35 minutes of break time. A total of
   4,000 minutes of instruction must be provided during a 9-day training period. Variations
   from either standard training day must be requested by the group commander, coordinated
   through HQ AETC/A1MRT, and approved by HQ AETC/A3T, with a courtesy copy to 2
   AF/TTOC. Day-to-day deviations for events such as appointments, functions, or unforeseen
   course interruptions are approved by the training squadron, detachment or operating location
   commander or chief. A few examples of situations that may require a deviation are severe
   weather, illness, and equipment and/or aircraft malfunction. Keep deviations to the training
   day minimized. Maintain approved waivers to the standard training day at the local level.
   7.1.2.1. 1 Use the guidelines in Table 7.1 to identify shift times.

Table 7.1. Shift Time Identification Codes.
  I        A                                              B

  1     S         Morning shift, 0600-1500
  2     T         Afternoon shift, 1500-2400
  3     R         Regular shift: Varies as long as 8 hours of training is provided
  4     A         0600-1200 plus 2 hours of supervised or directed study
  5     B         1200-1800 plus 2 hours of supervised or directed study
  6     C         1800-2400 plus 2 hours of supervised or directed study
  7     D         2400-0600 plus 2 hours of supervised or directed study
  8     E         Nonstandard training day: 24-hour day or other variation as required
       7.1.2.2. The TRG commander may approve variations for field trips not to exceed 5 days
       total per course, and field exercises that extend beyond either standard training day.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     51


     7.1.2.3. Variations to the standard training day must include at least 6 hours of C/L time.
     Up to 2 hours per day may be supervised or directed study. Variations may not be used to
     justify additional resources or personnel. Examples of situations that might require a
     variation are equipment or facility constraints that necessitate a multiple shift operation or
     individual projects that require access to classified information.
     7.1.2.4. Courses involving TDY instructors or where the majority of students are in a
     TDY status will be accomplished on a standard training day.
     7.1.2.5. 982 TRG courses designed and scheduled to be taught on other than a standard
     training day must be approved and annually validated by the 982 TRG/CC. These
     approvals and validations will be documented and filed in the course record set.
     Reporting the day-to-day deviations to the 982 TRG/CC is not required.
     7.1.2.6. Supervised study is time dedicated to student achievement of course objectives
     using self-study instructional materials. Specific objectives must be assigned and
     measured. Material covered by supervised study must not be retaught. A subject matter-
     qualified instructor must be present and may monitor more than one group of students.
     7.1.2.7. Directed study is time dedicated to student achievement of course objectives
     using self-study instructional materials. Specific objectives must be assigned and
     measured. Material covered by directed study must not be retaught. An instructor is not
     required to provide direct supervision to students for this period. No instructor
     authorizations are earned for directed study hours.
     7.1.2.8. Do not confuse directed study or supervised study with special individualized
     assistance (SIA). See AETCI 36-2215 for SIA guidance.
  7.1.3. Course charts will reflect the following standard training parameters:
     7.1.3.1. Course Orientation and Introduction. Maximum of 2 hours per course. Type
     6 courses usually require less time. In BMT, the immediate incoming briefing serves as
     the course orientation and introduction. The standard topics for a course orientation are
     woven throughout a series of briefings in the BMT curriculum. Note: Type 6 courses
     orientation will include information in paragraphs 8.1.1.1, 8.1.1.2, 8.1.1.4, and any
     others as applicable.
     7.1.3.2. Course Feedback and Graduation. Maximum of 1.5 hours per course. Course
     feedback surveys are administered twice during the BMT program: one shortly after
     arrival and the other shortly before departure. Each survey should take no more than 30
     minutes to complete. In BMT, the graduation parade lasts 1 hour and serves as the course
     graduation. Course feedback is administered separately through trainee surveys and
     through the use of Lackland AFB Form 133, Trainee Comment Sheet. Type 6 courses
     may require significantly less time because there is no graduation ceremony upon course
     completion.
     7.1.3.3. Written Measurements and Feedback. Should not exceed 1.5 hours per test.
     If extra time is needed, the block of instruction may be shortened to increase test time for
     that block (not to exceed 2.5 hours per test). Document justification for extended testing
     time and prepare a revised course chart for approval by the squadron commander or
     designated level within the squadron. Keep justification on file at the local level.
 52                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


      Typically written tests should cover a minimum of 32-40 course hours. However, they
      may be as infrequent as 80-120 course hours or greater. In any case, test frequency and
      content coverage must be consistent with sound educational practice and must
      accomplish the purposes set forth for written measurement in this instruction. Time
      allotted for progress checks is included in the objective times and will not be listed as a
      separate unit in the CC.
      7.1.3.4. Outprocessing appointments. Maximum of 2 hours per course (as required).
      Type 6 courses are exempt from this requirement. In BMT, picking up orders serves as
      the trainee's outprocessing appointment and takes less than 2 hours. Note: This time does
      not earn manpower resources.
      7.1.3.5. Traffic safety education. Maximum of 2 hours per course, when required by
      the TRW or TRG. Note: This time does not earn manpower resources.
   7.1.4. Commander's call or graduate evaluation information will not be included as CC time.
   7.1.5. The last training day must be at least 5 hours in length (except in Type 6 and self
   paced courses) when the course is over 20 academic days in length.
   7.1.6. Tentative CCs may include write-in changes based on interim validation findings if
   the changes are approved by the course TM. Write-in changes to final course charts, other
   than to correct approval/effective dates, typographical or grammatical errors, are not
   authorized.
   7.1.7. BMT provides foundational Air Force knowledge in a wide variety of areas and some
   of this training may be duplicated by PME or other ancillary training (BMT is exempt in
   accordance with paragraph 4.8.5.2. of this instruction). BMT triennial review establishes
   initial accession training requirements.
7.2. Developing Course Charts:
   7.2.1. Show supervised and directed study hours separately from C/L hours on the TTMS
   CC template or AETC Form 449.
   7.2.2. Do not include PME or ancillary training as part of course time unless a waiver has
   been granted by HQ USAF/AIDL.
   7.2.3. Identify tentative CCs on the course design and development database CC template or
   the AETC Form 449 by centering the word "Tentative" at the top margin. This may be typed,
   stamped, or handwritten.
   7.2.4. Include the following information in the remarks section of the course design and
   development database CC template or the AETC Form 449, as appropriate:
      7.2.4.1. Effective date with class number.
      7.2.4.2. Listing of other CCs that apply during a phaseout or validation period.
      7.2.4.3. When applicable, document constraints that require a variation from the standard
      training day.
      7.2.4.4. The name, office symbol, and phone number of the TM responsible for the
      accuracy of the information on the CC.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                    53


       7.2.4.5. Appropriate wartime remarks if applicable, such as changing the length of
       training day and/or number of days per week.
       7.2.4.6. Motivational training will not be used unless a statement indicating usage is
       included in the remarks section. Adding motivational training to a course will require a
       new course chart and an ATP.
       7.2.4.7. List piggyback courses in remarks section.
   7.2.5. In Table 1 of the TTMS CC template, or the AETC Form 449, list only major items of
   equipment (engine, engine stand, etc.). Do not list administrative or course support type
   items. Major items of equipment would include those required for attainment of a training
   objective.
   7.2.6. Prepare Table 2 on the back of AETC Form 449 or on plain bond paper if TTMS is
   not available. See Attachment 10 for an example.
   7.2.7. Mark classified course charts, classified block and unit titles, and individual segments
   and paragraphs with the appropriate security classification in accordance with DoD 5200.1-
   PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents, and local special security office
   procedures. When titles of classified units of instruction are unclassified, add a statement in
   the remarks section or in Table 2 indicating the titles are unclassified and are marked only to
   reflect classification of course content.
7.3. Developing Wartime CCs. Wartime course chart designation is no longer required.
Wartime courses will be developed as separate builds with wartime course numbers in the course
design and development database on an as-needed basis when there are different tasks and/or
equipment to be trained during wartime.
7.4. Contingency Delivery Plan. For interactive video teletraining (IVT) courses, or Web
based courses, the CC will identify alternative delivery methods in the event of satellite or
equipment/network failure.
7.5. Responsibilities. The training group or designated level within the group:
   7.5.1. Forwards requests for variations to the standard training day on a course-by-course
   basis signed by the TRG/CC through HQ AETC/A1MRT to HQ AETC/A3T.
   7.5.2. Provides guidance, expertise, and oversight for developing CCs.
   7.5.3. Prepares, approves, and distributes CCs. 737 TRG/TSDE prepares, and distributes
   CCs with the approval of the 737 TRG/CC.
   7.5.4. Coordinates (if designated by 2 AF as the OPR) CCs for standardized faculty
   development courses with other groups before approving CCs.
   7.5.5. Emails final unclassified course charts to the following organizations: CCAF/DFCA
   (Note: Email CC with POI to CCAF.CD@Maxwell.AF.Mil at least 30 days prior to course
   start); MAJCOM formal training section; AFSAT/TOIS for Type 3 and 8 courses; local
   registrar (982 TRG exempt); local evaluations office (982 TRG exempt); local manpower
   and organization flight for Types 2, 3, and 7 courses (982 TRG AFSC awarding courses
   only); HQ AETC/A3T (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical AFSCs); and AFCFM (982 TRG
   AFSC awarding courses only).

  7.5.6. Sends classified CCs and POIs together to AU/SSO, Attention: CCAF, 401 Chennault
  Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6428.
  7.5.7. Maintains CC record sets in the course design and development database, where
  installed. Where TTMS is not installed, maintain electronic or paper record sets.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     55

              PLANS OF INSTRUCTION (POI) AND LESSON PLANS (LP)

8.1. Purpose. The POI is a course control document, organized by blocks and units in the
preferred sequence of instruction. It lists the course objectives, needed support materials, and
training time apportionment. Actual instruction times may vary due to class size or student
ability differences. When separated into units of instruction, the POI becomes Part I of the lesson
plan.
   8.1.1. The POI includes a nonmeasured orientation (BMT covers overview and
   administration information through a series of weekly training briefings and orientations).
   Orientation covers at least the following:
       8.1.1.1. Course overview and administration.
       8.1.1.2. Student feedback program.
       8.1.1.3. Effective study techniques (airman basic resident and enlisted prerequisite
       resident courses only).
       8.1.1.4. CCAF benefits and credits, if applicable (enlisted courses and officer courses
       attended by enlisted members).
       8.1.1.5. Instructional material types and uses.
       8.1.1.6. Training material, resource, and energy conservation.
       8.1.1.7. Training environment safety (including chemical and/or radiation hazards, when
       appropriate).
       8.1.1.8. Air Force fraud, waste, and abuse prevention and detection.
       8.1.1.9. Sexual harassment and assault reporting, professional relationships, and hazing
       (describe required conduct standards and point out AETCVA 36-6, Points of Contact for
       Students and Trainees [AETC VA36-6 not required for Types 6 and 7 courses]).
Note: Type 6 course orientation includes paragraphs 8.1.1.1, 8.1.1.2, 8.1.1.4, and others if
applicable.
8.2. Development:
   8.2.1. Prepare a POI for all formal courses developed and conducted by AETC.
       8.2.1.1. Delete
       8.2.1.2. Delete
       8.2.1.3. Delete.
   8.2.2. Ensure the POI is approved before the first class starts.
   8.2.3. Ensure field trips and outside the classroom visits support specific objectives as
   necessary training activities. In the instructional guidance, identify how objectives will be
   met and measured if the field trip cannot be accomplished.
56                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


  8.2.4. Do not revise a POI for minor changes that will not affect training resources or change
  the TS level of support. The following guidelines apply for minor changes:
     8.2.4.1. To approve changes, the TDE chief initials the annotated record set copy, or
     places an electronically signed email in the folder (for electronic record sets).
     8.2.4.2. The OPR forwards updated information to applicable offices to ensure all POIs
     correspond with the record set.
     8.2.4.3. Incorporate all annotations into the next published change.
  8.2.5. The following guidance applies to POI preparation:
     8.2.5.1. Integrate the following:
         8.2.5.1.1. Job-oriented Safety. See applicable AFOSH standards.
         8.2.5.1.2. Environmental issues. Include pollution prevention awareness.
         8.2.5.1.3. Publications Awareness. Emphasize that compliance with instructions is
         mandatory.
         8.2.5.1.4. Risk Management (RM). Where               appropriate,   weave    principles
         throughout the core curriculum in all courses.
             8.2.5.1.4.1. For each teaching step or activity involving any hazard that could
             cause mission degradation, injury, illness, or system damage, and for AFSCs
             1C2X1, 1C4X1, 1T2X1, 1W0X2, 13DX, and 13LX include RM assessment
             worksheet(s) from the training plan or course record set (for courses not requiring
             training plans, e.g. Type 2) in the POI instructional guidance or as an attachment
             to the POI. Use the RM worksheet to assess the activity and include RM
             reference in instructional guidance. Note: Each time the activity is conducted,
             perform an RM assessment based on current conditions. RM guidance must be
             detailed and provide faculty and staff with risk mitigation, or risk control
             measures, by activity. (See attachment 16for an example of the specificity
             required.)
             8.2.5.1.4.2. The training group will determine where ORM tags are placed in the
             LP, Part I and/or Part II. This applies when teaching steps are not part of the
             instructional design of the course and for T.O.-based courses.
             8.2.5.1.4.3. TRGs develop local procedures to perform RM assessment based on
             current conditions each time the affected activity is conducted.
         8.2.5.1.5. Air Force Doctrine. Air Force instructors (active duty and civilian) will
         introduce Air Force doctrine to Air Force students in all initial skills courses.
         Examples of ways to integrate doctrine are provided by the Air Force Doctrine
         Center. Also see AFI 10-1302, Air and Space Doctrine Education.
     8.2.5.2. Instructional guidance must require instructors to present Air Force core values
     to all Air Force students. Throughout the course instructors will weave core values
     information into the curriculum. Use active learning techniques, called modeling,
     including one-way stories, guided discussions, two-way stories, simulations, personal
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 57


       experiences, and case studies. Instructor discretion determines which technique to use
       and when it will be presented.
       8.2.5.3. Integrate the Air Force technical data system and other AFSC applicable
       publications throughout the course.
       8.2.5.4. Integrate physical conditioning standards as BMT curriculum performance
       objectives. See AFI 10-248, Fitness Program, for current standards.
   8.2.6. Include one or more objectives in each instructional unit or module, except the
   introductory unit. Supporting teaching steps are optional.
   8.2.7. Refer each objective to the TS element(s) supported, and underline the element at
   which point students attain the TS specified proficiency level/behavior.
       8.2.7.1. An objective using previously taught skills or knowledge will not refer to that
       TS element unless accomplishing the objective results in a planned proficiency increase.
       8.2.7.2. Do not underline (finalize) an STS or CTS item more than once, or use an
       underlined reference again in the planned sequence of instruction. Note: This does not
       prohibit future lesson use of knowledge and skills learned and measured in previous
       blocks or WOT.
       8.2.7.3. Document the POI to TS correlation to illustrate in the measurement plan which
       objectives support and satisfy each TS element. Prepare a TS–to-POI correlation for Type
       4 courses. The measurement plan will serve as a TS-to-POI correlation.
   8.2.8. Use the following codes to indicate the type of student measurement for each
   objective: PC - progress check; P - performance test; W - written measurement.
   8.2.9. Show support materials and guidance for each instruction unit or module. Guidance
   should include the MIR/student ratio, MIR hours required, how MIR will be used, when to
   accomplish progress checks, and general lesson conduct.
   8.2.10. Instructional guidance should contain enough support information to enable new
   instructors to present each objective effectively and efficiently.
   8.2.11. Describe how and when motivational training may be applied within each unit of
   instruction. List approved methods, limitations and desired results.
   8.2.12. Use the TTMS POI template or AETC Form 133, Plan of Instruction Lesson Plan -
   Part I, if TTMS is not available. A computer-generated document may be used if all required
   information is included and appropriately identified.
   8.2.13. When two or more courses have identical contents (piggyback courses or an MTT),
   identify in a separate memo which is the parent course and which piggyback courses will be
   taught using the parent course documents. Piggyback courses will need separate TTMS
   builds/flows. When officers and enlisted personnel attend a course, separate course numbers
   and course builds are required to ensure accurate student tracking and accounting (does not
   apply to foreign officers).
8.3. POI Responsibilities. Provide POI development guidance, expertise, and oversight; print
and distribute POIs; approve new/revised POIs and POI changes prior to use (curriculum
 58                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


manager is 982 TRG authority); maintain electronic or paper POI record sets (it is not necessary
to maintain a copy of a published document and camera-ready copy of the same document).
8.4. Distribution. Email     unclassified  POIs    and    POI    changes    to  CCAF
(ccaf.cd@maxwell.af.mil), the specialty AFCFM, the local manpower office, HQ AETC/SGU
(for medical courses) and HQ AETC/A3TM (982 TRG courses).
8.5. Classified POIs. Do not compromise the qualitative requirements for the administrative
convenience of using an unclassified document. Prepare classified POIs according to security
directives and local procedures. Modify covers for classified publications to comply with
security directives. For classified courses that have unclassified POIs with security markings
indicating course content classification level, include a statement at the bottom of each POI page
to explain that markings on the page do not refer to POI content. Note: Forward classified POIs
and course charts together to AU/SSO, Attention: CCAF, 401 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB
AL 36112-6428.
8.6. Multiple Instructor Requirement:
   8.6.1. List MIR utilization       under    support   materials   and    guidance.   Example:
   Safety/Supervision (3).
   8.6.2. Use only qualified personnel as primary instructors or to certify student course
   objective achievement. An individual who has not completed the basic instructor course or
   military training instructor school, and who is not subject-matter qualified may be used to
   satisfy such MIRs as safety. Do not use students to fulfill the MIR.
   8.6.3. The training flight/detachment commander or chief may waive the POI MIR
   requirement. The waiver must be in writing and applicable for one class providing the unit
   objectives can still be achieved. This may require a training day extension or other
   temporary training situation modification. The training flight/detachment maintains MIR
   waiver records for 12 months. Subsequent waivers for classes in the same course require
   Squadron Commander approval (cannot be delegated)
   8.6.4. If the MIR cannot be met and a waiver is not granted, training will not be conducted
   and a training deficiency will exist.
8.7. LP Part II, Teaching Guide:
   8.7.1. An LP is a detailed outline of information and activities used by instructors to conduct
   the training prescribed in the POI. Use the corresponding POI page as the LP cover page. The
   POI page indicates LP approval.
   8.7.2. The instructor uses the LP to guide training activities. An LP is not required for Type
   6 courses designed for use without an instructor. There are three types of LPs: Master,
   personalized, and station.
       8.7.2.1. A master LP is not personalized, and is used to control and standardize course
       instruction (except courses taught only once or twice a year). It is the standard against
       which instructor supervisors check all individual instructor LPs. Maintain at least one set
       of LPs at the course level. This set may be the master LP unless the master set is
       maintained elsewhere. The master LP does not require a signature, and may be on
       computer, electronic media, or in TTMS. Merging Part I and II is not required for
       electronic master LPs.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     59


     8.7.2.2. A personalized LP includes information to aid the instructor and supplement the
     master LP. When signed by the supervisor, the LP is determined to be accurate,
     applicable and adequate for presentation, and the instructor is authorized to teach from it.
     8.7.2.3. A station LP is an LP that can be used by anyone teaching the lesson. It is
     particularly useful when teaching classified information since additional information
     changes classification. A station LP may include support material and must be signed by
     the Instructor Supervisor.
  8.7.3. An approved LP has been reviewed at least annually by the instructor supervisor who
  certifies the following:
     8.7.3.1. The LP is current and adequately outlines the subject covered.
     8.7.3.2. The LP includes adequate support material for student objective achievement.
     8.7.3.3. The LP includes adequate technical information for standardized objective
     instruction.
     8.7.3.4. Personalized LP information is accurate, applicable and adequate.
  8.7.4. Each training activity must be based on a learning objective.
  8.7.5. Each instructor will use an LP identifying the approved training activities.
  8.7.6. The primary instructor must have an LP approved by the instructor supervisor in the
  C/L. Supervisors may use a subordinate's lesson plan if substituting during an unexpected
  primary instructor absence.
  8.7.7. Instructors may use station LPs where authorized, but personalized LPs are
  encouraged. Personalization must include entries for the introduction and conclusion, and
  right column entries that amplify and relate to the teaching steps.
  8.7.8. Prepare an LP to guide training activities, even if a POI is not required.
  8.7.9. An LP is not required for units of instruction or objectives presented by a guest
  lecturer (a person not affiliated with the course). However, a list of objectives is required.
  8.7.10. For courses taught entirely by guest lecturers, prepare a brief outline of the points the
  lecturer is expected to cover. Also, prepare an alternate plan for use in the lecturer‘s absence.
  8.7.11. Use a three-part format for LPs. Course time is tagged to objectives and aggregated
  to the unit, block, and course. The introduction, body, and conclusion do not have specific
  time allocations. Include student break time in accordance with paragraph 7.1.2.
     8.7.11.1. Introduction. Includes a review (as appropriate), attention, overview,
     motivation (use 2 AF developed warrior ethos vignettes as the motivation step for the
     first hour of instruction daily), and transition. Classified courses include classification
     level statement during introduction.
     8.7.11.2. Body. Includes the presentation, application, and evaluation, as applicable.
     BMT may add processing, fitness, personal needs, transit, and other topics, as applicable.
     Identify instruction methods in the lesson plan.
     8.7.11.3. Conclusion. Includes a summary, study assignments, remotivation, and
     closing. Classified courses include a classification reminder in the conclusion.

   8.7.12. Use the TTMS 2-column or 2-page format LP outline. Identify course objectives,
   teaching steps, technical information (including testable information) in the left column.
   Support material and personalization go in the right column of the 2-column format, and on
   the second page of the 2-page format. Note: When using a 2-page format for BMT,
   personalize in the right margin rather than on a blank page.
   8.7.13. Include sufficiently detailed support elements with each objective and teaching step
   to facilitate beginning instructor use. Indicate planned instructional aide use. All teaching
   steps involving any hazard that could cause mission degradation, injury, illness, or system
   damage and AFSCs 1C2X1, 1C4X1, 1T2X1, 1W0X2, 13DX, 13LX will be identified with
   an RM tag in the TTMS course design and development database. Include a reference in the
   right column or right page of the lesson plan to the RM assessment worksheet found in the
   POI instructional guidance, or as a POI attachment (see Attachment 16). The level by which
   the RM tags are identified in LP, Part I or LP II will be determined by the training group
   when teaching steps are not part of the instructional design of the course, and for T.O. based
   courses. Note: Each time the activity is conducted, perform an RM assessment based on
   current conditions. RM guidance must be detailed and provide faculty and staff with risk
   mitigation, or risk control measures, by activity (See attachment 16). TRGs develop local
   procedures to perform RM assessment based on current conditions each time the affected
   activity is conducted. Maintain assessment until the training plan is superseded.

   8.7.14. Identify station LPs as such, i.e., used by all instructors at a station, lab, or position.
   It is not personalized.
   8.7.15. To identify personalized LPs, enter the instructor‘s name in the POI template or
   AETC Form 133 name block. Personalized LPs will include entries in addition to the
   introduction and conclusion.
   8.7.16. When a course includes a field trip, visit, or symposium away from the course
   environment, describe its purpose and content in the LP.
8.8. LP Responsibilities. Provide LP development guidance, expertise, and oversight; specify
coordination and approval procedures; establish LP currency control procedures; maintain all LP

   9.3.3. Organize simply. Avoid complicated subparagraphs (convert to main paragraphs if
   possible).
   9.3.4. Illustrate text when appropriate. Well-placed illustrations make text easier to read and
   understand.
   9.3.5. Write clear, descriptive titles for figures, paragraphs, and chapters. Be specific and
   avoid one-word titles. Position illustrations as near as possible to the first paragraph that
   refers to the illustration. Always reference the figure before it appears in the text.
   9.3.6. Edit carefully and rewrite to improve readability. Replace multi-syllable words with
   shorter words to improve clarity and readability.
   9.3.7. Spell out each acronym on first use. Spell out lengthy and uncommon acronyms
   intermittently to help students learn acronyms more quickly.
   9.3.8. Provide a bibliography for referenced material. Follow copyright laws.

   9.4.8. Does not imply in any way that the Air Force endorses, favors, or restricts the use of a
   commercial product, commodity, or service.
   9.4.9. Does not include classified information unless it is an authorized classified lesson.
   Prepare classified student instructional materials according to appropriate security directives.
   9.4.10. Does not included copyrighted material without a release from the copyright holder.
   Refer to AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property - Patents, Patent Related Matters, Trademarks,
   and Copyrights, and to the Staff Judge Advocate for proper procedures concerning use and of
   copyrighted and trademarked material.
       9.4.10.1. Retain a copyright releases on file. Provide a copy to SAF/GCQ, in accordance
       with AFI 51-303.
       9.4.10.2. Do not reproduce copyrighted material from Air Force or other government
       publications without obtaining a separate release.

   Summary Sheet; memorandum, etc.).
       9.4.11.1. Annotate record if classified material is used.
       9.4.11.2. Annotate record if document contains copyrighted material. Identify the
       copyright release location.
9.5. Printing and Distribution:
   9.5.1. Requests for AETC training materials from another Air Force or Government agency
   must be coordinated through the requesting agency‘s parent major command and submitted
   to HQ AETC/A2/3/10 TPM (HQ AETC/A3T/A3R/A3Z) as appropriate. Appropriate HQ
   AETC division will coordinate with the TRG TM to make the release determination. For
   copyrighted materials, refer to the original copyright owner prior to release.
   9.5.2. AETC will not release any AETC-designed measurement devices.
   9.5.3. Contractors supporting courseware development may request existing training
   materials if their statement of work specifically states access requirement. Excerpts from the
   SOW that reference the requirement must accompany the request. Fill all other general
   public requests (such as from contractors without a documented statement of work) as
   prescribed in DOD 5400.7-R, Freedom of Information Act Program.
9.6. Cost Effectiveness:
   9.6.1. When possible, use available standard or specialized publications, such as AFIs and
   TOs, rather than locally developed student instructional materials. Extract, for reproduction
 64                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   only, those pages necessary for training. Use commercial publications (such as textbooks or
   reference books) when they support course objectives.
   9.6.2. TOs, specialized publications, technical data extracts, and commercial publications
   should be as current as those in an operational unit. Maintain current training libraries unless
   changes adversely affect training equipment, objectives, techniques, or curriculum
   compatibility. Maintain a current master reference copy of each training library title in the
   flight, squadron, or family group. TOs and publications used for subject-knowledge
   objectives only may be outdated. Mark outdated publications and TOs that are not current
   with the TO catalog as "For Training Purposes Only." The TDE and SMEs will review TO
   and publication changes for curriculum compatibility. TO and publication updates that are
   not compatible with training equipment, objectives, techniques employed or that affect
   curriculum are not filed until equipment and/or curriculum is updated. Continue to file
   subsequent safety and other significant changes. If numerous TOs and publications are used
   in the same flight, squadron, or family group, maintain only one master reference copy. Mark
   others as ―For Training Purposes Only." Periodically review TOs marked "For Training
   Purposes Only" to ensure all safety and significant changes are posted. TOs and publications
   used by the 982 TRG to train tasks to the performance level must be current. Technical data
   extracts used to support performance objectives must be from current TOs and publications.
   9.6.3. Reuse locally developed student instructional materials when possible.
9.7. Technical Data. When Air Force technical data use is required for job performance,
integrate technical data use throughout the course. Students must use TOs, inspection work
cards, and checklists during system, subsystem, and support equipment operation and
maintenance. Maintain technical data as directed by Air Force.
9.8. Preparation:
   9.8.1. For detailed guidance on preparing student instructional materials, consult the
   technical writer resident course. Build the document shell with the course design and
   development database template, and edit as necessary. When using the database, the TTMS
   template is the standard, but does not add the disclaimer or supersession line on all
   documents (see paragraph 9.8.2).
   9.8.2. Prepare the cover of all locally developed training literature on bond paper (if for
   printing) and include the following:
      9.8.2.1. Type of student training material: Study guide (SG); workbook (WB); student
      text (ST); student handout (HO); appraisal (A); study guide and workbook, (SW);
      programmed text (PT).
      9.8.2.2. Course identifiers for courses supported.
      9.8.2.3. Text title.
      9.8.2.4. Publication date.
      9.8.2.5. OPR identification.

      Note: Not required on Technical Writer Resident Course instructional materials.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                        65


       9.8.2.7. Supersession line at the bottom of the title page, the first page, or the (i) page. If
       the document does not supersede a previous document state ―None.‖
       9.8.2.8. Bibliography of referenced materials. When the document includes copyrighted
       material, include a copyright statement on the cover page. Specific requirements may be
       identified by the copyright release grantor.
   9.8.3. Order at least a 12-month supply of instructional materials if changes are not
   anticipated and storage space is available. If documents are exceptionally large, subject to
   frequent change, storage space is limited, or funding is limited document and order as
   required.
   9.8.4. To develop computer-based instruction materials, use AFH 36-2235, Volume 5,
   Information for Designers of Instructional Systems – Advanced Distance Learning:
   Instructional Technology and Distance Learning.
9.9. Annual Review. OPRs conduct an annual review and/or special review before reproducing
course materials to maintain material currency. If required locally, OPRs record results in the
annual course review. Reviews are documented by memorandum, course, or self-inspections. All
Type 6 course materials will be reviewed annually. Annual reviews may be incorporated into the
ARTT process.
9.10. Responsibilities. Establish procedures that comply with the guidelines established in this
instruction to develop and use locally prepared student instructional materials. Maintain
electronic or paper locally developed instructional material record sets.
9.11. Type 6 DL. When possible, distribute suitable technical training courses or portions of
courses to students at their duty locations to reduce TDY-to-school expenditures and student
time away from home station. Prepare DL instructional materials as outlined in this instruction,
considering design, delivery characteristics, and management. See AFH 36-2235, Volume 5,
Information for Designers of Advanced Distributed Learning: Instructional Technology and
Distance Learning; AETCI 36-2208, and AETCI 36-2209.
9.12. Type 6 DL Instructional Materials:
   9.12.1. AETC offers exported courses as an alternative to resident training. Training
   materials include a variety of media such as paper, interactive multimedia courseware, ITV,
   Internet-based instruction, or video tape. Analyze media options to match the appropriate
   media with each lesson objective. Frequently courses use a combination of media.
   9.12.2. Avoid lengthy instructions. ITV, where the instructor is conducting a course from a
   different location, instructions should be easy to follow. Use broadcast time primarily for
   training. Use the DL POC or student handouts as much as possible to cover administrative
   issues.
9.13. Type 6 DL Responsibilities. The TRG or designated level within the group will:
   9.13.1. Establish a group DL POC to work DL issues, according to AETCI 36-2208.
   9.13.2. Establish procedures for analyzing, developing, delivering, and using DL
   instructional materials, according to AETCI 36-2208 and AETCI 36-2209.
66                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


  9.13.3. Keep record sets of locally developed DL materials (paper-based or electronic). It is
  not necessary to maintain a copy of the published document and the camera-ready copy of
  the same document.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     67

                                VALIDATION OF COURSES

10.1. Purpose:
   10.1.1. Helps identify and correct instructional system imperfections. Use the validation
   process to determine if instructional system content, sequence, methods, and media decisions
   are sound. Decisions are sound if minimal time, money and other resource investments result
   in desired student behavior changes.
   10.1.2. Ideally, validation is a concurrent and continual process applied as course portions
   are developed. Validation planning begins early in course development, addressing all
   aspects of the course efforts.
10.2. Procedures:
   10.2.1. Base validation primarily on student accomplishment of each objective. Consider
   comments from students and instructors who have completed the instruction.
   10.2.2. Before students arrive, validate as much of the course as possible, such as content,
   sequence of objectives, visual aids, and training media.
   10.2.3. Tentative course documents and student materials may be used until course
   validation is completed, appropriate course changes have been made, and final documents are
   published. Write-in changes, based on interim validation findings, are authorized with OPR
   concurrence. Use a formal POI change memorandum for write-in changes. When course
   validation is completed, have the local MO re-price any course parameter changes, and
   include in the training plan.
   10.2.4. Parent course validation validates piggyback course if the piggyback course has not
   changed.
10.3. Planning:
   10.3.1. Use at least three classes for validation. Fewer may be used if a three-class validation
   would take more than a year to complete. For Type 6 self-paced courses, validation requires
   at least 30 students. IVT course validation requires at least three broadcasts with a minimum
   of 30 students. Conduct validation classes under actual training conditions. Validate new
   courses and major revisions that will be taught more than twice. Use the minimum number of
   classes to validate the course and measurement.
   10.3.2. Validation planning should address significant course development aspects, such as
   instructional methods and materials, time allocation, training equipment, alternate delivery
   and training media selection, and measurement. The plan tailors the process to development
   specifics. For example, if only one course block is revised, plan to validate only that block
   unless the changed block has a significant impact on course flow and sequence. Validation
   plans include the following:
      10.3.2.1. Start and end dates, and classes to be used.
      10.3.2.2. Blocks, modules, and units to be validated.
      10.3.2.3. Data to be collected and means of collection.
 68                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


       10.3.2.4. Who will analyze the data and prepare the validation summary report.
10.4. Data Collection and Analysis:
   10.4.1. Collect at least the following data during validation classes:
       10.4.1.1. Student feedback data. Include student comments about course strengths and
       weaknesses.
       10.4.1.2. Document training development and instructor personnel comments and
       recommendations relating to items examined during validation.
       10.4.1.3. Measurement data, including appraisal results (kept only during validation
       period); progress check results, written measurement results on completed AETC Form
       668 or a computerized test analysis; and performance test results on completed AETC
       Form 98 or locally approved checklist.
       10.4.1.4. Student washback and academic elimination data.
       10.4.1.5. Student remediation data (summary of specific objective remedial training).
       10.4.1.6. Resource problems or utilization data; summarize shortfalls or constraints.
       10.4.1.7. Student background data.
   10.4.2. Analyze data to determine if course design, instruction, equipment, and/or materials
   meet objectives. Have SMEs check lessons for technical accuracy. Analysis should
   substantiate that time allocations and objectives are appropriate, especially for self-paced,
   supervised study, and directed study portions.
10.5. Reports. A validation report documents actions taken to improve the course, and helps
prevent duplication of effort. Complete the validation report within 30 work days after
completion of the last validation class.
   10.5.1. Ensure the validation report includes the following:
       10.5.1.1. Process summary. Include validation plan variations (with reasons for the
       variations, number of classes, and students used), and control document and instructional
       material interim changes made during validation.
       10.5.1.2. Constraints. Identify any known resource constraints before or during
       validation.
       10.5.1.3. Significant findings summary. Include the number of washbacks and
       eliminations, the block or unit where the action occurred, and time allocations,
       instructional materials, and instructor adequacy.
       10.5.1.4. Conclusions and corrective actions. Summarize the validation process ability to
       provide data needed to finalize the course. Include changes needed to finalize control
       documents, instructional materials and equipment, and actions taken or planned. Identify
       the final POI planned implementation date, recommended open item estimated
       completion dates, and the POC who should correct findings.
   10.5.2. When possible, correct problems identified during validation before teaching the
   course again. Finalize course documents within 90 days of graduation of the last validation
   class, if possible.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 69


   10.5.3. Maintain the validation report with the TM course record set. After the validation
   report is written, source data need not be maintained.
10.6. Responsibilities. TRGs or designated levels establish procedures to validate courses, and
ensure problems are identified, corrected, and documented.
10.7. Delete.

                                TRAINING DEFICIENCIES

11.1. Purpose. Report training deficiencies to alert managerial personnel and gaining
organizations if students did not receive the training documented in the training standard.
11.2. Training Deficiency Report:
   11.2.1. When a training deficiency occurs, submit a training deficiency report to 2
   AF/TTOC, HQ AETC/A3T, (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical AFSCs), and AFCFM (see
   Attachment 13 and Attachment 14). When training specified in the training standard cannot
   be provided before graduation, submit a training deficiency memo to the student's gaining
   organization. Annotate the deficiency in the TTMS student training report remarks section or
   on an AETC Form 156. Include the training standard number, date, and paragraph reference
   for which training was deficient; the proficiency code level required; the level of training
   provided; the number of deficient training hours; corrective action taken or planned; and the
   expected completion date.
       11.2.1.1. For training deficiencies expected to exist longer than one class, submit the
       memo after the first class graduates. Include the projected number of students and classes
       that will be affected through the remainder of the fiscal year.
       11.2.1.2. When a training deficiency is corrected, send a written notice of deficiency
       termination to the original report addressees.
11.3. Responsibilities:
   11.3.1. 2 AF provides support to correct equipment, personnel and facility-related
   deficiencies. HQ AETC/SGNU provides support for medical AFSCs.
   11.3.2. The TRG or designated level establishes procedures to report training deficiencies,
   and to correct deficiencies when they occur.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                   71


                                          Chapter 12

                        NONRESIDENT TRAINING MATERIALS

12.1. Purpose. Used at operational bases by students in self-study, group-study or combination
mode. Materials may support CDCs or SCs. Note: These training materials are not procured
through or approved by the publications manager.
   12.1.1. TRG SMEs prepare Air Force CDCs, SCs and other training materials, which are
   used Air Force wide. The terms preparing agency and training group are interchangeable.
   12.1.2. All preparing agencies (except Goodfellow AFB for cryptologic and certain other
   CDCs) send their CDC and SC manuscripts to AU/A4L for educational review, edit, test
   construction, publication, and administration. Goodfellow AFB reviews, edits, and distributes
   cryptologic and certain other CDCs, while AU/A4L handles unclassified aspects of CDC
   administration, including enrollment, activation, deactivation, end of course automated test
   correction and reporting via answer sheet, pass/fail course trend analysis, and publication of
   CDC advertisement catalog entries.
12.2. Nonresident Materials:
   12.2.1. CDCs. Self-study distance learning courses that provide airmen with fundamental
   AFS knowledge. CDCs directly support the Air Force OJT program and WAPS SKTs.
   12.2.2. SCs. Self-study distance learning courses that extend Air Force school educational
   and training capabilities to eligible personnel worldwide. Used to meet requirements outside
   the scope of CDCs. Note: Type 6 DL is not included in this chapter because TRWs prepare,
   distribute, and administer Type 6 course materials according to AETCI 36-2208 and as
   prescribed in other applicable sections of this instruction.
12.3. Air Force OJT Program Support:
   12.3.1. CDCs provide career knowledge upgrade requirements listed and coded in the
   current STS.
   12.3.2. CDCs furnish only the career knowledge component of STS tasks. When CDC
   content cannot be developed to correlate with STS knowledge levels, document the reasons
   in the CDC case management file. Consult AU/A4L about using multimedia enhancements
   to achieve designated proficiency codes and knowledge levels.
   12.3.3. Notify the AFCFM if STS requirements in the CDC columns cannot be achieved,
   requiring an STS revision.
12.4. CDC Requirements:
   12.4.1. A current and accurate CDC is integral to an AFS. Therefore, consider CDCs during
   training planning, STS preparation and at U&TWs. An AU/A4L representative and CDC
   writers should participate in these processes.
   12.4.2. Establish and document a CDC requirement in the CFETP, including a customer
   need date. When a CDC requirement is generated by factors that do not result in a new or
   revised STS or CFETP, the AFCFM must approve in writing.
 72                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


       12.4.2.1. CDCs are mandatory for all AFS 5-skill levels, unless waived by appropriate
       AFCFM.
       12.4.2.2. Do not create CDCs solely to support SKT development.
   12.4.3. When considering a CDC or SC as an option to meet training needs, see paragraphs
   4.4.6.6.2 through 4.4.6.6.2.3, and consider the following additional factors:
       12.4.3.1. AFS future population trend.
       12.4.3.2. Proposed subject matter security classification.
       12.4.3.3. AFS life-cycle training requirements.
       12.4.3.4. Number of current STS items that require knowledge upgrade.
       12.4.3.5. CDC scope relative to resources required.
       12.4.3.6. Available material from other services that will satisfy Air Force OJT and SKT
       requirements.
       12.4.3.7. Number of personnel who will use the CDC.
       12.4.3.8. Using command available in-house training.
       12.4.3.9. Type of AFS. If equipment oriented or procedurally oriented and subject to
       frequent change, consider Air Force inventory equipment stability.
12.5. Writer Resources. See AFI 36-2101 for writer qualifications, selection, and assignments
criteria. Positions are authorized in the TRGs to support CDC-related projects, but management
action is essential to ensure trained personnel are available for mission accomplishment.
   12.5.1. Early identification of the need for and assignment of qualified personnel to a CDC
   project is essential to OJT and SKT programs. Resource requirements must also be
   considered. CDC writers attend training identified in AETCI 36-2202, Faculty Development
   and Master Instructor Programs. CDC writers should also attend MECI100, Course for
   Authors, as soon as practical.
   12.5.2. CDC writers earn the designation ―SEI 386, Instructional Materials Writer
   Manager,‖ after completing E6AILTXXXX 0C1A, Career Development Course (CDC)
   Writer, and 6 months of satisfactory writing experience.
   12.5.3. TRGs may request MAJCOM help prepare a new or revised CDC.
   12.5.4. During preproduction and production, CDC writers will not perform duties that
   negatively impact approved course chart submission dates. CDC writers will provide
   squadron leaders and the group CDC manager with a monthly production status update, and
   will notify them immediately of potential delays.
12.6. General Preparation. The AU/A4L Guide for Authors establishes CDC preparation
standards.
   12.6.1. Approving Official Certification. The TM uses AETC Form 107 to approve a
   CDC or SC issue or continuance, and certifies the publication. Certification criteria include
   the following:
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                73


     12.6.1.1. Air Force mission necessity, and consistent with Air Force doctrine, existing
     law, and national, DoD, and Air Force policies.
     12.6.1.2. Current, technically accurate, and adequate.
     12.6.1.3. Directed to a specific audience.
     12.6.1.4. Does not include information that conflicts with, belongs in, or duplicates
     another publication.
     12.6.1.5. Does not include training offered locally, or through any PME or ancillary
     training in an Airman's career.
     12.6.1.6. Does not include information that could adversely affect public opinion.
     12.6.1.7. Uses gender-neutral language; maintains propriety and good taste.
     12.6.1.8. Does not imply the Air Force endorses, favors, or restricts commercial product,
     commodity, or service use.
     12.6.1.9. Does not include copyrighted material without a legal release.
     12.6.1.10. Does not include classified information unless necessary. Classified CDCs
     must be properly marked and controlled according to applicable security directives.
     12.6.1.11. Covers all required STS items to the correct proficiency levels.
  12.6.2. Job Safety. Integrate job safety training throughout the publication.
  12.6.3. Copyrighted Material. Obtain permission to use copyrighted material during the
  writing project planning stage. Keep releases on file. Provide CDC and SC release copies to
  AU/A4L, and a copy with the manuscript to SAF/GCQ, according to AFI 51-303. Refer to
  AFI 51-303 and to the Staff Judge Advocate for proper procedures concerning use, and
  obtaining releases for use, of copyrighted material and trademarks.
  12.6.4. Classified Material. Prepare classified publications according to Air Force and
  DoD security requirements. Ensure manuscripts processed through AU/A4L do not contain
  classified information.
  12.6.5. Content and Preparation. CDCs provide AFS career knowledge and support
  WAPS/SKTs. CDCs are specialty oriented and do not teach specific equipment, weapons
  systems, or work centers (except career ladders with multiple AFSs or AFSC shreds).
     12.6.5.1. CDCs should contain enough information to illustrate basic principles,
     techniques, and procedures, and how they apply to common AFS systems and situations.
     CDCs may address specific equipment items only when a piece or type of equipment best
     illustrates procedures or techniques useful to the overall AFS.
         12.6.5.1.1. CDCs must provide enough information to meet STS proficiency codes to
         ensure the correct training level is provided.
         12.6.5.1.2. Unit review exercises and CEs must also measure material to the correct
         STS proficiency level.
     12.6.5.2. Content may include a knowledge review to introduce new material or
     reinforce previously learned material.
 74                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


       12.6.5.3. Design CDCs as self-contained packages. Trainees should be able to complete
       the entire package without referring to outside sources, except classified CDCs.
       12.6.5.4. Career ladders with multiple AFSs and/or shreds have STS tasks common to
       several or all ladder specialties. Some STS tasks are common to two or more related
       career ladders. Identify and organize such common task information into common
       sections, chapters, or volumes, and then designate those as applicable to the appropriate
       CDCs. Common material normally addresses several subjects and has limited application.
       Identify common material to AU/A4L.
12.7. CDC Deactivation. Deactivation requires AFCFM approval. When a course review,
U&TW, or other event identifies a CDC as no longer required, the preparing agency sends the
deactivation rationale and alternate study references to the appropriate AFCFM. AFI 36-2201,
Volume 5, explains CDC activation and deactivation procedures. If approved, the AFCFM
instructs AU/A4L to deactivate the course, and requests HQ AFPC/DPPAT submit a training
requirements message to field units. Note: Coordinate all messages pertaining to CDC activation
and deactivation with AU/A4L prior to field release.
12.8. Need Dates:
   12.8.1. A command goal is to produce quality nonresident training materials by customer
   need dates.
   12.8.2. Ideally, CDC projects resulting from an STS change that also impact resident
   training should be activated by the graduation date of the first students from the associated
   resident course.
   12.8.3. CDC production involves two critical dates: 1) CDC delivery date, by which time the
   CDC writer must deliver the final CDC volume or its subset to AU/A4L; 2) customer need
   date, by which time the CDC should be available in the field.
   12.8.4. The AFCFM normally establishes the customer need date for the CDC in the CFETP
   and U&TW minutes after consulting with TM, AU/A4L, and CDC writer to ensure that
   customer need date can be realistically achieved.
   12.8.5. To meet the customer need date, the CDC writer establishes dates to deliver new and
   revised volumes to AU/A4L, based on estimates in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5. The CDC writer
   identifies time compression or delay sources that may affect delivery dates. The AFCFM
   may authorize adjustments. Note: An actual CDC activation date depends on all volumes
   being printed and available for distribution. AU/A4L will activate a course as close to the
   need date as possible, but a precise date may not be feasible.
   12.8.6. Document the customer need date, delivery to AU/A4L date, and manuscript
   submission dates in the CDC CC, AETC Form 469, Career Development Course Chart, and
   the production plan (See Attachment 11 for instructions). When AETC Form 469 is, not
   used, the replacement form or document should be similar enough that receiving
   organizations will understand it. Provide copies of all course documents to AU/A4L and
   AFOMS/TE, which track CDC production.
   12.8.7. Change supplements are normally prepared within 30 calendar days from an
   identified need. Unless a safety issue or pressing technical requirement exists, add
   supplements to course materials the next time the course is packed. Prepare AETC Form 469
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                    75


   and send copies to AU/A4L and AFOMS/TE 30 calendar days before submitting a change
   supplement to AU/A4L.
   12.8.8. The TRS commander approves AETC Form 469, ensuring proposed manuscript
   submission dates support desired activation dates, or are prepared as quickly as the scope,
   project complexity, writer availability, and other factors allow. The CDC writer or TDE
   notifies the TM of any submission date deviations. If submission dates cannot be met, the
   TRS commander signs a production slippage memorandum that includes a revised
   production plan with new submission dates and an explanation of factors that affected
   production. If the customer-need date agreed upon at the U&TW cannot be met, the TM
   notifies the AFCFM.
12.9. Volume Revisions and Changes. Revise individual volumes when posting changes to the
entire course (excluding typographical errors) takes more than an hour. After determining the
extent a CDC must be revised or upon identifying new CDC content, and before preparing text
or illustrations, contact the AU/A4L course development team to discuss the most efficient
preparation strategy.
12.10. Priority Processing:
   12.10.1. When a CDC revision is considered critical, the preparing agency sends a written
   priority assignment request through the TM to AU/A4L. The request must include
   justification to support the requirement.
   12.10.2. Changes that affect personnel safety or may result in equipment damage are
   authorized first priority and do not require separate action. The preparing agency submits a
   change marked ―first priority‖ and submits the priority request memorandum of transmittal to
   AU/A4L.
   12.10.3. AFOMS/TE, in conjunction with AU/A4L, coordinates WAPS-critical CDC
   processing priorities. Material submission dates, pre-existing course development
   requirements, and the SKT project schedule will determine if and when priority will be
   warranted.
12.11. Planning:
   12.11.1. CDC preparation time requires careful allocation. Work begins with an AFS change
   approval notification or other event that initiates an STS change. Between a change first alert
   and course chart/production plan approval is the most critical phase, during which time the
   writer should complete detailed research and course planning.
   12.11.2. Consider occupational survey data, if available, when translating broad STS tasks
   into CDC content. Use CDC course documents and the administrative file to document the
   process.
12.12. STS Correlation. Document correlation between course outline key topical statements
and applicable STS task or knowledge statements, proficiency codes or behavioral statements.
Use an STS or locally devised correlation instrument to link topical statements to the STS items.
12.13. Manuscript Preparation:
 76                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


   12.13.1. The Guide for Authors provides guidance to prepare manuscripts. AU/A4L,
   Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex AL 36118-5643, publishes and distributes this guide to writers.
   The guide can be found on the AU/A4L homepage under the Writer/Manager link.
   12.13.2. AU/A4L prescribes the format and provides directions for developing manuscripts
   (except classified CDCs) in the Guide for Authors. Failure to adhere to format standards will
   be grounds for rejection of materials/manuscripts.
   12.13.3. Submit volume manuscript to AU/A4L on or before the established submission
   date, as documented on the AETC Form 469. To assist AU/A4L editorial staff, submit each
   volume upon completion.
12.14. Duplication of Other Air Force Training Programs. CDCs will not duplicate
information provided by other Air Force training programs, such as ancillary training or PME.
Limit CDC content to AFSC knowledge. When PME or ancillary training provides general task
knowledge required for a particular STS item, include in the CDC the specific type and title of
PME or ancillary training course. The CDC may contain applications of these topics that are
unique to the AFSC.
12.15. Prepublication Quality Control:
   12.15.1. Review CDC documents and manuscripts for technical accuracy and adherence to
   quality standards. Use AETC Form 158, CDC Quality Control Checklist, to conduct
   technical, quality and final reviews. Technical, quality and final reviewers initial in blocks 1
   through 4, as appropriate, and sign block 6.
   12.15.2. At least one AFSC-qualified individual, other than the CDC writer or TDE chief,
   conducts the manuscript technical review to ensure CDC texts support learning objectives.
   Technical reviewers may be from outside AETC.
   12.15.3. A CDC writer, other than the author, conducts the quality standards review. Quality
   reviewers should be experienced writers and may be from any AFSC. Quality reviewers will
   verify that manuscript scope and depth support approved course control documents (STS and
   course chart), and that course content reflects writing technique standards established in the
   Guide for Authors. CDC manuscripts must be technically accurate, grammatically sound,
   error free, and include all illustrations.
   12.15.4. The TDE chief conducts the final review to certify that all required STS knowledge
   items have been translated to learning objectives of the appropriate scope and level and the
   publication is consistent with Air Force doctrine, existing law, and national, DoD, and Air
   Force policies.
   12.15.5. In the memorandum of transmittal, identify a new writer's first manuscript so
   AU/A4L can provide quick review and feedback.
   12.15.6. AU/A4L instructional system specialists review for instructional adequacy,
   organization, readability, style, format, and conformance to prescribed methodology. They
   critique the material and suggest improvements for more effective presentation. AU/A4L will
   honor a reviewer by-name-request when possible. AU/A4L sends manuscripts that do not
   meet prescribed standards back to the CDC writer if correction requirements cannot be
   communicated by telephone or email. The CDC writer revises the manuscript and returns it
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                  77


   to AU/A4L. AU/A4L reviewers provide writers with additional guidance on processing
   factors, subject matter, text, and graphics.
   12.15.7. Conduct a prepublication review for technical accuracy of each CDC examination
   prepared and forwarded by AU/A4L. Changes are made by telephone and then confirmed in
   writing. The CDC writer destroys examination manuscript copies upon receipt of published
   copies. Employ appropriate safeguards including those applicable to computer systems to
   prevent measurement material compromise. Safeguard CEs and accompanying materials
   according to AU/A4L test review and change procedures. Communicate directly with the
   AU/A4L course development team responsible for the specific course. Mail examinations
   according to AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.
   12.15.8. AU/A4L prepares and sends a monthly manuscript status report to each TRG
   designated level, which includes manuscript status, a list of manuscripts that are past the
   stated submission date, a list of manuscripts on hold or returned as unsatisfactory (showing
   the number of days late and reason for delay), and a list of courses activated.
12.16. Reviews. An initial, annual or special review approval authorizes continued CDC use
and establishes its currency, technical accuracy, and information adequacy. Use AETC Form
107, Annual or Special Review Record, to document review results.
   12.16.1. Initial. The CDC writer reviews the published CDC upon receipt from AU/A4L to
   ensure consistency and technical accuracy. Mark the AETC Form 107 special review block
   and annotate the remarks block to document the initial review. Document errors but make no
   other text changes at this point.
   12.16.2. Annual. on the terminal volume publication date anniversary, review CDCs for
   essentiality, currency, technical accuracy, and adequacy. CDCs used in the field should be
   reviewed as scheduled even if the CDC is being revised, edited, or printed. Continuing a
   CDC (or SC) with fewer than 26 enrollments per year must be justified for cost effectiveness.
   To prevent excessive or inadequate stock on hand, inform AU/A4L, by memorandum, when
   a program change will significantly alter how many Airmen use the CDC.
   12.16.3. Special. Do not wait for a scheduled annual review if a significant AFSC change is
   implemented. Conduct special reviews when warranted by a career field change, an STS is
   published or revised, requested by AU/A4L because of a high failure rate or low enrollment,
   and/or in conjunction with an OSR review. Check AU/A4L volume review records to
   identify possible recommendations or future revisions. A special review will not replace a
   scheduled annual review
12.17. Field Evaluation:
   12.17.1. AFI 36-2201, Volume 5, requires continuous evaluation to determine how
   effectively a CDC imparts specific career development knowledge. AU/A4L collects quality
   data from two sources:
      12.17.1.1. CDC Survey. Student and supervisor surveys, available on the HQ AU
      Extension Course Program Web site, are emailed directly to students and supervisors.
      Surveys measure student and supervisor satisfaction with the instruction quality and
      applicability, and service efficiency, and solicit improvement input. Personal information
      is maintained according to Air Force policy and federal law. Extension Course Program
 78                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


      personnel compile responses and make the data available to AFCFMs and preparing
      agencies.
      12.17.1.2. Course Examination (CE). AU/A4L collects data on and develops CE
      statistical analysis. Statistical analysis indicates overall student CE performance, and
      shows individual CE item performance. AU/A4L reviews the analysis and provides it to
      the course author, who uses it to evaluate course effectiveness and determine course
      component disposition.
          12.17.1.2.1. CDC writers review CE analysis reports and identify causes and
          corrective actions for discrepancies identified by AU/A4L instructional systems
          specialists. Refer to the Guide for Authors for guidance on reading analysis reports.
   12.17.2. Review continuous evaluation results for trends and act as appropriate.
12.18. Administrative Procedures:
   12.18.1. Reference Publications:
      12.18.1.1. AU/A4L. AU/A4L automatically distributes current CDCs, AU/A4L course
      materials, shipping lists, change supplements, and other materials to course writers.
      Additional copies of AU/A4L materials may be purchased. See the AU/A4L catalog on
      the AU/A4L Web page for purchase instructions. AU/A4L distributes current DL
      materials, course materials, shipping lists, change supplements, and other materials to
      responsible preparing agencies as needed (determined by AU/A4L). Use DD Form 1150,
      Request for Issue or Turn-in, to request additional materials.
      12.18.1.2. Other Armed Forces. Writers research other services‘ correspondence
      courses and procure correspondence materials (catalogs and courses) as required by AFI
      36-2230(I).
   12.18.2. Direct Communication. Writers should communicate directly with industry,
   MAJCOM, and other Air Force activity representatives to obtain copyright releases, source
   materials, or other information required to prepare CDCs. TDY visits are acceptable if
   necessary.
   12.18.3. Student Inquiries. AU/A4L forwards technical inquiries to the preparing agency
   for reply. Writers should promptly answer student inquiries. Document student telephone and
   email inquiries. CE question inquiries require the same safeguards as the CE.
   12.18.4. Packaging (Except Classified CDCs). Protect camera-ready material. Pack CDC
   manuscripts in containers strong enough to protect them during transit. Wrap packages
   according to Air Force and postal requirements. When possible, mail CDC manuscripts on
   digital media using locally prescribed procedures. Use AF Form 74, Communication Status
   Notice/Request.
   12.18.5. SKT Development Support. If CDCs have been processed at AU/A4L or are
   being revised before the scheduled SKT development date, AU/A4L will forward four copies
   of the printed volume and 2 copies of the volume on CDROM to AFOMS as soon as it is
   printed and delivered to AU/A4L. At least one copy remains at AFOMS on completion of the
   project. SKT development schedules are often based on the scheduled CDC manuscript
   availability dates. Submitting CDC manuscripts on schedule is critical to SKT support.
   Inform AFOMS/OMD and AU/A4L of manuscript submission delays in submitting
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                79


   manuscripts so they can determine if published CDCs will be available for the scheduled
   WAPS testing cycle.
   12.18.6. SKT/CDC/STS Compatibility Critiques. CDCs are the source for SKT item
   development. When appropriate, the SKT team identifies specific STS and CDC currency,
   relevancy, or coverage areas that need improvement.
       12.18.6.1. AFOMS/TE forwards an SKT/CDC/STS compatibility critique with
       comments and recommendations to the CDC writer.
       12.18.6.2. The CDC writer reviews the critique, takes necessary corrective action, and
       provides an itemized critique response to TM and AFOMS/TE. Responses are used by
       the next SKT writing team.
       12.18.6.3. The CDC writer sends a copy of the critique response to the group evaluation
       section and the AFCFM.
12.19. SCs:
   12.19.1. New SCs require Air Force-level approval. Submit new SC production plans o the
   appropriate AFCFM. Production plans for revisions are approved locally.
   12.19.2. Prepare SC production plans in the same format as CDC production plans, but for
   new courses, also include justification for the proposed courses in terms of Air Force
   quantitative requirements, a summary or outline of the proposed content, and recommended
   enrollment criteria.
   12.19.3. Unlike the CDC, the SC is not normally based on an STS or used as a WAPS
   source reference .
   12.19.4. Do not prepare new SC CCs until the production plan has been approved.
   12.19.5. When an SC is no longer required, send a deactivation request with detailed
   rationale to the AFCFM. Upon approval, notify AU A/4L in writing.
12.20. Responsibilities:
   12.20.1. HQ AETC/A3P is the policy liaison; HQ AETC/A3T (TPM) is the production
   issues liaison to Air Staff, AFPC, MAJCOMs, AU/A4L, AFOMS, and other agencies.
   12.20.2. The TRG or designated level has the following responsibilities:
       12.20.2.1. Program, schedule CDC and SC preparation and revision.
       12.20.2.2. Prepare, approve, and distribute course charts.
       12.20.2.3. Prepare, review, and forward CDC and SC manuscripts, illustrations, and test
       item pool to AU/A4L.
       12.20.2.4. Respond to AU/A4L recommended corrective actions to ensure manuscripts
       are instructionally adequate.
       12.20.2.5. Manage CDC and SC writer preparation and maintenance resources. Provide
       SME and other support for SKT projects, as tasked in the USAF training planning
       document.

     12.20.2.6. Review these publications annually for essentiality, currency, technical
     accuracy, and adequacy. Record results on AETC Form 107.
     12.20.2.7. Appoint an alternate manager.
        12.20.2.7.1. When a CDC writer is not assigned or is on an extended TDY or leave,
        scheduled to PCS, or retiring, appoint an alternate manager and promptly provide
        POC information to AU/A4L. Include POC full name, rank, DSN, organization, street
        address, base/city, zip code (include the last 4) and courses for which he or she is
        responsible. Indicate whether POC is the primary or the alternate, and provide
        guidance on the previous writer‘s status (retired, PCS, TDY, etc.). Provide complete
        course numbers without an X in the number field, unless X is used in the official
        course number (i.e. 3E2X1 should not be used for 3E251 or 3E271).

   14.2.1. Identify anticipated benefit to the Air Force, and establish specific start and end
   dates.
   14.2.2. Document in a TRS approved plan coordinated by AETC TPM.
   14.2.3. If service test deviates from approved TS, secure TPM and AFCFM approval.
   14.2.4. Course documentation is exempt from inspections until conclusion of the test, but the
   process is subject to inspection, and such documents as the measurement plan may be
   reviewed to ensure TS requirements are met. Except for EIS/OIS courses, when a service
   test results in a Major change (20 percent or more) obtain a new PDS code.
   14.2.5. Use validation procedures to collect and report findings (see Chapter 10).
   14.2.6. For courses attended by enlisted members, email revised and modified course control
   documents (POIs and CCs) for CCAF review to ccaf.dfca@maxwell.af.mil. Send hard
   copies only when requested or if documents are classified. Note: Send classified POIs and
   CCs together to AU/SSO, Attention: CCAF, 401 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-

                     ANNUAL REVIEW OF TECHNICAL TRAINING

15.1. Purpose. To conduct a thorough, periodic look at the continuum of training within
various AFSC courses. The annual review of technical training (ARTT) is designed to generate
an in depth look at various skill level officer and enlisted courses to ensure they include only
relevant skills and knowledge, do not unnecessarily duplicate training, and satisfy customer
requirements. It consolidates annual TS, test, student training materials and low-flow course
review requirements. It must incorporate team members knowledgeable in training processes and
procedures. Team members may include instructor supervisors, course supervisors, TDE
specialists, instructional technology unit specialists, TMs, training evaluators, training resource
specialists, flight chiefs, and TRS commanders. A team does not need each of those members,
but a typical team will include those experience types. BMT conducts a triennial review,
following the same rules on a 3-year cycle.
15.2. Procedures:
   15.2.1. Conduct annual review of all AETC courses that support an AFSC. Review Type 4,
   Type 6, and faculty development courses every 2 years. If a course is within 6 months of
   deactivation, do not include it in the ARTT. Instead, include a memo for record in the record
   set identifying the course deactivation or replacement date. Do not include courses managed
   and conducted by other agencies, but review them to ensure AETC courses do not duplicate
   training.
   15.2.2. Scrutinize the TS, CC, POI, LP, resident training materials, student measurement,
   FEQs, graduate assessment survey data, and course validation data (if available) to determine
   if courses meet customer requirements; whether training is unnecessarily duplicated; if
   course material depth and breadth expands from one skill level to the next, whether courses
   maintain a clear relationship with others in the same family group; and whether courses are
   still needed.
   15.2.3. Use the CFETP anniversary month (initial skills course TS if CFETP does not exist)
   to determine the 12-month analysis period. Review all AFSC-pertinent courses that are active
   during the ARTT, except those identified in paragraph 15.2.1. If a course is slated for
   revision, place a memorandum for record indicating such , to include the projected revision
   date, in the course record set.
   15.2.4. Send a copy of the annual training standard review to AFOMS/TE.
15.3. Responsibilities. The TRG establishes the ARTT program schedule. The TRG will either
create a separate guide, or include the process in a supplement to this instruction. In either case,
forward procedures at least 60 days prior to use to HQ AETC/A3PV for review and approval.
The TRS/CC ensures the ARTT is accomplished, and initiates appropriate action, including
reviewing and purging the system of no longer required tentative course shells (not activated,
discontinued, cancelled). The TRS/CC completes initiated actions with the AFCFM, HQ
AETC/A3T, and 2 AF/TTOC as required by this and other applicable AETC instructions.
 84                                                        AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


15.4. Documentation. Document ARTT results and forward to HQ AETC/A3T. Include
information pertaining to areas indicated in paragraph 15.2.2 and resulting actions. If training
duplication exists, include rationale or corrective actions taken to eliminate duplication.

Terms
Abbreviated Training Plan—Means to make minor changes to an approved course; used when
course parameters change less than 20 percent, the change does not require a new course number
and PDS code, and additional resources are not required. An ATP supplements the most current
certified course CTP.
Agenda/Outline/Syllabus-driven Courses—Agenda-driven seminars or symposia designed to
quickly react to field changes; 50 percent or more of courses subjects/topics change from class to
class.
Appraisals—Optional application method: requires no control measures; comprised of a group
of questions and/or projects used to check day-to-day learning; used informally during teaching-
learning activities to help determine student comprehension and progress. The appraisal can be
used in consideration for washback and advancement, but not to satisfy an objective.
Behavior—Specifies what a student must do to satisfy a job performance requirement. Behavior
may involve recall, manipulation, discrimination, problem-solving, performing a step-by-step
procedure, or producing a product.
Behavioral Objective—Specification of behavior the student must exhibit, the conditions under
which the behavior is accomplished, and the minimum standard of acceptable performance.
Behavioral Statement—Statement of the behavior the student must exhibit. If a condition or
standard is needed to clarity the behavior, either or both should be included.
Block of Instruction—One or more related units or modules grouped to cover course major
subject or task areas.
Career Field Education and Training Plan—Air Force career field life-cycle management tool
that identifies career path education and training requirements and core tasks for each skill level
or duty position of every AFS.
Classroom/Laboratory—Time spent in a classroom/laboratory environment dedicated to
student course objective achievement. Instructional methodology may vary, but a qualified
instructor must be present during this time.
Condition—Specified limits under which behavior is performed. Conditions may include the use
of specific TOs, or equipment provided to perform a task during which the behavior will be
demonstrated. Conditions may also be information provided which to guide action a specific
way.
 92                                                           AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


Course Chart—Document that outlines course general structure and content by block and unit
of instruction. It also provides course parameters and other course data for staff personnel.
Course Content—Knowledge and skills, including proficiency levels, identified in the
applicable training standard which will be taught. Adding or deleting tasks, or changing
proficiency levels constitutes a course content change. Rearranging objectives, reallocating times
within a course, and inserting technology or updated equipment used to teach course content,
address how the course content is taught but do not change actual course content.
Course Control Documents—Documents used to control course content and instruction. They
include the training standard, course chart, and plan of instruction.
Course Implementation—Course implementation begins when the first validation class starts.
Course Resource Estimate—Initial vehicle used to seek training resource funding. The estimate
includes resources needed to initiate training and sustain it through the future years defense plan.
The CRE is intended to be an accurate estimate developed by the TM, and is the foundation of
the course training plan. It is not in finite budget detail. HQ AETC/A1MRT processes a CRE as
a draft annex. Resource requirements are refined as the CTP is finalized. The TM completes the
CRE Part I, and HQ AETC/A3RB completes Part II.
Course Training Plan—Course training plan is the foundation to plan, program, and implement
training addressing facilities, equipment, manpower, etc. The plan is based on implementation
year training requirements. The CTP includes the proposed course content outline and identifies
required resources. It is a refined and accurate statement of resources required to support a
course.
Differentiation Index (DI)—The DI measures the ability of an item to differentiate between
students with high scores on the total test and those with low scores.
Directed Study—Time dedicated to course objective achievement using self-study instructional
materials. Specific objectives must be assigned and measured. Material covered must not be re-
taught. Instructor direct supervision is not required. Instructor authorizations are not earned for
directed study hours.
Distance Learning—Structured learning mediated with technology that does not require an
AETC instructor‘s physical presence. DL models can be used in combination with other forms of
instruction or to create wholly virtual classrooms. DL is also known as Type 6 formal technical
training, exportable training, and advanced DL (ADL).
Ease Index (EI)—Represents the difficulty of the test item. An effective test should include test
items representing a range of difficulty, but most items should be of average difficulty (EI of
50/60 percent). In criterion referenced instruction, an Ease Index below 80 percent may be
unacceptable.
Expansion Group Size—Maximum number of students that can be accommodated under
wartime surge conditions. Consider all available local options, but do not allow for washbacks.
This group size is for wartime planning only, based on wartime course requirements.
Family Grouping—Courses with like AFSCs or areas of instruction, controlled by OSC and
PAS. Instructors are cross-utilized.

measure student performance objective achievement when participating in a group or team
effort.
Group Size—Group sizes are established to make efficient use of facilities and resources, ensure
transfer of learning, program classes to satisfy training requirements, determine instructor
requirements, evaluate training expansion capability, and manage class cancellation. Group sizes
are established in coordination with the local manpower office.
Group-Lock Step—Each group of students progresses through the course at a predetermined
pace completing training on schedule. This design is normally used when course-operating
constraints dictate adherence to planned instructional times.
Group-Paced—Students progress through the course as a group, at the same rate. Hours listed in
the course chart, established during course validation, are averages that the typical group is
expected to need.
Hazing—Any conduct whereby a military member or members, regardless of service or rank,
without proper authority causes another military member or members, regardless of service or
rank, to suffer or be exposed to any activity which is cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive,
demeaning or harmful.
Instructional Design—One of three planned strategies (group-lock-step, group-paced, or self-
paced) for student progress through a course. Strategy combinations may be used as appropriate.
Instructional Materials—Materials used by instructors and/or students in formal courses,
including training aids, TOs, commercial publications, visual aids, etc.
Instructional Systems Design—Systematic training course development approach based on
training needs.
Instructional Methods—Methods include lecture, demonstration, self study, computer-based

the teaching guide.
 94                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


Major Course Change—Change that affects course content and/or course length by 20 percent
or more. Either change will require a new course number and PDS code. Examples: 20 percent
longer or shorter course length; 20 percent more or fewer training standard line items or course
objectives; a series of minor changes since the PDS code was issued that constitute 20 percent or
more change to course content and/or length. Note; initial skills courses require a new PDS
code only when the AFSC portion of the course number changes.
Maltraining—Any practice not designed to meet a course training objective. Examples of
maltraining include but are not limited to using abusive, excessive physical exercise or
unnecessarily rearranging the property of an Airman to correct infractions. Any practice for the
purpose of inducing an Airman to self-eliminate is considered maltraining.

which instructor supervisors check all other LPs. The right column may include data to guide and
expand upon the lesson, but will not include individual instructor personalization.
Maximum Group Size—Maximum number of students that can be accommodated based on
peacetime facilities and equipment use, considering safety and effective instructional methods.
Maximum group size does not include possible washbacks. However, the programmed group
size does. For courses that subdivide groups or use a team concept, the multiple instructor
requirement must be identified in the manpower annex.
Measurement Plan—Plan that defines methods used to measure student course objective
achievement, and illustrates the correlation between a measurement device (or test item) and POI
objective.
Measurement—Process used to determine student course objective achievement, which
includes appraisals, progress checks, performance tests, performance rechecks, and written tests.
Minimum Group Size—Minimum number of students who can be trained and still satisfy
course training objectives, team instructional requirements, safety requirements, and/or cost-
effective resource use. Except in unusual circumstances, the minimum class size will be two or
more. Minimum group size affects whether or not a class will be cancelled.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                     95

Program Group Size—Number of students per group used to schedule (program) classes. The
program group size is the basis for manpower computations. It will be the same as the maximum
group size, except when washback and elimination rate adjustments are required. For new
courses that lack attrition or washback data, the group size reduction rate will be determined
from family-related courses. After a year, the course will be reviewed and the group size
reduction will be based on actual washback and elimination rate experience. The program group
 96                                                          AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009

   COURSE TRAINING PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL, FLOW CHART
                    DECISION LOGIC NARRATIVE

Note: This narrative supports the CTP processing, approval, and certification flow chart (Figure
A3.1).
A3.1. CTP Submission Timelines. CTP processing, approval and certification should take no
more than 90 calendar days: 30 days for local processing and approval; 30 day for HQ AETC
validation and certification; and 30 days for OTA required course schedule conversion.
A3.2. Step 1. Develop a CTP when developing a new course, existing course changes impact
resource requirements or manpower authorizations, or when a course transfers from one base to
another. If parameters remain the same, the gaining TM makes TPS changes, the losing TM
discontinues the old course, and the gaining TM loads the new parameters. Note: Use an
abbreviated plan for existing course changes that are less than 20 percent, or changes that do not
affect resources. Any change that affects resource requirements requires a complete CTP.
A3.3. Step 2. The TM enters new or changed course parameters and information in TPS
(requesting a new course number and PDS code if necessary) and prepares CTP annexes
(including the course control documents, manpower and personnel, facilities, logistics,
comptroller, environmental assessment, ITRO, and security annexes, and others as required). The
TM immediately, simultaneously starts and completes applicable annexes once course changes
are known, (i.e., a U&TW tasking, training planning team -driven changes, or field feedback
result-driven changes).
A3.4. Step 3. The TM assembles the CTP (including planned implementation date), coordinates
with all base agencies according to local established guidelines, and forwards to the TRG
resources chief. Note: TMs should follow up with applicable agencies as necessary to encourage
timely response and to meet established CTP processing timelines.
A3.5. Step 4. The TRG resources chief validates resource availability, coordinates CTP with
the TRG training administrator/director who submits the CTP to the TRG commander for
approval.
A3.6. Step 5. The TM emails the approved CTP to the TRW/MO for review. The TRW/MO
compares course parameter information in TPS with the CTP. If CTP cannot be emailed, the TM
hand carries three hard copies to TRW/MO.
A3.7. Step 6. The TRW/MO maintains a copy of the CTP, and emails it to HQ AETC/A1MRT
(HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses), HQ AETC/A3T TPM, and 2 AF/TTOC.
A3.8. Step 7. HQ AETC/A1MRT validates additional manpower and SMY resource needs,
forwards a recommendation to HQ AETC/A3RB (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses), and
courtesy copies HQ AETC/A3T TPM.
A3.9. Step 8. HQ AETC/A3RB reviews and validates the resource impact (O&M start up costs,
substantial recurring costs, etc.) for nonmedical courses, and sends a recommendation for
certification to HQ AETC/A3T TPM. For medical courses, HQ AETC/SGNU reviews the CTP
provided by the TRW/MO, and validates the resource impact and sends the approved CTP to HQ
AETC/A3T TPM.
 102                                                         AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009


A3.10. Step 9. The HQ AETC/A3T TPM generates and forwards the certification memo (see
Figures A3.2 and A3.3), with the approved CTP, for HQ 2 AF/TTOC review (including the
planned implementation date and impact to the accessions plan for enlisted initial skills courses),
and to AFPC for new courses and AM10 officer initial skills courses.
A3.11. Step 10. If the accessions plan is affected, HQ 2 AF/TTOC reviews the CTP to identify
the impact, coordinates any actions to the plan, and sends the CTP to HQ AETC/A3T for
certification. If the accessions plan is unaffected, HQ 2 AF/TTOC will identify the earliest
implementation date in the certification memo and send the CTP to HQ AETC/A3T for
certification.
A3.12. Step 11. HQ AETC/A3T certifies the CTP and sends the certification memo to the
TRW/MO, HQ AETC/A3T TPM (SGNU for medical courses), A1MRT, A3RB, A3I (if
interservice course), 2 AF/TTOC, TRG and TRS commanders, and the TRG TM. The TM
prepares AETC Form 179A and forwards it to 2 AF/TTOC. Note: Courses containing
motivational training must be certified by HQ AETC/A2/3/10.
A3.13. Step 12. HQ AETC/A1MRT activates the course in TPS.
A3.14. Step 13. 2 AF/TTOC releases class schedules.

   EQUIPMENT RESOURCES AVAILABILITY FLOW CHART, DECISION LOGIC
                           NARRATIVE

Note: This narrative supports the equipment resources availability flow chart (Figure A4.1).
A4.1. Step 1. TM identifies equipment requirements on AETC Form 120.
A4.2. Step 2. TM forwards a copy of the AETC Form 120 to the equipment custodian.
A4.3. Decision Point. Is equipment available in the TRS? If equipment is available in the TRS,
the TM completes the CTP logistics annex. If equipment is not available in the TRS, the TM
contacts the TRSS POC to check on equipment availability in the TRW.
A4.4. Decision Point: Is equipment is available in the TRW? If yes, the TRSS POC instructs
the TM to proceed with developing the equipment annex. If not, the TM contacts the TPM (HQ
AETC/SGNU for 882 TRG) to check AETC equipment availability, and courtesy-copies the
TRSS POC. HQ AETC/SGNU queries other MAJCOMs and AETC bases for medical course
equipment requirements.
A4.5. Decision/Question: Is equipment available in AETC? If yes, TPC provides TM with
supply information (courtesy-copies TRSS), and TM develops logistics annex. If no, TPM
solicits HQ Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) assistance.
A4.6. Decision/Question: Is equipment available in AFMC? If yes, TPM instructs TM to
develop the logistics annex. If no, the TPM will contact the AFCFM for assistance. The AFCFM
will query the major command (MAJCOM) functional managers for equipment and/or funding
requirements.
A4.7. Decision/Question: Do other MAJCOMs have equipment or funding? If yes, AFCFM
makes equipment/funds available, the TPM notifies the TM, and the TM develops the logistics
annex. If no, the AFCFM, TPM, HQ AETC/A3R, and TM look for alternatives or workarounds.
The AFCFM, TPM and HQ AETC/A3R will coordinate the out-of-cycle funding training
requests through AF/A1PT. Training is not implemented until resourced or
workarounds/alternatives are coordinated and the training plan approved.
A4.8. Step 3. When equipment (or funding) becomes available, availability information is
forwarded to the TM, who develops the logistics annex, based on requirements identified on
AETC Form 120.

              MANPOWER RESOURCES DECISION LOGIC NARRATIVE

Note: Use this narrative to develop and process the CTP manpower annex. Before a course can
be activated and conducted, HQ AETC/A1MRT must validate the manpower annex, and TPM
(HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses) must certify it. Manpower annexes either have no
manpower impact, or require manpower that the wing has identified as an offset to pay for the
added cost of a new or updated course. If there are no offsets in the wing, the TPM will prioritize
the course among all others that require resources. Once resources are available, the TPM will
certify the training plan and notify the TM, HQ AETC/A1MRT, 2 AF/TTOC, and TRW/MO.
A5.1. TM Requests Annex. TM forwards a manpower annex request to the TRW/MO when a
course transfers from one base to another, existing course parameters changes (such as course
length [days or hours], MIRs hours, program group size, or shift limit), or when developing a
new course. Note: HQ AETC/A1MRT requires 30 days each to process a manpower annex and a
CTP.
A5.2. TRW/MO Develops Annex. The TRW/MO develops the manpower annex using data
from the TM and appropriate databases, and validates the manpower-related data.
A5.3. TRW Forwards Annex. TRW/MO sends the manpower annex to the TM.
A5.4. TM Forwards Annex. The TM forwards the request to HQ AETC/TPM (SGNU for
medical).
   A5.4.1. If manpower is not affected (i.e., no additional instructor authorizations or SMYs are
   required to certify the course), the TM completes the CTP (see Attachment 3).
   A5.4.2. If manpower is affected and the TM can identify offsets from within the TRS, the
   TM identifies the offset to TRW/MO, who annotates the offset in the manpower annex.
   A5.4.3. If offsets are not available in the TRS, see paragraph A5.8.
A5.5. TRW/MO Finalizes Annex. The TRW/MO finalizes the annex, attaches a cover
memorandum summarizing the resource impact, and forwards the draft annex to HQ
AETC/A1MRT and the TPM.
A5.6. HQ AETC/A1MRT Validates Draft. HQ AETC/A1MRT validates the draft manpower
annex and notifies the TPM and HQ AETC/A3R. When offsets from an existing course will pay
for a new course, the TPM – with HQ AETC/A3R input – approves offset use and notifies HQ
AETC/A1MRT, the TRW/MO, and the TM.
A5.7. TM Includes Memo. The TM includes the approval memo in the CTP manpower annex.
A5.8. TM Seeks Offsets from TRSS. If manpower offsets are not available in the TRS, the
TM contacts the TRSS for availability within the TRG or TRW. If manpower offsets are
available, the TRSS notifies the TM, who proceeds according to paragraph A5.4.
A5.9. TM Seeks Manpower from HQ AETC. If offsets are not available in the TRG or TRW,
TM forwards the manpower annex to the TRW/MO to request HQ AETC fill additional
manpower resources. TRW/MO proceeds with the annex, identifying the manpower shortages.
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 109


A5.10. TRW/MO Forwards Annex with Shortages, Impact Summary. The TRW/MO
forwards the manpower annex with the shortages and resource impact summary memo to HQ
AETC/A1MRT and the TPM (HQ AETC/SGNU for medical courses).
   A5.10.1. HQ AETC/A1MRT validates the manpower shortages and notifies the TPM (HQ
   AETC/SGNU for medical courses).
   A5.10.2. If resources are available, the TPM - with HQ AETC/A3R input - validates the
   annex and notifies HQ AETC/A1MRT, TRW/MO, and the TM.
A5.11. TPM Prioritizes Course. If resources are not available, the TPM prioritizes the course
in ―awaiting manpower‖ status, and notifies HQ AETC/A1MRT, TRW/MO, and the TM.
   A5.11.1. When resources become available, the TPM validates the annex and notifies HQ
   AETC/A1MRT, TRW/MO, and the TM. The TM then completes the CTP.
   A5.11.2. HQ AETC/A3T maintains and updates the list of courses awaiting manpower
   resources and notifies HQ AETC/A1MRT when updating resource status.
   A5.11.3. For medical courses, if offsets are not identified by HQ AETC/A3T or HQ
   AETC/SGNU, then HQ AETC/SGNU coordinates requirements with HQ USAF/SG. If
   offsets are acquired, HQ AETC/SGNU notifies HQ AETC/A1MRT, TRW/MO, and the TM.
   The losing command transfers the authorizations and HQ AETC/SGNU approves the
   manpower annex. If offsets are unavailable, HQ AETC/SGNU notifies HQ AETC/A1MRT,
   TRW/MO, and the TM.
A5.12. TPM Requests Manpower From Commands. When resources are unavailable, the
TPM contacts the AFCFM to request manpower from using commands.
A5.13. Losing Commands Transfer Authorizations. If the AFCFM secures manpower from
using commands (to be used by AETC as instructors, SMYs, or support personnel), the losing
commands transfer the authorizations to HQ USAF/A1M. HQ USAF/A1M transfers them to HQ
AETC. When notified by HQ AETC/A1MRT that authorizations have been transferred, the TPM
validates the manpower annex and notifies HQ AETC/A1MRT, 2 AF, TRW/MO, and the TM.
The TM completes the CTP. Note: HQ AETC/A1MRT returns excess manpower resources to
the functional community that initially furnished them if manpower becomes excess after the
course validation phase. Courses under validation will be priced after the validation phase, at
which time a final standard is submitted. The TM and MO ensure the CTP manpower annex
states that the course is under validation and the standard is interim. Supplemental or advanced
course manpower goes back to the functional community that originally provided it if the course
was established with a known term and discontinue date.
A5.14. TM Coordinates Workarounds. If manpower is unavailable, the TM coordinates with
the TPM and AFCFM to identify workarounds to satisfy the training requirement until resources
are available.

                   AETC FORM 120 COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS

A6.1. AETC Form 120. The AETC TM coordinates all AETC Form 120 generation or update
processes. The designated TM approves each course AETC Form 120 depending on CTP,
curriculum, or logistics applications. The TM uses the TTMS course design and development
database equipment list where TTMS is installed See Figure A6.1 for a sample AETC Form 120.
   A6.1.1. Equipment custodians give the TM course correlated supply equipment account
   inventory (R-14 listing) copies. The TM, with the course TDE, determines whether to
   generate a new Form 120 in TTMS or externally. The TM delivers copies of new or updated
   course Forms 120 to equipment custodian(s).
   A6.1.2. Enter start date and form preparation date as follows: year in four digits, month and
   day in two digits each. (Example: 14 December 2008 is 20081214 and 7 January 2009 is
   written 20090107.) Enter stock numbers in ascending order. Forward a copy of the form and
   a cover memo signed by the squadron commander or flight chief to the equipment custodian.
   After TM coordination/approval, if there are changes, additions or deletions, equipment
   custodians provide base supply with a new copy of the form and cover memo.
A6.2. Equipment List Headings. List equipment in four parts under the following headings:
   A6.2.1. Part I—Investment Items (Base Funded). This part includes Air Force
   decentrally managed investment type equipment items (ERRC codes "NF") and a unit cost of
   $250,000 or more. Items are procured or requisitioned at base level from commercial
   venA3Rs, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), or the General Services Administration
   (GSA), or are locally manufactured. These items are charged to AETC appropriations
   57X3080 and EEIC 140. They are identified by budget code "Z." Note: For list of supply and
   equipment codes, see AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.
   A6.2.2. Part II—Expensed Items (Base Funded). This part includes Air Force centrally
   procured expense items (ERRC coded "XB," "XF," and possibly "XD"), as well as Air Force
   decentrally managed expense items requisitioned or procured at base level DLA, GSA,
   Army, Navy, Depot Maintenance Service, Air Force Industrial Fund, local purchase,
   commercial venA3Rs, and equipment items acquired from functional communities other than
   AFMC. These items apply to O&M appropriation 57X3400, identified by budget codes "1,"
   "9," and possibly XD8 special purpose recoverables authorized to maintenance (SPRAM)
   assets.
   A6.2.3. Part III—AFMC Financed Items. This part includes items procured and funded
   by AFMC.
   A6.2.4. Part IV—Financing Unknown. This part includes items for which funding
   responsibility cannot be ascertained. Include SPRAM training spares XD/XF-coded repair
   assets in this part.
       A6.2.4.1. Stock Number. If an item is not stock listed, provide manufacturer's part
       number. For equipment authorization inventory document (EAID) items, the prime
       national stock number (NSN) cited is the appropriate table of allowances (TA).
AETCI36-2203 12 AUGUST 2009                                                                 111


       A6.2.4.2. Nomenclature. Use abbreviated nomenclature if the item has a valid stock
       number. Otherwise, describe the item in sufficient detail to identify it.
       A6.2.4.3. Allowance Source Code (ASC). Enter "N/A" – not applicable – for non-
       EAID or non-CAP items. Enter "CAP" if applicable. For EAID items, enter the first three
       digits of the applicable ASC or include action being taken in the remarks column.
       A6.2.4.4. Quantity-Maintenance. Enter the quantity maintenance requires to support
       the course.
       A6.2.4.5. Quantity—Support. Support items are those that enhance training and
       provide indirect support of training objectives (i.e., administrative computers,
       smartboards, projectors, tool kits, etc.). Support items are those authorized on
       administrative and support EAIDs. Enter the quantity required for the course.
       A6.2.4.6. Quantity—Training. Training items are those that are necessary to meet
       training objectives; usually those students are being trained to use, maintain or operate
       (i.e., LRUs, computers and specific tools). Enter the quantity required for training.
       Training spares are SPRAM assets identified in appropriate TOs and authorized on AF
       Form 601, Equipment Action Request, AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn in Request, or by
       memorandum.
       A6.2.4.7. Quantity—Short. The quantity short is the quantity that cannot be supplied
       from base assets. Enter the base supply requisition number in the remarks column.
       A6.2.4.8. Cost—Unit. Enter a unit cost for all "base investment," "base expensed," and

                                 SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision changes the term ―countermeasure assessment‖ to ―countermeasure review,‖
changes the course number to reflect the new AFSC, and eliminates countermeasures required
for a facility.

                                     PRODUCTION PLAN
                       CDC 3N051 PUBLIC AFFAIRS JOURNEYMAN
1. The current Public Affairs Career Development Course, 3N051, published in 2003, must be
revised to correct inaccurate information and to deemphasize subjects/material in accordance
with current public affairs programs and procedures.
2. The decision to revise the 3N051 CDC was made following discussion with the career field
manager and subject matter experts.
3. The career field will conduct a utilization and training workshop to update the career field
education and training plan to accurately reflect current career field policy and procedures. The
update will involve minor revisions, some deletions, and restructure.
4. CDC units will be renamed and rearranged to accurately identify subject matter and to better
organize information based on similarity. For example, public affairs programs and activities
(media, community relations, internal information, and security and policy review) are addressed
in two volumes, which will be combined into one volume. Generic training information and
much of the newspaper design and layout information will be deleted.
5. CDC Projected Activation Date Justification: The CDC will be activated (date). The customer
need date is (date). Volume submission will follow career field manager review. Submission
dates are proposed based on the following schedule:
     a.
     b.
     c.
     d. The following are start and submission dates for each volume:
         1) Volume 1                    (Date)                        (Date)
         2) Volume 1                    (Date)                        (Date)
     e. The terminal volume final delivery date is (Date). Upon receipt AU/A4L requires 150
     days for processing. This puts the projected field need date at (date).
6. Send questions or concerns about this plan to the CDC writer at (email address) or call DSN
(number).

                    MOVING A COURSE TO STUDENT MANAGEMENT

A15.1. Process. Moving a course to student management (SM) allows users to move course
data developed in the course design and development software into SM. The course design and
development software initiates a validation check before the actual move can take place. Certain
criteria must be satisfied, but the system will not know if the information is correct, so double
check to ensure all information identified in Figure A15.1 has been addressed.
A15.2. Responsibilities. The course design and development software user must be at least a
TM/PM or faculty development chief to access the project tools phase, and must have a valid SM
user ID and password to start the move to student management task. Users must manually check
to ensure all information is correct to avoid conflict with other systems. The information required
in Figure A15.1 must be correct before the move.
