SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Explains, updates, and implements revised provisions on the initiation of personnel and position
actions; personnel and position actions requested by supervisors; personnel actions requested by
employees; and the process of requesting a personnel or position action. Attachment 2 lists all
Requests for Personnel Action (RPAs) by Nature of Action (NOA) family, Attachment 3
provides detailed instructions on how to complete and process RPAs in the Defense Civilian
 2                                                         USAFEI36-728 14 OCTOBER 2010]


Personnel Data System (DCPDS) and Attachment 4 contains provisions for serviced
organizations on how to submit RPAs in case there is temporarily no access to DCPDS.
1. Initiation of Actions. Actions will be initiated by:
     1.1. Supervisor. Supervisory responsibilities encompass requesting personnel and position
     actions, as well as reporting changes in employee’s personal or employment data. When an
     action is required or planned, the supervisor consults with the servicing Civilian Personnel
     Office (CPO) if help is needed on technical aspects of the action, ensures that coordination
     and approvals are obtained prior to submitting a request, and transmits an electronic request
     in DCPDS asking the CPO to take action.
     1.2. CPO processes individual personnel and position actions only upon receipt of an
     electronic request in DCPDS from the supervisor unless an action must be taken under law or
     by other authority, or the decision to take an action is not within the supervisor’s purview,
     e.g., a labor court decision orders the restoration of an employee to duty. In other instances,
     such as realignments or salary increases due to tariff negotiations, the CPO processes the
     mass requests in the system.
     1.3. Employees: Personnel actions addressed in this paragraph may be requested by
     employees. Requests may be in writing or requested electronically, and may be subject to
     giving advanced notice IAW governing collective tariff provisions or directives issued by
     HQ USAFE. The following type of personnel action requests can be requested by an
     employee:
        1.3.1. Change to Lower Grade.
        1.3.2. Utilization of Quarters.  These actions include assignment, change, and
        termination of US Government quarters authorized for employees subject to
        USAFEPAM 36-720 (I), Tariff Agreements That Apply to Persons Employed by the U.S.
        Forces in Germany (English Translation) and the Collective Tariff Agreement (CTA II),
        Appendix H or Z.
        1.3.3. Parental Leave. This type of special leave governed by the Parental Leave Act
        places an employee on leave without pay and reduces annual leave entitlements by 1/12
        for each full calendar month of parental leave taken. Supervisors must verify employee’s
        eligibility with the CPO before approving.
        1.3.4. Work Hour Changes.
        1.3.5. Termination of Employment. Termination actions include resignation, optional
        retirement, or resignation to accept employment with another US Forces agency not
        serviced by an Air Force CPO. These are all voluntary actions. Therefore, supervisors or
        management officials must not ask or advise an employee to resign nor deny the right to
        resign or to terminate employment. If the supervisor is aware of reasons for a resignation
        which differ from those given by the employee, he/she may enter an appropriate
        statement on the electronic RPA, Part D. Oral resignations provided by employees may
        be accepted on an exceptional basis only, but must be confirmed by the supervisor or
        operating official. If an employee resigns orally, the official receiving the oral
        resignation enters an appropriate statement or explanation on the RPA, Part D, stating the
        reasons the employee gave (or a statement that no reasons were given) and the dates,
USAFEI36-728 14 OCTOBER 2010]                                                                 3


       names of any witnesses, and their statements. Refer to USAFEI 36-723, Implementation
       of Collective Tariff Agreement (CTA II) and Overtariff Conditions for Labor in the
       Federal Republic of Germany for more guidance about notice periods and waivers of
       those.
2. Position Actions Requested By Supervisors: Increases or decreases in the number of
authorized positions, realignment of duties and responsibilities, functional transfers,
reorganizations, and temporary additional workloads usually require position actions be taken.
The following terms and basic criteria apply:
   2.1. Establish. A position must be established before an employee or applicant can be
   assigned or hired to fill it. Validation of the need, such as the Unit Manning Document
   (UMD) or approved changes thereto, is required before the position can be set up. A position
   is established and may be filled when the validated workload requirement has been
   documented, the duties and responsibilities are described, certified, and classified, and a
   classification action has been completed by the CPO.
   2.2. Review. If the duties and responsibilities are to be changed from those described in the
   current (standard) Core Personnel Description (CPD), the CPO will be asked to review or
   audit the position.
   2.3. Abolish. A position is to be abolished when no longer needed or authorized on the
   UMD. Requests to cancel filled positions must be routed to the CPO as far in advance of the
   proposed effective date as possible to permit timely action to place the employee or initiate
   Reduction in Force (RIF) action.
   2.4. Record Changes. Any changes in position sensitivity, payroll numbers and accounting
   classification codes which do not cause other position changes must be reported to the CPO
   by an RPA, a pertinent memorandum, or a governing list.
3. Personnel Actions Requested by Supervisors:
   3.1. Basic Personnel Actions. Among others, Attachment 3 addresses the most common
   personnel actions initiated by supervisors.
   3.2. Termination of Temporary Placement Actions. Termination of time-limited placement
   actions, keyed to an event rather than a specific date, requires prompt notification to the
   CPO. Typical examples are the return to duty of an employee from sick absence for whom a
   temporary replacement was hired or the completion of a special project performed by
   temporary over hires.
   3.3. Adverse Actions. Any action by management that reduces an employee in pay plan,
   grade, or basic pay, or effects an involuntary separation from employment may be subject to
   legal restrictions or other specific processing procedures. To assure full understanding and
   compliance with governing laws, publications, and procedures, the supervisor must contact
   the CPO when considering such an action.
   3.4. Assignment of Other Duties. Supervisors may not assign employees higher or lower
   level duties on a temporary or permanent basis before they have obtained the mandatory
   Works Council cooperation through the CPO. Temporary assignments to other duties in
   excess of 30 calendar days are to be treated as personnel actions.

4. Request for Personnel Action (RPA):
     4.1. Personnel and position actions are requested by completing electronic RPAs and routing
     them through DCPDS. Upon approval, the system automatically returns a Notification of
     Personnel Action (NPA) that is to be signed, distributed and filed by the CPO. The NPA
     serves as the formal employment contract required IAW CTA II. Detailed completion
     instructions for RPAs are in Attachment 3, while Attachment 4 contains provisions for
     supervisors on how to proceed if access to DCPDS is temporarily not available. When
     changes involve several employees, paragraph 4.3 below applies.
     4.2. A combined request for personnel and position actions such as ―
                                                                        Establish and Fill‖ or
     ―Termination and Abolish‖ may be routed on one RPA. For all other requested actions
     except mass actions addressed below, a separate RPA is required.
     4.3. The results of sensitivity changes, payroll changes, modifications of accounting
     classifications, changes in the organizational designation of the unit or activity, and other
     mass changes that apply to several employees and do not require additional position or
     personnel changes are processed in DCPDS by the CPO based on the governing legal
     authority. If the mass action is not initiated by the CPO, a memorandum or pertinent list
     reflecting the particular change and the names of the affected employees can be provided by
     the organization.
5. Effective Date of Actions: Unless specifically authorized or required by law, tariff
provisions, regulations based on law or tariff agreements, or by a court decision, an action cannot
be made effective before the date the appointing authority (commander or staff members of the
CPO specified in AFI 36-102, Basic Authority and Responsibility for Civilian Personnel
Management and Administration) determines that all requirements are met and approves the
action.
6. Actions Required by Supervisor When Notified of Approval:
     6.1. A signed printout of the systematic NPA issued by the CPO is the document the
     supervisor uses to annotate or update the Supervisor’s Employee Brief, and to notify the
     employee of actions taken. One signed printout will be provided without delay to the
     employee, another copy is to be maintained in the supervisor’s folder.
     6.2. Employees will be given a copy of the CPD, when an approved position or personnel
     action resulted in a revised position description. If only minor pen and ink changes are
     needed, the supervisor will obtain a manually modified CPD copy from the CPO for the
     employee.
7. Forms Adopted: AF 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
