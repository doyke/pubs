   Flight Manual Program (FMP) and MAJCOM Supplement.
1.2. Mission Description. Operation DEEP FREEZE (ODF) is the Department of Defense
(DOD) inter/intra-theater air and surface logistical support of the United States Antarctic
Program (USAP). It involves the deployment and redeployment of scientific and support
personnel, resupply of South Pole Station, McMurdo Station, and numerous deep field research
camps established by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP).
   1.2.1. C-17A aircraft, aircrews, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), and maintenance, satellite
   communications support personnel are tasked to perform airland and airdrop operations on
   the Antarctic continent in support of USAP programs on an annual basis.
   1.2.2. C-17A crews from 62/446 OG at Joint Base Lewis-McChord are responsible for
   filling ODF taskings and managing the C-17 Aircrew Antarctic Training Program IAW AFI
   11-2C-     17V1. If another wing is tasked to conduct the ODF mission, crews must be ODF
   trained and certified IAW AFI 11-2C-17V1 Aircrew Antarctic Training Program.
   1.2.3. Deployed aircraft and personnel are assigned to the 304 EAS, the C-17A
   Expeditionary Airlift Squadron based at Christchurch, NZ, subordinate to the 13 Air
   Expeditionary Group (AEG), Joint Task Force - Support Forces Antarctica (JTF-SFA).
   1.2.4. ODF operations are divided into three time periods: Winter Flying (WINFLY), Main
   Season/Redeploy, and Intra Season.
1.3. Specialized Terms.
   1.3.1. Ice Certification – The certification of an ODF crew member is conducted in
   accordance with the 62/446 OG ODF C-17A Antarctic Training and Certification Guide and
   syllabus. Additional certifications exist for WINFLY, airdrop and NVG operations.Certified
   crews will be referred to as “Ice Certified.” These certifications are tracked in TMS and are
   recorded on the letter of X’s.
   1.3.2. WINFLY – The period of ODF operations that occur during the Austral Winter,
   usually in August, which brings in the advance team of personnel to prepare the airfields and

     C-17 ODF missions. Position is normally held by the 304 EAS/CC but may be delegated as
     required.
     1.3.7. Point of Safe Return (PSR) – An enroute point between Christchurch and McMurdo
     Station where the Aircraft Commander must make the decision to proceed to McMurdo
     Station or return to Christchurch based on weather conditions at McMurdo Station.
     Continuing past the PSR commits the aircrew to land at McMurdo regardless of weather
     conditions.
     1.3.8. Pegasus Ice Runway – The compacted hard surfaced white ice runway built on the
     permanent Ross Sea Ice Shelf approximately 8 miles from McMurdo Station. This runway
     can be made available year round.
     1.3.9. Annual Sea Ice Runway – The temporary runway built on the annual sea ice in
     McMurdo Sound. This runway is constructed each season on a new site over frozen sea
     water and is approximately 2 miles from McMurdo Station. This runway is only available
     when the sea ice is thick enough to support aircraft operations, usually from early October
     thru early December.
     1.3.10. OPCON – The authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
     forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, designating objectives,
     and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission.
     1.3.11. TACON – The command authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or
     military capability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the detailed and,
     usually, local direction and control of movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish

   1.4.4. C-17A crewmembers are not required to carry COMSEC materials on missions
   between Christchurch, NZ and Antarctica.
1.5. Mission Planning, Briefings, and Guides.
   1.5.1. A formal training day will be conducted at the beginning of each deployment rotation.
   Crews will be trained IAW the 62/446 OG ODF C-17 Antarctic Training and Certification
   guide and syllabus. Support personnel will utilize established continuity guides for
   operations.     The 62/446th DEEP FREEZE Program office may produce ODF-specific
   inflight guides or training products to aid members in mission accomplishment. These guides
   will be approved by the 62/446 OG commanders.
   1.5.2. Pre-mission aircrew, weather, and Mission Commander briefings will be conducted
   prior to each ODF mission. Briefings will be conducted IAW current AMC briefing guides
   and may be augmented with the 304 EAS briefing guides.
   1.5.3. ODF aircrew flight planning, flight management and weather support will be provided
   by SPAWAR Systems Center, Charleston, SC, the designated ODF military weather service
   provider.
1.6. Aircrew Management. Crew management will be IAW AFI 11-2C-17V3, Chapter 3, and
the following.
   1.6.1. Aircrew Qualification. The Aircraft Commander and primary loadmaster for all
   missions to Antarctica will be Ice Certified.         NOTE: During WINFLY, the Aircraft
   Commander and primary loadmaster positions will be WINFLY certified.           NOTE:
   Ice instructors will be provided for upgrading pilots & loadmasters.
   1.6.2. Crew Complement. An Ice crew normally consists of 4 pilots, 4 loadmasters and 2
   flying crew chiefs. The Mission Commander may adjust the crew size based on scheduling
   and mission requirements.
   1.6.3. Alerting Procedures. Ice crews are alerted by the Mission Commander 3+45 hours
   prior to scheduled takeoff time to allow 1 hour for reporting and 2+45 hours for mission
   preparation.      304 EAS personnel will use the DEEP FREEZE C-17A Sequence of
   Events (See Attachment 4).
   1.6.4. Flight Duty Period (FDP). Aircrews will assume all days are augmented unless
   specifically told otherwise by the Mission Commander prior to entering pre-mission crew
   rest that they will operate basic. The Mission Commander may approve flights with basic
   crews based on mission and scheduling requirements.
   1.6.5. Training FDP. Comply with AFI 11-2C-17V3. ODF training missions normally
   include an annual NVG and airdrop Off Station Trainer (OST). Any additional crew duty
   day extensions must be requested and approved by 18AF/CC.
1.7. ODF Aircraft Operating Restrictions. Aircraft operating restrictions will be IAW AFI
11-2C-17V3, Chapter 4. Christchurch is considered Column A for missions departing for
 6                                               AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013


Antarctica. Aircraft returning to Christchurch will be Column B. Departures from Christchurch
to other locations will revert to Column B. ODF missions launching to Antarctica will have the
following additions:
     1.7.1. Ignition channels A and B will be fully operational.
     1.7.2. All non-mission essential equipment will be removed from the aircraft.
     1.7.3. The APU will be operational.
     1.7.4. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
     flight from the point of safe return (PSR) to a suitable recovery base, should oxygen be
     required. Calculate crew requirements using the 100 percent Oxygen Duration Chart in the
     flight manual. Calculate crew and passenger requirements based on flight at FL 250 from the
     PSR to the nearest suitable recovery base.
        1.7.4.1. EPOS is the primary emergency oxygen source for palletized seats. Calculate
        EPOS oxygen supply at 60 minutes for seated passengers. Passengers in palletized seats
        require one EPOS for every hour of flight from the PSR to a suitable recovery base. One
        EPOS will be stowed under each seat. The additional EPOS may be kept in the Survival
        Equipment Locker and distributed to passengers following the emergency.           NOTE:
        The Mission Commander (with Aircraft Commander concurrence) may allow exceptions
        to the requirements listed in paragraphs 1.7.1 thru 1.7.3 based on operational need.
1.8. ODF Specific Waivers. The following waivers are granted for AMC C-17A aircraft
supporting Operation DEEP FREEZE missions or training sorties.
     1.8.1. Parachute Waiver. In an effort to maximize available allowable cabin load (ACL) and
     fuel load, C-17A missions supporting ODF are authorized to operate without parachutes and
     associated survival kits on board the aircraft. The additional space generated will be used to
     store specialized cold weather gear and anti-exposure suits required for the mission.
     Parachutes will be removed and stored at home station. Restraint harnesses will be utilized
     for ODF airdrop operations.
     1.8.2. Life Raft Overflow Waiver. C-17A missions supporting ODF are authorized to
     operate over water utilizing the overload capacity of 69 personnel per life raft versus the
     standard 46 personnel per life raft on active legs.
     1.8.3. Approval for operations on unlit runways. AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 5.12.1 requires
     MAJCOM/A3 approval to operate on runways that do not have lighting but are equipped
     with reflective markers. ODF NVG certified aircrews are authorized to operate on Pegasus
     Runway utilizing NVGs and High Intensity Retro-Reflective, Heliport/Runway Identification
     Markers (HIRRRIM) with the restrictions published in chapter 4 of this document. The 304
     EAS/CC or designated Mission Commander will inform AMC/A3V prior to mission
     execution that operations are being conducted IAW with this approval.
     1.8.4. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Operations. C-17A aircraft supporting
     ODF missions to McMurdo are authorized to operate with 5 of 6 available ARFF vehicles in
     service. This reduced number will still meet the Critical Level of Service (CLS) category
     capability for sustained C-17A operations. The 304 EAS/CC or Mission Commander will
     inform the Aircraft Commander and must notify 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ if operations are
     being conducted IAW this waiver. Operations under this waiver are not approved if less than
AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                        7


  5 vehicles are available or if ARFF falls below CLS. If ARFF support falls below CLS, the
  mission will be rescheduled or a new waiver will be required IAW AMCI 11-208, Chapter
  10.
  1.8.5. AFI11-231 Door Bundle Airdrop Speed Waiver. Due to the high Mean Sea Level
  drop altitudes (10,000-12,000 feet) and estimated aircraft weight, minimum aircraft
  maneuvering speeds for the C-17A are estimated to be between 142-147 KCAS for airdrop
  configuration. Normal door bundle procedures utilize static line personnel airdrop
  procedures at airdrop airspeeds between 127-133 KCAS. This waiver allows door bundle
  aerial delivery from a C-17A using high altitude personnel configurations with airspeeds up
  to but not greater than 150 KCAS and bundle weights not to exceed 400 pounds. Reference
  TO1-C-17A-1-1 Figure 1-12 for expected planning stick shaker speeds.

Aircraft Go/No-Go Decision Matrix (Attachment 3) and the Weather Go/No-Go Decision Matrix
(Attachment 4) to aid in this decision.
     2.1.1. At any time during the launch sequence or after the aircraft has launched, the Mission
     Commander may cancel, delay, or recall the mission as conditions warrant.
2.2. Christchurch Launch Weather Minimums. Specific minimums have been developed for
ODF missions in an effort to mitigate risk and prevent unsafe operations in an inhospitable
environment.
     2.2.1. Minimum weather to launch routine ODF mission from Christchurch to McMurdo are
     1,500 ft ceiling and 3 SM visibility for ETA +4 hours at McMurdo. If the weather does not
     support these minimums, the mission will be delayed or cancelled until weather conditions
     improve. NOTE: If an emergency condition exists requiring weather conditions below
     those outlined in paragraph 2.2.1, ceiling and visibility may be lowered IAW AFI 11-2C-
     17V3. The 304 EAS/CC (or designated Mission Commander) will determine if lower
     minimums are acceptable after accomplishing a thorough ORM review and obtain approval
     from 18 AF/CC through 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ.
     2.2.2. The 304 EAS/CC (or designated Mission Commander) will consider weather trends,
     recent observations at origin and destination, and forecast temporary weather conditions
     when making launch decisions. Of primary concern is preventing PSR turn around due to
     weather as well as ensuring departure weather capability out of McMurdo.
2.3. Point of Safe Return Fuel Planning. The PSR is the furthest point along the flight path
from Christchurch to McMurdo where the aircraft has enough fuel to turn around and divert to
Christchurch if the weather at McMurdo is below minimums. The PSR can be overhead
McMurdo or up to a maximum of 60 minutes from landing depending on cargo and fuel load.
Upon arriving at the PSR, the Aircraft Commander must decide to either proceed to McMurdo
Station or return to Christchurch. This decision is based on several factors to include current and
forecast weather, aircraft condition, airfield status, and reliable communications.
     2.3.1. C-17A aircraft without extended range fuel tanks will always load a maximum fuel of
     approximately 180,000 pounds. For C-17As with extended range fuel tanks, the amount of
     fuel will be determined by PSR distance and mission requirements.
     2.3.2. C-17A missions will be planned utilizing a maximum fuel load with an ACL of
     100,000 pounds on all missions. Depending on mission needs, an ACL greater than 100,000,
     but less than 120,000 pounds, requires Mission Commander approval. ACL in excess of
     120,000 pounds significantly affects PSR and requires 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ approval.
     2.3.3. The PSR is based on a point determined by the mission computer. The PSR allows the
     aircraft to return to Christchurch (or other designated alternate) with minimum required fuel.
AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             9


   If in the view of the Aircraft Commander more fuel is required when returning from PSR, the
   PSR will be adjusted back (farther from McMurdo).
   2.3.4. Once past PSR, the crew is committed to land at McMurdo regardless of conditions
   because insufficient fuel exists to return to a recovery/alternate airfield.
2.4. Point of Safe Return Weather Minimums.
   2.4.1. To proceed beyond the PSR, the Aircraft Commander must have the following:
      2.4.1.1. The McMurdo weather at or above a forecast of 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility
      at ETA plus 1 hour.       NOTE: With Mission Commander approval, if the aircraft has
      sufficient fuel to fly a straight-in IAP, execute a missed approach, climb to enroute
      altitude, and return to Christchurch with holding and divert fuel, the aircraft commander
      may elect to continue past PSR with forecast weather of 1,000 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility at
      ETA plus 1 hour.
      2.4.1.2. A PSR forecast will be obtained no earlier than 60 minutes prior to PSR. The
      PSR forecast provides specific weather conditions expected at ETA and will not contain
      any temporary conditions.
      2.4.1.3. The PSR forecast will contain sky condition, visibility, weather, surface wind
      (Grid), runway air temperature, runway dew point, and altimeter setting. Communication
      with McMurdo Weather may be direct or relayed through other aircraft or stations, or via
      Iridium phone voice or text if SATCOM or radio communications are unavailable.
   2.4.2. C-17A aircraft will reverse course at PSR if any of the following conditions exists at
   the McMurdo airfields.
      2.4.2.1. Observed weather below 1,500ft ceiling/3 SM visibility (or 1,000 ft ceiling/3
      SM visibility if meeting criteria in the note in paragraph 2.4.1.1)
      2.4.2.2. Crosswind limitations, corrected for RCR, are exceeded. (Observed or forecast).
      2.4.2.3. Mooring chart wind limitations are exceeded (Observed or forecast).
      2.4.2.4. NIL surface definition.   NOTE: If a POOR surface definition is observed,
      runway lights, PAPI and navigation aid for the instrument approach must be
      operational.
      2.4.2.5. TACAN not in service.         NOTE: If observed weather at McMurdo exceeds
      3,000ft ceiling/3 SM visibility and is forecast to remain greater than 3,000 ft ceiling/3 SM
      visibility for at least 2 hours after ETA, and if dual GPS with RAIM are available and
      operational, the mission may continue past PSR on the published GPS arrival to a visual
      approach to the field. If a certified RNAV approach is available, aircraft may continue
      past PSR with weather minimums of 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility with the TACAN
      not in service.
      2.4.2.6. Negative communications, direct or relay, with McMurdo Center.
      2.4.2.7. More than one inch depth of loose snow reported on the primary runway
      (Pegasus or the Seasonal Ice Runways).    NOTE: The Pegasus “White Ice” Runway is
      covered with a snow layer of 3-5 inches in depth that is compacted to the approximate
 10                                            AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013


       consistency of concrete. This compacted snow layer does not restrict aircraft operations
       to the runway.
   2.4.3. Two sources of air for engine start are not available (APU and air cart) unless an ERO
   is planned.
2.5. McMurdo Arrivals and Instrument Approach Procedures. McMurdo airfields are
certified for IMC operations, however they lack normal instrument runway markings and
lighting. Aircrews flying into these airfields must be Ice certified IAW AFI 11-2C-17V1 to
operate safely in this environment.
   2.5.1. Instrument arrival and approach procedures are produced and flight-checked by the
   FAA each season and will be made available to all ODF aircrews.
   2.5.2. Due to operational necessity, C-17 aircrews may need to perform flyability checks on
   new IAPs at the beginning of the ODF season, prior to the arrival of FAA flight check
   personnel. These flight checks will be conducted in VMC and IAW AFI 11-230. An AF
   IMT 3992 will be submitted to the 13 AEG/CC for validation and approval.
2.6. Ground Operations. C-17A aircrews will be trained and certified on all non-standard
ground equipment at McMurdo, cargo loading operations and the use/wear of Extreme Cold
Weather (ECW) gear.
2.7. McMurdo Area Airfield Departure Weather Minimums. There are no departure
alternates meeting AFI 11-2C-17V3 requirements for C-17A aircraft at McMurdo. Aircrews
must plan to use the McMurdo departure airfield as the only emergency return option available
to them. Aircrews will plan to depart McMurdo airfields with weather minima of 1,500 ft
ceiling/3 SM visibility to the maximum extent possible.
   2.7.1. Crews will thoroughly analyze current and trend weather data when departure weather
   is observed or forecasted to be below 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility. If departure weather
   below 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility is caused by a temporary event, the crew should wait
   until conditions improve before departing.
   2.7.2. If, after thorough analysis of weather conditions, the Aircraft Commander determines
   that waiting to obtain 1,500 ft ceiling/3SM visibility for departure is impractical, a departure
   is authorized with weather minimums of 1,000 ft ceiling/2 SM visibility with Mission
   Commander approval.
   2.7.3. If 1,000 ft ceiling/2SM visibility for departure is not attainable and the crew does not
   have enough FDP remaining to wait for improved weather conditions, the Aircraft
   Commander will contact the Mission Commander to determine lowest weather departure
   minimums for safe operations. The Mission Commander may approve departure minimums
   below 1,000 ft ceiling/2 SM visibility, but not lower than the lowest compatible approach
   minimums. The approval will be situational dependent based on a Mission Commander
   thorough ORM re-view, to include as a minimum, aircrew experience, actual weather
   conditions and weather trends, crew duty day and comparing risk associated with departing
   McMurdo under IMC versus keeping a C-17A on the surface for an extended period of time.
   The Mission Commander will obtain launch approval from 18 AF/CC through 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOZ with coordination with AMC/A3V.
AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                             11


                                            Chapter 3

                                  AIRDROP OPERATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter outlines specific procedures unique to performing airdrop operations
on the Antarctic continent and the surrounding waters. Airdrop is the only means of reaching the
South Pole Station or other parts of the Antarctic interior during the Austral Winter period.
Pilots performing airdrops at or near the South Pole must be Ice airdrop certified. Pilots
performing airdrops in other areas of the continent, or in the surrounding waters, must only be
Ice certified.
3.2. Christchurch Airdrop Launch Weather Minima. All weather minima listed in Chapter
2 for airland operations apply to ODF airdrop missions. However, the Mission Commander will
also consider the following when making the Go/No-Go decision:
   3.2.1. Due to the distance between Christchurch and the South Pole, McMurdo Station must
   be utilized for refueling prior to conducting the airdrop unless an air refueling is planned.
   The Mission Commander will ensure weather at McMurdo is suitable to allow the refueling
   stop and departure, as well as providing emergency divert capability before and after the
   drop.
   3.2.2. McMurdo weather must be 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility for ETA +4 hours for fuel
   stop return time.
   3.2.3. Drop Zone weather must be 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility for ETA +1 hour.
   3.2.4. Weather at McMurdo must be 1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility during the time frame
   when an emergency divert to McMurdo from the drop zone might be needed.
3.3. Mission Computer Anomalies. Due to the rapid convergence of lines of longitude near
the South Pole, the aircraft mission computer may give a false representation of where the
aircraft is in relation to the ground. Additionally, there may be divergence between the pilot and
copilot’s MFDs in relation to the run in course.
   3.3.1. Pilots must complete the Ice airdrop certification training prior to dropping on or near
   the South Pole (below 85 degrees S latitude). This training will include a sortie that conducts
   an actual or dry pass over one of the South Pole Drop Zones. All South Pole airdrops must
   be conducted with a visual back up to verify aircraft position and mission computer
   alignment prior to the release point.
3.4. Drop Zone Surveys and Markings. The JTF-SFA is responsible for providing drop zone
surveys, if available. If a survey is not available, drop zone coordinates and terrain data for the
surrounding area will be provided. A communications plan and drop zone markings will be
relayed to the Mission Commander and provided to the crew prior to mission execution. The
Mission Commander will ensure a safety of flight review is conducted for the drop zone IAW
AFI13-217.
3.5. Airdrop configurations. The nature of the airdrop will vary based on customer
requirements. Configurations for airdrop cargo may include Heavy Equipment, Container
Delivery System or Door Bundles. In most emergency situations, only a small amount of cargo
will be required to be airdropped as a Door Bundle.
 12                                          AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013


   3.5.1. Depending on conditions, it may be necessary to fly Door Bundle airdrops above AFI
   11-231 speeds. Refer to paragraph 1.8.5 of this document for a description of the approved
   Door Bundle airdrop airspeed waiver.
3.6. Emergency Airdrop Operations. If an emergency condition exists requiring airdrop
operations in the JOA with weather conditions below those outlined in paragraph 3.3.1, ceiling
and visibility may be lowered and the wind component may be increased IAW AFI 11-2C-17V3
and AFI 13-217 . The 304 EAS/CC or designated Mission Commander will determine if lower
minimums or increased wind component are acceptable after accomplishing an applicable ORM
review and obtain approval from 18 AF/CC through 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ.
AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           13


                                          Chapter 4

                     NIGHT VISION GOGLES (NVG) OPERATIONS

4.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for C-17 Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations
on Pegasus runway in support of the NSF mission on the Antarctic continent during periods of
darkness. The utilization of NVGs provides year-round capability to McMurdo offering a
valuable means to evacuate personnel or deliver emergency supplies during the Austral Winter.
   4.1.1. Runway markings. Due to the lack of runway edge lighting and the minimal contrast
   be-tween the runway edge and the surrounding ice, High Intensity Retro-Reflective Runway
   Identification Markers (HIRRRIM) are utilized to aid in runway identification. These
   markers reflect the light from the aircraft’s landing lights to aid in runway edge
   identification. The aircraft must be aligned within 8 degrees of centerline to ensure
   reflectivity.
   4.1.2. The Mission Commander will coordinate with Pegasus Airfield Manager to ensure
   that HIRRRIM are installed properly and will brief the aircrew on the marker configuration.
4.2. Mission Planning. Crews will be notified by the Mission Commander if NVG operations
are required. Crews will deploy with an appropriate number of NVGs to include spares as
determined by the Mission Commander. Life support personnel will deploy with necessary
maintenance equipment, Hoffman testers, and an eye lane.
4.3. Christchurch NVG Launch Weather Minima. All weather minima listed in Chapter 2
for airland operations apply to ODF NVG missions. The Mission Commander will also consider
airfield instrument approach procedure availability, airfield lighting and crosswind component
for the launch determination.
4.4. NVG Operating Restrictions.
   4.4.1. Pilots performing a takeoff or landing at McMurdo on NVGs must be current and
   qualified as an Ice NVG pilot or be under the direct supervision of an Ice NVG IP.
       4.4.1.1. NVG flight training will be conducted IAW the 62/446 OG ODF C-17 Antarctic
       Training and Certification guide and syllabus and AFI 11-2C-17V3, Chapter 9.
   4.4.2. All airland PSR weather and minima guidance from Chapter 2 of this document
   apply to NVG operations. In addition to minimum ceiling and visibility requirements of
   1,500 ft ceiling/3 SM visibility for ETA + 1 hr, the airfield must have a fully functioning
   straight in instrument approach procedure, and runway end identifier lights or similar lead-in
   lighting.
   4.4.3. Maximum cross wind component limitation for landing is 15 knots.
   4.4.4. Due to the inherent degradation of NVG effectiveness in areas of precipitation,
   continuation past PSR is not permitted if observed or forecasted weather includes continuous
   or heavy snow showers. Operations are permitted during periods of light snow (-SN).
4.5. Emergency NVG Operations. If an emergency condition exists requiring NVG operations
at McMurdo with weather conditions below those outlined in paragraph 4.3, ceiling and
visibility may be lowered and the cross wind component may be increased IAW AFI 11-2C-
 14                                       AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-C 14 NOVEMBER 2013


17V3. The 304 EAS/CC (or designated Mission Commander) will determine if lower minimums
and/or increased cross wind component are acceptable after accomplishing a thorough ORM
review and obtain approval from 18 AF/CC through 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ.
