This instruction implements AFPD 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety. This publication
is consistent with AFPD 13-5, Air Force Nuclear Enterprise. It applies to operations with the
Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) Configured E-6B weapon system. Section A assigns
responsibilities. Section B contains each nuclear weapon systems' safety rules. The safety rules
in Section B may only be changed or supplemented using procedures in AFI 91-102, Nuclear
Weapon System Safety Studies, Operational Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules. See attachment 1
for abbreviations and acronyms used in this instruction. This instruction applies to the Air Force
Reserve and Air National Guard. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33- 363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Field
activities must send implementing publications to the higher headquarters functional OPR for
review and coordination before publishing. The authorities to waive wing/unit level
requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number
following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for
a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers
through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately,
to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and requires complete review. There are some
minor administrations and formatting changes and regulation references were updated. Placed
paragraph 3.3 under paragraph 3.2 to properly align responsibilities for guidance. Added
paragraph 5.3 to require compliance with AFI 91-102. Changed wording in paragraph 6.2 to
better reflect ALCS controls when critical components are aboard. Added wording to paragraph
6.3 to deny unauthorized use of ALCS alert-configured aircraft. Added paragraph 15 to prevent
positioning of ALCS aircraft near nuclear bomber generation. This revision incorporates AFI
33-360 guidance to include tier waiver requirements and incorporates Interim Change 1, 3 April
2012.

     Control (NC2) Facilities, and USSTRATCOM, Air Force, Navy instructions, and MAJCOM
     supplements apply.
     6.2. When any critical component is aboard, control access to the aircraft and deny entry to
     any personnel unless: a) the critical component is being controlled by a proper code-
     handling or Two-Person Concept team IAW EAP-STRAT Vol. 16, ICBM Code Component
     Control Policy and Procedures or b) the critical component is properly installed and secured

10. Personnel Reliability. DoD 5210.42-R and applicable Service (AFMAN 10-3902;
SECNAVINST 5510.35A) and COCOM (USSTRATCOM Directive 227-2) supplemental
guidance apply.
   10.1. An ALCS alert-configured (PCM and/or AF Critical Components) aircraft must remain
   under the control of PRP certified personnel. (T-0)
11. Equipment, Procedures, Checklists, and Modifications:
   11.1. Use only equipment, procedures, and checklists that are consistent with technical
   publications approved by the US Air Force and US Navy for any operations directly
   associated with the ALCS portion of the ICBM nuclear weapon systems. (T-0)
   11.2. All technical publications and equipment modifications must be approved by the US
   Air Force and/or US Navy, as appropriate, and must conform to the safety rules in this
   instruction and the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Surety Standards. (T-0)
12. Operational Code Control:
   12.1. Before loading either the operational cryptovariable or the operational S-data, a
   certified MCC-A must successfully complete the following test sequences: (T-0)
      12.1.1. Airborne Operational Program Crypto Sumcheck (CSC).

   12.3. After electronically loading the cryptovariable data into the CPE, secure the access
   doors on the CPE with two approved locks to secure the VKA-A and VKA-B and prevent
   use of the Classified Command Control switch. A single person must not know both
   combinations or control the keys to both locks. (T-0).
   12.4. Individuals will not concurrently perform MCC-A duties and be a USWAC-401
   custodian or member of a USWAC-401 handling team. MCC-As must be decertified prior to
   performing USWAC-401 custodian or handling team duties. USWAC-401 custodians or
   members of a USWAC-401 handling team will not be certified as MCC-As until expiration
   of worldwide unlock codes period. (T-0).
   12.5. When transferring components between aircraft in a single Protection Level I (PL-1)
   alert aircraft parking area, lock the VKA-A and VKA-B in the CPE with two approved locks.
   A single person must not know the combinations to both locks. (T-0).
 6                                                              AFI91-117 25 FEBRUARY 2014


     12.6. Only one half of an operational cryptovariable (VKA-A or VKA-B) may be flown
     aboard the aircraft when not electrically loaded in the CPE. (T-0).
     12.7. When removing an ALCS-configured aircraft from alert, erase the cryptovariable data
     stored in the CPE by cycling the CPE power switch. The MCC-A must witness the lighting
     of the CPE's AC and BC lights. (T-0).
     12.8. Do not remove VKA covers, except for emergency VKA destruction. (T-0).
     12.9. If proper erasure of the VKA memory cannot be verified, continue to control as an
     operational VKA until the cryptovariable data stored in memory have been superseded. (T-
     0).
     12.10. When non-alert ALCS-configured aircraft are uploaded with complete operational
     cryptovariable data, the aircraft will not take off with operational unlock documents aboard.
     (T-0).
     12.11. Do not authorize/grant unescorted entry to the ALCS-configured aircraft to anyone
     who had access to the Offutt Air Force Base Wing Code Processing System when current
     operational ALCS cryptovariable data was prepared or has knowledge of any portion of the
     current worldwide unlock values. (T-0).
13. Aircraft Configuration:
     13.1. If an operationally coded VKA-A or VKA-B is installed or if operational
     cryptovariable data are electronically loaded in the CPE, follow these procedures until the
     MCC-A has authenticated an execution order:
        13.1.1. Keep the ALCC switch in the OFF position. (T-0).
        13.1.2. Do not activate the Multifunction Selector ALARM OVERRIDE switch, except
        when electronically loading the operational cryptovariable data. (T-0).
        13.1.3. Do not move the Classified Command Control switch inside the CPE to
        ENABLE.     (T-0)
     13.2. Install the operationally coded VKA-A and VKA-B in the CPE and verify the
     capability of the VKA erase circuits before an ALCS-configured aircraft takes off. Do not
     preclude aircraft takeoff directed by an emergency war order if the erase circuits fail to
     verify. (T-0).
     13.3. Keep the operationally-coded VKA-A and VKA-B in the CPE and the selector
     switches in the ARM position during takeoff, flight, and landing, except when required for
     airborne equipment checkout and loading procedures, in-flight electronic loading of the
     cryptovariable data, and/or fault analysis while airborne. (T-0).
        13.3.1. If the selector switches need to be placed to the SAFE position, or if the VKAs
        must be removed while airborne, the aircraft must be in level flight, at cruise altitude, and
        free of malfunctions that could be dangerous to flight. The MCC-A will maintain
        proximity to the CPE to facilitate reinstallation and arming of the VKAs if safety-of-
        flight status changes. (T-0).
        13.3.2. The selector switches need not be returned to the ARM position after the MCC-A
        has authenticated an execution order. (T-0).
