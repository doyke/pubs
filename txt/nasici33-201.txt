       factory-sealed packages, then it must be protected at the highest level of classification
       processed within that facility until appointed security officers have reviewed and marked
       the removable media consistent with the classification guide.
          3.1.4.1. Blank media will enter NASIC through SCOK only. Users will receive
          SCOK pre-printed blank media through their MAM.

          separated from the media. Unique media identification values are generated through
          the media accountability tracking system.
          3.2.1.3. Scan media for malicious code using approved standalone workstation.
          3.2.1.4. Mark media with classification of media contents, title, classification of title,
