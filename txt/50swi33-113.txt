This instruction implements AFPD 33-1, Information Resources Management. This instruction
applies to all contractor, as stipulated by contract, and government agencies on Schriever Air
Force Base (SAFB). It defines the methods and establishes the procedures for contractors and
government agencies, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard
(ANG) units when requesting approval to perform communications systems installations, modify
installations or de-install an installation/modification on SAFB. This includes but is not limited
to all changes to hardware (H/W), facilities, and technical documentation that are used to
maintain the SAFB Configuration Baseline. The 50 SW Form 19, Installation/Modification
Authorization Request process and the SAFB Scheduling process shall be adhered to once it is
determined by the 50 Space Communications Squadron (SCS) Configuration Management
Office that a 50 SW Form 19 is required. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the
appropriate chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication eliminates a mandatory meeting between 50 SW Form 19 submitters and

1. Introduction.
     1.1. Scope. This instruction deals with facility preparation, cable installation and
     modification, H/W installation, and modifications to the SAFB Configuration Baseline for
     communications. A modification is defined as any change which departs from a description
     in approved documentation including changes to any depiction in engineering drawings,
     wiring lists, cable lists, floor plans and/or installation instructions. By implementing the 50
     SW Form 19, Installation/Modification Authorization Request (I/MAR) process and SAFB
     Scheduling process, SAFB is assured that all on-site installations/modifications to the SAFB
     Configuration Baseline for those areas under Configuration Management (see 50 SWI 33-
     105, C4 Systems Installation Standard) are properly coordinated, approved, scheduled,
     monitored, and documented.
     1.2. General. If a question arises whether a 50 SW Form 19 (hereafter referred to as Form
     19) is required, please contact the I/MAR Help Desk for assistance. If required the
     requesting organization shall meet with their CML or designee to determine requirements for
     the Form 19.
        1.2.1. A Form 19 is required for:
            1.2.1.1. All installations or modifications to the SAFB Configuration Baseline
            (facility, H/W, or documentation).
            1.2.1.2. All installations/modifications that interface with or that may change/alter
            interfaces with the SAFB Configuration Baseline.
        1.2.2. A Form 19 is not required for installation or modification of the software (S/W)
        baseline. However, all S/W installations or modifications that require utility outages or
        Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) downtime must be scheduled through
        SAFB Scheduling and coordinated with 22 SOPS/MAO.
2. 50 SW Form 19 Process/Preparation:
     2.1. The requesting organization is encouraged to meet with the Configuration Management
     Office or their designees to discuss the installation/modification requirements prior to the
     submission of a Form 19 package. The CML or their designee will assist the requesting
     organization in preparing the Form 19 and associated Technical Data Package if required.
        2.2.1. The Form 19 package shall incorporate and/or reference the detailed instructions
        for installation of the proposed work.
        2.2.2. When the Form 19 involves signal cable installation, including growth or spare
        cables, cable management data as described in 50 SWI 33-114, Cable Management, shall
        be included in the Form 19 package.
        2.2.3. When the installation/modification involves equipment/rack installation or power
        requirements, a 50 SW Form 20, Reservation/Removal Request Form, shall be submitted
        to the Configuration Management Office for floor space/rack space allocation and/or
        circuit assignments per 50 SWI 33-105.
        2.2.4. A copy of the approved 50 SW Form 20 must be included in the Form 19 package.
        2.2.5. When the installation or modification involves a change to the facility or other
        work normally controlled by Base Civil Engineering, the requesting organization shall
50SW33-113 12 MAY 2010                                                                         3


      prepare an AF Form 332, Civil Engineering Work Order Request, and obtain a work
      authorization number from the base Civil Engineering Squadron. The requesting
      organization shall include a copy of the approved AF Form 332 (with the work
      authorization number) in the Form 19 package. The requesting organization shall notify
      SAFB Scheduling of updates to the AF Form 332 status. In no case does a Form 19
      supersede or replace an AF Form 332.
      2.2.6. Once the Form 19 package has been prepared by the requesting organization it
      shall be submitted directly to the I/MAR Help Desk.
      2.2.7. Requesting organizations shall submit a detailed work plan as part of all Form 19
      packages. Upon approval of the Form 19 package, the agencies performing the
      module/area work shall submit a 50 SW Form 21, Activity Scheduling Form, a minimum
      of 5 work days days prior to the start of the planned activity, or as specified by
      module/area scheduling requirements, to allow full coordination and conflict resolution.
      If additional time is required to complete previously scheduled work, the requester shall
      contact SAFB Scheduling to extend the access or schedule additional time. Once the
      requesting organization has determined work is complete, they shall notify their Area
      Integrator within 10 calendar days to schedule final verification. When issues or
      discrepancies are noted and require corrective work to be performed, the requesting
      organization shall notify and provide the necessary details to SAFB Scheduling. These
      activities shall be added to the work plan. Prior to performance of the corrective work a
      50 SW Form 21, Activity Scheduling Form, shall be submitted a minimum of 5 work
      days prior to the start of the planned activity or as specified by module/area scheduling
      requirements.
      2.2.8. When an activity requires a utility outage, a 50 SW Form 21, Activity Scheduling
      Form shall be submitted to SAFB Scheduling at least 14 calendar days prior to scheduled
      outage.
      2.2.9. When an activity requires AFSCN downtime, a Downtime Forecast/Request shall
      be submitted to SAFB Scheduling at least 14 calendar days prior to the activity start date
      or 10 days prior to the effective date of the 7-day forecast in accordance with 50 SWI 10-
      217, Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Users Operations Instruction.
      2.2.10. When requesting an activity to be performed during a configuration freeze, the
      requesting organization must submit a Freeze Waiver Request for review and approval, 7
      to 10 calendar days prior to the activity. For further information, reference 50 SWI 10-
      1208, Launch Readiness and Responsibilities.
3. 50 SW Form 19 Administrative Review.
   3.1. Upon receipt of a Form 19 package, the Help Desk shall review it for completeness,
   work plan detail, technical evaluation, and assign a tracking number. The Form 19 package
   may be rejected during the initial administrative review due to lack of technical information,
   improper completion of the request, or any other administrative error or omission. A rejected
   Form 19 package shall be returned to the requesting organization with an explanation of why
   it was rejected.

       Form 19 who may be impacted by the Form 19 installation. Form 19 packages shall not
       include proprietary contractor data or classified data.
       3.1.3. The I/MAR Help Desk has no later than close of business (COB) to process new
       Form l9 packages (COB for Form 19 processing is 1500 local time). New Form l9
