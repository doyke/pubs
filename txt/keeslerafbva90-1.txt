                          81st Training Wing
         Inspector General (IG) Complaints Resolution Program




The Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program is prescribed in AFI 90-301, Inspector General
Complaints Resolution. Air Force military and civilian members have a duty to promptly report fraud, waste,
abuse (FWA) or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, or regulations; an injustice;
abuse of authority, inappropriate conduct, or misconduct (as defined by AFI 90-301); and a deficiency or like
condition to an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector, or through an
established grievance channel.

You have a right to file an IG complaint at any level, but experience has shown that many complaints can be
resolved through the chain of command. For this reason, although not required, you are encouraged to
discuss your concerns with your chain of supervision and/or your commander before coming to the IG. Not all
complaints are suitable for the IG to resolve, but Iâ€™ll assist you in finding the best avenue to resolve your
complaint. If you wish to file an IG complaint, contact the IG office:
