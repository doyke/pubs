                                           Chapter 2

                                MISSION AND STANDARDS

2.1. Mission. The mission of AFRC PB FES is to organize, train and equip FES UTC’s (IAW
higher Headquarters Instructions) to deploy and provide fire fighting, rescue, and Hazardous
Materials (Hazmat) response capabilities as stated in the Designed Operational Capability (DOC)
statement; and prevent or minimize injury, loss of life, and damage to property and the
environment.
2.2. Goal. The goal of AFRC PB FES flights is to become effective and efficient wartime
firefighters, to protect personnel, property and missions from all hazards.
2.3. Organization. AFRC PB FES Flights are identified by UTC’s and organized as a part of a
Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) and/or within a Mission Support Group (MSG). There are two
configurations of AFRC PB FES Flights. There is a twenty four person AFRC PB FES Flight
and thirty six person AFRC PB FES Flight.
2.4. Objectives. Once mobilized and deployed the primary objective is early intervention at
emergency events by occupants, operators, and automatic detection/fire protection systems.
Secondary objective is to intervene early with firefighters when FES related emergency events
occur. The third objective of the flight is Fire prevention. This objective is achieved with an
aggressive and effective fire prevention training program consisting of fire safety education,
inspections, enforcement and facility design review. This multi-phased approach ensures
mitigating actions are initiated as soon as possible to minimize consequences of the incident.
AFRC PB FES flights do not have a fire prevention mission while in Unit Training Assembly
(UTA) status but when deployed will integrate with AF or ANG forces to provide this function.
2.5. Scope of Services. The primary focus of AFRC PB FES is to train to accomplish
mitigation activities at emergency events that pose risks to personnel or property and employ
incident management actions within the limits of available resources. These include natural or
man-made incidents requiring fire suppression, hazard mitigation, rescue and management of
hazardous materials incidents (including Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high
yield Explosive (CBRNE) agents) that result from accidents, act of war or terrorism. In addition,
the scope of services includes assisting the primary Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
provider within the limits of available resources.
   2.5.1. AFRC FES Flights do not have organic vehicle assets. The host base provides these
   resources for training. During training activities, each flight receives primary resources
   (vehicles and equipment) from the host to manage the flight training activities being
   accomplished
       2.5.1.1. UTA’s. While utilizing host base equipment for training, PB FES personnel
       shall respond to real world emergencies as indicated in the MOU/MOA with the host unit
       as to ensure host unit capabilities are not diminished.
   2.5.2. Core missions include on-scene incident management, suppression, rescue, managing
   Hazmat incidents, and assisting the primary EMS providers in wartime and/or deployed
   environment as determined by local agreements and only when FES resources are available.

2.6. Standards and Regulatory Guidance Affecting Training. NFPA standards and
recommended practices affecting FES are adopted either as written or as implemented with
specific Technical Implementation Guides (TIG).
     2.6.1. AFRC FES policy and guidance for training and operations are implemented through
     TIGs approved by the AFRC/A7XEF and AFCESA. NFPA Standards are not implemented
     for one year after publication to allow time for analysis and development of a TIG. The TIGs
     reflect AFRC mission and priorities and ensure implementation of NFPA standards during
     training is consistent with AF and AFRC policy and guidance.
     2.6.2. AFRC/A7XEF establishes working groups as needed consisting of appointed
     members including the NAF/RSG FES or their representative. AFRC Fire Chief’s
     Committee assists in the development of AFRC PB FES TIGs.
2.7. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Uniforms. Proper PPE will be worn when
participating in training events that require it. All AFRC PB FES firefighters are issued PPE.
PPE is permanently issued to the firefighters at the first duty location as professional gear. The
RFC will ensure all PPE is inspected IAW NFPA Std. 1851, Standard on Selection, Care, and
Maintenance of Protective Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire Fighting
and is safe to use.
     2.7.1. NFPA Std. 1975 compliant BDU/DCU/ABU. AFRC PB FES personnel are issued
     compliant uniforms. They shall wear compliant uniforms at all times where firefighting
     activities are scheduled or a potential for firefighting activities exists.

   is available to each firefighter at no cost to the individual. RFC’s may approve attendance to
   AF/DoD formal training venues. Acquiring FESCS certification training from external (non
   DoD) contract sources at government expense requires review by the NAF/RSG A7C FES
   Manager. Final approval authority resides with AFRC/A7XEF.
   3.1.7. Certification in the DoD IFSAC program will be granted only for skills required for
   the duty position and the next-higher position to which the individual may be promoted.
   Certifications will not be issued for Training or testing greater than five years old.
       3.1.7.1. Individual(s) entering the 3E7XX career field with prior civilian training that
       provided either IFSAC or National Professional Qualification Board (NPQB)
       certification and also meet all required training requirements as stated in the 3E7XX
       Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP) shall have an electronic waiver package
       prepared by the Assistant Chief for Training (A/C for Training) IAW the Civil Engineer
       Certification Testing (CerTest) procedural guide. The package shall be submitted to the
       RFC. The approved package will then be submitted to the NAF/RSG A7C FES Manager
       for review. After review, the package will be sent to the HQ AFRC/A7XF Prime BEEF
       FES Manager for approval. Following review and concurrence, the waiver package will
       then be submitted to AFCESA/CEXF for approval. This shall be accomplished within
       the first six months.
   3.1.8. Deployed firefighters will meet forward operating location proficiency training
   requirements and are exempt from home station proficiency training during the period of
   deployment. Upon return from deployment, proficiency training may be credited on the date
   of training with appropriate documentation (AF IMT 1085) and approval of the RFC.
   Training for recurring certifications must be completed based on required timelines
   (example: Hazmat, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation [CPR] etc.).
   3.1.9. AFRC/A7XEF is responsible for approving and investigating effective and cost-
   effective methods to provide proficiency and certification training. This includes all trainers
   for aircraft and structural live fire exercises.
3.2. Management. The RFC establishes and maintains FES training programs that train AFRC
PB FES personnel to protect life, property and the environment while ensuring firefighter safety
and readiness IAW applicable standards.
   3.2.1. The AFRC PB FESTP is based on national consensus standards, OSHA regulations,
   DoD, USAF and AFRC specific guidance and policy. This assessment provides benchmarks
   to promote efficiency, sound management practices and to verify compliance with regulatory
   requirements and effectiveness of unit and command training programs. HQ AFRC/A7XEF
   will ensure the AFRC PB FESTP is incorporated into the Command Inspector General (IG)
   inspection checklist system. The Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) is the
   standard inspection checklist. The RFC will use this program along with any additional self-
   inspection checklists provided by the AFRC/A7XEF or NAF/RSG to satisfy the self-
   inspection requirements specified in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities.
3.3. FES Fire Prevention. AFRC PB FES Flights do not have a formal fire prevention program
while in UTA status, however, AFRC PB FES Flights should have training in the AF Fire
Prevention Program goals and objectives.
   3.3.1. Fire Prevention Training should be incorporated in the annual training plan.

Terms
Adjusted Manpower for Operations (AMO)—is the total number of operations personnel
needed to accomplish all fire ground tasks without multi-tasking. AMO is determined by
dividing the total authorizations for operations by the manpower availability factor 2.64. The
result is the number of personnel expected for duty when all authorized personnel are available.
The AMO is based on typical structural and aircraft firefighting tasks.
Aggregate Response Times (ART)—Total of dispatch time, turnout time, and travel time. The
time elapsed from the receipt of the emergency alarm to when the units arrive on scene.
Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) Vehicle—Vehicles designed to deliver and
dispense fire fighting agents on fires involving aircraft or liquid fuels
Air Force Fire Emergency Services Community of Practice (AF FES CoP)—The official
web site for AF FES.
Automated Civil Engineer System–Fire Department (ACES-FD)—A comprehensive and
automated dispatch system, and data collection and retrieval system mandatory for use in all AF
FES flights.
Critical Level of Service (CLS)—The level of capability when resources available provide is at
least a one appropriate vehicle and crew to each FDZ within the response time standard.
Although acceptable, CLS is the absolute minimum level of service and should only be allowed
for short durations. At this level firefighting forces can provide rescue and quick fire attack
operations for a short duration. Firefighting crews may provide limited search and rescue, and
property conservation during this period; however, these operational capabilities cannot be
sustained without additional resources.
DoD Component—USAF, USA, USN, USMC, and the Defense Logistics Agency
DoD Fire Emergency Services Certification System (FESCS)—A nationally accredited
system that validates training received by DoD emergency responders and issues certifications.
Expedient Firefighting—The first level of protection is the user. These individuals are
responsible to operate in the prescribed safe manner, and to initiate corrective action when
something goes wrong. For example, the user employs portable fire extinguishers when a fire
occurs. This level of protection is always required whenever people are present.
Expeditionary Firefighting—The second level of protection is a contingency fire department
with trained and equipped personnel that provides protection beyond that which users can
provide. This level of protection is required when the volume of assets or activities, or the
AFRCI32-2001 25 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   19


potential fire is estimated to be beyond the capability of the user. During Expeditionary
operations, firefighting forces are the primary installation emergency response forces and are
responsible for supporting the commander’s primary requirement to launch and recover sorties.
Functional Area Visit (FAV)—Functional Assistance Visits are a scheduled visit to a unit or
functional area within a unit to satisfy a specific need or request. FAV’s are tailored to the
subject functional area. FAV’s are conducted to provide guidance and assistance to AFRC units.
FAVs are usually requested by unit/wing commanders to furnish functional area expertise, help
develop new processes, implement new policies and procedures, or assist in preparing for
scheduled inspections.
Fire Demand Zone (FDZ)—A FDZ is a specific area within a fire district that demands similar
resources, tactics and strategy to manage FES events.
Fire District—A geographical area served by a fire station.
Fire Vehicles—Emergency response vehicles designed to pump or carry fire extinguishing
agents to the scene of a fire, transport specialized equipment required for FES operations, or
provide command and control capability. Fire vehicles include command, pumper, rescue,
HazMat, aerial, or ARFF vehicles.
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)—A national organization, recognized as the
authority for all matters involving fire emergencies that publishes national consensus standards
and the National Fire Codes.
National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS)—A national database of emergency
response data, owned by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and managed by the United States Fire Administration. NFIRS is
the mandatory central depository used by all DoD FES response organizations. ACES-FD sends
response data to the Naval Safety Center for population of the NFIRS database.
Optimum Level of Service (OLS)—The level of service available when 90 to 100 percent of
AMO required resources (vehicles set to provide required agent, required discharge capacity; and
required manpower for fire ground capability) are available. At the OLS, a maximum level of
service can be continuously provided, when determined appropriate by the Fire Chief. During
OLS, firefighting forces are capable of providing all services continuously throughout an event
with reasonable expectation of successful offensive fire attack operations, search and rescue, and
property conservation.
Reduced Level of Service (RLS)—The level of FES capability that exceeds the critical but is
less than the optimum level of service. During this level adequate firefighting capability can be
provided by utilizing cross staffing, selective response and sound fire ground tactics. At the
RLS, firefighting forces should be successful in offensive fire attack operations, search and
rescue, and property conservation; however, operations may not be sustainable throughout an
event without additional resources.
Inadequate Level of Service (ILS)—The level of service in which, except for rescue,
firefighters are not permitted to conduct interior operations in IDLH atmospheres (such as fire
areas). This LOS is comprised of a minimum of one fire company comprised of appropriate
vehicle and 4 firefighters available for emergency response.

Staff Assistance Visit (SAV)—A scheduled visit to a unit to validate unit compliance with
established program management directives. A SAV may be requested by a commander to
render support in a specific area, to prepare the unit for a unit compliance inspection (UCI) or to
provide an in-depth perspective of the health of the unit. The SAV team may review common
core compliance areas (CCCA) identified in AFI 90-201, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
Supplement (Sup) 1, Inspector General Activities , and applicable self-inspection checklists.
Although the primary purpose of a SAV is to validate unit compliance, the SAV team is not
limited to just CCCA or checklist items. Within FES, over-the-shoulder personnel evaluations
and evaluator proficiency evaluations may be accomplished.
Senior Fire Official (SFO)—The senior official at a scene of an event.
Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI)—UCIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as
well as mission areas identified by senior Air Force and MAJCOM leadership as critical or
important to assess/assure the health and performance of organizations. Unit failure to comply
with the established directives in these areas could result in significant legal liabilities, penalties,
or significant mission impact.
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A five-character alphanumeric designator that identifies a specific
capability package. The UTCs for all Air Force packages are found in volume III of the WMP
and are used by unified and specified commands, HQ USAF, and the JCS to identify forces
required to support contingency plans.

A8.2. Proficiency training for Reserve 3E7X1 personnel is in the AFRC PB FES Training
Program (TP) outlined in Attachment 10.
A8.3. Commanders include Air Force Reserve Prime BEEF fire fighters in annual field training
and should include the RFC in the advance planning to identify training site fire protection and
fire fighter training needs. Fire fighters establish a simulated bare base fire department. They
should perform only a fair share of duties outside the fire protection functional areas. For
Training purposes, they should treat the training site as a tent city and establish fire safety
procedures accordingly. They provide fire protection for the FTX site within the limits of
available equipment. The "FES Concepts of Operations" and Expeditionary Firefighting guide
provided separately contains other additional information.
A8.4. Eligibility for Secret Security Clearance: All 3E7XX personnel require eligibility for a
Secret security clearance. Personnel should be removed from the career field if eligibility is not
received.
A8.5. Managing Untrained Personnel. Do not assign fire protection duties to personnel with
AFSC 3E711 while awaiting technical training. They will not receive driver training or ride on
any Fire Department vehicles during fire fighting operations or emergency responses. Personnel
with AFSC 3E731 require direct supervision by fully qualified fire protection personnel when
performing fire protection duties or operating fire protection vehicles and equipment.
A8.6. AFRC Seasoning Training Program (STP). The STP is designed to build a ready force by
allowing recent 3-Skill Level and formal tech school graduates to voluntarily remain on Active
Duty for Training (ADT) orders until they have been trained via On the Job Training (OJT).

      AFRC PRIME BEEF FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES UNITERRUPTED UNIT
                       TRAINING ASSEMBLIES (UTA)

A9.1. Firefighter training requirements are extensive. AFRC PB firefighters participate in the
contingency and ancillary training required of all Prime BEEF personnel. They must also
participate in certification/upgrade, proficiency, NFPA, and driver training. Additionally,
firefighters must continually maintain capability to perform the critical tasks of firefighting and
rescue from aircraft and structures. To develop and maintain this capability, firefighting teams
must exercise at frequent intervals. Because teams, not individuals accomplish firefighting and
rescue, it is critical that training be accomplished by teams. Likewise, it is crucial that teams be
provided the time to conduct and participate in these exercises without interruption.
A9.2. UTA Types. For purposes of this document, there are two types of UTAs: CE UTA and
Fire UTA. The CE UTA is the date the entire squadron is scheduled to train. The Fire UTA is
the date in which just the fire teams are scheduled. There shall be a minimum of three Fire
(alternate) UTA’s per year. Any deviation due to mission requirements shall require written
approval by unit CES/CC or MSG/CC.
   A9.2.1. The purpose of the fire UTA is to allow firefighters to accomplish training requiring
   multiple UTCs such as aircraft and structural firefighting and rescue exercises. Additionally,
   they practice for and conduct certification performance testing.
A9.3. The RFC is responsible to provide management oversight of all activities for firefighters.
The RFC should work the CE UTA and the Fire UTA. This will enable the RFC to interface and
coordinate with other personnel in and outside the squadron.

     AFRC PRIME BEEF FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES TRAINING PROGRAM

A10.1. Preface. This AFRC PB FES TP is a comprehensive proficiency training guide that
identifies education and proficiency training requirements for the FES career field. The TP will
provide AFRC PB FES Firefighters with a clear path to success and instill continuity into all
facets of our career field proficiency training program.
A10.2. Purpose. The FES TP is designed to further firefighter’s educations beyond receipt of
the initial skills training received upon achieving certifications from training courses.
Additionally, the plan identifies expected levels of competency based on the rank and duty
position of the individual. The plan places expectations for advanced study and formal training
in both the fire protection career field as well as pursuing academic education. It is not intended
to levy mandatory certifications since these guidelines are established in DODI 6055.06M.
   A10.2.1. The primary purpose of this plan is to establish minimum reoccurring training
   requirements contingent on the firefighter’s rank and duty position. It is assumed the training
   at each level will be within the scope of the individual’s capabilities since the level of
   performance is currently expected or - soon will be - based on their rank or duty position.
   This program also identifies annual Continuing Education Units (CEU) based on the duty
   position or rank. CEU’s will apply to firefighters even upon PCS or deployment and are
   calculated on an annual basis despite status or location.
