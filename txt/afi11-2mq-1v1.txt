SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
revision aligns the training cycle with the 12-month fiscal year. It clarifies that the Ready
Aircrew Program (RAP) applies only to ACC and ACC-gained units. It changes MAJCOM
ANG OPR from ACC/A3G to NGB/A3O, and adds AFRC MAJCOM OPR as AFRC/A3T. This
revision changes the term ―non-RAP‖ to ―basic skills‖. Table 4.1 Ground Training Requirements
and Table 4.2 Basic Skills (formerly Non-RAP) requirements have been removed and replaced
with tables in the RAP tasking memorandum or MAJCOM specific guidance. Numerous
changes have been made to the currency table (new Table 4.1). This revision clarifies
Launch/Recovery (L/R) evaluation requirements and approval for local L/R training. Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Defense Training
requirements have been clarified, including elimination of the CBRNE flight. It incorporates the
use of standardized task event identifiers. This revision removes a blanket authorization for ACC
aircrew to obtain multiple qualifications without a specific multiple qualification authorization. It
also clarifies criteria for instructor upgrade. The difference training paragraph has been updated.
This instruction also revises the definition of experienced aircrew, replaces the definition for
Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) with Predator Mission Aircrew Training System (PMATS),
and replaces the Pilot Proficiency Sortie definition with Pattern Proficiency Sortie (PPS).
Demanding and Non-Demanding sortie definitions have been deleted, as well as definitions for
Basic Delivery and Tactical Delivery as they are not applicable to MQ-1 operations.

AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  7


   1.2.6. Training Reports. Designed operational capability (DOC) tasked squadrons will
   submit a training report to higher headquarters (HHQ) IAW MAJCOM/A3 directives.
   Squadrons may submit out-of-cycle reports at anytime if HHQ assistance is required to
   prepare for UTC or deployment tasking. Report only significant shortfalls or limiting factors
   (LIMFACS) that affect most or all of the squadron for prolonged periods of time. Include
   possible solutions or specific assistance required if able. MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or
   minimize noted shortfalls or LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way.
      1.2.6.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not accomplished due
      to shortages of equipment, munitions, ARMS software, etc. Example: unable to
      accomplish actual weapons release due to a shortage of training weapons. LIMFACS are
      factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training effectiveness. Example:
      squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is limited due to the lack of
      ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may include support hardware and
      software.
      1.2.6.2. All deviations from these training requirements, after prorating, will be reported
      to MAJCOM/A3 (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T). This includes requirements waived by
      Operations Group Commander (OG/CC). Submit via e-mail training reports to
      appropriate MAJCOM program manager.
      1.2.6.3. (N/A AFSOC) CAF OG/CCs will submit a RAP training report every fourth
      month during the 12-month training cycle (February, June and end of cycle report in
      October). In lieu of RAP reports, ACC Formal Training (TF-coded) Units (FTU) will
      submit Status of Formal Training reports every four months during the training cycle
      (Feb and Jun and end of cycle report). Reporting will be IAW guidance and examples at
      the       ACC/A3YU           Community          of        Practice     (CoP)       at
      https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=AC-OP-02-94.
      RAP/FTU briefings should be submitted via e-mail to ACC/A3YU
      (acc.a3yu@langley.af.mil).
   1.2.7. Individual aircrew will:
      1.2.7.1. Hand-carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing
      qualifications and training requirements.
      1.2.7.2. Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the
      guidelines of this volume.
      1.2.7.3. Participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,
      current, and prepared.
1.3. Processing Changes. Forward recommendations for change to this volume to HQ
ACC/A3Y on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. HQ ACC/A3Y will
coordinate changes to this instruction with MAJCOM OPRs and consolidate recommended
changes and forward proposed interim changes to HQ USAF/A3O-AT. HQ USAF/A3O is the
approval authority for changes to this volume. Handle time-sensitive changes by immediate-
action message.

1.4. Training. Aircrew training is designed to progress a pilot or sensor operator from Initial
Qualification Training (IQT), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to
Continuation Training (CT).
    1.4.1. IQT. IQT provides aircrew members the training necessary to initially qualify in a
    basic aircraft position and flying duties without regard to any specific unit's mission. See
    Chapter 2. Upon completion of IQT, the aircrew member attains Basic Aircraft
    Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for all follow-on training, including MQT.
    Except for general officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status.
    Waiver authority for any aircrew member other than general officers above the wing level to
    remain BAQ for longer than six months is MAJCOM/A3 (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T).
    1.4.2. MQT. MQT provides aircrew members the advanced training necessary to qualify in
    an assigned aircrew position to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. See
    Chapter 3. Aircrew will maintain BAQ status until completion of MQT. Completion of
    MQT or Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructor course is a prerequisite for Combat Mission
    Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC). Note: CMR/BMC status requires a MSN
    evaluation IAW AFI 11-2MQ-1, Volume 2, MQ-1 Crew Evaluation Criteria.
    1.4.3. Continuation Training (CT). CT is the training program for CMR/BMC-designated
    aircrew. CT is designed to maintain a minimum level of proficiency and/or to increase the
    capability of individual aircrew. There are two aspects of CT: Specific MAJCOM guidance
    (i.e., RAP TM for ACC) and Basic Skills training requirements found in the RAP TM.
       1.4.3.1. (ACC/ACC-Gained only) Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). RAP is the ACC
       program designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core
       tasked missions. Types of training sorties and events are unit specific and established by
       the MAJCOM and unit commander. Specifics are contained in the RTM which is
       released periodically and is to be filed at the back of this instruction. AFSOC follows a
       semi-annual training cycle: Oct-Mar and Apr-Sep. AFSOC will publish RTMs as
       required.
       1.4.3.2. Basic Skills Training Requirements. These requirements ensure skills are
       maintained to safely and proficiently operate unit aircraft and associated equipment.
       These requirements apply to all MQ-1 units and generally do not change. Basic Skills
       sorties and events are contained in the RTM (or MAJCOM specific guidance).
    1.4.4. CT Requirements. There are two basic designations for qualified aircrew: CMR and
    BMC. CMR training requirements are considerably more robust than BMC requirements.
       1.4.4.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
           1.4.4.1.1. Minimum training required for aircrew to be qualified and proficient in all
           of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
           1.4.4.1.2. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1 positions
           and flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs
           may designate other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR.
           EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of
           their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s to CMR and designate the overage
           BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced aircrew members with
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                    9


          at least 50 percent, if available, designated CMR. (ARC: any aircrew member may be
          designated CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion).
          1.4.4.1.3. CMR aircrew maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of
          the flying unit to which they are assigned/attached. CMR aircrew must maintain
          currency in all core designated flight training, sorties and events and all mission
          ground training which affect CMR status.
          1.4.4.1.4. Non-CMR (N-CMR). Failure to complete CMR training or maintain
          designated currencies results in regression to N-CMR status unless waived by
          appropriate authority. While N-CMR, pilots may perform missions (including
          exercises and contingencies) and events in which they are current and qualified at the
          discretion of the SQ/CC. Aircrew that regress to N-CMR status will accomplish the
          requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.6
      1.4.4.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC).
          1.4.4.2.1. The minimum training required to be familiar with all (and may be
          qualified and proficient in some) of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit
          and weapons system.
          1.4.4.2.2. All active duty wing aircrew positions that are not designated CMR
          positions, are BMC positions. BMC designations are assigned to aircrew that have a
          primary job performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the
          flying operation. FTU/USAF Weapons School (USAFWS) instructors and
          operational test aircrew are also assigned BMC status.
          1.4.4.2.3. BMC aircrew maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. They
          may also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core missions.
          For those missions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC aircrew must be
          able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC aircrew must
          accomplish all mission-related ground training designated by their assigned SQ/CC.
          1.4.4.2.4. BMC aircrew may deploy and participate in any mission for which they are
          proficient and qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC.
          1.4.4.2.5. Non-BMC (N-BMC). Failure to complete BMC required training results in
          regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will determine
          missions aircrew may perform and supervision level required. Aircrew that regress to
          N-BMC status will accomplish the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.6
      1.4.4.3. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills that
      are not required by every aircrew member, but are necessary to carry out the unit's
      assigned missions. Specialized training is normally accomplished after an aircrew
      member is assigned CMR/BMC status. Unless otherwise specified in this AFI, aircrew in
      CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as any
      additional training requirements are accomplished.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of readiness
   consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for
   realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety. This instruction provides
10                                                         AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


     training guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable
     flying/operations publications.
     1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC/TRSS) will develop and validate training
     programs when tasked by HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMS may submit requests for training
     program support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and
     tasked to ACC TRSS. Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade
     operational test aircrew in support of specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by
     the TEG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS.
     1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked roles,
     maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training
     missions should emphasize basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and
     operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition
     capabilities. Tactical training will include use of captive and live weapons, threat simulators,
     and countermeasures.
     1.5.4. In-flight Supervision: Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of
     supervision necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include
     introduction to new tasks, or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot
     (IP) or instructor sensor operator (ISO) is generally required.
     1.5.5. An experienced aircrew member has one of the following:
        1.5.5.1. 500 hours MQ-1.
        1.5.5.2. 250 hours MQ-1 and previously experienced in another MDS.
        1.5.5.3. 150 hours MQ-1 and previously experienced in MQ-9.
1.6. RAP Policy and Management (ACC/ACC-gained units only): Note: RAP is an ACC
program that tasks operational MQ-1 units with specific training sorties and events to ensure
units are prepared to accomplish their DOC mission(s). Other MAJCOMs will develop and
direct specific training guidance that ensures units are appropriately trained for contingency
operations.
     1.6.1. The ACC/ACC-gained units’ RAP annual training cycle is aligned with the 12 month
     fiscal year calendar, October - September. AFSOC follows a semi-annual training cycle
     October-March and April - September.
     1.6.2. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number and type of RAP missions,
     plus specific weapons delivery qualifications as determined by MAJCOM and unit
     commanders. The breakout of sorties and mission types is provided as a guideline; minor
     variations are authorized.
     1.6.3. Variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC.
     Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance
     and the individual’s capabilities.
     1.6.4. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a
     building block-type mission. Each profile or mission requires successfully completing a
     significant portion of the events applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC
     and Attachment 2.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  11


   1.6.5. The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR.
   1.6.6. CMR status requires:
       1.6.6.1. A 1-month look-back at the CMR mission rate.
       1.6.6.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
       1.6.6.3. Confirmation that the progressed aircrew member can complete the prorated
       number of sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
       1.6.6.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification
       (see paragraph 3.2.2 for initial verification and paragraph 4.2.5 for continuation
       verification).
       1.6.6.5. Squadron CC certification.
   1.6.7. Special Capabilities or Qualifications. SQ/CCs will determine which aircrew will
   train for and maintain special capabilities or qualifications. Special capability/qualification
   sortie and event requirements are normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC
   sortie/event requirements.
   1.6.8. CMR and BMC (wing-level and below) aircrew will fly the required monthly mission
   rate. If unable, refer to Regression, paragraph 4.7
   1.6.9. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew experience level and
   qualifications on the last day of the current training cycle.
   1.6.10. Units converting to another Mission Design Series (MDS) may fly aircrew in CMR
   positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if CMR
   mission rates cannot be supported. CMR aircrew should be flown at a CMR rate for the
   month prior to initial operational capability (IOC). Active duty wings converting to new
   MDS are authorized one SQ-equivalent of additional API-6s during the conversion period.
   However, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final
   conversion equipage.
1.7. RAP Training Mission Program Development (ACC/ACC-Gained only): Note: RAP is
an ACC program that tasks operational MQ-1 units with specific training sorties and events to
ensure units are prepared to accomplish their DOC mission(s). Other MAJCOMs will develop
and direct specific training guidance that ensures units are appropriately trained for contingency
operations.
   1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR
   and BMC aircrew as well as those individuals carrying special capabilities or qualifications
   and are IAW the RAP tasking message. The requirements in Table 1.1 establish the
   minimum number of sortie/missions per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training.
   The current RTM takes precedence over this volume and may contain updated requirements
   and events not yet incorporated in Attachment 2.
   1.7.2. Basic Skills requirements, missions, and events designed to ensure maintenance of
   basic crewmember skills are in addition to RAP requirements. Aircrew may log Basic Skills
   events on RAP sorties provided there is no effect on RAP sortie effectiveness. Unit flying
   programs contain sorties for aircrew to accomplish their minimum Basic Skills requirements.
12                                                           AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


     1.7.3. Consider collateral or cost-of-business mission requirements when developing unit
     flying programs. These missions do not directly relate to combat employment or basic skills
     training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations. Functional
     check flights and aerial demonstration support are in this category. RAP training does not
     require these sorties.
     1.7.4. Unit flying programs contain a number of attrition sorties that compensate for non-
     effective training sorties. Log a non-effective sortie when not accomplishing a major portion
     of valid training for a planned RAP or Basic Skills training mission due to poor weather, air
     aborts, etc. In order to allocate accurate numbers of attrition sorties to unit flying programs, it
     is essential that units appropriately log non-effective sorties.

1.8. Training Records and Reports:
     1.8.1. Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
        1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
        1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
        1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.

        https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.
        1.8.1.6. Applicable MAJCOM directives.
     1.8.2. Units will track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable):
        1.8.2.1. Ground training.
        1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, MAJCOM-specific
        sorties and missions types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
        1.8.2.3. Look-back: MAJCOM-specific mission requirements using 1-month, and 3-
        month running totals for look-back.
        1.8.2.4. Currencies. Sortie and event currencies required for unsupervised flight.
        1.8.2.5. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment
        attempts and histories.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   13


   1.8.3. Units may fill in ARMS "NO DATE" with either the date of the last FTU sortie or the
   unit mission-certification date.
1.9. Mission and Armament Recording.
   1.9.1. Aircrew should use and assess all available training documentation, such as digital
   recording devices, on all missions. Individual aircrew should review applicable portions of
   mission tapes to enhance training.
   1.9.2. As a guide, the following items should be reviewed after every mission: weapons
   parameters, accuracy, identification procedures, adherence to training rules, communications
   procedures and discipline, flight discipline, and tactical employment.
1.10. Aircrew Utilization Policy:
   1.10.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group aircrew (API-1/6) fill authorized positions IAW
   unit manning documents and that aircrew member status is properly designated. The overall
   objective is that aircrew perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign aircrew to
   valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, flight evaluation board (FEB)/mishap board member,
   etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flying
   proficiency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced pilots in the first year of their
   initial operational assignment, supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to
   combat activities.
   1.10.2. Commanders must ensure that MQ-1 aircrew assigned duties are commensurate with
   their level of assignment. Units may assign the following duties required by various
   publications to CAF squadron-level aircrew: tactics officer, scheduler, flying safety officer,
   supervisor of flying, mobility and contingency plans officer, training officer (except ARMS
   documentation), SQ standardization and evaluation liaison officer, and other duties directly
   related to flying operations. Do not attach squadron-assigned MQ-1 aircrew to wing or
   group staffs or man wing or group staff positions with squadron-assigned MQ-1 aircrew
   unless total wing, group, and squadron MQ-1 crew manning is 100 percent or better. In
   some instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, units may attach squadron-
   assigned MQ-1 aircrew to the wing. Commanders (CCs) will assure wing-and-above staff
   aircrew perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and fill
   positions authorized in UMDs.
   1.10.3. Aircrew will not perform long-term duties which detract from their primary duties of
   training for, or performing, the unit flying mission.
1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance: Note: Sortie allocation guidance applies to training
sortie/missions, not contingency operations.
   1.11.1. In general, inexperienced aircrew should receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced aircrew. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
       1.11.1.1. Formal Training (TF-Coded) Units. Formal syllabus training, Instructor
       Upgrade Training, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or
       Flight Examiner (FE) duties.
       1.11.1.2. Operational (CC-Coded) Units. Squadron-assigned CMR, squadron-assigned
       MQT, wing-assigned CMR, wing-assigned MQT, and wing assigned BMC.
14                                                       AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


        1.11.1.3. Test (CB-coded) Units. Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required
        to prepare for assigned projects and tasking, BMC training requirements that cannot be
        accomplished on primary missions.
     1.11.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
     1.11.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following
     aircrew will maintain formal instructor status (when possible): WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC,
     OG/CD. For FTU-only wings, all API-6 aircrew will maintain instructor status (optional for
     WG/CC, OG/CC, and functional check flight (FCF) crews). FTU-only wings will fly API-
     1/6 aircrew as required by programmed flying training (PFT).
     1.11.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM
     guidance. Above-Wing-Level and test unit aircrew will fly the BMC rate; however, are not
     required to complete BMC-specific missions and events or meet monthly lookback
     requirements. They will accomplish Basic Skills requirements within their BMC number of
     sorties. Units should provide assigned aircrew adequate resources to maintain minimum
     training requirements; however, the support will not come at the expense of the flying
     squadron's primary mission. API 6/8 flyers will strive to accomplish Basic Skills
     requirements with allotted BMC sorties. If units cannot meet attached aircrew member
     requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, MAJCOM Supplement. Units
     requiring flying hour adjustments for attached aircrew must request program changes IAW
     MAJCOM instructions.
     1.11.5. (N/A AFRC and ANG) There is no maximum sortie count for CMR aircrew.
     Table 1.2 defines the minimum and maximum sortie requirements for other aircrew. On
     occasion, unique operations may require aircrew to fly more than the maximum number of
     sorties authorized, however, this may impact training of other aircrew. Aircrew assigned or
     attached to ACC Office of the Inspector General (ACC/IGS) as API-6 will maintain RAP
     currencies/lookback per API-8 guidance.

                            INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) for MQ-1. IQT
includes Basic Training (B-Course), Re-qualification Training (TX), Launch and Recovery (L/R)
Training, and Senior Officer Training.
     2.1.1. IQT will normally be conducted during formal syllabus courses at an FTU. In
     extenuating circumstances, when FTU training is not available within a reasonable time
     period, and with appropriate approval, IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW the
     provisions of this chapter. The following guidance applies to unit administered IQT (other
     than being accomplished in the FTU).
        2.1.1.1. IQT Programs will be based upon the syllabus tracks, flow programs, sorties,
        and events required in ACC Syllabus Course MQ-1B Qualification Training (Basic
        course) MQ1QT, MQ-1B Launch/Recovery Training Course MQ1LR, Predator Formal
        Training Unit Instructor Upgrade Training Course FIUT, or Predator Foreign Remote
        Pilot/Sensor Operator Training Courses FORNPRED.
        2.1.1.2. Completion of IQT requires a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and
        AFI 11-2MQ-1, Volume 2.
        2.1.1.3. Aircrew will not be evaluated on events in which they were not specifically
        trained or qualified (i.e., mission ready aircrew not trained in launch and recovery (L/R)
        operations).
     2.1.2. Completion of L/R qualification training will conclude with an AF Form 8 flight
     evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and AFI 11-2MQ-1, Volume 2.
2.2. Approval/Waiver for Local IQT:
     2.2.1. Gaining MAJCOM/A3 (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T) is the approval authority to conduct
     local IQT, and is waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally conducted
     IQT. Provide a copy of local IQT programs and waivers to HQ ACC/A3Y.
        2.2.1.1. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
            2.2.1.1.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training.
            2.2.1.1.2. Summary of individual’s flying experience.
            2.2.1.1.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
            2.2.1.1.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
     2.2.2. When developing unit-level L/R IQT programs, commanders will base the program on
     MQ-1B Launch/Recovery Training Course MQ1LR and provisions in paragraph 6.5 Forward
     copy of unit re-qualification program to MAJCOM POC (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T) and
     ACC/A3YU.
        2.2.2.1. OG/CC is approval authority to administer local L/R training for individuals
        previously qualified in L/R operations in the last three years.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                    17


       2.2.2.2. Gaining MAJCOM/CC (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T) is the approval authority for
       non-formal course IQT for Colonel Selects and above to be conducted at the unit to
       which the officer is assigned.
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, this instruction, the
appropriate formal course syllabus and Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcements (applicable ACC Syllabus Course). Individuals without all prerequisites met or
waived may be denied entry into training.
2.4. Ground Training. Ground training may be tailored to an individual’s background and
experience. Use available and current reference materials such as Air Force Tactics, Techniques
and Procedures (AFTTP), instructor guides, and audiovisual programs as supporting materials to
the maximum extent possible. Accomplish simulator missions in an MQ-1 Aircrew Training
Device (ATD). Use an approved Predator Mission Aircrew Training System (PMATS) to the
maximum extent possible; however, OG/CCs can authorize a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer,
Part-Task Trainer, Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT), or Ground Control Station (GCS) if a
PMATS is not available.
2.5. Flying Training:
   2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be based upon required events from the
   appropriate formal course syllabus.
   2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the approved syllabus. Failure
   to complete within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to
   MAJCOM/A3 (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T) with aircrew member’s name, rank, reason for
   delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.5.3. Aircrew will fly under instructor supervision until completion of IQT.
   2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements. The
   SQ/CC may authorize incorporation of additional training events into the program, based on
   student proficiency and background. Additional training due to student non-progression is
   available within the constraints of the course syllabus. SQ/CCs may add discretionary
   additional training sorties as required.
2.6. IQT for Senior Officers:
   2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (Colonel selects and above) will be
   conducted at the FTU unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2
   2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus
   requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives. Note: paragraph 2.2 waiver authority
   applies only for local IQT.
   2.6.3. If senior officers must be trained at the unit to which they are assigned, they will be in
   formal training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice
   commanders until training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by
   gaining MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG).

                                           Chapter 3

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQ-1 Mission Qualification Training begins at the FTU during IQT, normally
culminating with a mission evaluation and the aircrew member attaining BAQ status. Guidance
in this chapter is provided to assist unit CCs in developing a unit-specific MQT program to
upgrade newly assigned aircrew members to BMC or CMR to accomplish the unit mission.
Completion of the unit-specific MQT program is required for the aircrew member to attain BMC
or CMR status.
     3.1.1. A unit administered MQT program will be approved by OG/CC (forward a copy of
     local MQT training programs to MAJCOM).
     3.1.2. . Units may tailor the program for each aircrew member based on experience,
     currency, documented performance, and formal training.
     3.1.3. Sorties and events for a unit administered MQT program will include sorties and
     events needed to qualify an aircrew member in the unit-specific mission and TTPs. The
     program will incorporate unaccomplished sorties and events from the IQT syllabus.
     3.1.4. Units will ensure events not accomplished at the FTU are completed or waived before
     the individual is certified BMC or CMR.
     3.1.5. The Initial MSN Evaluation and certification to CMR/BMC will be completed NLT
     120 calendar days after the individual’s completion of IQT; notify MAJCOM/A3
     (NGB/A3O, AFRC/A3T) if training exceeds 120 calendar days. MQT training is complete
     upon SQ/CC certification to BMC/CMR.
     3.1.6. Aircrew in MQT should not fly in FLAG, Weapons School support deployments,
     Weapons System Evaluation Programs, or equivalent type exercises.
3.2. Ground Training:
     3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as
     determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this
     requirement.
     3.2.2. Initial Verification/Special Operations Planning Exercise (SOPE). CMR aircrew
     will demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mission to a formal
     board established by the SQ/CC. Desired board composition is SQ/CC or DO (chairman),
     weapons officer, intelligence officer, a senior Instructor SO, and a plans representative.
     Suggested verification briefing guides are at Attachment 3.
        3.2.2.1. CMR aircrew will complete an initial verification within 90 days (ANG: 180
        days) after completing MQT. Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR until
        the verification is complete.
        3.2.2.2. At the discretion of the SQ/CC, BMC pilots may accomplish an initial
        verification and/or participate in CT verifications to facilitate future upgrade to CMR
        status.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               19


      3.2.2.3. AFSOC crews who participate in a SOPE will meet Initial Verification
      requirements.
      3.2.2.4. SQ/CCs may elect to count completion of unit-specific MQT programs or
      combat and combat support sorties flown during MQT as satisfying the initial
      verification/SOPE requirement.
   3.2.3. Initial Aircrew Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield
   Explosive (CBRNE) Defense Training. Aircrew CBRNE training is designed to ensure
   aircrew proficiency in the overall use of CBRNE individual protective equipment (IPE) and
   to familiarize aircrew with combat capabilities while wearing CBRNE IPE.
      3.2.3.1. Ground Training. Units will ensure aircrew complete appropriate CBRNE
      defense training courses IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM)
      Program Planning and Operations, and MAJCOM guidance. Aircrew will accomplish
      the following training prior to the first ATD with CBRNE IPE:
          3.2.3.1.1. Physiological effects/first aid of CBRNE agents.
          3.2.3.1.2. Equipment orientation/fitting of full IPE.
          3.2.3.1.3. GCS entry/exit procedures.
      3.2.3.2. CBRNE ATD. When tasked to deploy to a CBRNE high threat area (HTA) or
      medium threat area (MTA) as outlined in AFI 10-2501, aircrew will accomplish a
      CBRNE ATD mission. This training is typically accomplished in preparation for Launch
      and Recovery Element (LRE) deployment to HTA or MTA. The CBRNE ATD will be
      accomplished upon each tasking to deploy to an HTA or MTA. Mission will be
      conducted in standard ground crew CBRNE IPE as a minimum, and consist of correctly
      donning and checking IPE, simulated emergency procedures, basic tactical mission
      profile, crew coordination procedures, and doffing of simulated contaminated equipment.
      Both aircrew will wear the equipment at the same time in order to adapt to limitations to
      crew coordination. An elevated MOPP Level (3 or 4) appropriate to the simulated
      threat(s) will be maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes in the ATD. CBRNE ATD
      missions are intended to complement existing ATD mission profiles and are not additive
      to ATD requirements. Units without access to an ATD may use a GCS for training.
          3.2.3.2.1. Aircrew members will be trained to use Ground CBRNE IPE upon the
          completion of initial ground and ATD training.
          3.2.3.2.2. The initial CBRNE ATD mission may be credited towards CBRNE CT
          requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
3.3. Simulator Training:
   3.3.1. PMATS will be used if available. If a PMATS is unavailable, MQT simulator
   requirements may be combined into one or more CPT missions to accomplish appropriate
   switchology and emergency procedures training. MQT aircrew should fly mission profiles
   that replicate wartime tasking.
   3.3.2. MQT PMATS Event Requirements:
      3.3.2.1. Instruments and Emergency Procedures. Personal and mission preparation,
      normal ground operations, flight operations, navigation, emergency procedures and
20                                                      AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


        approaches, published penetration and approach to any specified alternate and home base,
        post-flight ground operations, Critical Action Procedures (CAPs), and selected non-CAPs
        emergency procedures (EP).
        3.3.2.2. SAT and Weapons Anomalies. Heavyweight takeoff, tactical procedures,
        tactical navigation, weapons deliveries (normal and backup), weapons anomalies,
        emergency divert/recovery procedures, hung ordnance procedures, and selected
        emergency procedures. These missions will be accomplished using a tactical scenario.
3.4. Flying Training. Unit-developed MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron
missions. Maximum use of armament recording assets and actual deliveries are encouraged on
all MQT missions.
     3.4.1. Supervision. An IP/ISO is required unless specified otherwise. The SQ/CC will
     determine the physical position of supervision unless specified otherwise.
     3.4.2. Prerequisites and Currency. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an
     additional review sortie will be flown before continuing the program.
     3.4.3. Mission Evaluation. This mission will be administered IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
     AFI 11-2MQ-1, Volume 2, and MAJCOM and local directives. Crews will only be
     evaluated on events in which they are trained.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               21


                                          Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter, along with the current MAJCOM-specific guidance (RTM for
ACC/ ACC Gained), outlines ground and flying continuation training requirements for BAQ,
BMC, and CMR aircrew. Aircrew must be qualified IAW this instruction, AFI 11-401, AFI 11-
202, Volume 2, AFI 11-2MQ-1, Volume 2, and applicable MAJCOM and local instructions.
Aircrew must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status; MQT (or FTU instructor upgrade) to fly in
BMC/CMR status. Refer to Chapter 6, Specialized Training, for additional training program
specifics. During CT, aircrew will update all applicable ground and flying currencies IAW AFI
11-202, Volume 1, this volume, and other ancillary training publications. Training terms and
sortie/event definitions referenced throughout this chapter are found in Attachment 1 and
Attachment 2, respectively. Units will track completed training and monitor unaccomplished
training using ARMS.
4.2. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the ground training table in
the RTM or MAJCOM specific guidance. Waiver authority for the ground training specified is
IAW the reference directive. Ground training accomplished during IQT/MQT may be credited
toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished. The RTM is a
reference for MQ-1 specific ground training only, which will be tracked in ARMS. The RTM
and/or MAJCOM specific guidance does not include all Air Force ancillary training, which
should be tracked at unit level. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes
precedence. Chapter 6 contains specialized programs with both flying and ground training
requirements.
   4.2.1. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher
   Program; AFI 11-202, Volume 2; and MAJCOM supplements.
       4.2.1.1. Units will ensure IRC programs include briefings on recognition and how to deal
       with spatial disorientation, unusual attitude recoveries, transition between visual and
       instrument conditions, weather avoidance, and navigation procedures.
       4.2.1.2. Units will also develop theater-specific instrument academic programs for
       inclusion in their pre-deployment spin-up training programs. Units will include a course
       on flight operations in icing conditions with emphasis on the MQ-1 limitations,
       capabilities, and avoidance in their theater-specific instrument academic training.
   4.2.2. Aircrew Training Device (ATD):
       4.2.2.1. The RTM and MAJCOM specific guidance depicts minimum ATD training
       requirements. Accomplish ATD training requirements in a PMATS. OG/CC can
       substitute other training devices as described in paragraph 2.4 if PMATS is not
       available. Units will determine additional CT training device requirements based on
       expected employment tasking, training device capabilities, and mission training
       objectives. Units will determine appropriate supervision levels for ATD missions/tasks.
       Units will track all aircrew device training used to satisfy RAP and basic skills
       requirements. Note: Aircrew are not expected to have or gain proficiency in EPs in
       phases of flight in which they are not qualified (e.g., L/R ops).
22                                                       AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


        4.2.2.2. Units will develop scenarios that cover all CAPs, EPs, instrument approach
        procedures, and other scenario requirements based on expected employment tasking and
        training device capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable
        during daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios annually and update as
        required. Unusual attitude and inadvertent weather entry procedures training and unusual
        attitude recovery training will be accomplished during all instrument or emergency
        procedure ATD training. Unusual attitude training will include recognition of heads up
        display (HUD) limitations.
        4.2.2.3. Tactical (TAC), EP, and CBRNE missions will be accomplished in a PMATS, if
        available. If a unit does not have access to a PMATS, EP and CBRNE missions will be
        accomplished in the best ATD available. If required, a GCS may be used to accomplish
        this training.
            4.2.2.3.1. EP ATD. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight EPs and maintain
            proficiency in applying aircraft general knowledge to abnormal situations. Specific
            Mission Tasks: Unusual attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent
            weather entry, controlled flight departure recognition and recovery procedures, CAPs,
            aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, in-flight EPs, and instrument
            procedures.
            4.2.2.3.2. TAC ATD. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight malfunctions and
            maintain proficiency in applying tactical knowledge to combat scenarios. Specific
            Mission Tasks: DOC-relevant simulated combat employment, threat recognition and
            counter tactics, weapons malfunction procedures, relevant CAPs and aircraft
            subsystem failure procedures, controllability and structural damage checklists.
     4.2.3. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
        4.2.3.1. This monthly training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency
        procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One
        aircrew member should present a situation and another aircrew member discuss actions
        necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. CAPs and
        squadron special interest items should be emphasized. Incorporate the following
        elements into the SEPT training program:
            4.2.3.1.1. SQ/CC or SQ/DO involvement in the selection of monthly SEPT topics.
            4.2.3.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using MQ-1 mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
            4.2.3.1.3. Discuss at least two EPs for each phase of flight--in which qualified--
            during the SEPT session.
        4.2.3.2. Aircrew will accomplish a SEPT each calendar month. Currency will expire at
        the end of the following month. Aircrew with an expired SEPT are grounded until
        subsequently completed. ACC/ACC-gained aircrew will accomplish a minimum of two
        SEPTs each 12-month training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor. AFSOC aircrew will
        accomplish a minimum of one SEPT each 6-month training cycle with an IP or SQ
        supervisor.
        4.2.3.3. SEPTs should be accomplished in the best ATD available or a GCS. If an ATD
        or GCS is not available, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one, but small flight-
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                               23


     sized groups are allowable if all members participate to the full extent and share equal
     time responding to emergency situations.
     4.2.3.4. Completion of an ATD EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement, if not
     already accomplished.
     4.2.3.5. IPs/supervisors who administer/observe EP ATDs satisfy their monthly SEPT
     requirement.
     4.2.3.6. Formal course student EP/ATDs can satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for
     the IP who administers the training.
  4.2.4. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/tactics
  academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required IAW
  the RTM or MAJCOM specific guidance. The program will require successful completion of
  an examination (85 percent minimum to pass). Use testing to validate qualification to the
  maximum extent possible throughout the training program. Aircrew successfully scoring 85
  percent or greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT, where authorized by the
  governing publication. Audiovisual/CBT programs may be used in place of academic
  instruction.
     4.2.4.1. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates, tactics personnel or
     experienced instructors, and will determine training requirements based on unit- and
     theater-specific mission requirements and unit Mission Essential Task Listing (METL).
     4.2.4.2. Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but not limited to:
         4.2.4.2.1. Air-to-surface weapons: description, operation, parameters, fusing,
         limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.
         4.2.4.2.2. Capabilities, characteristics, and TTPs of other CAF assets that the MQ-1

     4.2.5. Continuation Verification/SOPE.
        4.2.5.1. CT verification/SOPE updates aircrew on their squadron’s wartime mission.
        Each CMR aircrew will participate in a squadron initial or continuation training
        verification/SOPE IAW the RTM or MAJCOM specific guidance as a briefer, board
        member, or seminar participant. Note: to facilitate future upgrades to CMR, SQ/CCs
        should encourage BMC aircrew to accomplish an initial verification/VPE and/or
        participate in CT.
        4.2.5.2. ACC and AFRC aircrew who participate in a unit deployment in a tasked theater
        of operations may receive credit for CT verification (but not initial verification).
        Participating in remote split operations for a period of 14 days fulfills the unit
        deployment requirement. AFSOC: Participation in the planning and Verification Review
        Board (VRB) briefing of an operational, contingency, or exercise mission may be
        substituted for a SOPE. Unit commanders will determine which missions qualify to
        satisfy this requirement.
        4.2.5.3. SQ/CC may elect to count combat and combat support sorties as satisfying the
        CT verification/SOPE requirement.
        4.2.5.4. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3.
     4.2.6. Intelligence Training. The intelligence training program will be closely aligned with
     the unit weapons and tactics training program. The focus and extent of academic training
     will be determined by the Unit/CC and be aligned with projected wartime tasking, threats,
     and unit equipage. In addition to threat knowledge, aircrew training should include, but is
     not limited to:
        4.2.6.1. Visual Recognition (VR). Aircrew should be able to:
        4.2.6.1.1. Visually identify aircraft (rotary and fixed-wing, including joint/allied assets)
        they are likely to encounter by name or numerical designator and determine whether the
        aircraft is a threat or non-threat.
            4.2.6.1.2. Visually identify major combat ground vehicles and equipment, and
            determine friend or foe.
            4.2.6.1.3. Visually identify major categories of naval vessels.
        4.2.6.2. Collection and Reporting (C&R). C&R training will enable aircrew to initiate
        reports (In-Flight Report [INFLTREP], Communication Instructions Reporting Vital
        Intelligence Sighting [CIRVIS], etc.) and will familiarize them with the information
        requirements of the intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and Intelligence
        Report (INTREP).
        4.2.6.3. Current Intelligence will also cover significant military/political developments
        (including threat updates), in the squadron’s mission areas of interest. Use guidance
        contained in AFI 14-105, Unit Intelligence Mission and Responsibilities, and MAJCOM
        supplements, to develop and manage unit intelligence training programs. The Unit/CC
        will determine aircrew testing requirements for intelligence and Electronic Combat (EC)
        training.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  25


   4.2.7. Semi-Annual Take-off/Landing/Go-around Training (only required for L/R
   qualified crews).
       4.2.7.1. Semi-annually, L/R qualified crews will review proper takeoff/landing
       techniques and procedures. Discussion will include crosswind landings, go-arounds
       (planned, un-planned, IP directed, etc.), hard-landings, bounces and porpoise recovery.
       Training will include video review of mishap landings and normal landings that show
       good and bad techniques and procedures. If aircrew lose landing currency, they will
       receive this training prior to their landing re-currency sortie.
       4.2.7.2. Include hard landing training and nose-wheel first landing training in initial
       qualification, requalification, and IP upgrade syllabi and recurring training. Training
       should include approach procedures and techniques, GPS landing system (GLS) use,
       problems associated with limited visual cues, go-around decision making, height
       assessment techniques, improved head-up display (I-HUD) symbology, and procedures to
       recover from pilot induced oscillation and/or nose-wheel first landing. Training should
       include video from previous mishaps to show relationship between the lack of
       visual/somatic-sensory cues, and the result of continuing a bad approach/landing.
   4.2.8. Crew Resource Management (CRM). Units will participate in MAJCOM
   established CRM CT. Training builds upon the basic cockpit management skills taught in
   SUPT and FTUs. Each aircrew member is required to participate in one session every 24
   months (AFRC and ANG: Every other unit training cycle, not to exceed length of 2 x AEF
   cycle). Training will be tracked in ARMS. Failure to attend CRM training results in
   grounding (waiverable by OG/CC). Briefings and debriefings will include the core
   curriculum of CRM training IAW AFI 11-290 Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
   Program and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-290. The instructor CRM
   course may be used to satisfy the 24-month requirement.
   4.2.9. Enlisted Sensor Operator Career Progression Training. Enlisted Sensor Operators
   must maintain core competency knowledge, skills, and abilities in their enlisted career fields.
   Use assigned Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) or Air Force Job
   Qualification Standard (AFJQS) to develop and manage Sensor Operator skill-level and
   continuation training. Failure to maintain career field training progression does not affect
   CMR status.
4.3. Flying Training. All aircrew (except API-8 and ACC/IGS aircrew) will accomplish the
mission and event requirements listed in the most current RTM and MAJCOM specific guidance
as applicable to their crew position and qualifications. Failure to accomplish these requirements
will not affect BAQ, BMC or CMR status, but may require additional training as determined by
the SQ/CC. API-8 and ACC/IGS flyers will strive to accomplish as many of the requirements as
practical. In addition, the following are required:
   4.3.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ):

       4.3.4.4. Failure to accomplish the requirements will result in                    loss   of
       certification/qualification (see paragraph 4.7 for recurrency/requalification).
   4.3.5. Designated Training (TF-coded) and Designated Test (CB-coded) Unit
   Requirements:
       4.3.5.1. Aircrew assigned or attached to TF or CB-coded units will fly, as a minimum, at
       the BMC rate and accomplish the basic skills BMC requirements as shown in the RTM
       and MAJCOM specific guidance. Formal training syllabus-directed missions and
       approved test plan missions apply to BMC rate requirements for TF and CB-coded units
       respectively.
       4.3.5.2. For instructors, failure to complete a RAP requirement does not affect instructor
       status, but requires additional training as determined by the SQ/CC before resuming
       instructor duties in delinquent sortie types and/or event(s). Instructors will not instruct
       any event in which they are not current and qualified.
       4.3.5.3. Ground training as directed by the SQ/CC:
          4.3.5.3.1. There is no requirement for aircrew assigned or attached to TF-coded or
          CB-coded units to accomplish CBRNE ATD, CBRNE Flight, or verification.
          4.3.5.3.2. There is no requirement for CB-coded units to accomplish formal
          intelligence training or weapons and tactics academics. Aircrew will be thoroughly
          familiar with all current intelligence and weapons and tactics issues affecting on-
          going test projects.
       4.3.5.4. SQ/CC will direct the addition of sorties if programmed syllabus or test missions
       do not provide sufficient aircrew proficiency training.
       4.3.5.5. Instrument/Qualification/Mission or Instructor flight Evaluation, as applicable,
       IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and AFI 11-2MQ-1, Volume 2. Aircrew assigned/attached

4.4. Special Categories:
   4.4.1. Flight Surgeon. Flight surgeons may participate in continuation training missions as
   observers. Units will develop appropriate continuation training mission orientation programs
   for assigned flight surgeons.
   4.4.2. Above-Wing-Level Aircrew (ARC: Responsibilities for API-8 staff flyers are
   contained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG and AFRC):
       4.4.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for Above-Wing-Level personnel (other than
       that conducted in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the
       supporting unit. MAJCOM Division Chiefs are the reviewing authorities for assigned
       personnel. They will:
          4.4.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure maintenance of
          appropriate ARMS data and provide that data IAW AFI 11-401.
          4.4.2.1.2. Review assigned aircrew accomplishments and currencies prior to
          authorizing participation in MDT.

            4.4.2.1.3. Provide each aircrew with written documentation specifying the authorized
            mission types and events the aircrew may fly. Above-Wing-Level aircrew who fly
            with only one unit may receive this from their attached unit commander.
        4.4.2.2. Above-Wing-Level aircrew maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic
        ground training and special training programs within authorized mission areas. Specific
        currencies will be provided to the host squadron and squadron supervisors will determine
        aircrew qualifications to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT.
        4.4.2.3. Aircrew will:
            4.4.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
            4.4.2.3.2. Submit qualification and authorization documentation along with currency
            information to the supporting squadron supervisors prior to flying with that squadron.
            4.4.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that they do not
            exceed their ability and proficiency.
        4.4.2.4. With the concurrence of the OG/CC, instructor-qualified aircrew may perform
        instructor duties provided they have qualification and currency for the applicable
        missions and events.
     4.4.3. Active Duty aircrew flying with ANG and AFRC units:
        4.4.3.1. Wing/group air advisor rated personnel on duty with operational training units
        can maintain CMR and may be qualified as an IP and FE.
        4.4.3.2. Active duty aircrew other than assigned advisors are authorized to fly with ARC
        units IAW AFI 11-401 as supplemented by ANG and AFRC.
        4.4.3.3. Pilots on exchange programs from active duty units are authorized mission
        oriented sorties IAW specific operations plans (OPLAN) that establishes the exchange.
        SQ/CCs may authorize their participation IAW their specific experience and
        qualification.
        4.4.3.4. HHQ staff pilots may participate in tactical training events. Each pilot will
        present documentation summarizing medical status (e.g., AF Form 1042, Medical
        Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty), currencies, flight
        qualifications, etc., to the unit where flying is performed.
4.5. Multiple Qualifications:
     4.5.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3 with A2 coord) may authorize qualification in more
     than one MDS for aircrew when command mission requirements direct such action and dual
     qualification is economically justifiable. MAJCOMs cannot delegate this authority. Unless
     required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit aircrew qualified in
     primary mission aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft.
        4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to
        MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3 with A2 coord). All requests must contain full
        justification. Units will provide multiple qualification approval to the appropriate host
        base flight management office. Do not authorize flight accomplishments until aircraft
        assignment is updated in ARMS.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  29


      4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual
      remains assigned to the specific position and aircraft unless rescinded by MAJCOM/A3
      (ANG: NGB/A3).
      4.5.1.3. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with
      different types of aircraft. Wing commanders (WG/CCs) will qualify in only one of their
      wing's aircraft. Either the wing vice commander (WG/CV) or OG/CC should qualify in
      another of the wing's aircraft (not the one selected by the WG/CC).
   4.5.2. OG/CC will determine which currencies/events may be satisfied in either MDS and
   which currencies/events must be satisfied in both MDS.
      4.5.2.1. Aircrew qualified in multiple MDS will fly at least once each 45/30
      (EXP/INEXP) days in each aircraft. They will complete all other currency requirements
      for each aircraft.
      4.5.2.2. Aircrew members qualified in multiple aircraft will satisfy at least 50 percent of
      their sortie requirements in their primary aircraft. If CMR in more than one MDS, an
      equitable distribution (as determined by OG/CC) of sortie and event requirements will be
      logged.
      4.5.2.3. If dual qualified in L/R operations, aircrew will fly an equitable distribution (as
      determined by OG/CC) of emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations, and
      approaches in each MDS to fill their basic skills requirements.
   4.5.3. Aircrew must complete MDS conversion/qualification training IAW an approved
   syllabus.
4.6. Currency, Recurrency, and Requalification:
   4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.1, as supplemented by the most current RTM or MAJCOM
   specific guidance, defines currency requirements for MQ-1 aircrew. If an aircrew member
   loses a particular currency, the individual may not perform that sortie or event except for the
   purpose of regaining currency as noted.
   4.6.2. Recurrency. Aircrew require recurrency whenever they exceed a currency
   requirement in this volume.
      4.6.2.1. Aircrew must satisfy overdue training requirements before performing tasks
      applicable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training annotated as affecting
      CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until accomplishing appropriate training as
      specified by SQ/CC. Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require
      regression from CMR, although the deficiency may result in grounding until completing
      training. The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect
      on CMR status.
      4.6.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, the SQ/CC determines supervisory requirements
      pertaining to recurrency.
   4.6.3. Sortie Recurrency. Loss of sortie currency requires the following action (timing
   starts from last sortie):
      4.6.3.1. 31-90 (46-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain sortie currency. Supervision
      level is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie or event.

        plus qualification and tactical written exams, EPE, and qualification and/or mission flight
        evaluation (as required).
     4.6.4. Landing (L/R Operations) Recurrency/Requalification. The following actions are
     required to regain currency or qualification. Timing starts from last landing. (Note: aircrew
     may continue to fly missions not requiring aircraft landing or L/R operations).
        4.6.4.1. 31-90 Days (46-90 for Experienced). Regain landing currency. Supervision
        level is a qualified and current instructor pilot.
        4.6.4.2. 91 to 135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.6.4.1 above, plus instructor supervised
        ATD including normal, instrument, and emergency procedures.
        4.6.4.3. 136-210 Days. Same as above, plus L/R portion of written examinations and EP
        evaluation.
        4.6.4.4. More than 210 Days. Complete L/R IQT (see paragraphs 2.2.2 and 6.5.1). L/R
        qualification expires after 210 days (inexperienced) or 225 days (experienced) from last
        landing (unit CCs may place additional requirements upon L/R qualification).
     4.6.5. Loss of and Requalification to Instructor Status. Decertify instructors if:
        4.6.5.1. They fail a flight check. To regain instructor status, the instructor must
        successfully complete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and AFI 11-2MQ-
        1, Volume 2.
        4.6.5.2. They fail a qualification, instrument, or tactical examination. To regain
        instructor status, the instructor must successfully accomplish the written exam.
        4.6.5.3. Instructor currency expires. To regain status, see Table 4.1
        4.6.5.4. They become non-current in any event or sortie that causes removal from CMR
        or BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to
        require de-certification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor
        becomes non-current in events or sorties which do not require removal from CMR or
        BMC status, the individual may retain instructor status, but the instructor will not instruct
        in that event or sortie until regaining the required currency.

NOTES:
1. Only applicable to L/R qualified crews.
2. Aircrew may update currency or obtain recurrency in the ATD. Requires pilot and SO to
perform the event as a crew. Aircrew and instructors may update this currency or obtain
recurrency once in the ATD, then the next update must be an actual event.
3. Instructors may log this event for currency when they instruct it.
4. The supervision level for recurrency is a sq supervisor current and qualified in the event.
5. Supervision level for recurrency is an instructor, current and qualified in event.
6. Non-currency for 91-180 days requires a recurrency flight with an instructor.
7. Must be current in this event to fly unsupervised if mission requires launch, takeoff, and
landing procedures.
8. ANG and AFRC units: 90/120
9. Either Precision or Non-Precision approach satisfies this requirement.

4.7. Regression:
     4.7.1. CMR and BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback (N/A for AFSOC). Use
     only RAP training, pattern proficiency sorties, and contingency operations sorties for
     lookback as determined by MAJCOM-specific guidance (i.e., RAP sorties for ACC/ACC-
     gained units). For L/R-qualified pilots, a maximum of one PPS per month can be counted
     towards RAP look-back. If aircrew do not meet lookback requirements throughout the
     training cycle, SQ/CCs may regress them to N-CMR or N-BMC status, as applicable, remove
     them from a CMR manning position, or initiate action to remove them from active flying
     status.
        4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month MAJCOM-directed sortie lookback requires a review of
        the aircrew member’s 3-month sortie history. If the aircrew member meets the 3-month
        lookback, the aircrew member may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR or BMC, as
        applicable. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in regression to N-CMR or
        N-BMC status as appropriate, or the SQ/CC may place the aircrew member in probation
        status for 1 month. If the SQ/CC chooses probation, the only way to remove an aircrew
        member from probation and preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month
        lookback at the end of the probation period. (See Figure 4.1).
        4.7.1.2. CMR and BMC aircrew regressed to N-CMR or N-BMC for lookback must
        complete a SQ/CC-approved re-certification program to return the aircrew member to
        CMR or BMC standards. Upon completion of the re-certification program, the aircrew
        member also must meet the subsequent 1-month lookback requirement prior to
        reclaiming CMR or BMC status. Units may credit the sorties and events accomplished
        during the re-certification program toward the individual's total and type sortie and event
        requirements for the training cycle as well as for the monthly sortie requirement.
        4.7.1.3. Lookback computations begin following SQ/CC designation of the aircrew
        member to BMC or CMR. The aircrew member must maintain 1-month lookback until
        establishing a 3-month lookback. If a new CMR or BMC aircrew member fails to meet
        1-month lookback while establishing 3-month lookback, SQ/CCs may apply probation
        rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1 In addition, 1-month lookback starts the first full
        month of CMR or BMC status.
     4.7.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain MAJCOM-directed
     specific tasked weapons qualification at the end of the training cycle will require:
        4.7.2.1. For events tasked as QUAL at CMR/BMC, regression to N-CMR/N-BMC
        unless waived by OG/CC. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew member must re-
        accomplish initial qualification in the deficient weapons event (see paragraph 5.2).
        Events accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT
        event qualification required at the end of the training cycle.
        4.7.2.2. For events tasked as FAM at CMR/BMC, regression to N-CMR/N-BMC unless
        waived by OG/CC. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew member must accomplish at least
        three weapons deliveries reviewed by a squadron supervisor or instructor. Events
        accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumulative CT event
        qualification required at the end of the training cycle.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   33


   4.7.3. Unqualified Aircrew Evaluations. Handle aircrew who fail a qualification,
   instrument, or mission flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Aircrew will regress to
   N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These aircrew will remain N-CMR or N-BMC until
   successfully completing required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are re-certified by the
   SQ/CC.
   4.7.4. Failure to Maintain Flying Standards. If a qualified aircrew member demonstrates
   lack of proficiency or knowledge during CT (not related to a flight evaluation) the SQ/CC
   may elect to regress the individual to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These aircrew will
   remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by
   the SQ/CC, an evaluation if required, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
4.8. End of Cycle Requirements. Aircrew who fail to complete sortie or event requirements of
this volume by the end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the
type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9 for proration policy. In all cases
report training shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.2
   4.8.1. Aircrew who fail to meet the total MAJCOM-directed sortie requirement may
   continue CT at CMR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if
   these aircrew require additional training.
   4.8.2. Aircrew who fail to meet other CT sortie or event requirements may continue at CMR
   or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if these aircrew require
   additional training.
   4.8.3. Failure to meet RAP Sortie Requirements will result in the following:
       4.8.3.1. Regression to N-CMR or N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie type
       deficiency is significant. To regain CMR or BMC, the aircrew member will complete all
       deficient sortie types. Units may count these sorties against the total requirements for the
       new training cycle.
       4.8.3.2. Continuation at CMR or BMC if the aircrew member maintains total MAJCOM-
       directed sorties and lookback and the SQ/CC deems the sortie type deficiencies
       insignificant.
   4.8.4. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Qualifications will result in loss of
   that certification or qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.
   4.8.5. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will
   result in loss of that qualification unless otherwise specified in this publication or the
   MAJCOM-specific guidance. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.
4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC
may prorate all training requirements when duty not to include flying (DNIF), emergency leaves,
non-flying temporary duty (TDY), exercises, contingency operations, or direct combat support
preclude training for a portion of the training period (ARC: or mandatory training required by
civilian employment). Do not consider normal annual leave as non-availability. Units may
consider extended bad weather that precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive
days as non-availability. ANG and AFRC aircrew unable to fly during their monthly availability
period due to weather may prorate one month’s portion of total training cycle RAP sorties and
events. The following guidelines apply:
34                                                         AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


     4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
     availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
     4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying (to include post-
     deployment comp time) during the training cycle. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of
     months to be prorated based on cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
     4.9.3. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next
     lower whole number, but no requirement shall be prorated below one (except when 100
     percent of logged missions/sorties are contingency operations).
     4.9.4. Consider newly assigned or converted aircrew and aircrew achieving CMR or BMC
     status after the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month for
     proration purposes. Aircrew will complete prorated RAP sorties/events in CT.
     4.9.5. If IQT is re-accomplished, an aircrew member’s training cycle will start over at a
     prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT training.
     4.9.6. SQ/CCs may prorate an aircrew member's last month on station prior to departing
     permanent change of station (PCS) provided they do not exceed one month's proration. Units
     may consider individuals departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days from date
     of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station.
     4.9.7. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative
     impact on a unit’s CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A
     potential lack of training opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing
     it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station.
     The following proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the
     unit’s CT program.
        4.9.7.1. Normally, all sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as
        contingency operations sorties. These sorties do not count toward annual MAJCOM-
        specific requirements but may be used for lookback purposes. MAJCOM-specific events
        logged during contingency operations sorties do not count toward annual requirements
        but may be used to update currencies. Upon relief from contingency operations, units
        will prorate RAP sorties and events for the period of time each individual was tasked.
        Additionally, proration is authorized for deployment preparation and deployment
        recovery time where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM.
        4.9.7.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations varies
        considerably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provide valid training to be
        logged as MAJCOM-directed sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties may count
        toward MAJCOM-specific event requirements, and these sorties/events cannot be
        prorated upon return to home station.
        4.9.7.3. Upon return from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating
        the sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of
        valid sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie proration.
        Negative numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion based on
        the events accomplished during valid RAP sorties.

   4.9.8. Proration Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January
   and attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days.
   His SQ/CC authorized a total of two months proration from his training cycle (two months
   for the 73 cumulative days of non-availability for flying).
4.10. Regaining CMR and BMC Status:
   4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the End-of-Cycle weapons
   qualifications requirements or end-of-cycle MAJCOM specific event requirements,
   requalification is IAW paragraph 4.7
   4.10.2. If an aircrew member loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet sortie
   lookback IAW paragraph 4.7, the following applies (timing starts from the date the aircrew
   came off CMR or BMC status):
      4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The aircrew member must complete a SQ/CC directed re-
      certification program IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2 In addition, the aircrew member must
      regain event currencies. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to
      re-certification to CMR.
      4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as 4.10.2.1 above, plus OGV-administered qualification
      and tactical written examinations.
      4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT. Sorties, events, ATDs, and
      ground training as determined by the SQ/CC, plus qualification (and tactical if
      applicable) written exams, EPE, and mission flight evaluation. The individual's training
      cycle will start over at a prorated share following completion of the flight evaluation.
      The instrument and/or qualification flight evaluations must be re-accomplished only if
      overdue.
4.11. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification
Process. Captain Smith is an experienced CMR aircrew member with a 1- and 3-month
36                                                        AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


lookback requirement of 4 and 10 RAP sorties respectively. On February 3, Captain Smith flew
a counterland sortie prior to departing for a non-flying TDY staff tour for two months. Captain
Smith reported back for flight duty on 6 April. What is Captain Smith's status throughout the
TDY and on return to flying duty?
     4.11.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Captain Smith as a countable CMR aircrew member for
     reporting purposes throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 March, Captain Smith's Flight
     Commander (FLT/CC) performed the mandatory 1-month lookback (February). Captain
     Smith only flew one MAJCOM-specific sortie, failing the 1-month lookback. The FLT/CC
     then performed a 3-month lookback (Dec, Jan, and Feb). This 3-month lookback showed
     that Captain Smith flew only 7 sorties for the period. Had Captain Smith flown two more
     sorties, the SQ/CC could continue him at CMR. However, with 7 sorties, Captain Smith did
     not meet the 3-month lookback for a CMR aircrew member. The SQ/CC could regress
     Captain Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as
     CMR.
     4.11.2. The SQ/CC carried Captain Smith on one month's probation. On 1 April, Captain
     Smith's 1-month lookback (March) was zero sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Captain
     Smith to N-CMR. When Captain Smith returns on 6 April, the SQ/CC must place him in a
     re-certification program. Upon completing this program, Captain Smith must then re-
     establish a 1-month lookback by 1 May. Failing to re-establish a 1-month lookback by 1
     May forces the unit to report Captain Smith N-CMR one more month until the next lookback
     process on 1 June.
     4.11.3. If Captain Smith had returned on 22 March and had last landed 48 days ago, he could
     fly a RAP sortie with an instructor to regain sortie currency. For CMR purposes, Captain
     Smith must fly 4 RAP sorties to recapture a 1-month lookback and achieve removal from
     probation.
     4.11.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 June, the SQ/CC prorated two months of
     Captain Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Captain Smith was deficient in
     one RAP sortie category. The SQ/CC could regress Captain Smith to N-CMR, if deemed
     significant. After he accomplished the tailored re-certification program (the deficient
     sorties), the SQ/CC re-certified Captain Smith to CMR. This training counts for the new
     training cycle.

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial weapons qualification and
maintaining qualification in the employment of Air-to-Surface (A/S) weapons. Refer to
"Glossary of Events" in Attachment 2 for further guidance in weapons events.
5.2. Initial Weapons Qualification. Aircrew must accomplish initial weapons qualification in
any weapons event requiring qualification at CMR or BMC. Initial qualification achieved in
IQT/MQT satisfies requirements for CT qualification, but not for CT event requirements. If not
otherwise specified, initial qualification in a weapons event is satisfied when the aircrew member
has achieved a minimum of three hits out of six consecutive record deliveries.
5.3. CT Qualification/Maintaining Weapons Qualification. These criteria establish the
minimum standards for a pilot to maintain weapons qualification in the appropriate event and do
not necessarily determine evaluation criteria established by other regulations or agencies (e.g.,
inspection or evaluation teams). These qualifications are valid throughout the following training
period.
     5.3.1. CT weapons deliveries (to include simulated deliveries) will be tactical deliveries
     simulating realistic employment of weapons; considering such factors as arming, safe
     separation, recovery, safe escape maneuver, egress, etc., using USAF Technical Order (TO)
     1-1M-34, Aircrew Weapons Delivery Manual (Nonnuclear) as a reference. To maintain a
     combat perspective in a peacetime environment, weapons deliveries should simulate realistic
     employment of live munitions. Maximize the use of air-to-surface tactical range
     opportunities for weapons event requirements.
     5.3.2. Weapons qualification will be maintained by completing the minimum number of
     record hits, record deliveries, and also by achieving appropriate qualification percentage
     during the training period. Periodic qualification hit rate will be no less than 50 percent. See
     the specific MAJCOM guidance for specific qualification criteria.
     5.3.3. At the end of the training cycle, each aircrew member’s weapons delivery scores will
     be reviewed to assess the aircrew member’s qualification. If qualified, the aircrew member’s
     qualification is valid through the following training period.
5.4. Failure to Qualify. Failure to qualify in one weapon series does not invalidate
qualification in others. SQ/CCs may declare an aircrew member unqualified in any weapon, and
invalidate all previous record deliveries for that weapon, at any time during a training cycle
without affecting other weapons qualifications. If qualification is required at CMR, failure to
qualify will result in regression to N-CMR and entry into a re-certification program until re-
qualification is accomplished, unless waived by OG/CC.
5.5. Weapons Delivery. A weapons delivery event includes target acquisition, laser designation
(actual or simulated), missile launch (actual or simulated), and missile impact (real or simulated),
followed by a tactical escape maneuver for the ordnance being delivered (or simulated). Pattern
descriptions, procedures, training rules, and foul criteria are contained in AFTTP 3-1.Predator ,

5.6. Live Ordnance. Live ordnance training is essential to aircrew combat capability. Every
attempt should be made to give each crew the opportunity to employ as many types of weapons
as are approved for squadron use.

                                  SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. General. This chapter outlines pilot and sensor operator upgrade training programs for
special capabilities and qualifications. Units will develop and maintain local specialized training
programs based on these guidelines. SQ/CCs may tailor programs for individuals based on
previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. These capabilities and
qualifications are in addition to core missions for the unit and may not apply to every aircrew
member assigned or attached to the unit.
6.2. Instructor Pilot Upgrade Training (IPUG) and Instructor Sensor Operator Upgrade
Training (ISUG). These programs establish the minimum guidelines for those pilots and sensor
operators identified by the SQ/CC for IPUG and ISUG training. Upgrade candidates should be
selected based on a continued display of excellent airmanship and sound judgment and must
meet the criteria listed below. OG/CCs may waive hourly requirements, selected missions and
events based on previous experience of the upgrading pilot (UIP) or sensor operator (UIS). UIPs
and UISs designated for FTU instructor duties must complete the formal syllabus upgrade course
Predator Formal Training Unit Instructor Upgrade Training Course--(FIUT).
     6.2.1. Individuals selected for instructor upgrade must be experienced in the MQ-1.
     6.2.2. Academic Training. UIPs and UISs must satisfactorily complete the following
     blocks of instruction prior to certification. Additionally, AFSOC initial instructor upgrade
     candidates are required to complete the Flight Instructor Preparatory (FIP) (or equivalent)
     course prior to upgrade. Units will add considerations and techniques for specialized training
     to all applicable areas. At a minimum, ground training will consist of locally developed
     instruction in the following areas:
        6.2.2.1. Principles of Instruction: Learning objectives, instructor responsibilities,
        instructor-student relationship, training facilities, publications, and Predator specific
        training considerations.
        6.2.2.2. Techniques of Flight Instruction: Training objectives and environment,
        recognition and analysis of common operator errors, maneuver demonstration, task
        performance and review, and instructional limitations.
        6.2.2.3. Conduct of Flight Briefing: Use of briefing guides and audiovisual aids, briefing,
        debriefing, and questioning techniques, and use of recorded media for flight review.
        6.2.2.4. Systems Refresher Training: Subject knowledge evaluation and practical
        demonstration. Instructor candidates must demonstrate an advanced knowledge of GCS
        and aircraft systems and associated operational equipment to include: power-up, power-
        down, and reboot procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, expanded checklist
        procedures, pilot-sensor operator (PSO) rack displays, controls and procedures, internal
        and external communication procedures, aircraft operations and limitations, and airborne
        handover procedures.
        6.2.2.5. Student Evaluations: Grading systems, squadron specific procedures, and
        preparation and use of required forms.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  41


     6.2.2.6. Instructor CRM training will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-290, and MAJCOM
     supplements, prior to assuming duties as an instructor. Instructor CRM training may be
     accomplished prior to entering instructor upgrade training.
  6.2.3. Device Training.
     6.2.3.1. GCS Demonstration. UIPs/UISs must satisfactorily demonstrate and instruct
     GCS system power considerations, communication interfaces, Ku interfaces, scenario
     development, call-up procedures (if applicable), environmental control configurations,
     and ATD instructional procedures.
     6.2.3.2. Sensor operator workstation familiarization training. UIPs will accomplish a
     familiarization session of the SO station. This is usually accomplished with an IP or ISO
     instructing all aspects/responsibilities of the SO position.
  6.2.4. Flying Training. Specific training events do not have to be accomplished on
  specified sorties. However, all events must be accomplished within the construct of the
  upgrade program. Ku link and Handover (gaining/losing) procedures may be instructed on
  any sortie. Inability to complete specific training events need not delay certification. In such
  cases, SQ/CC will certify instructors with appropriate limitations to preclude performance of
  duties in which training is incomplete. Unit programs should specify which tasks the
  upgrade candidate will practice demonstrating, which tasks they will practice evaluating a
  performance, and which tasks they will do both.
     6.2.4.1. Basic Instruction Sortie. Practice instructing basic flight procedures. Specific
     Tasks: In-flight instruction, CRM and crew coordination, aircraft launch and recovery
     procedures, aircraft handling, patterns and landings, approaches (instrument and visual),
     SFOs (LOS and Ku), night nose camera low approaches, in-flight checks and checklist
     procedures, navigation procedures, mission briefing and debriefing, operational mission
     and emergency mission management, right seat procedures, weather and aircraft checks.
     Note: Elements of this sortie may be included in the other sorties if upgrade is not going
     to be LRE instructor qualified.
     6.2.4.2. RSTA Sortie. Practice instructing a basic Intelligence, Surveillance and
     Reconnaissance (ISR) mission in support of tactical objectives. Specific tasks: in-flight
     instruction, CRM and crew coordination, in-flight checks and checklist procedures,
     sensor (EO and IR) capabilities and limitations, target acquisition procedures, sensor
     cross-cueing, time management (mission and target prosecution), threat avoidance,
     navigation procedures, mission briefing and debriefing, operational and emergency
     mission planning and airspace management.
     6.2.4.3. SAT/Counterland Sortie. Practice instructing a low- to medium-threat tactics
     mission, and/or strike profile in support of tactical objectives. Specific tasks: In-flight

            target ID, weapons preparation, and post-strike/BDA procedures. Include provisions
            for CAS with FAC (A) and/or JTAC.
        6.2.4.4. Flight Evaluation. Complete an instructor flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-2MQ-
        1, Volume 2, MAJCOM, and unit requirements.
6.3. Contingency and Exercise Pre-Deployment Training. Conduct this training prior to
deploying in support of contingency operations locations or combat exercises. The objective of
this training is to ensure the aircrew member’s ability to conduct all missions in support of
expected tasking.
     6.3.1. Exercises. For exercises, units are responsible for referring to appropriate exercise
     plans (EXPLAN) and contacting appropriate exercise points of contact to determine expected
     mission tasking (COMACC EXPLANs include EXPLAN 80 for Red and Maple Flags,
     EXPLAN 323 for Green Flag West, and EXPLAN 163 for Green Flag East).
     6.3.2. Contingency Operations. For contingency operations, units are responsible for
     contacting appropriate gaining command or organizations to determine expected mission
     tasking. Prior coordination ensures unit preparation for the appropriate tasking and allows the
     responding OG/CC to tailor spin-up training for the theater, threat, and tactics for the
     assigned task. The SQ/CC is responsible for implementing spin-up training, prosecuting the
     required missions, and determining the specific requirements necessary to reach the desired
     level of proficiency. Units will place emphasis on training needed for missions not
     accomplished in daily operations. Conduct spin-up training IAW all applicable instructions.
     When tasked to deploy into a CBRNE HTA or MTA IAW AFI 10-2501, aircrew must have
     completed applicable CBRNE defense training courses, ATD mission, and other required
     pre-deployment requirements IAW applicable directives.
     6.3.3. Attached and Supporting Aircrew. Aircrew not assigned to the supported squadron
     must receive spin-up training as determined by the supported SQ/CC. This requirement
     applies to all attached aircrew (OG, WG, HQ staffs, etc.) and all aircrew supporting from any
     other squadron (operational, test or FTU). The objective of this spin-up training is to ensure
     attached and supporting aircrew are proficient to conduct all expected missions. The
     supported SQ/CC determines the amount of spin-up training required for each attached and
     supporting aircrew based on the individual's level of proficiency, currency, qualification,
     experience, etc. The supported and supporting squadron commanders (or equivalent) will
     jointly agree on the administration, documentation, and evaluation of required spin-up
     training.
     6.3.4. Ground Training. Aircrew may be required to complete academic training prior to
     contingency operations or exercises. Units will brief contingency (or exercise) Special
     Instructions (SPINS), ROE, and Command and Control (C2) procedures. Programs will
     emphasize deployment airfield capabilities, limitations, approach procedures, and hazards. In
     addition, air defenses, area terrain and weather and unique operating procedures will be
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  43


   addressed. The local Weather Flight can assist with weather-unique training. Local
   intelligence organizations may assist the unit's intelligence functions in the development of
   threat assessments, training materials, and expected collection tasking.
   6.3.5. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting aircrew are
   proficient, current, and qualified in expected mission tasking.
   6.3.6. Responsibility. OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating aircrew are
   ready to deploy and are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.
6.4. Difference Training.
   6.4.1. Difference training (DT) for initial cadre is usually conducted under the supervision of
   the engineering specialists (usually coordinated through program office officials) responsible
   for improving the MQ-1 system (e.g. new engines, baseline upgrades, major software
   changes, etc.). These personnel usually will provide training for an initial cadre whenever
   possible. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre of
   personnel for whom certain training requirements will be waived. Instructors completing DT
   will provide upgrade training to other unit aircrew. 703d Aeronautical Systems Group
   (AESG), Detachment 3 will be considered the primary unit for DT when new systems come
   online which represent major changes from current configurations; 53 TEG/556 TES is the
   alternate unit.
   6.4.2. The following conditions apply to management of initial cadre qualification:
       6.4.2.1. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to
       begin aircrew upgrades. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than
       currently held unless previously qualified. The host unit providing training will
       document all DT and maintain the training folder until successful completion of the
       upgrade program. Initial cadre aircrew are responsible for completing recommended
       training on any equipment, systems, or crew procedures which differ from that in the
       MDS they are currently qualified.
       6.4.2.2. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will determine which training events are applicable
       after examining the training and evaluation records of initial cadre and determine if a
       certification is applicable or whether a qualification evaluation (check ride) is required.
       OG/CC may require aircrew to complete a written examination prior to unsupervised
       flight when emergency procedures have changed; even if an AF Form 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, flight evaluation is not required. Forward a copy of proposed
       training qualification plan to MAJCOM OPR when training requires a flight evaluation.
6.5. Launch and Recovery (L/R) Training. Normally, L/R training is conducted at the FTU
through formal course syllabus; however, special circumstances and availability of class slots
may necessitate local or in-house upgrades. The goal of this training is to produce aircrew
proficient in Predator launch, takeoff, pattern, handoff, transition, landing, and recovery
operations. Because L/R training is considered a formal IQT program, also refer to Chapter 2
for local upgrade guidelines.
   6.5.1. Upgrade to L/R operations will be at the discretion of the SQ/CC based on standard
   squadron operations, taskings, and manning. Crews qualified in L/R operations will be
   qualified IAW AFI 11-2MQ-1 Volume 2 and certified by the SQ/CC (i.e., LoX).
44                                                        AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


     6.5.2. For individuals never qualified in L/R operations, upgrade training will meet the
     course prerequisites and follow the course flow in the formal course syllabus (MQ-1B
     Launch/Recovery Training Course MQ1LR).
     6.5.3. For individuals previously qualified in L/R operations, an abbreviated SQ/CC-
     approved course may be administered. Formal IQT is not required for aircrew who have
     been L/R qualified within the last three years.
     6.5.4. For aircrew whose qualification has expired refer to paragraph 4.6.4
     6.5.5. If qualification has not expired and only a re-currency sortie is required, follow
     guidance in Table 4.1 and paragraph 4.6.4
     6.5.6. Local Upgrade Program for Previously L/R Qualified Individual.
        6.5.6.1. Academics: Upgrade candidates must satisfactorily complete the following
        instruction prior to certification. At a minimum ground training will consist of
        instruction in the following areas:

            (GDT) and Air Data Terminal (ADT) interface, payload and frequency control
            interface, antennae procedures, GDT LOS tracking modes, aircraft lost link logic and
            procedures and data link malfunctions.
            6.5.6.1.4. Aircraft Systems Refresher Training: Subject knowledge evaluation and
            practical demonstration. Instruction will include refresher on power-plant, electrical
            system, landing gear, flight data systems components, emergency procedures, and
            Ops limits.
            6.5.6.1.5. GCS displays, menus, HUD, heads-down display, and GPS Landing
            System (GLS).
        6.5.6.2. Device Training: Through repetitive practice of checklist procedures, a
        building block approach is used in an ATD to introduce in-flight procedures. The
        following area of instruction will be included in device training portion of the program.
            6.5.6.2.1. Rack configuration through shutdown checklists, menu selection, pedestal
            control operation and display manipulation.
            6.5.6.2.2. Takeoffs, departure, arrivals, and approaches and all applicable checklists.

Terms and Definitions
Air Combat Training (ACBT)—A general term which includes (D)BFM, (D)ACM, and
(D)ACT. The prefix (D) refers to the type of adversary assets. When the prefix is present,
dissimilar is optional. When the prefix is missing, similar is assumed as flown/required. When
present without parenthesis, dissimilar is assumed flown or required. This convention
corresponds to all facets of ACBT (i.e., BFM, ACM, ACT).
Air Combat Tactics (ACT)—Training in the application of BFM, ACM, and tactical intercept
skills to achieve a tactical air-to-air objective. (AFI 11-214).
Air Reserve Component (ARC)—ANG and AFRC units and aircrew members, both associate
and unit-equipped.
Attrition Sortie—A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Basic Skills sortie, or
collateral sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, in flight emergency (IFE),
maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these
sorties properly. Improper accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation,
stresses to the unit schedule, and negative impacts to the quality of unit training programs.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training (MQT, FTU IPUG/ISUG) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the
basic unit operational missions but does not maintain CMR status. Aircrew members accomplish
training required to remain familiarized in all, and may be qualified and proficient in some, of
the primary missions of their weapon system and unit. BMC aircrew members may also maintain
special capabilities.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training prescribed to maintain the basic skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The
member must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and
flight standards set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by aircrew until
completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above the
wing level, and any other aircrew members specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3. Aircrew
are not authorized to perform RAP-tasked combat event/sorties without instructor pilot or SQ
supervisor supervision. Flight duties will be limited to those identified in paragraph 4.3.1
Certification—The process of certifying pilots’ tactical employment and special weapons
capabilities, procedures, and rules. Replaces verification for nuclear tasked units.
Circular Error—Miss distance of a given weapon impact expressed in radial distance from
center of target.
Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT)—A training device in which the controls, switches,
and instruments do not have to respond to trainee inputs. Used for checklist use, normal
procedures, and emergency procedures (see Air Force Handbook (AFH) 36-2235, Volume 7,
Information for Designers of Instructional Systems, Design Guide for Device-based Aircrew
Training).
Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT)—A training device in which instruments and displays are
activated to respond to trainee inputs. Used for safety of flight, instrument, normal, and
emergency procedures (see AFH 36-2235V7).
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   57


Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational
missions, and maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API-
1/2’s, Squadron Commander, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API-6 manning
positions are required to maintain this qualification level. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-
manned, they may elect to train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated
as BMC.
Composite Force Training (CFTR)—Scenarios employing multiple flights of the same or
different types of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, performing the same
or different roles. (AFI 11-214).
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew
capabilities to perform unit missions and pattern proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus
missions, tests, or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC pilots.
Conversion Training—Training required when units (or individual aircrew) are converting
between MDS (i.e. MQ-1 to MQ-9). Conversion training is normally done through formal
training courses; however MAJCOMs may develop in-unit training when formal school courses
are not available. In-unit training plans should maximize the use of highly experienced personnel
as the initial cadre.
Currency—Minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely.
Delivery Parameters—Data reflecting current delivery considerations for general purpose
ordnance as well as tactical survivability. Appropriate aircraft/ weapons Tech Orders must be
consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and -1 performance charts for recovery altitudes.
Difference Training—Training required when new systems/hardware come online which
represent significant changes from current configurations. Initial cadre instructors completing
difference training may provide training to other unit aircrew members at home station.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation—An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and responsiveness
to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by a FE in an ATD, or the GCS. An EPE may be
administered orally if an appropriate training device is not available.
Experienced Aircrew (EXP)—500 hours MQ-1 or 250 hours MQ-1 and previously experienced
in another MDS or 150 hours MQ-1 and previously experienced in MQ-9.
Familiarization (FAM)—Normally requires a minimum of six weapons deliveries for PGMs
and bombing events in a twelve month cycle.
Flight Lead (FL)—As designated on flight orders, the individual responsible for overall conduct
of mission from preflight preparation/briefing to postflight debriefing, regardless of actual
position within the formation. A certified 4-ship FL may lead formations and missions in excess
of four aircraft, unless restricted by the unit CC. A 2-ship FL is authorized to lead an element in
a larger formation.
Full Scale Weapons Delivery (FSWD)—Delivery of live or inert ordnance representing a
typical combat configuration or SCL in a tactical scenario.

Launch and Recovery Element (LRE)—Deployed personnel based at a forward location who
are responsible for the launch, recovery and ground support of the MQ-1. Launch and recovery is
accomplished using a standard deployable GCS, or a modified GCS equipped with the
functionality of two PSO racks and associated systems, a communications interface and a GDT.
LITENING II/ER—Second generation targeting pod with unique built in capabilities such as
laser marker, charge couple device (day use camera), laser spot search and track mode and lase
ability above 25,000’.
Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN)—A navigation and
targeting system that provides tactical aircraft with a low-altitude, under-the-weather, day and
night operational capability.
Mission Control Element (MCE)—A GCS (usually geographically separated from LRE)
responsible for taking an MQ-1 from an LRE following takeoff, executing the mission, and then
handing the MQ-1 back to the LRE for recovery and landing.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR or BMC
status.
Predator Mission Aircrew Training System (PMATS)—The PMATS is a replica of the
Ground Control Station (GCS) and provides training for pilots and sensor operators. PMATS
trainers are capable of local area networked operations and are programmed for Distributed
Mission Operations certification. The PMATS provides mission, normal, and emergency
procedures training capability. Note: an alternate software program can reconfigure the PMATS
to replicate the MQ-9 Reaper GCS.
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational
mission. The PAI forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include manpower,
support equipment, and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the PAI required
to meet their assigned missions (See AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting and Termination).
Proficiency—Demonstrated ability to successfully accomplish tasked event safely and
effectively. For purposes of this volume, proficiency also requires currency in the event, if
applicable.

                                           Attachment 2
              GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Sortie and Mission Definitions:
     A2.1.1. Sortie: The operational nature of MQ-1 requires clarification of the term sortie
     within the scope of this AFI. An MQ-1 flight is defined as initial takeoff until the full stop
     landing. A sortie, for documenting events accomplished, is the portion of the flight in which
     an individual aircrew member is performing his or her assigned duties. For the purposes of
     this instruction the terms mission and sortie are synonymous.
     A2.1.2. RAP Sortie. RAP training sorties are oriented to developing basic combat skills or
     practicing tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission. If
     training is accomplished, a RAP sortie may be logged. Due to the nature of MQ-1 L/R
     operations, pattern proficiency sorties (PPS) may be considered a RAP sortie. The PPS may
     also be included in sortie lookback.
     A2.1.3. Basic Skills Sortie. A sortie where combat skills training is not accomplished.
     Unless specifically tasked, there is no requirement to log Basic Skills sorties.
     A2.1.4. Logging Sorties. Normally, aircrew members will not log more than one type of
     sortie on a single flight, unless:
        A2.1.4.1. Specifically allowed in the sortie description (i.e. instructor sortie).
        A2.1.4.2. An aircrew member is relieved by another aircrew member for the purpose of
        accomplishing a sortie and then subsequently takes over the position again during the
        same flight.
A2.2. Specific Sortie definitions:
     A2.2.1. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) [ME49] – Basic flying skills sortie.
     Training for proficiency in utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope,
     consistent with operational and safety constraints.
     A2.2.2. Air Strike Control (ASC) Sortie [RC22] – Sortie designed to develop proficiency in
     airborne forward air control of armed attack aircraft in support of actual or simulated ground
     forces. Mission elements include:
        A2.2.2.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning.
        A2.2.2.2. Actual or simulated interface with Theater Air-Ground System (TAGS).
        A2.2.2.3. Target acquisition, identification and marking.
        A2.2.2.4. Positive control of ground attack fighters employing simulated or actual
        ordinance against designated targets.
        A2.2.2.5. FAC-to-fighter brief.
        A2.2.2.6. Integration of ground and heliborne fire support elements (if available).
        A2.2.2.7. Identification and neutralization of enemy air defenses.
        A2.2.2.8. Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and INFLTREP.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                  61


  A2.2.3. Attrition Sortie [SC14] – A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie,
  Basic Skills sortie, or collateral sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE,
  maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log
  these sorties properly. Improper accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie
  allocation, stresses to the unit schedule, and negative impacts to the quality of unit training
  programs.
  A2.2.4. Basic Surface Attack [SR26] – Building block sortie. Training designed to achieve
  proficiency in day [BSA-(Day)] or night [BSA-(NT)] air-to-surface weapons delivery events.
  A2.2.5. Close Air Support (CAS) Sortie [SR27] – Counterland mission sortie flown in
  support of ground forces under the control of a FAC (A) or JTAC. Mission elements include:
     A2.2.5.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning.
     A2.2.5.2. Mission execution against actual or simulated threats.
     A2.2.5.3. Simulated or actual weapons delivery under positive control of JTAC or
     Forward Air Controller (Airborne) [FAC(A)].
     A2.2.5.4. BDA and INFLTREP.
  A2.2.6. Collateral Sorties [SC00]– These sorties do not directly relate to combat
  employment or basic skills training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit
  operations. Functional check flights and air shows are in this category. These sorties are not
  required for RAP training purposes.
  A2.2.7. Commander Option Sortie [SR99] – A sortie that may be used to provide
  individualized training based on proficiency and demonstrated performance. This sortie may
  be allocated above the guidelines in the RAP tasking message for all mission types. The
  intent is to use these missions as necessary throughout the training cycle, rather than
  allocating them at the beginning of the training cycle.
  A2.2.8. Contingency Operations Sortie [SC13] – Sorties at a contingency location, or in
  support of real-world operations, which provide limited or no RAP training and do not count
  toward training cycle RAP requirements. Units may use Contingency Operations sorties for
  lookback purposes. RAP events accomplished during sorties logged as Contingency
  Operations do not count toward training cycle RAP requirements; however individual events
  can be used to update currencies.
  A2.2.9. Forward Air Controller-Airborne (FAC-A) Sortie [SR07] – Sortie flown to provide
  airborne forward air control of strike aircraft in support of actual or simulated ground forces.
  Mission elements include:
     A2.2.9.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning.
     A2.2.9.2. Actual or simulated interface with TAGS C2 network.
     A2.2.9.3. Target acquisition, identification and marking.
     A2.2.9.4. Positive control of ground attack fighters employing simulated or actual

A2.3. Events. An event is defined as a specific type of target acquisition or weapons
employment performed during a sortie or the accomplishment of a specific training element,
function, or task (i.e., buddy lasing, handover procedures, SAT, etc.). Unless otherwise specified
in the event descriptions, units will determine the necessary parameters for fulfilling and logging
tasked events. Accomplishing a specific training event is independent of the type of sortie
logged. In the absence of guidance, units determine the frequency and number of events.
   A2.3.1. Weapons Event Definitions. The following is a listing of event definitions for use
   in fulfilling tasked requirements. Not all events may be applicable to MQ-1 operations.
       A2.3.1.1. Weapons Delivery [WE22]. A delivery event is defined as a pass at a target on
       which ordnance is expended or simulated and meets the criteria defining a specific
       weapon delivery. These delivery events will be used to update weapons qualifications
       and currencies. Weapon events are defined in Chapter 5. All deliveries will be recorded,
       but not necessarily as a "record" delivery.
64                                                         AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010


        A2.3.1.2. Categories. A delivery constitutes a weapons delivery event based on two
        categories: by record keeping (Record or Non-Record), and by RAP tasking (FAM and
        QUAL):
           A2.3.1.2.1. Non-Record. Basic or Tactical weapons delivery accomplishments not
           credited toward weapons qualification provided the aircrew declares non-record prior
           to beginning event.
           A2.3.1.2.2. Record. Conventional or nuclear delivery scored for individual weapons
           qualification. Scoring shall be accomplished by ground, air or AVTR scoring, as
           appropriate. A maximum of two record deliveries may be accomplished during a
           sortie from a single run-in heading. Additional record deliveries may be accomplished
           from headings differing by at least 90 degrees or on different targets/ranges and may
           not be preceded by non-record deliveries in the event on the same sortie. The first two
           deliveries will be considered record unless otherwise declared prior to the roll-in to
           final. Scores will be documented by CEP and clock position. Additional guidelines
           are:
           A2.3.1.2.3. FAM. Weapons events tasked at FAM may be basic/tactical record
           deliveries. Each single pass counts as one delivery. Unless otherwise specified in the
           RAP tasking message or formal course syllabi, FAM tasking requires six weapons
           deliveries annually.
           A2.3.1.2.4. QUAL. Weapons tasked at QUAL must be tactical, record deliveries.
           QUAL tasking demonstrates the aircrew's capability to put appropriate ordnance on
           target. Unless otherwise specified in the RAP tasking message or formal course
           syllabi, QUAL criteria is established for each event in Chapter 5.
     A2.3.2. Miscellaneous Weapons Delivery Definitions and Descriptions:
        A2.3.2.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended. Such
        dry passes prior to completion of record deliveries in an event are charged to the aircrew
        as gross error unless pass was dry because of safety interests, system malfunctions, basic
        delivery requirements, or directed for flight integrity purposes.
        A2.3.2.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent
        with established procedures or safety considerations. A foul will result in a gross error for
        that delivery. Verbal warnings will not be substituted for fouls. A second foul or any
        dangerous pass will result in mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during that
        mission and a gross error score for the event. A foul will be charged IAW flying directive
        publications.
        A2.3.2.3. Full Scale Weapons Delivery. Delivery of live or inert ordnance in a combat
        configuration. Also known as live-fire.
        A2.3.2.4. Gross Error. A penalty score or miss assigned to an aircrew's records when a
        weapons delivery attempt results in: munitions impact outside the range scoring
        capability; a chargeable dry pass; a foul; an unintentional release, or exceeding tactical
        delivery time on final requirements.
        A2.3.2.5. Hit. Any munitions impact within the weapons criteria established for that
        event.
AFI11-2MQ-1V1 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   65


     A2.3.2.6. Multiple Release. More than one weapon released against the same target on a
     single pass.
         A2.3.2.6.1. Intentional. The aircrew must advise the range officer prior to delivery
         and designate which impact to be scored.
         A2.3.2.6.2. Inadvertent. Ordnance which has released without command by the
         aircrew. Impact will not be scored.
         A2.3.2.6.3. System Malfunction. An undeclared multiple release caused by a verified
         system malfunction. Score is void after system malfunction verification, otherwise,
         unintentional rules apply.
         A2.3.2.6.4. Unintentional. Ordnance released due to aircrew error. Will be scored as
         gross error regardless of impact point.
     A2.3.2.7. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No score
     or error will be assigned.
     A2.3.2.8. Void Delivery. Weapons delivery not successfully completed due to: a
     documented and verified weapons system malfunction; a pass aborted for safety; no spot;
     or circumstances beyond the control of the aircrew.
  A2.3.3. Tactical Events. The following is an alphabetical listing of events to be used for
  fulfilling tasked requirements. In the absence of guidance, units will determine the content of
  tasked events and how often they may be logged. Alphanumerics in brackets identify the
  ARMS code associated with the event.
