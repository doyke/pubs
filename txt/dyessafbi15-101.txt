                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction, along with the Dyess Installation Data Sheet (IDS) between the
7th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (7 OSS/OSW) and the 26th Operational
Weather Squadron (26 OWS) establishes roles and responsibilities for providing collaborative
weather support to the 7th Bomb Wing (7 BW), 317th Airlift Group (317 AG), and all other
tenant organizations and agencies at Dyess Air Force Base. It consolidates weather support
requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and eliminates the need for written
agreements between the weather unit and supported operations.
1.2. 7 OSS/OSW Normal Hours of Duty and Key Contact Information. Mission weather
forecasting and airfield services are provided IAW this instruction 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year, with the exception of federal holidays and when the Dyess tower and aerodrome are closed.
There is usually only one official forecaster on duty who performs both mission weather and
airfield services duties. Dyess weather personnel can be reached at the following numbers:
Mission Weather/Airfield Services Forecaster, DSN 461-2524/4857; NCOIC, DSN 461-2501;
Flight Commander, DSN 461-4364; Wing Weather Officer, DSN 461-3211. The Dyess
Consolidated Command post at DSN 461-1921 can recall a weather forecaster during non-duty
hours. The commercial number at Dyess is (325) 696-xxxx. To call commercial to Dyess, dial
(325) 696-xxxx, where the x’s are the last four digits of the DSN number. Normal duty hours for
staff weather support services are 0730L to 1630L Monday through Friday, with the exception of
federal holidays. The 7 OSS/OSW is located in Building 9001, 674 Alert Avenue.
1.3. Duty Priorities. The 7 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS establish duty priorities to ensure task
accomplishment in order of relative importance. The forecaster may only deviate from the
priority list in the best interest of flight safety and protection of life and property. All personnel
use the concept of Operational Risk Management (ORM) when using the duty priorities.

1.4. Observing Limitations.
   1.4.1. There are no known or documented limitations to the AN/FMQ-19 sensors on the
   airfield.
   1.4.2. When backing up or supplementing the AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological
   Observing System (AMOS), the alternate observation point is on the airfield side of Building
   9001, on the red marked (DV) pavement. The view from this location is restricted from the
   E to the SE by buildings.
   1.4.3. The forecaster may not detect weather changes as they occur due to other duties
   performed inside the building away from the outdoor elements. A cooperative weather watch
   with Dyess tower Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel IAW Chapter 3 reduces the impact of
   this limitation.
1.5. Alternate Operating Location (AOL) Limitations.
   1.5.1. Weather services from the alternate operating location are limited. During
   evacuations, personnel safety and ORM take priority over all other duties. Surface
   observations are not available during the initial execution of an evacuation. Since tactical
   equipment is used to compute pressure, both station pressure and altimeter setting are
   estimated from the alternate location. Mission weather services resume after the forecaster
   has relocated to the alternate facility and has transmitted the first observation.

     1.5.2. Visibility is determined from the observation point along the flightline directly
     adjacent from the Dyess tower.. Due to limited backup resources, product and service delays
     may be experienced during peak production times.
1.6. Backup Support to the 26 OWS. The Dyess 7 OSS/OSW will assume flight weather
briefing support, local Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) and weather watch, warning and
advisory responsibility during significant OWS communication outages, Continuity of
Operations Exercises (COOP), evacuations or catastrophic events.
1.7. Release of Weather Information. Refer any requests for weather information by non-
Department of Defense (DoD) agencies to the 7 BW Public Affairs (7 BW/PA), who then
determines if providing the information is in the best interest of the installation.
1.8. Primary Product Dissemination. JET is the primary dissemination system for TAFs,
surface observations, Watches/Warnings and advisories. The MWP is posted on the Weather
Webpage (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AC-OP-02-90/default.aspx).
1.9. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). PMSV is available by contacting “Dyess Metro” at
frequency 383.25 Megahertz, or through a global phone patch to DSN 461-2524. The 7
OSS/OSW monitors PMSV and relays any observation/forecast or update weather briefings upon
request. The operating range of the PMSV is restricted to line-of-sight resulting in a maximum
operational range of approximately 200 NM. No backup PMSV capability currently exists,
however Sheppard AFB will provide alternate PMSV service at 339.65. All weather stations
within a 200 NM radius of Dyess operate on frequency 344.6. When the PMSV is inoperative
the 7 OSS/OSW immediately notifies Base Operations, and in turn, a NOTAM is issued to
reflect the outage.
1.10. Backup Product Dissemination and Data Retrieval.
     1.10.1. The 7 OSS/OSW forwards local weather observations and PIREPS first to the Dyess
     tower using the hotline/phone, then to the 26 OWS. These calls are tracked on an AF Form
     9, Local Dissemination Log.
     1.10.2. The AFW-WEBS internet site is the primary method for long line dissemination of
     weather observations and PIREPS.
     1.10.3. The 7 OSS/OSW disseminates weather watches/warnings and advisories via
     telephone to the Dyess tower, Dyess command post, airfield ops, the SOF and NAOC (if
     applicable).
     1.10.4. The 7 OSS/OSW disseminates the MWP via fax or email to all flying squadrons and
     the Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
     1.10.5. When the 26 OWS web site is inoperative, the 7 OSS/OSW uses alternative data
     sources in preparing the MWP and conducting METWATCH/MISSIONWATCH. Links to
     alternate sources are on the weather intranet webpage. When internet capability does not
     exist, the 7 OSS/OSW contacts the 26 OWS and has them fax data as needed IAW the Dyess
     IDS.
1.11. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). The AOL is located in the Dyess tower on 1017
Herk Drive (Building 4300). The forecaster will operate out of the 4th floor, DSN 461-5302, and
any additional 7 OSS/OSW personnel will relocate to the 4th floor to support mission weather
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                   9


services. NOTE: If Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) is evacuating, the Duty
forecaster will ride with them to the AOL.
   1.11.1. The forecaster notifies the following agencies of evacuation to the AOL:
      1.11.1.1. Dyess tower/SOF, 696-1400/4684 or in person after evacuation.
      1.11.1.2. Dyess consolidated command post, 696-1921/1984.
      1.11.1.3. Airfield Management, 696-2515 or in person before evacuation.
      1.11.1.4. Bomber/airlift squadrons during wing flying days: 9BS at 696-7453; 28BS at
      696-2828; 337 TES/77 WS at 696-8000; 39AS at 696-4045; 40AS at 696-4004, and
      NAOC (if applicable) at 696-2105/2106.
      1.11.1.5. The 26 OWS to coordinate mission essential backup support – DSN 331-2618.
      1.11.1.6. Flight CC/ NCOIC.
   1.11.2. Alternate Operating Location (AOL): The forecaster takes supplemented/backup
   observations from the AOL. The observation point is on the flightline directly adjacent to the
   Dyess tower. Elevation is 1775 Feet above MSL.
   1.11.3. The forecaster continues to perform normal duties according to the Duty Priorities
   List (Table 1.1) and Shift Checklists (i.e. MWP, MISSIONWATCH, METWATCH, Eyes
   Forward, etc.).
   1.11.4. Primary and alternate dissemination methods are used. The 7 OSS/OSW personnel
   will transmit the observation within 15 minutes, if network capability is functioning via JET.
   If the JET system is not functioning, personnel will upload the observation into AFW-
   WEBS. If network capability is not functioning, personnel will call 26 OWS, or another
   weather station and logged in Column 13 of AF Form 3803, Surface Weather Observations
   (METAR/SPECI). Other bases personnel can call KGRK at DSN 738-9620; KRCA at DSN
   675-1042; KSPS at DSN 736-2730, or KDMA at DSN 228-3536. Local dissemination will
   be log on an AF Form 9.
   1.11.5. The 7 OSS/OSW conducts AOL evacuation training on a quarterly basis in
   conjunction with their monthly continuation training.

                                           Chapter 2

                             MISSION WEATHER ELEMENT

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. The forecaster prepares, issues, and briefs the Dyess MWP and provides
   MISSIONWATCH for all flights.
   2.1.2. The 7 OSS/OSW provides or arranges weather support for all transient aircrew IAW
   duty priorities.
   2.1.3. Dyess Weather Availability. Dyess Weather (7 OSS/OSW) will have personnel on
   duty when their supported unit is performing their primary operation, duty, or mission and/or
   when Dyess tower is open and no automated observing system capability exists.
       2.1.3.1. The 7 OSS/OSW is not required to be on duty when Dyess tower is closed,
       unless SWAP has been implemented and it is necessary to provide the eyes forward
       function, or to supplement for tornadic activity IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather
       Observations. The 26 OWS will provide flight weather briefing (FWB) support to flights
       conducted outside normal organization operations when Dyess tower is closed and 7
       OSS/OSW personnel are unavailable.
       2.1.3.2. The 7 OSS/OSW will enter a FWB request via the 26 OWS web page when the
       supported unit provides advance notification of intent to conduct operations, and the 7
       OSS/OSW personnel are unable to provide MWPs.
       2.1.3.3. The 7 OSS/OSW will coordinate requests for briefing support with the 26 OWS
       on larger flying operations when 7 OSS/OSW cannot provide MWPs to the supported
       unit(s) due to manning levels or temporary duty commitments.
   2.1.4. Aero Club Activities. The 7 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS will provide flight weather
   briefings to Aero Club members performing official AF operational duties (i.e., Civil Air
   Patrol and Initial Flying Training Programs). The 7 OSS/OSW will provide or arrange
   briefings when such Aero Club flights are in a transient status through the 26 OWS or Flight
   Service Station. The 7 OSS/OSW will not remain open on weekends or times outside normal
   Dyess tower published operating hours to provide briefings for routine Aero Club flying
   activities. The 7 OSS/OSW will advise Aero Club members performing official flight duties
   of the 26 OWS web page request process and self-briefing capabilities.
2.2. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). The MWP is a mission-specific forecast developed
using a continuous cycle that adapts as the supported units needs change as outlined in AFMAN
15-129V2. A MWP is provided through a number of methods (web-based, verbally, face-to-
face, DD 175-1’s, Flight Weather Briefing, etc.,). The forecaster fuses and tailors products from
operational weather centers and local units to produce the MWP, and amends the MWP as
needed when rapidly changing conditions exist or when conditions threaten resource protection.
The 7 OSS/OSW coordinates with the 26 OWS when time permits in these situations.
   2.2.1. The 7 OSS/OSW will coordinate with their supported agencies to determine the
   content and format to ensure it contains decision-grade information, which effectively
   impacts the end user’s decision-making process.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                11


  2.2.2. The 7 OSS/OSW will coordinate/tailor the delivery method and timing of the MWP
  with their supported agencies to fit mission requirements.
  2.2.3. The 7 OSS/OSW will tailor information delivery to critical decision points within the
  supported agencies’ operational cycle (i.e., mission planning) where a weather forecast
  would provide the maximum benefit to the successful outcome of the mission.
  2.2.4. The 7 OSS/OSW, at a minimum, will formally document weather forecast
  information/product descriptions (i.e., sample products, formats, delivery methods, decoding)
  and MWP products.
  2.2.5. The forecaster presents the following forms of MWP products:
     2.2.5.1. Over the counter/phone (Verbal) briefings. The forecaster is available during
     normal duty hours to brief aircrews on weather affecting the flight departure, en-route,
     destination(s) and alternates.
     2.2.5.2. Mass briefings: The 7 OSS/OSW provides face-to-face mass briefings upon
     request. The morning planning weather briefing is the most common mass brief,
     normally incorporated into the 28 BS morning aircrew brief and available to the 9 BS at
     their request.
     2.2.5.3. DD Form 175-1 weather briefings. The 7 OSS/OSW provides 175-1 briefings to
     aircrews upon request. These briefings are primarily for off-station missions. For a
     complete breakdown of the elements included in the 175-1, refer to AFMAN 15-129V2.
     NOTE: All briefings are conducted IAW AFMAN 15-129V2.
     2.2.5.4. Dyess AFB Mission Weather Product: The forecaster prepares a MWP daily for
     all 7 BW/317 AG flying squadrons. This product is used for local missions, including
     round-robin missions without intervening stops. A MWP is built for each flying
     squadron and posted on the 7 OSS/OSW webpage under the corresponding unit on the
     right. The MWP is completed and posted to the website at 0400L and 1200L, valid for
     an 18 hour period, and amended as needed until 1 hour after the last mission on the MWP
     lands. Amendments are made as necessary based on the criteria listed below. New
     MWP numbers are assigned for the 0400L and 1200L MWPs issued and amended MWPs
     will append “AMD #” to the number of the last MWP issued. Amendment times will be
     posted on each MWP.
         2.2.5.4.1. The MWP contains the following parameters (Refer to Attachment 3 for
         an example MWP):

   2.3.1. The 7 OSS/OSW will make the determination if weather support will be provided by
   the weather flight if duties and time permits, or if weather support will be coordinated with
   other agencies.
   2.3.2. The 7 BW/317 AG aircrews conducting missions at locations other than Dyess may
   receive briefing support in the form of DD 175-1’s, verbal briefings over the phone, and
   updates to briefings. The 7 OSS/OSW will provide support to these missions or will arrange
   for support with other weather agencies.
2.4. MISSIONWATCH. The forecaster monitors flying routes and missions briefed to the 7
BW and 317 AG aircrews, and informs the appropriate squadron top three or SOF of any
significant unforecast weather expected to impact the flight. The forecaster monitors the weather
along the route of flight from takeoff until landing back at Dyess or the first destination (for
aircraft not returning to Dyess). The 7 BW and 317 AG MISSIONWATCH thresholds are
defined in Attachment 4.
2.5. Low-Level Instrument Route (IR) Closures. The 7 OSS/OSW will immediately notify
the SOF and recommend a low level route be closed when the forecaster identifies any
meteorological condition listed below that is affecting or will affect IR 178, IR 126, or IR 109.
   2.5.1. The following conditions may warrant route closure IAW ACCI 11-B-l V3, and
   AFI 11202 V3_ACCSUP:
       2.5.1.1. Observed moderate or greater icing.
       2.5.1.2. Observed or forecast moderate or greater Mountain Wave turbulence. Observed

                             AIRFIELD WEATHER SERVICES

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. The forecaster performs a Basic Weather Watch (BWW), and fills an “Eyes Forward”
   role for the 26 OWS. The official weather observation is produced using the AN/FMQ-19
   AMOS in either a “fully automated,” “augmented” mode IAW AFMAN 15-111. The FMQ-
   19 observations are augmented IAW Paragraph 3.8 of this instruction.
   3.1.2. The FMQ-19 sensor group at the approach end of the active runway is the official
   point of observation. The alternate observation point when supplementing or backing-up the
   FMQ-19 is on the airfield side of Building 9001, on the red marked (DV) pavement.
   3.1.3. Fully automated observations are produced and disseminated 24/7 through JET. An
   augmented FMQ-19 observation is only available when the weather station is open and/or
   when the criterion in Table 3.4. for supplementing or backing up an observation is met.
3.2. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). When supplementing or backing-up the FMQ-19 is
required, the 7 OSS/OSW conducts a BWW IAW AFMAN 15-111. A BWW will be conducted
when the airfield is open and during periods when any of the mandatory augmentation of AMOS
is required IAW Chapter 3. Due to these other weather duties, weather technicians on duty may
not detect and report all weather changes as they occur. During a BWW, weather technicians
will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last
observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI observation, when any of the following
conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
   3.2.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   3.2.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   3.2.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
   3.2.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
   3.2.5. Precipitation (any form).
   3.2.6. Thunderstorms.
   3.2.7. Fog or Mist.
   3.2.8. All supplemental criteria specified in Table 3.4.
   3.2.9. During mandatory back up of AMOS.
   3.2.10. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will remain
   alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation.
   Weather technicians will also monitor local area observational and forecast products as often
   as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
   3.2.11. When a reliable source (Dyess Tower personnel, pilots, etc.) reports weather
   conditions different from the previous report, weather personnel will re-evaluate the forecast
   and disseminate a new observation as required.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                     17


3.3. Eyes Forward Role for 26 OWS.
   3.3.1. The forecaster provides “eyes forward" by providing information to 26 OWS
   concerning local area weather and unforecast changes and contacts the 26 OWS when:
       3.3.1.1. Severe weather signatures on radar or METSAT are identified.
       3.3.1.2. Watch/warning/advisory criteria are occurring / expected to occur or are in effect
       and is not expected to occur.
       3.3.1.3. A warning/advisory issued by the 26 OWS is not occurring or expected to occur.
           3.3.1.3.1. If weather imminently poses a hazard to life and property and notification
           to the 26 OWS is not possible, or if there is insufficient time, issue the forecast
           weather warning yourself. Notify the 26 OWS when possible.
       3.3.1.4. The 7 OSS/OSW will alert the 26 OWS to developing situations not coded in
       meteorological reports that potentially drive amendments to forecast products from the
       OWS or impact flight safety.
       3.3.1.5. Provide the 26 OWS severe weather reports not normally available through
       standard observations. These include reports from local indigenous sources, local law
       enforcement, local news media, and unit personnel. These reports will be passed
       immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement (i.e., a special weather
       observation). If this is not possible, pass the reports as soon as practical to assist the 26
       OWS in post-analysis and verification.
       3.3.1.6. Anytime the TAF needs to be amended
       3.3.1.7. Relay all PIREPs to the 26 OWS.
       3.3.1.8. Notify the 26 OWS when MISSIONWATCH indicates 26 OWS regional level
       products may be, or may become, unrepresentative when compared to current or expected
       weather conditions.
3.4. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The CWW is a program where qualified non-
weather personnel monitor the weather to assist in the reporting of weather conditions that could
affect flight safety or are critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and
resources. Dyess tower personnel participate in the CWW IAW AFI 13-204V3, Airfield
Operations Procedures and Programs and the 7 OSS/OSW provides initial weather training to
all Dyess tower controllers in support of this program. When informed by Dyess tower
personnel of changes in weather conditions, the forecaster verifies and validates weather
conditions and disseminates special observations as required. Specific responsibilities are
outlined in Paragraph 8.5.
3.5. Surface Weather Observations.
   3.5.1. Surface Observation Elements:      The following elements are observed and
   disseminated locally and long line. See AFMAN 15-111 for a complete breakdown of the
   METAR/SPECI code.
       3.5.1.1. Winds: Wind velocity is recorded using sensors at both ends of the runway and
       the wind value for the active runway is reported in the observation. Wind direction is
       reported in magnetic to the nearest ten degrees and speed is measured to the nearest knot.
18                                                       DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014


     The Dyess tower and 7 OSS/OSW equipment provide digital readings for wind direction
     in degrees magnetic, speed, gust, and variability. The weather observation represents a 2-
     minute average for the period preceding the time of observation with maximum wind
     gusts based on a 10-minute period before the observation.
     3.5.1.2. Prevailing Visibility: The FMQ-19 on the approach end of the active runway
     determines prevailing visibility. When supplementing or backing-up the FMQ-19, the
     forecaster uses known landmarks, buildings, or unfocused lights as markers to determine
     prevailing visibility, which is the visibility considered to be representative of the
     visibility conditions at the weather unit. This representative visibility is the greatest
     visibility equaled or exceeded throughout at least half the horizon circle, not necessarily
     continuous (i.e., it may be composed of sectors distributed anywhere around the horizon
     circle).
     3.5.1.3. Runway Visual Range (RVR): The range over which the pilot on the center line
     of a runway can see the runway surface markings and the lights delineating the runway or
     identify its center line. The FMQ-19 located near the approach end of the runway is used
     to measure RVR.
     3.5.1.4. Obstruction to Vision/Present Weather: The FMQ-19 and/or the forecaster
     determine and report obstructions to vision whenever the prevailing visibility is less than
     7 SM. Present weather includes thunderstorms and precipitation.
     3.5.1.5. Sky Condition and Ceiling: A visual observation of the clouds and atmospheric
     conditions consisting of cloud type or phenomena, amount and height above the surface.
     The FMQ-19 and/or the forecaster determines types, heights and amounts. Sky condition
     is based upon the amount of sky coverage. “SKC” represents a sky free of clouds and/or
     obscuring phenomena. “FEW” indicates coverage of 1/8 to 2/8 coverage of the sky.
     “SCT” represents coverage of 3/8 to 4/8 of the sky. “BKN” means 5/8 to 7/8 coverage
     and “OVC” means 8/8 coverage. The FMQ-19 and/or the forecaster determines cloud
     heights, including vertical visibility (VV), by using a laser beam ceilometer, known
     heights of objects in the area, weather radar, or estimation based on cloud type and
     observer experience. The laser beam ceilometer is located near both approach ends of the
     runway and is accurate for cloud heights at or below 25,000 feet.
     3.5.1.6. Temperature and Dew Point: The FMQ-19 Temperature and Relative Humidity
     sensors provide current temperature and dew point readings. Readings are reported to the
     nearest degree centigrade and are disseminated on all METAR and Special observations.
     3.5.1.7. Altimeter Setting (ALSTG) and Pressure Altitude (PA): The FMQ-19 is the
     primary pressure-measuring instrument. The secondary measuring instruments are the
     Kestrel and the TMQ-53. ALSTG will be included on all observations, but PA will only
     be included on locally disseminated observations.
     3.5.1.8. Remarks: Disseminated on all observations, as appropriate, to present a more
     precise picture of the existing weather conditions such as varying visibility or distances
     and movement of thunderstorms near the airfield.
  3.5.2. Non-Duty Hours: The FMQ-19 produces and disseminates fully automated
  observations during non-duty hours.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                   19


3.6. Types of Surface Weather Observations.
   3.6.1. Record Observations (METAR): These observations are transmitted between 55 and
   59 minutes past each hour. The observation contains the following elements:
       3.6.1.1. Time (UTC).
       3.6.1.2. Wind direction (magnetic), speed (knots).
       3.6.1.3. Prevailing visibility (statue miles).

       DA +3379;
   3.6.2. Special Observations (SPECI): Special observations have the same format as record
   observations. When special observation criteria are met, a SPECI observation is taken and
   disseminated. The following are the Dyess AFB special observation criteria:
       3.6.2.1. Visibility: Prevailing visibility (rounded to reportable values) decreases to less
       than, or if below, increases to equal or exceed:

Landing System (MMLS) Azimuth Critical Area, and MMLS Elevation Critical Area.

       3.6.2.3. Sky Condition: A layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena aloft is observed
       below 700 feet and no layer reported below 700 feet in the preceding observation.
       3.6.2.4. Tornado or funnel cloud is observed, disappears from sight, or ends. If a tornado
       occurred within the past hour according to outside sources and was not observed or
       recorded from the weather station a remark will be included on locally derived
       observation form AF Form 3803, Surface Weather Observations (METAR/SPECI),(also
       refer to AF Form 3803).
       3.6.2.5. Wind Shift: Any wind direction change of 45 degrees or more in less than 15
       minutes and wind speed after the shift is greater than or equal to 10 knots.
       3.6.2.6. Squall: When occurring. A strong wind characterized by sudden onset in which
       the wind speed increases at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least
       one minute. A special observation is not required to report a squall if one is currently in
       progress. Although a wind event, SQ is reported as a present weather event.
       3.6.2.7. Volcanic Eruption: Eruption or volcanic ash cloud first noted.
       3.6.2.8. Thunderstorm (occurring at the station) begins or ends (15 minutes after thunder
       is last heard). NOTE: A SPECI is not required to report the beginning of a new
       thunderstorm if one is currently reported.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                       21

          3.6.2.9.3. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends. NOTE: Except for
          freezing rain, freezing drizzle, hail and ice pellets, a special observation is not
          required for change in type (i.e.,, drizzle changing to snow) or the beginning/ending
          of one type while another is in progress (i.e.,, snow changing to rain and snow.
       3.6.2.10. Tornado or funnel cloud is observed, disappears from sight, or ends. If a
       tornado occurred within the past hour according to outside sources and was not observed
       or recorded from the weather station a remark, it will be included on the locally derived
       observation form, AF Form 3813.
       3.6.2.11. RVR: Prevailing visibility first observed < 1SM/1600 meters, again when
       prevailing visibility goes above 1SM/1600 meters. The highest value decreases to less

(PAR) Touchdown Areas, and MMLS Azimuth Critical Area. EXCEPTION: Not required if
published RVR minima is above 2000 feet (i.e., not required for RVR minima of 2400 feet).
NOTE*: Applies when ALS is INOP (DOD FLIP).

          3.6.2.11.1. Transmit RVR when prevailing visibility decreases to < 1SM.
          3.6.2.11.2. Transmit RVR when prevailing visibility increases to > 1SM.
          3.6.2.11.3. RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for the runway in use,
          and when it is first determined that the RVRNO report is no longer applicable,
          provided conditions for reporting RVR exist.
       3.6.2.12. Upon Resumption of Observing Function: Within 15-minutes after the weather
       technician returns to duty following a break in observing coverage or augmentation at the
       observing location unless a record observation is filed during that 15-minute period.
 22                                                          DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014


       3.6.2.13. Ten minutes prior to the arrival and departure of Air Force One.
       3.6.2.14. Alert Observations: Upon hearing the klaxon sound, when notified of an
       aircraft alert, or when requested to by the Dyess command post the forecaster
       immediately disseminates a SPECI observation. This observation is transmitted within
       30 seconds; “ALERT WX OBS” is appended to the local remarks.
       3.6.2.15. Aircraft Mishap (back-up mode only): Taken immediately following
       notification or sighting of an aircraft mishap at or near the observing location unless there
       has been an intervening observation.
   3.6.2.16. Any other meteorological situation that, in the forecasters opinion is critical.
       3.6.2.17. Sample SPECI Observation: KDYS SPECI 0223Z 02011KT 3200 BR FEW010
       SCT015 OVC030 22/21 ALSTG 29.75 RMK TWR VIS 1 1/4 VIS N 1 PA +616 DA
       +1751 23/RGB
3.6.3. Local Observations: An unscheduled observation, reported to the nearest minute, not
meeting SPECI criteria. Take a full element LOCAL for altimeter setting changes during back-
up of FMQ-19 pressure sensor. A full element LOCAL is required because it will replace the
previous METAR in Dyess tower AFAS System.
       3.6.3.1. LOCAL altimeter setting observations are taken during back-up of AMOS
       pressure sensors at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change of
       0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last ALSTG value. A METAR or SPECI taken
       within the established time interval will meet this requirement.
3.7. FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS): The FMQ-19 is
capable of taking and disseminating “fully automated” weather observations 24/7.
Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified weather technicians manually add or
edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited AMOS. The forecaster must maintain
situational awareness of the current weather conditions and AMOS observations and augments
(supplements or backs up) the observations as required.
   3.7.1. Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an
   automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the automated observing system to
   detect and/or report. Weather technicians will perform a BWW and be prepared to
   supplement observations when the airfield is open and the weather conditions in Table 3.4
   are observed and/or forecast to occur within 1 hour. Weather personnel are required to log
   on to an ADS and be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued
   for tornadic activity. Weather technicians are not required to supplement during airfield
   closure hours for other Table 3.4 criteria. Note: This does not relieve EUs of their AFI 10-
   229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and
   Responsibilities and AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Air Force Weather Operations –
   Exploitation, responsibilities for responding to severe weather events during non-duty hours.
   EUs will continue to have SWAP in place to respond to severe weather threats. EUs should
   concentrate their SWAP efforts on eyes forward resource protection and notification efforts
   during airfield closure hours.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                    23

Snow Depth (only during airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been issued and
snowfall is occurring)
NOTE: The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedence over any other phenomena.
       3.7.1.1. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedent over any other
       phenomena.
   3.7.2. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological data to an automated
   weather observation when the primary automated method is not operational or unavailable
   due to sensor and/or communication failure. When the airfield is open the forecaster backs-
   up the FMQ-19 if the system/sensor(s) is/are not operational or unavailable due to sensor
   and/or communication failure. The forecaster makes every attempt to immediately log out
   any broken equipment, except when immediate flight safety warrants otherwise. When the
   airfield is closed, the forecaster is not required to backup the FMQ-19 unless tornadic activity
   is occurring or forecast to occur.
       3.7.2.1. 7 OSS/OSW leadership will use sound ORM practices to develop/document
       those operationally significant weather thresholds (normally provided by a fully
       operational AMOS) to report while operating in back-up mode. After allowing the
       AMOS (FMQ-19) sensor(s) the required averaging time the following criteria is
       augmented if unrepresentative due to ORM concerns:
          3.7.2.1.1. Any SPECI criteria AT & Below CIG 2200 and/or VIS 2 1/2 .
          3.7.2.1.2. Any criteria warranting a watch, warning, and/or advisory.
          3.7.2.1.3. There is no requirement to back-up the system/sensor when the airfield is
          closed, unless SWAP has been implemented and WWA criteria is met and not
          accurately reported in the interest of resource protection.
   3.7.3. Automated Sensor display (ASD): The JET web server produces the ASD and is
   available on the AWOS/WWA portlet to JET users. The display derives data from sensors
   and weather instruments on the field to provide a graphic representation of wind and weather
   elements. The 26 OWS uses this display as a METWATCH tool when the 7 OSS/OSW is
   closed.

           TROPICAL CYCLONE AND VOLCANIC ERUPTION SUPPORT

4.1. Tropical Cyclone.
   4.1.1. General. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), is the governing authority for all
   hurricane advisories, watches, and warnings in the Continental United States. While Dyess
   AFB is not located in a hurricane threat zone, many Dyess AFB assets travel to hurricane
   prone regions or Dyess AFB may receive aircraft for bed-down from hurricane-prone
   installations. Hurricane season lasts from June through November; however, hurricanes have
   occurred at other times throughout the year. The 26 OWS will produce a Tropical Cyclone
   Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP) whenever Dyess AFB is expected to receive sustained
   winds of GTE 35 knots during the next 96 hours as a result of a tropical cyclone. The TC-
   TAP uses the National Hurricane Center or Joint Typhoon Warning Centers forecast for the
   tropical cyclones track and intensity and does not deviate from this forecast.
   4.1.2. 7 OSS/OSW Commander.
      4.1.2.1. Operational Weather Squadrons (OWSs) will produce a TC-TAP for locations
      within their area of responsibility (AOR) expected to receive sustained winds > 35-kts
      during the next 96 hours as a result of a tropical cyclone. The 7 OSS/OSW Commander
      will use this product to provide installation commander(s) with forecasts of the expected
      onset, intensity, end times of significant winds, and closest point of approach for the
      associated storm.
      4.1.2.2. Ensures customers understand that 48-hour and 72-hour outlooks (or longer if
      issued) contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only, and are
      subject to change. This notification must include the forecast error probability statements
      included in discussion bulletins or on the forecast products.
   4.1.3. Duty Forecaster.
      4.1.3.1. The 7 OSS/OSW will use the MEFP to tailor the official tropical cyclone
      forecasts into a specific mission forecast product for their supported agencies. Tailoring
      may include factors such as specific local effects such as terrain or relative position to the
      storm.
      4.1.3.2. Provides tropical cyclone information in flight weather MWPs for aircraft
      leaving Dyess if the flight path is close to the tropical cyclone.
      4.1.3.3. Provides or arranges for weather support for all transient aircrew evacuated to
      Dyess. The transient aircrew’s home station weather flight should have contacted Dyess
      7 OSS/OSW prior to the evacuation of the aircraft. If not, the forecaster contacts the
      aircrew’s home station weather flight before providing support.
4.2. Volcanic Eruption.
   4.2.1. General. The civil Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC)National Hurricane
   Center (NHC), are the governing authority for all volcanic eruption ash cloud forecasts.
   While Dyess AFB is not located in a volcanic eruption threat zone, many Dyess AFB assets

                 WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES

5.1. General. Weather watches and warnings are special notices provided to supported agencies
for potential or established weather conditions that pose a threat to life and/or property. Weather
advisories are special notices provided to a supported agency when an established weather
condition affecting its operations is occurring or forecast. All WWA’s are issued within a 5 NM
radius of Dyess AFB unless noted otherwise below.
   5.1.1. The 26 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast watches, warnings and advisories
   (WWAs) for Dyess AFB. The 7 OSS/OSW is the primary source for issuing observed
   warnings and advisories for Dyess AFB. When the 7 OSS/OSW is closed, the 26 OWS uses
   the 7 OSS/OSW’s automated equipment in issuing WWAs until the standby forecaster
   arrives. Advisories for winds 25-34 kts, snow and/or sleet (with accumulation < 2 inches in
   12 hours), potential B1 induction icing, visibility < 1/8 mile and thunderstorm within 10 NM
   and 25 NM are issued by the 26 OWS when the airfield is closed. Customer responses and
   mission impacts are listed in Attachment 5.

Table 5.1. Dyess AFB Weather Watch and Warning Criteria

Table 5.2. Dyess AFB Weather Advisories




5.2. Rules for Issuing WWA’s:
   5.2.1. Include maximum hail size, maximum rain/snow accumulation, or maximum wind
   speed as applicable in warnings and advisories.
   5.2.2. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time (and will include multiple warning
   criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings and/or observed lightning warnings.
   5.2.3. Warnings take precedence over advisories for the same phenomena. Forecast
   advisory/warning valid for the same phenomena will not be valid for the same time.
   Conversely, warnings and multiple forecast advisories for different phenomena may be valid
   for the same time.
   5.2.4. Watches are stand alone products based upon potential and are unaffected by warnings
   or advisories for the same phenomena.
   5.2.5. Forecasted warnings and advisories will maintain horizontal consistency with TAF
   and other forecast products. Watches are not required to be included in the body of the TAF-
   coded forecast depending on circumstance
   5.2.6. A watch is not a substitute for a warning (WW). Units will issue warnings, as
   required, regardless of whether or not a watch had previously been issued.
   5.2.7. All watches and WWs are issued for specific and distinct locations.
      5.2.7.1. The area affected by a watch or warning will be clearly indicated in the text of
      the watch/WW.
      5.2.7.2. Watches may be issued for an area larger than the corresponding warning (watch
      for base X and surrounding local flying area, WW for the aerodrome).
      5.2.7.3. A WW affects an area no larger than 5 nautical miles (nm) radius.
   5.2.8. The lightning watch and the observed lightning warning are separate entities and do
   not supersede previously issued watches or WWs for other criteria.
   5.2.9. A separate valid time will be specified for each criterion when warranted.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                  29


     5.2.9.1. All times used in a watch or WW will be expressed in coordinated universal time
     (UTC) and local time. Exception: A valid time is not used in observed warnings. In
     place of valid time, the following statement is used: "Valid until further notice".
  5.2.10. A forecast WWA will not be issued for a single unforecasted event that is not
  expected to persist or recur.
  5.2.11. The 26 OWS will issue observed warnings when 7 OSS/OSW is not on duty, as
  capability exists until the standby forecaster arrives.
  5.2.12. More than one advisory may be in effect at the same time for the same location, but
  only one will be in effect for a particular phenomenon at the same time.
  5.2.13. Under rare circumstances EUs may, without prior coordination, issue WWs to
  facilitate resource protection actions when sufficient time does not exist to communicate a
  change in weather with the characterization unit. EUs will forward pertinent information to
  the servicing characterization unit to ensure the warning is entered into the Air Force weather
  dissemination system.
  5.2.14. The 7 OSS/OSW will issue observed WWAs to include lightning warnings while on
  duty.
  5.2.15. Time permitting, the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) leader queries the 7
  BW/CC through the Dyess command post on whether to convene a kilo weather conference
  prior to issuing or upon issuing a weather warning for tornadoes, 3/4 inch hail, winds >
  50kts, heavy snowfall, or freezing precipitation. In this conference the forecaster explains to
  the wing staff, group commanders, and other appropriate agencies the weather threat to
  Dyess AFB.
  5.2.16. Tornado Warnings:
     5.2.16.1. The normal sequence of events for a tornado starts with the 26 OWS or 7
     OSS/OSW issuing a tornado watch followed by a tornado warning. A tornado watch
     means conditions are favorable for tornado development within 5 NM of Dyess AFB. A
     tornado warning means a certified observer, law enforcement representative, or ATC
     controller has sighted a tornado, or radar indicates one that may threaten Dyess AFB.
     5.2.16.2. In addition to identifying tornadoes, Doppler radar (also called NEXRAD) can
     identify mesocyclones, which are the precursors to the formation of tornadoes. Over 50
     percent of all manually verified mesocyclones develop into tornadoes. When the
     NEXRAD projects either a tornado or a confirmed mesocyclone to enter the Dyess AFB
     area, the 7 OSS/OSW or 26 OWS issues a tornado warning.
     5.2.16.3. If there is a radar indicated or confirmed tornado moving toward Dyess AFB,
     the 7 OSS/OSW contacts the Dyess command post directly to issue a tornado warning.
     The command post activates the base siren immediately and disseminates the warning to
     priority customers IAW established procedures. When contacting the Dyess command
     post weather personnel will provide location, speed and direction of movement of the
     tornado or radar signature. This information is also included in the text of the warning in
     IWWC.
     5.2.16.4. Dyess AFB conducts a Natural Disaster Response Exercise (NDRE) focused on
     a tornado scenario in late winter/early spring prior to severe weather season.
 30                                                       DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014


   5.2.17. Snow/Sleet Advisory and Heavy Snow Warning:
      5.2.17.1. Upon issuance, the Base Snow and Ice Plan will be activated IAW Winter
      Weather Procedures.
   5.2.18. The 7 OSS/OSW will disseminate heat stress condition advisories for conditions two
   (II) through five (V) when notified by bio-environmental.
      5.2.18.1. These advisories will be valid from the time of issue until 2000L, or until a new
      heat stress condition advisory supersedes it or the heat stress condition drops to one (I).
      5.2.18.2. When issuing this advisory, add “Dyess AFB is currently in heat stress
      condition #” to the remarks section, where “#” is the current heat stress condition.
   5.2.19. Thunderstorm advisories DO NOT imply surface crosswind and wind gusts up to and
   including 34 knots. The surface crosswind and surface wind advisory will be issued
   separately.
   5.2.19.1. Thunderstorm advisories may be upgraded and downgraded between each other.
   (i.e., upgrade from TS within 25NM to TS within 10NM). NOTE: More than one advisory
   may be in effect at the same time for the same location, but only one will be in effect for a
   particular phenomenon at the same time.
5.3. Dissemination of Watches, Warnings, and Advisories.
   5.3.1. JET is the primary method of dissemination for all weather watches and warnings to
   base agencies. When open, the 7 OSS/OSW ensures the Dyess consolidated command post,
   Dyess tower, SOF, AMOPS and NAOC (if applicable) have received all watches and
   warnings issued by the 26 OWS and the 7 OSS/OSW. Each agency is responsible for
   disseminating the information to the appropriate units IAW the Dyess Weather Notification
   Chain, Figure 5.1. Any agency having problems with their JET software will contact the JET
   system manager at 696-2524.
   5.3.2. Backup dissemination of all watches and warnings is via telephone to the Dyess
   command post, Airfield Ops, tower, and NAOC (if applicable). Airfield Ops relays all
   watches and warnings via the secondary crash net (SCN).
      5.3.2.1. Example of Disseminated WWrng/WWtch over JET.
          5.3.2.1.1. Watch:

VALID 12/1130Z (12/0630L) TO UFN (UFN)
LIGHTNING IS OCCURING WITHIN 5 NM OF DYESS AFB.
THIS WARNING UPGRADES WEATHER WATCH 08-A12.

5.4. Verification of Watches, Warnings, and Advisories.
   5.4.1. The verification radius is based on desired lead time requirements (AFMAN 15-
   129V1 Figure 4.1).
   5.4.2. The 26 OWS will verify all WWAs transferred to them from the 7 OSS/OSW
   during/after a disruption in services and enter the verification data in the Air Force weather
   dissemination system. The 7 OSS/OSW will provide any assistance in this process and track
   verification when the forecast WWA was issued until it is passed to the 26 OWS.
   5.4.3. Warnings and advisories will be verified using all available sources of representative
   sensed or observed data or subjective analysis (when appropriate) within an expanding radius
   around a specific geographic location based on the desired lead-time requirement of the
   warning or advisory product.
   5.4.4. Observed warnings and advisories are verified using sensed or observed data within
   the specification distance from the point location. For example, a warning for lightning
   within 5NM of an airfield is issued and simultaneously verified based on lightning strikes,
   radar returns within the specification distance, or reporting TS as a weather type in the body
   of an observation.
   5.4.5. Warnings and advisories issued with lead-times are verified using an expanded
   verification radius, not to exceed 15nm, around the affected location.
   5.4.6. Units issuing WWAs will verify each phenomenon separately except severe
   thunderstorm and moderate thunderstorm warnings will be verified upon first occurrence of
   either wind or hail threshold.
5.5. Rules for Amending, Extending, and Canceling WWAs
   5.5.1. When a warning or advisory no longer adequately describes the phenomenon's
   expected occurrence, a completely new warning or advisory with a new number will be
   issued.
   5.5.2. WWAs are extended if the extension is issued prior to the expiration of the original
   notice.
   5.5.3. The text will clearly state how the amended or extended WWA affects any previously
   issued notice.
   5.5.4. WWAs are cancelled when previously forecast/observed conditions are no longer
   occurring and are not expected to recur.

    5.5.5. Lightning watches are cancelled only when the potential for lightning within the next
    30 minutes is no longer forecast.
    5.5.6. Observed Lightning warnings are cancelled when thunderstorms have dissipated or
    passed beyond 5NM and lightning is no longer occurring within 5NM of the installation.
    During B-1B operations, 7 OSS/OSW shall notify the SOF via telephone as soon as
    cancellation criteria is met. For lightning warning cancellations, include a statement
    indicating its affect on any previously issued warnings, such as "WEATHER WARNING
    #XX-XXX remains in effect" or ― WEATHER WATCH #XX-XXX FOR LIGHTNING
    REMAINS IN EFFECT.

                           SEVERE WEATHER ACTION PLAN

6.1. General.
   6.1.1. The Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) outlines procedures to recall 7 OSS/OSW
   standby personnel and Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) personnel in the event of
   severe weather, or any other emergency requiring weather support.
   6.1.2. These procedures are in effect 24 hours per day. The 26 OWS is the primary
   forecasting and weather warning/watch office and has personnel on duty 24 hours per day.
6.2. Pre-Emptive Actions. In case of potential severe weather at Dyess, the 7 OSS/OSW and
the 26 OWS will combine efforts and provide a forecast. Duty positions and priorities shift to
cover SWAP responsibilities through the duration of the weather event.
6.3. 7 OSS/OSW Responsibilities. The 7 OSS/OSW performs SWAP responsibilities as
defined in AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 10-229, AFI 10-206, the Dyess IDS, and local weather
procedures. More specifically, the 7 OSS/OSW accomplishes the following procedures:
   6.3.1. SWAP Activation Guidelines. The on-duty/standby weather forecaster will notify the
   SWAT leader whenever criteria in Table 7.1. are met. The SWAT leader on duty will
   discuss the meteorological situation, manning requirements, and the recall (or placement on
   standby) of additional personnel with the designated forecaster/standby person. If deemed
   necessary, and the defined criteria exists, the SWAT leader will report to the weather station
   NLT 30 mins after notification, or as soon as possible.
       6.3.1.1. During normal duty hours (0730 to 1630 CT), Monday through Friday, except
       federal holidays/airfield closure days, the forecaster implements SWAP by notifying the
       7 OSS/OSW leadership whenever one or more conditions in Table 7.1. are met.
       6.3.1.2. Outside normal staff duty hours, the forecaster will implement SWAP by
       notifying the SWAT leader, as indicated on the current duty schedule whenever one or
       more conditions in Table 7.1. below are expected, are occurring, or if they feel that they
       are too busy to perform all required duties.
       6.3.1.3. The SWAT will effectively use the ORM process by prioritizing what tasks
       need to be accomplished immediately to ensure that the most effective decision has been
       made in helping provide resource protection to Dyess and its assets.
   6.3.2. Standby Forecaster Duties. The forecaster will have the standby cell with them at all
   times. Contacts will be made twice daily to the 26 OWS to discuss severe weather at 06-09L
   and 18-21L.
       6.3.2.1. The 26 OWS will issue all applicable WWAs if the forecaster is not at the
       weather station.
       6.3.2.2. The forecaster must report to the weather station NLT 30 mins after notification
       whenever a WWA is issued for the criteria in Table 7.1. Once the forecaster is at the
       station, he/she will maintain normal operations.
DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014                                                                  35


       6.3.2.3. Efforts will be concentrated on eyes forward resource protection and notification
       efforts during airfield closure hours.
       6.3.2.4. If there are active missions the forecaster will enhance MISSIONWATCH and
       keep the SOF updated on changes IAW duty priorities.
       6.3.2.5. The 7 OSS/OSW will remain open and SWAP will remain in effect until the
       expiration or cancellation of watches and/or warnings.
       6.3.2.6. The forecaster will supplement for mandatory elements IAW AFMAN 15-111.
   6.3.3. The Dyess command post will contact the stand-by forecaster in the event the airfield
   opens and it is not previously scheduled.
       6.3.3.1. Inbound Aircraft: Forecasters will arrive one hour prior to aircraft arrival time
       or when the airfield is open, whichever is earlier.
       6.3.3.2. Outbound Aircraft: Forecasters will arrive as early as needed to provide any
       briefing required and stay until the airfield closes.
   6.3.4. The 7 OSS/OSW reviews home phone and cell phone numbers monthly to ensure the
   most current numbers are available for SWAP.
   6.3.5. The standby forecaster will request a TAF be issued at least 3 hours prior to the
   airfield opening.

to last at least one hour.
Amendment Criteria—--Significant operational weather thresholds (ceiling height, visibility,
wind speed, etc.) used to determine whether a TAF is amended.
Basic Weather Watch (BWW)—--When an observer cannot continuously monitor the weather
due to other duties, location of the weather station, and/or obstruction of view of the runway
complex, a BWW is conducted. In addition to the hourly observations, the observer rechecks
conditions at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation when any of the
following conditions are observed occurring or are forecast to occur within one hour; ceiling
1,500 feet or less, visibility 3 miles or less, precipitation (any form), thunderstorms, and/or fog.
Broken (BKN)—--Descriptive of sky cover of 5/8 to 7/8 of clouds or obscuring phenomena.
The description “BKN” constitutes a ceiling.
Ceiling—--The height (in feet above airport elevation) of the bases of the lowest layer of clouds
or obscuring phenomena when the clouds or phenomena are reported as broken or overcast.
Cell—--A convective cloud element.
Clear (SKC)—--An adjective used to describe a cloud-free sky.
Climatology—--The scientific study of the statistical collective of a specified area’s weather
conditions over an extended interval of time (usually at least several decades).
Continuous Weather Watch (CWW)—--When an observer monitors the weather conditions
without interruption and performs no other duties.
Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW)—--The concept where the duty observer is assisted in
monitoring weather conditions by other properly trained personnel, such as ATC personnel.
Crosswind—--Wind vector component perpendicular to the course of an aircraft heading down
the runway. The drift crosswinds cause is critical to aviation and is especially dangerous during
landing and takeoff.
Desired Lead Time (DLT)—--The goal for the amount of time in advance of onset of a
particular weather phenomenon. It is set by a combination of customer requirements and
meteorological limitations.
High Winds—--Wind speeds of 50 kts or greater.
 56                                                         DYESSAFBI15-101 30 JUNE 2014


Dew Point—--The temperature to which air must cool in order for condensation to occur.
Downwind Direction—--The compass direction the wind is blowing toward; the opposite of
wind direction.
False Alarm—--The issuance of an Advisory/Watch/Warning for which the hazardous weather
never actually occurred.
False Alarm Rate—--The number of false alarms divided by the total number of
Advisories/Watches/Warnings issued, expressed as a percentage.
Few—--Descriptive of sky cover of 1/8 to 2/8 of clouds or obscuring phenomena.                The
description “FEW” does not constitute a ceiling.
Flight Weather Briefing—--A presentation of the observed and forecast weather conditions
given by a forecaster to an aircrew member prior to takeoff. The briefing includes expected
conditions for takeoff, enroute, destination and alternate weather observations and forecasts.
Freezing Precipitation—--Any form of liquid precipitation that freezes upon contact with the
ground or exposed objects.
Funnel Cloud—--A cloud column or inverted cloud cone pendant from a convective cell. If it
reaches the earth’s surface, it is then called a tornado.
Gust—--Maximum wind speed observed during the 10-minute observational period with
variation of 10 kts or more between peaks and lulls.

severe turbulence, heavy precipitation and possible hail. Low-level wind shear poses a
significant hazard to pilots when thunderstorms are in the vicinity of the terminal.
Tornado—--Sometimes called “cyclone” or “twister.” A violent rotating column or pendant of
air from a thunderstorm. On a local scale, it is the most destructive of all atmospheric
phenomena. Its vortex, commonly several hundreds of yards in diameter, whirls with wind
speeds estimated at 100 to more than 300 miles per hour.

horizon, and (b) at night, a known, preferably unfocused, moderately intense light source.
Waterspout—--A tornado over water.
Weather—--(1) The state of the atmosphere; mainly with respect to the effects upon life and
human activities. As distinguished from climate, weather consists of the short-term (minutes to
months) variations in the atmosphere. (2) In weather observations, any atmospheric phenomena
other than “obstructions to vision” significant in the description of atmospheric conditions
(especially regarding visibility) at the time of observation (essentially, all forms of precipitation,
tornadoes, waterspouts and thunderstorms).
Weather Advisory (WA)—--A special notice to a supported agency for an established weather
condition, which may affect the agency’s operations, is observed or forecast to occur.

customers alerting them of a potential for weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a
hazard to life or property for which the customer must take protective action.
Wind Chill Temperature—--Also called “wind-chill factor” and “wind-chill index.” A
quantitative approximation of the cooling effect of any combination of temperature and wind.
Essentially, this approximation is intended to quantify how much colder blowing air at a given
temperature feels than calm air at the same given temperature.
Wind Direction—--The direction from which the wind is blowing.               It is the opposite of
downwind direction.
Wind Speed—--The speed at which the wind is blowing. Commonly differentiated into steady
or mean speed and gust speed.
Zulu Time (Z)—--Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);
usually used for times associated with weather data.
