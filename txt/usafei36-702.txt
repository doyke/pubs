1. Policy. A high level of discipline and work morale among the non-U.S. work force may be attained
through competent and decisive leadership, maintenance of constructive and effective labor management
relations, and fair and equal treatment of employees in every respect. Emphasis will be placed on prevent-
ing situations that may require corrective or disciplinary action. However, when such actions are appro-
priate, they will be taken promptly, constructively, and equitably.

2. General Principles.
    2.1. Discipline and work morale are the essence of effective teamwork. Commanders, operating offi-
    cials, and employees must maintain a work environment in which both management and employees
    recognize and carry out their responsibilities.
    2.2. Supervisors at all levels must understand and accept their own responsibility for creating and
    maintaining sound relations between themselves and employees, and among employees. They must
    influence employees through proper guidance, instructions, and good example to abide by established
    standards of conduct and performance, rules and regulations. Clear communication and consistent
    enforcement of established requirements, early identification of conduct and performance problems,
    fair treatment and motivation of employees, and recognition of good performers will also help to min-
    imize disciplinary problems.
    2.3. Employees are expected to perform the duties assigned and meet obligations under their employ-
    ment contract conscientiously and in the most effective manner possible; to respect the administrative
    authority of those directing their work; and to observe the laws, internal regulations, and collective
    agreement provisions governing their employment and conduct.
    2.4. Reasonable standards of conduct should be developed and published for installation-wide appli-
    cation, or keyed to individual work environments. They will be communicated to all affected employ-
    ees by appropriate means.
    2.5. Constructive discipline is preventive in nature. Its primary objectives are to develop, correct, and
    rehabilitate employees. Supervisors will bear this in mind when considering actions under paragraph
    5. or 6.
    2.6. Corrective and disciplinary actions prescribed in this instruction will be taken only when caused
    by delinquency or misconduct personally attributable to the employee (violations of rules, regulations,
    or standards of conduct governing individual employment situations). Substandard performance will
    be the basis for appropriate nondisciplinary action, unless the causes are within the employee's con-
    trol, and application of corrective action can be expected to motivate a change in behavior.

3. Responsibilities and Delegation of Authority.
    3.1. Installation Commanders who are delegated appointing authority under Air Force Instruction
    (AFI) 36-102, Basic Authority and Responsibility for Civilian Personnel Management and Adminis-
    tration, 18 February 1994 will ensure proper application of policy, principles, and procedures outlined
    in this instruction with due consideration of local requirements.
    3.2. Civilian Personnel Officers will:
       3.2.1. Provide guidance to and assist management in the development of reasonable standards of
       conduct.
USAFEI36-702 11 AUGUST 2006                                                                               3


       3.2.2. Ensure, through formal training and other forms of communication, that supervisors under-
       stand the concepts of sound employee-management relations, desired employee behavior, and the
       techniques for handling on-the-job behavioral problems.
       3.2.3. Assist management in analyzing the facts and reasons associated with disciplinary prob-
       lems.
       3.2.4. Provide guidance to supervisors in individual corrective actions and disciplinary measures.
       3.2.5. Ensure that corrective and disciplinary actions are consistent with governing laws, collec-
       tive agreement, and instructions/regulations, justified and supported on merit, and comply with all
       procedural requirements. This includes responsibility for notifying employees periodically
       through newsletters, electronic messages or individual notification of the persons having authority
       to take disciplinary action and sign letters of warning and separation notices (see paragraph 2.4.
       and German Civil Code (BGB), Section 174, 2d sentence).
       3.2.6. Take actions (draft, sign, and issue notice letters) which are outside the immediate supervi-
       sor's normal personnel management responsibilities. For example, actions resulting from unsuit-
       ability for employment, when the determination is based on information in investigation reports
       and is not directly related to current performance.
   3.3. Supervisors at first or higher level will:
       3.3.1. Establish standards of conduct (refer to Attachment 2, paragraph A2.1., Guidelines for
       Establishing Standards of Employee Conduct) for their area of responsibility and maintain an
       environment which promotes good employee-management relations, efficiency, productivity, and
       morale of their employees (see paragraph 9.1.1.).
       3.3.2. Keep employees informed of rules of conduct and maintain discipline by observing the
       principles established in paragraph 2.2.
       3.3.3. Analyze disciplinary problems thoroughly to determine and, if possible, remove causes.
       3.3.4. Gather, carefully analyze and consider available facts and circumstances before taking or
       recommending corrective or disciplinary action.
       3.3.5. Guide and counsel employees by means of individual interviews or group discussions,
       when justified by their conduct or attitude, to reduce the need for formal corrective or disciplinary
       action.
       3.3.6. Initiate and take corrective/disciplinary action, as necessary and appropriate; sign and issue
       notices of formal corrective/disciplinary actions (paragraph 5.2. and 6.).

4. Investigation of Infractions.
   4.1. Before initiating a corrective or disciplinary action, the immediate supervisor will thoroughly and
   objectively investigate alleged violations or offenses. Investigations will, unless prohibited by circum-
   stances of an individual case, include a discussion with concerned employees to obtain their explana-
   tions. Consideration will also be given to possible extenuating circumstances, past conduct and duty
   performance, and whether an employee was provoked into the action. In addition, it should be estab-
   lished whether employees knew, or could reasonably be expected to know, what standard of conduct
   was expected of them. (refer to Attachment 2, paragraph A2.3., Guide for Selecting Corrective or
   Disciplinary Action)
4                                                                      USAFEI36-702 11 AUGUST 2006


    4.2. In case of unexcused absence from work, the immediate supervisor should take appropriate
    action to determine the reason for the employee's absence not later than the 3rd workday after the last
    day of active duty. The sample letter in Attachment 7, Advance Inquiry, Abandonment of Position,
    will be used for this purpose unless evidence can be obtained by other means.
    4.3. On completion of the initial investigation process, the case will be presented to the next level
    management official for review and verification that all facts are properly and conclusively estab-
    lished (unless this official is identical with the commander specified under paragraph 3.1.). On deter-
    mination of the employee's fault, one of the actions prescribed in paragraph 5. or 6. will be taken, as
    appropriate.

5. Corrective Actions. German labor law and jurisdiction have established that inflicting a penalty upon
an employee requires the existence of a penalty ordinance with legal basis in the governing collective
agreement. Such a legal basis is not included in the CTA II. Therefore, corrective actions within the mean-
ing of this paragraph can only be considered and used as formal warnings that inform employees of their
failure to meet certain obligations resulting from their employment contract, or to comply with estab-
lished standards of conduct, and of the possible consequences that may result from a repetition of specific
infractions. The objective of a corrective action, as opposed to a disciplinary action, is to correct attitudi-
nal problems and misconduct, not to punish or penalize. Action taken should have a constructive effect
and motivate affected employees to improve their work habits, attitude, or behavior. To be effective, cor-
rective actions must be timely because results achieved through these means will diminish in proportion
to the time elapsed between the offense and the corrective action.
    5.1. Oral Admonishment. This action is appropriate for minor infractions of established standards
    of conduct and derelictions in duty performance. In a private discussion, the immediate or a higher
    level supervisor will inform the employee of the charges against him or her, including a warning as to
    the possible consequences of repetition. A summary of the interview will be recorded on computer
    generated AF Form 971, Supervisor's Employee Brief (as prescribed in Air Force Pamphlet (AFPam)
    36-106, Supervisors Records, 20 December 1993). It will be initialed by both parties. The employee's
    initials do not indicate agreement with the entry content, but only awareness of the entry. The notation
    shall be destroyed after six months if the desired improvement is evident. The employee will be noti-
    fied accordingly. Thereafter, no further reference will be made to the incident. Unless screened from
    the records earlier, documentation of an oral admonishment will be destroyed two years from its
    effective date.
    5.2. Letter of Warning.
       5.2.1. Issuance will be appropriate for major infractions of established rules of conduct, or
       repeated infractions of the same or a different nature. Letters of warning will include (see sample
       in Attachment 4, Letter of Warning):
           5.2.1.1. A brief but precise statement of the offenses.
           5.2.1.2. Reference to previous offenses, if appropriate, and corrective actions, if applicable.
           5.2.1.3. A statement of possible consequences of repeated action on the continuity of the
           employment contract.
           5.2.1.4. Information about the employee’s rights to reply to the letter under grievance proce-
           dures in USAFEI 36-1201 (see para 8.), and the temporary retention of the letter of warning, if
           sustained, in personnel records for a period of 2 years.
USAFEI36-702 11 AUGUST 2006                                                                               5


       5.2.2. Paragraph 7. outlines coordination requirements and procedural instructions to be observed
       in connection with the issuance and delivery of letters of warning, and documentation in the super-
       visor's and CPF records.

6. Disciplinary Actions. When the offense is of such a serious nature that retention of the employee
would adversely affect the discipline, efficiency, and morale of the employing activity and other employ-
ees, formal disciplinary action (separation) may be initiated. This also applies when corrective actions
taken under paragraph 5.2. fail to produce desired results. Disciplinary action may consist of separation
with ordinary or extraordinary notice, as warranted by the facts and circumstances of the individual case.
   6.1. Separation with Ordinary Notice.
       6.1.1. This action involves application of notice periods established in CTA II, Article 44, para-
       graph 1. It will be appropriate unless the prerequisites for serving extraordinary notice (6.2.) are
       met, and provided application is not precluded by host country law or collective agreement.
       6.1.2. Employees served ordinary notice, whose retention in their current position for the duration
       of the notice period is not feasible, may be detailed to another position in the same or different
       activity at the same locality to perform a type of work which can be expected of them (CTA II,
       Article 44, paragraph 2a).
   6.2. Separation with Extraordinary Notice.
       6.2.1. Dismissing an employee without observance of the notice periods listed in CTA II, Article
       44, will be appropriate and justified only if an “important reason” within the meaning of German
       labor law exists. This condition is met if facts prompting the dismissal are such that management
       cannot be expected to retain the employee for the duration of a normal notice period, or through
       the end of a time limited appointment, because such retention would be incompatible with the just
       interests of the employing activity or organization. CTA II, Article 45, requires that a determina-
       tion regarding the propriety of extraordinary notice is made after full consideration of all circum-
       stances of the case and weighing the just interests of both management and the employee.
       Examples of such "important reasons" are listed in Attachment 2, paragraph A2.2., Employee
       Actions that Normally Breach Standards of Conduct.
       6.2.2. Extraordinary notices must be procedurally correct and legally valid, and must be served
       within 2 weeks from the date the underlying facts are established and known by the management
       official authorized to decide on and serve the notice (CTA II, Article 45(3). As a rule, in this con-
       text, management official will mean the employee's immediate or higher level supervisor. If con-
       clusive facts supporting the dismissal are developed by investigative agencies, the 2-week time
       period will start when they are reported to either the installation commander (3.1.), the CPF, or an
       official in the supervisory chain of command of the employee's activity. German courts have con-
       sidered facts to be conclusively established, for example, when an employee was heard on the
       charges and pleaded guilty. Failure on the part of an Air Force investigative officer to promptly
       relay such information to the responsible management official pending completion of the final
       investigation report is at management's risk and could result in the two-week deadline being
       missed. On the other hand, courts have also ruled that an employer must be accorded the right to
       hear the employee on alleged or proven offenses or infractions as part of the investigative process
       prior to arriving at a decision. Such hearing must take place without undue delay, normally within
       a week's time. It will cause the 2-week period to start. The required hearing of the works council
6                                                                     USAFEI36-702 11 AUGUST 2006


       (paragraph 9.2.) must also be initiated and completed within the two-week period allowed for
       serving the extraordinary notice.
    6.3. Dismissal Notices.
       6.3.1. Principles and requirements to be observed when serving ordinary or extraordinary notices
       are detailed in Attachment 3. Sample notice letters are provided in Attachment 5 (Ordinary
       Notice), Attachment 6 (Extraordinary Notice), and Attachment 8 (Abandonment of Position).
       6.3.2. Notices will be issued in writing (see paragraph 3.2., 3.3. for signatory authority). If neces-
       sitated by special circumstances, for instance, to meet the two-week deadline discussed in 6.2., an
       extraordinary notice may be served orally, but will be confirmed in writing without delay.
       6.3.3. To leave no doubt about management's intent to terminate employment, all extraordinary
       notices will include precautionary ordinary notice unless this is precluded by special protective
       rights accorded the employee by law or CTA II.

7. Requirements and Procedures.
    7.1. Supervisors will obtain coordination from the servicing CPF on all letters of warning and separa-
    tion prior to delivery to the employee. This is to assure actions comply with governing requirements.
    The CPF review covers both merit and procedures. In addition, the CPF is responsible for obtaining
    works council coordination on the proposed action, when and as required (see paragraph 9.). The
    reviewing CPF staff member will coordinate on the record copy of the notice or warning letter that is
    eventually placed in the employee's official personnel folder (OPF), (7.4.). Oral admonishments need
    not be coordinated with the CPF, although it is recommended that the supervisor discuss the matter
    with a CPF representative before deciding to issue the admonishment.
    7.2. Letters of warning and notices of separation will be prepared in both English and German. If
    action affects a third-country citizen, the CPF will ensure the contents are clearly understood by the
    employee.
    7.3. Original letters of warning and separation notices should be served personally to the employee,
    who will be asked to acknowledge receipt on the record copy by date and signature. The employee's
    written acknowledgment does not indicate agreement with the content, but only receipt of the respec-
    tive letter. If receipt acknowledgment is refused, the supervisor will make an annotation on the record
    copy as to when, how, and by whom the letter or notice was delivered. This also applies if the
    employee is absent from work, cannot be reached at home, or delivery is by mail. If it is necessary to
    deliver a notice letter by mail to meet a deadline, a method should be used that provides proper docu-
    mentation.
    7.4. Supervisors will keep one copy of a letter of warning on file with the employee's AF Form 971.
    Record copies of letters of warning and separation notices reflecting coordination and receipt will be
    forwarded to the CPF, together with other pertinent and supporting documentation.
       7.4.1. Documentation of legally effective separation action will be retained in the employee's OPF
       as a permanent record.
       7.4.2. A letter of warning will be retained in the OPF for a period of two years from the date of
       issuance. For the purpose of suspense control, it will be input to Defense Civilian Personnel Data
       System (DCPDS). On expiration of the 2-year period, the letter of warning will be removed from
USAFEI36-702 11 AUGUST 2006                                                                                7


       personnel records and destroyed. Thereafter, it may not be referred to in support of other correc-
       tive or disciplinary action.

8. Appeals, Grievances, and Court Action.
   8.1. Notices of separation, as adverse actions, are appealable under the provisions of USAFEI
   36-1201. A statement of appeal rights will be included in such letters, and the employee will be
   advised as to whom the appeal must be presented.
   8.2. A letter of warning is not an adverse action as defined in USAFEI 36-1201. However, employees
   may file a grievance under provisions of that regulation if they believe the letter of warning is not war-
   ranted. A statement of grievance rights will be included in the letter to include information as to whom
   the grievance must be presented USAFEI36-1201, paragraph 6.2.1., second sentence.
   8.3. Employees have the right to challenge the propriety of letters of warning, as well as any adverse
   personnel action, by filing an appeal with a German labor court. Only the correct, fair, and careful
   handling of disciplinary problems at all levels of management will ensure such court cases will not
   reflect adversely on the image and general reputation of the United States Air Force as an employer.

9. Works Council Participation. The German Federal Personnel Representation Law (FPRL) as modi-
fied for application by the Sending States Forces and precedent setting judicature provide for participation
of works councils in the maintenance of order and discipline at an installation, and the execution of per-
sonnel and other actions discussed in this regulation, as follows:
   9.1. Works councils have a formal cooperation right in:
       9.1.1. The development and modification of general standards, rules, and regulations governing
       conduct of employees (FPRL, Article 75(3)15).
       9.1.2. Terminations of employment by ordinary notice (FPRL, Article 79(1)).
   9.2. Works Councils have the right to be heard by management:
       9.2.1. On terminations of employment by extraordinary notice (FPRL, Article 79(3)), whereby
       actions affecting works council members, youth and severely handicapped employee representa-
       tives, and, under certain conditions, alternate works council members require concurrence of the
       respective works council under FPRL, Article 47(1).
       9.2.2. When presenting grievances and complaints filed by employees directly with the works
       council, provided they appear to be justified (FPRL, Article 68(1)3).
   9.3. The formal cooperation or hearing process on issues discussed under 9.1., and 9.2. must be com-
   pleted prior to taking the action.

10. Forms Adopted. AF Form 825, Notification of Personnel Action (Non-U.S., Germany); AF Form
971, Supervisor's Employee Brief.

        A2.3.3.1. Positive aspects tending to lessen the corrective measure:
            A2.3.3.1.1. Situation involving possibility for misunderstandings, enticements or provoca-
            tions, culpabilities of others, and mitigating circumstances.

            reputation, past work contributions, past cooperativeness, and record of achievements.
     A2.3.4. Negative aspects tending to intensify the corrective measure:
        A2.3.4.1. Previous breaches of conduct involving similar or other acts; oral admonishments or
        warning letters, provided such corrective actions can still be referred to (paragraph 5.1., and
        7.4.2.).

  A2.3.5. Selection of most appropriate corrective or disciplinary measure after weighing factors such
  as:

                PRINCIPLES TO OBSERVE IN ISSUING SEPARATION LETTERS

A3.1. Principles.
     A3.1.1. The notice letter is the legal separation document. AF Form 825, Notification of Personnel
     Action (Non-U.S., Germany) (as prescribed in Air Force Manual (AFM) 36-1102, Base Level Person-
     nel Data System Civilian (PDS-C) User Manual, 1 September 1988)), subsequently issued is only an
     administrative confirmation of facts established in the notice letter.
     A3.1.2. After completion of required participation of the works council, a notice of separation is
     legally effective when it is served upon the employee. Thereafter, withdrawal is only possible on
     mutual consent.
     A3.1.3. Notice letters must be clear, brief, and specific as to date and reasons for termination of
     employment. Simple language is a must.
     A3.1.4. Notice letters will not be conditional, for example, hinge on some future action or determina-
     tion.
     A3.1.5. Notice letters must be written to fit the individual action. A patterned or form letter is to be
     avoided.
     A3.1.6. Unnecessary justification and explanation of reasons that led to the separation should be
     avoided. Moreover, notice letters should be free from extracts of instructions, and other information
     not immediately pertinent to the case.
     A3.1.7. Reference to previous admonishments or letters of warning will be limited to cases where
     such actions are relevant to and support the separation action.
     A3.1.8. All notice letters will contain a statement of employee's appeal rights under USAFE Instruc-
     tion (USAFEI) 36-1201, Grievances and Appeals NON-US Citizen Employees, 14 November 2002,
     with specific guidance as to where an appeal must be addressed.
     A3.1.9. The German translation of a notice letter must be understandable and clear as to the form and
     intent, since this version will constitute the legal basis if the validity of an action is subject to labor
     court.
USAFEI36-702 11 AUGUST 2006                                                                               13

FROM: (Organization/office symbol/address)


SUBJECT: Letter of Warning


1. On 9 February 2006, you were absent from work without leave for a full shift's duration. On 10 Febru-
ary 2006, you were given the opportunity to explain your absence and circumstances that caused it. Your
statement that you had overslept in the morning because of prolonged social activities the preceding
evening, and that due to a malfunction of your private car, you had no transportation to come to work later
during the day, is not an acceptable excuse. It is your responsibility to arrange your off-duty activities so
that you can report for work on time. Moreover, you should have been able to report for work later by
using available public transportation.
2. This is the third time you have been absent without leave (AWOL) or tardy within the past four weeks.
On 26 January 2006, you left your place of work without permission at 1500 after an argument with one
of your fellow-workers. On 16 December 2005, you reported for work 2 hours late and had no explana-
tion. On each of these occasions, you were orally admonished and reminded of existing rules and stan-
dards of conduct that govern your employment.
3. This is to warn you that any further repetition of violations of the type described above, or other disre-
gard on your part for obligations resulting from your employment contract, may be cause for termination
of your employment.
4. If you feel that this letter of warning is unwarranted, you may file a grievance under the procedures
established in USAFEI36-1201 within 15 calendar days from receipt. Original presentation of the griev-
ance may be oral or in writing. It must be addressed to (Name of appropriate higher level supervisor;
office designation and location). Mr./Ms. (Name of Human Resources Specialist), CPF, telephone
extension__________, will answer any questions you may have regarding your grievance rights.
5. In case you elect not to reply, this letter of warning will be retained in your personnel records for a
period of two years. The same applies if the validity of the letter of warning is sustained by final decision
in a grievance procedure.
