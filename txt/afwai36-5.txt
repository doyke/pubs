This instruction provides appropriated fund employees assigned to the Air Force Weather
Agency (AFWA), to include all geographically separated units (GSUs), with the policy
and procedures for claiming compensatory time off for travel. This instruction
implements policy outlined in HQ USAF/DPXC memorandum, dated 19 Aug 05 and
5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 550 (Pay Administration). Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with Air Force RIMS Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

Minor editorial changes made to reflect new office symbols in accordance with AFWA
reorganization. Added para on “modes of transportation” (para 4) and a para on “travel
involving two or more time zones” (para 5). Deleted the requirement for deduction of
meal times (para 4.2.). Atch 2 deleted.

1. General. Compensatory time off for travel may be earned by an employee for time
spent in a travel status away from the employee’s official duty station when such time is
not otherwise compensable.

1.1. Covered employees are appropriated fund civilians. Federal wage and executive
service employees are excluded.

1.2. Part-time employees cannot earn compensatory time for travel until they have been
in a duty/travel status for 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week. Part-time employees
would accrue non-overtime hours (regular pay hours) if duty/travel is less than 8 hours a
AFWAI 36-5, 1 OCTOBER 2008                                                                 2


day or 40 hours a week.

1.3. Travel must be for official work purposes and must be approved by employee’s
supervisor. If at all possible, schedule official travel during an employee’s regular tour of
duty. Only when it is not practical to do so, will employee be entitled to compensatory
time off for travel.

2. Creditable Travel. Time in a travel status includes:

2.1. Time spent traveling between the official duty station and a temporary duty station.

2.2. Time spent traveling between two temporary duty stations.

2.3. The “usual wait time” (e.g., waiting at an airport or train station prior to departure).
Supervisors determine what is creditable as “usual wait time.” An unusually long wait or
“extended wait time,” during which the employee is free to use the time for their own
purposes would not be compensable.

2.4. Time in a travel status ends when the employee arrives at the temporary duty
worksite or his or her lodging in the temporary duty station, wherever the employee
arrives first. Time in a travel status resumes when an employee departs from the
temporary duty worksite or his or her lodging in the temporary duty station, from
whichever the employee departs last. Travel time in connection with an employee's
permanent change of station (PCS) is not time in a travel status.

3. Commuting Time.

3.1. Time spent traveling outside of regular working hours between home and temporary
duty station, and/or a transportation terminal outside of employee’s official duty station is
creditable travel time. Normal home-to-work/work-to-home commuting time must be
deducted.

3.2. Travel to or from a transportation terminal within the employee’s official duty
station is considered commuting time and is not compensable travel time.

3.3. Travel between a worksite and a transportation terminal is creditable travel time if
travel is outside normal working hours—no commuting time offset applies. For example,
after completing his or her workday, an employee may travel directly from the regular
worksite to an airport to attend an out-of-town meeting the following morning. The travel
time between the regular worksite and the airport is creditable as time in a travel status.

3.4. If an employee travels directly between his or her home and a temporary duty station
outside the limits of the employee's official duty station (e.g., driving to and from a 3-day
conference), the agency must deduct the employee's normal home-to-work/work-to-home
commuting time from the creditable travel time. The agency must also deduct an
employee's normal commuting time from the creditable travel time if the employee is

required—outside of regular working hours—to travel between home and a transportation
terminal (e.g., an airport or train station) outside the limits of the employee's official duty
station.

4. Alternative Mode of Transportation. If an employee, who is permitted to use an
alternative mode of transportation from a mode that is offered, chooses to travel at a time,
or by a route, or by a mode other than that selected by the supervisor, then the supervisor
must determine the estimated amount of time in a travel status the employee would have
had if the employee had used the original mode of transportation or the originally offered
travel time or route of travel.

5. Travel Involving Two or More Time Zones. When an employee's travel involves
two or more time zones, the time zone from the point of first departure must be used to
determine how many hours the employee actually spent in a travel status for the purpose
of accruing compensatory time off for travel.

6. Procedures. For verification purposes, an employee’s supervisor must be provided
with a travel itinerary within five workdays after returning to work in order to request
credit for compensatory time off for travel.

6.1. The employee’s timesheet will be coded with “CB” for earned travel compensatory
time and “CF” for used travel compensatory time.

6.2. Supervisors must approve the use of accrued compensatory time for travel in
accordance with established leave policy. Compensatory time off for travel must be used
within 26 pay periods from the pay period in which it was earned. Compensatory time
off for travel can be earned/taken in 15-minute increments. If an employee fails to use
his or her compensatory time earned by the end of the 26th pay period after the pay
period during which it was earned due to an exigency of the service beyond the
employee's control, the director/commander, at his or her sole and exclusive discretion,
may extend the time limit for using such compensatory time off for travel up to an
additional 26 pay periods. Contact AFWA/DPC for guidance.

6.3. Monetary payment will not be given in lieu of compensatory time off for travel.
Failure to use time off within prescribed timeframe will result in its forfeiture.

       6.3.1. Compensatory time off for travel will not transfer with an employee to
       another agency or if an employee separates from Federal service—the time will
       be forfeited.
AFWAI 36-5, 1 OCTOBER 2008                                                             4


     6.3.2. If an employee with unused compensatory time for travel separates from
     Federal service or is placed in a leave without pay status to perform service in the
     military or because of an on-the-job injury (must be entitled to injury
     compensation) and later returns to work with the same agency, the employee must
     use all of the compensatory time off by the end of the pay year in which the
     employee returns to duty.
