                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), (also known as the Characterization
     Unit (CU) as referenced by AFMAN 15-129V1), and 1st Special Operations Support
     Squadron Weather Flight (1 SOSS/OSW), commonly referred to as the Weather Flight (or
     Exploitation Unit (EU) as outlined by AFMAN 15-129V2, but will be referred to as Weather
     Flight for common understanding of the general populace), are the official weather
     information agencies for and provide weather services to the 1st Special Operations Wing (1
     SOW) and other units assigned to Hurlburt Field, Florida. Basic concepts and procedures are
     outlined in Air Force and Air Force Special Operations Command directives. Weather
     support is directed by AFMAN 15-129 Air and Space Weather Operations which is split into
     two separate volumes; one for the Characterization Unit (CU) in volume 1 and one for the
     Exploitation Unit (EU) in volume 2. For common understanding, this directorate will be
     referenced simply as AFMAN 15-129. Additional information and details of support
     provided by the 26th Operational Weather Squadron are provided in a Memorandum of
     Agreement between the 1st Special Operations Support Squadron and the 26th Operational
     Weather Squadron. Please see Attachment 1 for a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms.
     1.1.2. This instruction establishes requirements and procedures for weather support, which
     must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
     requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and eliminates the need for written
     agreements between the weather unit and supported operations. It does not cover weather
     support procedures for emergency war operations or certain other special operations or
     procedures. These are covered in applicable plans/regulations. This publication supersedes
     Hurlburt Field Support Plan dated 25 Mar 2003.
     1.1.3. This document is UNCLASSIFIED and does not come within the scope of directives
     governing the protection of information affecting national security. Although it is
     unclassified, it is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force
     Privacy Act Program.
     1.1.4. OPSEC. Operational security has been considered in the development of this plan.
     The nature of operational support identified does not violate OPSEC.
1.2. Designators. All weather products disseminated by or for Hurlburt Field will use KHRT as
the ICAO location indicator. The WMO index number is 74777.
1.3. Weather Operations.
     1.3.1. Operational Weather Squadrons provide resource protection, Terminal Aerodrome
     Forecasts (TAFs), regional and operational-level weather products and information,
     meteorological watch (METWATCH), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and limited flight
     weather Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) support for Air Force and Army locations within
     designated geographic regions.

   1.3.2. The 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana provides regional and operational-level
   weather products and information to Air Force and Army units operating in the southeast
   CONUS. The Weather Flight at each Air Force and Army location will focus on providing
   tactical-level weather products and information needed for mission execution and provide
   weather products and information to the commander of deployed forces during wartime,
   contingency, and exercise operations.
   1.3.3. The Weather Flight Commander, 1 SOSS/OSW, is the designated Staff Weather
   Officer (SWO) to the 1st Special Operations Wing and will coordinate all weather support
   required by units assigned to Hurlburt Field.
1.4. Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to execute this
instruction and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various sources on which to
base weather operations and production.
1.5. Shortfalls and Limiting Factors. None.
1.6. Duty Priorities. All base weather station tasks cannot be accomplished simultaneously.
Therefore, duty priorities are established to ensure tasks are accomplished in order of relative
importance and publicized to avoid misunderstanding among supported agencies. Duty priorities
will ensure timely response to situations under normal conditions. However, the list will not
replace good judgment. The weather technician may deviate in the best interest of flight safety
and/or protection of personnel or property. The weather technician will use the following
priority list as a guide for accomplishing duties.
   1.6.1. Complete Emergency War Order (EWO) Tasking.
   1.6.2. Execute Base Weather Station Evacuation.
   1.6.3. Respond to Aircraft/Ground Emergencies.
   1.6.4. Respond to Pilot-to-Metro Service Contacts.
   1.6.5. Provide weather information for Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
   1.6.6. Augment AN/FMQ-19 Observations for Mandatory Elements.
   1.6.7. Provide eyes forward support to the 26th Operational Weather Squadron Barksdale
   AFB.
   1.6.8. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) Operations.
   1.6.9. Produce and disseminate Mission Execution Forecasts (MEFs).
   1.6.10. Relay Urgent (PIREPs) and Special AIREPs to OWS.
   1.6.11. Disseminate PIREPs/AIREPs.
   1.6.12. Perform MISSIONWATCH.
   1.6.13. Provide Flight Weather Briefings.
   1.6.14. Accomplish Weather Function Training.
   1.6.15. Accomplish Administrative Tasks and Other Duties. Note: When the airfield is
   closed, priorities paragraph 1.6.7 and paragraph 1.6.8 are reversed.

1.7. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The area of responsibility for products and services
provided by the Weather Flight is the terminal area, which is the area located within a 5 nautical
mile radius around the center of the Hurlburt airfield complex. The weather flight (WF) will also
MISSIONWATCH all areas and routes in which Hurlburt flying units are conducting operations.
1.8. Operating Hours and Contact Information.
     1.8.1. Staff services are available from 0730 to 1600, Monday through Friday, except federal
     holidays, Wing Goal Days, Family Days, or other directed down days.
     1.8.2. Weather technicians are available in the Base Weather Station (BWS) to provide all
     services 24-hours a day, Monday - Friday and on Saturday and Sunday when the airfield is
     open. A standby forecaster will be available and recalled by the 1 SOW Command Post, or
     as                     weather                      conditions                   dictate.
     1.8.3. The WF can be contacted at DSN 579-7423/6527/6198 or Commercially 850-884-
     7423/6527/6198.
1.9. Backup Weather Support. If weather operations at 26 OWS are interrupted (e.g., power
outage, natural disaster), the 26 OWS will contact the WF. The Hurlburt Terminal Aerodrome
Forecast (TAF), weather watch, weather warning, and weather advisory responsibility will be
transferred to 1 SOSS/OSW until such time 26 OWS is postured to resume operations.
Responsibility for other 26 OWS products (e.g., graphical products) will be transferred to other
agencies as necessary to continue weather information flow to Hurlburt customers.
1.10. Base Weather Station Evacuation. If the WF is required to evacuate the BWS, the
operations will relocate to the Alternate Operating Location (AOL), which is in building 90220
(Weather Warehouse located on the back side of the Education Office) until able to move back
into the primary location.
     1.10.1. The 26 OWS will assume the following duties until the WF resumes operations.
        1.10.1.1. Perform METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH for 1 SOW operations and
        issue all terminal and flying area weather warnings and advisories to the best of their
        ability. Since 26 OWS is limited to cloud-to-ground strike data from the National
        Lightning Detection Network, it does not have the capability to detect or observe other
        lightning strike occurrences (e.g., cloud-to-cloud lightning).
        1.10.1.2. Mission Execution Forecast. If the WF is unable to produce MEFs from the
        alternate site, the 26 OWS will produce and update the MEFs for the 1 SOW using their
        standard format. The MEFs will be posted on the 26 OWS website under the Unit
        Tailored Pages link or via fax or email.
        1.10.1.3. The 26 OWS will assume responsibility for all other flight weather MEFs for
        missions departing Hurlburt Field and conduct limited MISSIONWATCH for these
        flights.
     1.10.2. Upon arrival at the AOL, the WF will standup operations and notify Air Traffic
     Control (ATC), the command post, Eglin RAPCON, Airfield Management, 26 OWS, and all
     of the flying squadrons in 1 SOW that they have resumed operations at the new site.
     1.10.3. The weather technician will provide the following services from the alternate
     operations location.
HURLBURTFIELDI15-101 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            9


       1.10.3.1. Continue to issue and update MEFs (AFSOC Form 87, AFSOC Mission
       Weather Briefing, and electronic Weather Briefing Flimsy) if the capability exists. The
       MEF will be faxed or emailed to the flying squadrons.
       1.10.3.2. Provide METWATCH for Hurlburt Field from the alternate work center. An
       additional technician will be posted to a location that provides visibility of the airfield.
       This person may be co-located in the air traffic control tower if possible.
       1.10.3.3. Brief aircrews and MISSIONWATCH flights. Briefings will be conducted via
       phone or fax.
   1.10.4. PMSV radio support will not be available from the alternate operations location.
   However, the Eglin AFB WF’s PMSV frequency will be added to all Mission Execution
   Forecasts (MEF) and briefed to aircrew.
   1.10.5. Timeliness and accuracy of services provided from the alternate work center may
   suffer somewhat due to limited communications and use of backup equipment.
1.11. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is the primary weather data dissemination
system on Hurlburt Field. All required agencies will have the JET software loaded and running
at all times so they automatically receive weather updates as they occur. Examples of products
disseminated over JET are in Attachment 5. 1 SOW Command Post will also use the ReachPlus
Popup Alerts Client as a secondary dissemination to get watches, warning and advisories to the
base populace.
1.12. Release of Weather Information. Support to non-DoD agencies and the general public
will not be provided unless authorized by the Wing Public Affairs Office.

                                            Chapter 2

                             AIRFIELD SERVICES ELEMENT

2.1. Weather Observations.
   2.1.1. Automated Observations. The Weather Flight uses the FMQ-19 Automated Weather
   Observing Station System as its primary surface weather observation source. The FMQ-19 is
   a sophisticated set of weather instruments that measure pressure, precipitation, wind speed,
   wind direction, visibility, runway visual range, sky cover, cloud height, temperature, dew
   point and lightning. The FMQ-19 has three different operational modes. Normal,
   Augmented, and Backup.
      2.1.1.1. Automatic Mode. When the FMQ-19 is in Automatic Operational Mode, the
      system records, encodes and disseminates weather observations without human
      intervention.
      2.1.1.2. Supplemented Mode. Supplementing is a method of manually adding
      meteorological information to an automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of
      the AMOS to detect and/or report. The FMQ-19 will be placed in Supplemented
      Operational Mode during the following conditions:
          2.1.1.2.1. Tornadic activity, including funnel clouds and water spouts (2 hrs. prior to
          onset).
          2.1.1.2.2. Hail 3/4 inch or greater (2 hrs. prior to onset).
          2.1.1.2.3. Volcanic Ash (2 hrs. prior to onset).
          2.1.1.2.4. Ceiling height less than or equal to 5,000 ft. (during operational hours
          only).
          2.1.1.2.5. Visibility less than or equal to 5 statute miles (during operational hours
          only).
          2.1.1.2.6. Any weather condition that is considered operationally significant (e.g. has
          a significant mission impact or mission failure).
      2.1.1.3. Backup Mode. The FMQ-19 will be placed in Backup Operational Mode when
      there is a partial system failure, or determined that specific sensors are not representative
      with actual conditions.
      2.1.1.4. Limitations. Although the FMQ-19 is an advanced system, it does have
      limitations compared to human observed weather conditions. Some of the limitations of
      the system are its ability to determine prevailing visibility, cloud cover and ceilings. The
      FMQ-19 only sample cloud data directly above the sensor, and is a different type of cloud
      observation than the human observer’s celestial dome, or entire sky, observation. There
      are algorithms within the software suite which uses the sensed data to compute sky
      coverage. The visibility sensor samples a small part of the air in the vicinity of the sensor
      to determine visibility. The FMQ-19 will not be able to detect reduced visibilities away
      from the sensor, or sector visibility.
HURLBURTFIELDI15-101 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            11


   2.1.2. Manual Observations. The Weather Flight will manually observe weather observation
   elements when all or part of the FMQ-19 in not operational. The location of the weather
   observing site does not permit a 360degree unrestricted view of the weather and is further
   limited by the lack of visibility markers beyond 5 statute miles. Visibilities at night are
   limited due to the lack of distinguishable nighttime visibility references. Specific limitations
   are:
       2.1.2.1. Daytime:
           2.1.2.1.1. Azimuth 200 degrees through 230 degrees restricted to 1/8 SM due to
           Eason hangar.
           2.1.2.1.2. Azimuth 030 degrees through 070 degrees restricted to 5/8 SM due to high
           tree line.
           2.1.2.1.3. No daytime markers beyond 5 SM.
       2.1.2.2. Nighttime:
           2.1.2.2.1. No nighttime references beyond a 1/2 SM from azimuth 150 degrees
           through 350 degrees.
           2.1.2.2.2. No nighttime references beyond 1 SM from azimuth 360 degrees through
           090 degrees.
   2.1.3. Dissemination. Automated Observations are taken by the FMQ-19 Automated
   Weather Observing System, and disseminated locally and long-line via the JET system and
   identified by the heading "KHRT, (type of observation), and time (UTC)." During periods
   when the FMQ-19 or JET system is inoperative, observations will be relayed via telephone
   and/or hotlines in the following order: ATC, Eglin RAPCON, and the 1 SOW/CP. When
   received by telephone/hotline, these agencies will provide the caller with their initials and a
   read-back of the entire observation to ensure accurate reception of the information.
2.2. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). A Basic Weather Watch will be used when the FMQ-19 is
in Augment or Backup mode (see paragraph 2.1.1.2 and paragraph 2.1.1.3). Weather
personnel normally conduct a BWW from the base weather station (BWS). Due to other duties,
along with other restrictions such as a building design that does not allow a 360-degree view of
the runway complex, etc., weather personnel cannot monitor the weather continuously and
cannot be expected to detect and report all weather changes as they occur. In addition to taking
and disseminating required observations, the BWW observing program includes minimum
requirements to recheck weather conditions at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last
observation/recheck, to determine the need for a LOCAL or SPECI observation.
   2.2.1. When reliable source (ATC personnel, pilots, law enforcement, etc.) reports weather
   conditions different from the last report, weather personnel will recheck the weather and, if
   required, disseminate a new observation.
2.3. Cooperative Weather Watch. A Cooperative Weather Watch is the name given for the
cooperation between weather personnel and control tower operators in identifying significant
weather changes. The primary concern is the occurrence of previously unreported weather
conditions that could affect flight safety or could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other
local operations and resources. Due to the weather technician’s limited view of the horizon,
tower personnel will notify the weather technician of the occurrence of previously unreported
 12                                         HURLBURTFIELDI15-101 28 FEBRUARY 2013


weather conditions. These include prevailing visibility which meets special criteria as listed in
Attachment 2; tower prevailing visibilities less than 4 statute miles (6000 meters) when
different from surface prevailing visibility; sector visibilities which differ from prevailing
visibility, especially in the area where the weather technician’s view of the horizon is restricted;
beginning or ending of precipitation, thunderstorms, lightning, and any other significant weather.
Tower personnel will relay PIREP’s in accordance with paragraph 7.8.8. The assistance
provided by tower personnel will not interfere with their primary duties and does not reduce the
responsibility of weather personnel to identify changes in weather conditions. When reliable
sources (i.e., ATC, pilots, and security forces) report weather conditions different from the last
disseminated observation, the weather technician will reevaluate the weather conditions. If the
FMQ-19 is in Backup or Augment mode and based on reevaluation of the different weather
conditions reported and local policy, the technician will:
   2.3.1. Take and disseminate a SPECI or LOCAL observation if different conditions warrant
   immediate dissemination, (AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, paragraph
   2.17.2.1.).
   2.3.2. Include the report of the differing conditions in the next METAR, SPECI, or LOCAL
   observation if the different conditions alone do not warrant immediate dissemination,
   (AFMAN 15-111, paragraph 2.17.2.2.).
2.4. Eyes Forward.
   2.4.1. The WF integrates weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
   detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather
   picture and near-term trend forecast for the 26 OWS/WXA. Eyes forward yields meaningful
   meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the OWS and is an
   integral part of the METWATCH for Hurlburt Field.
   2.4.2. The WF will provide the "eyes forward" function by providing significant information
   to 26 OWS concerning local area weather patterns and un-forecasted changes. The WF will
   contact 26 OWS when:
       2.4.2.1. Severe weather signatures on radar displays or METSAT imagery are identified
       that      will    affect    the     Hurlburt     Field     installation    or   mission.
       2.4.2.2. Warning/advisory criteria are occurring or forecast to occur and 26 OWS has yet
       to issue the warning/advisory. The WF will also contact 26 OWS when warning/advisory
       criteria are forecast by 26 OWS and are not expected to occur. The WF will ensure 26
       OWS receives all severe weather reports in the area of concern (e.g., from National
       Weather Service, local news media, and unit/base personnel).
       2.4.2.2. When local weather phenomena are forecast to occur (next 30 minutes) and will
       affect 26 OWS and WF products (i.e., TAFs and MEFs). The WF will also contact 26
       OWS when significant forecast elements on 26 OWS products are not expected to occur.
       Communication is to help the 26 OWS technicians anticipate changes and subsequently
       adjust forecast products.
       2.4.2.3. When the FMQ-19 is no longer in Normal Operational Mode (Automatic) and
       requires human observations.

                             MISSION WEATHER ELEMENT

3.1. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   3.1.1. Weather technicians at 26 OWS will prepare and disseminate a TAF over JET at
   0900Z, 1700Z, and 0100Z and cover a 30-hour period. See Attachment 9 for code
   breakdown. When the airfield is scheduled to close, TAF issue time will be modified in
   accordance with Attachment 4.
   3.1.2. Specification and Amendment Criteria. The TAF Specification and Amendment
   criteria are listed in Attachment 4 and are specified IAW AFMAN 15-129, Air and Space
   Weather Operations-Processes and Procedures and mutually agreed upon criteria specific to
   the mission needs of customers at Hurlburt Field.
   3.1.3. Dissemination. The 26 OWS will disseminate the TAF over JET. If JET is
   inoperative, forecasts will be disseminated by phone to the command post and to the WF.
   The command post will notify any other agencies on an as-needed basis. The forecast is also
   available via the WF webpage whenever JET is operational.
3.2. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF).
   3.2.1. Weather Briefing Flimsy. The Weather Flight will use the Weather Briefing Flimsy
   as its primary means of producing a flight weather briefing for all scheduled flights that are
   within the local flying area, defined as the Florida Panhandle and southern Alabama. The
   Flimsy is in a spreadsheet format that outlines takeoff and landing data along with range zone
   forecasts.
   3.2.2. AFSOC Form 87. The Weather Flight will use the AFSOC Form 87 as a primary
   means of producing a flight weather briefing for all scheduled flights that are outside of the
   local flying area, or for missions that have unique needs that the Weather Briefing Flimsy
   does not cover. The AFSOC Form 87s will be pre-filled the day prior using scheduled flight
   data located in the C2 Database. The AFSOC Form 87 will be completed, faxed or digitally
   sent to an email address, and will have an electronic transmission time in the “briefing time”
   block. This time will be prefixed with an “E”. It is the aircrew’s responsibility to call the
   duty forecaster for a step brief to see if there are any changes. At this time an official brief
   time and forecaster’s initial will be given.
   3.2.3. Local/Verbal Briefing. If an aircrew is conducting local flying, they may request a
   “local” weather briefing which will be given face to face at the weather station or via phone.
   All Local/Verbal briefings will be documented on a Local Aircrew Briefing Log. The
   Local/Verbal Briefing may be in the same format as the Weather Briefing Flimsy described
   in paragraph 3.2.1
3.3. Mission Watch. The WF will conduct a continuous MISSIONWATCH of all routes and
flying areas used by Hurlburt flying units during the times they are using them. During
emergency situations or rapidly changing conditions, the WF will immediately notify the 1
SOW/CP to relay important weather information to airborne aircraft.

3.4. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). The WF will provide full service PMSV on the assigned
frequency of 335.45 MHz Aircrews are highly encouraged to relay pilot reports during PMSV
contacts. When the Hurlburt PMSV is inoperative, aircrews will be given the Eglin AFB PMSV
frequency of 342.2 MHz.
3.5. Space Weather Support. Space weather data and forecasts for Hurlburt customers are
available upon request. Information available includes space weather impacts on radio
frequencies and the Global Positioning System (GPS).
3.6. Toxic Corridors. IAW AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations, the WF will
provide the 1 SOCES/CEX with weather information so they can calculate toxic corridors for
chemical spills. The WF will not be responsible for producing toxic corridors.
3.7. Chemical Downwind Messages: The WF will provide Chemical Downwind Messages
(CDM) upon request for disaster response, chemical/nuclear attack, and exercise purposes.
Automated CDMs can also be found at the 26 OWS homepage. The "CDM" link located at the
bottom right of the page will provide both CDM and Effective Downwind Message (EDM) data
for a selected ICAO or site name.

4.1. Wing Staff Meeting. Upon request, the WF will present a weather briefing at the 1 SOW
Commander’s staff meeting. The content of the briefing is flexible but should include a current
satellite picture, a 5-day forecast for Hurlburt and any other graphics determined relevant by the
briefer.
4.2. Battle Staff. The WF will provide weather briefings to the Wing Battle Staff as necessary.
The format of the briefing will be tailored to the scenario driving the Battle Staff’s formation.
4.3. Mobility Concept Briefing. The WF will provide a briefing at all Mobility Concept
Briefings as necessary. The focus of this briefing will be on departure conditions, deployed area
conditions and climatology. As a minimum, the briefing will include forecast conditions at
Hurlburt Field for departure time, deployed area climatological conditions, and forecast
conditions for destination arrival time. Other topics will be briefed as required.
4.4. Frag-break Briefing. The WF will provide a briefing at the Frag-break meeting. Weather
will generally be limited to a 5-day forecast for Hurlburt Field with a focus on activity on the
airfield for maintenance prep of aircraft and logistics prep of cargo.
4.5. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). A WF representative will provide a local weather
effects briefing to all IRC classes. The briefing format is fixed. IRC schedulers will provide the
WF with a schedule of upcoming IRCs as early in the process as possible.
4.6. Climatology Support. Climatological data will be available upon request including data
for other locations. Requests should be made at least 1 business day in advance in order to allow
the WF to research and compile the data. Urgent requests will be compiled as soon as possible
and in accordance with WF duty priorities (See paragraph 1.6).
4.7. Air Traffic Control Training/Orientation. The WF will provide training and certification
for ATC personnel on METAR code, TAF code, and visibility determination.

                              METEOROLOGICAL WATCH

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. The 26 OWS and the WF will jointly monitor observed and forecast weather
   conditions and notify selected agencies when pre-established weather conditions occur or are
   expected to occur.
   5.1.2. Desired Lead Time. Advanced warning of threatening weather conditions allows
   local agencies to take specific actions prior to occurrence. The desired lead-time is the
   minimum amount of advanced notice an agency requires prior to the onset of a particular
   weather phenomenon.
   5.1.3. All weather watches, warnings, and advisories are issued IAW AFMAN 15-129.
   Warnings and advisories may be issued as forecast or observed. These watches warning and
   advisories are issued as Terminal (within 5nm of Hurlburt) with the exception of the
   Thunderstorms within 10 NM.
   5.1.4. The WF may issue or supersede a 26 OWS -issued weather warning only when
   imminent weather conditions pose a hazard to life or property and prior coordination with 26
   OWS is not practical or communications do not allow. The WF will be responsible for local
   dissemination and contact 26 OWS as soon as possible afterward so 26 OWS can assume
   responsibility/accountability.
5.2. Responsibilities. Detailed responsibilities of the 26 OWS and the WF are outlined in a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) Between 1st Special Operations Support Squadron and 26th
Operational Weather Squadron. This MOA is reviewed triennially and updated as needed.
5.2.1. The 26 OWS will:
       5.2.1.1. Perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for Hurlburt Field.
       5.2.1.2. Issue all watches, forecast weather warnings, and forecast weather advisories.
   5.2.2. WF will:
       5.2.2.1. Perform “eyes forward” function. Assist with METWATCH for the Hurlburt
       Field terminal area and advise the 26 OWS when hazardous conditions that could affect
       Hurlburt, or pose a hazard to life or property, are observed or expected to occur.
       5.2.2.2. Issue all observed weather advisories and the observed weather warning for
       lightning.
       5.2.2.3. Notify the 26 OWS when local mission-watch indicates a 26 OWS-issued watch,
       warning, or advisory is, or may become, unrepresentative of current or expected weather
       conditions.

Table 5.5., if the Automated Observation System is
operable.

5.6. Dissemination of Watches/Warnings/Advisories. All weather warnings, watches, and
advisories will be disseminated using JET. Telephone confirmation will be used to ensure the
Command Post, Airfield Management Operations, and the tower has received them. If the JET is
inoperative, warnings, watches, and advisories will be disseminated by phone to the same
agencies. The Command Post and Airfield Management Operations will disseminate
information to the agencies listed in Attachment 6.

5.7. Weather Warning/Watch/Advisory Text Format. The text of weather warnings,
watches, and advisories will contain the warning/watch/advisory number, the specific valid time
period (until further notice for observed products), and specific conditions expected. They will
be numbered consecutively with the number of the month, and the number of the warning. For
example, the first warning issued in March will be No. 3-1; the next is No. 3-2. A warning for
observed lightning is the only criterion that will be issued separately from other warning criteria.
More than one advisory may be in effect at the same time. The following additional
requirements apply to warnings issued for criteria other than observed lightning.
   5.7.1. Only one warning will be in effect at a time (other than observed lightning), and it will
   include all elements meeting warning criteria. The only exception to this rule will be a
   Tornado Warning. In the interest of safety, this warning will be issued as soon as possible
   and may be issued as a separate warning allowing for two warnings to be simultaneously
   valid.
   5.7.2. Warnings issued to add or delete a weather phenomenon (for example, adding hail
   greater than or equal to 1/2 inch to an existing warning for winds greater than 45 knots) will
   include the explanation “This warning upgrades/downgrades Weather Warning # (previous
   warning)”.
       5.7.2.1. UPGRADES. The new warning forecasts more severe weather.
       5.7.2.2. DOWNGRADES. The new warning forecasts less severe weather.
       5.7.2.3. EXTENDS. The valid period of a previously issued warning is extended.
   5.7.3. Warnings and watches issued to extend the valid time will not be re-issued or re-
   numbered. These will include the explanation “This is an extension of Weather Warning
   Number (current warning)”.
   5.7.4. When the weather technician believes that phenomena meeting warning, watch, or
   advisory criteria are no longer expected during the valid time, they will be canceled with the
   explanation “Weather Warning Number (current warning) is canceled”. See Attachment 5
   for dissemination formats.
5.8. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The purpose of SWAP is to ensure 26
OWS and the WF has sufficient personnel available to provide effective resource protection
during potential and/or actual severe weather events. SWAP may be implemented for any
warning criteria (Table 5.2) but will primarily be used for severe thunderstorm, high wind, and
tornado/waterspout events. SWAP may also be implemented in the event of unforeseen
circumstances (i.e. communications line or critical equipment failure). SWAP will be
implemented at the discretion of the 26 OWS in coordination with WF leadership and/or the
standby forecaster.
   5.8.1. WF Responsibilities. WF will perform the WF SWAP responsibilities as defined in
   AFMAN 15-129, AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, AFMAN 10-206,
   Operational Reporting and this instruction. More specifically, WF will accomplish the
   following procedures:
       5.8.1.1. Notification. 26 OWS will notify the WF if any of the criteria in Table 5.2 are
       occurring or are expected to occur within the next 4 hours. If WF personnel are not on
       duty, 26 OWS will contact the WF standby forecaster. Once the WF has been contacted,
HURLBURTFIELDI15-101 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                        21


     26 OWS and WF personnel will jointly evaluate the weather situation and decide whether
     to recall the Severe Weather Action Teams (SWATs) in accordance with local standard
     operating procedures. 26 OWS will provide backup SWAT support for the WF in the
     event of communications failure, equipment outages, personnel unavailability, etc.
        5.8.1.1.1. During normal staff duty hours (0730 to 1600, Monday through Friday,
        except federal holidays/authorized down days) the weather technician will implement
        SWAP by notifying the WF Commander, the Operations Manager, Wing Weather
        Officer (WWO) and/or the SWAT standby member in their office or cell. It is likely
        that the above personnel are present in the weather station and do not need to be
        recalled/activated.
        5.8.1.1.2. During nights, weekends and federal holidays/authorized down days the
        weather technician will implement SWAP by notifying the SWAT standby member,
        as indicated on the current duty schedule, by home phone or cell phone.
     5.8.1.2. Activation. The weather person on duty will discuss the meteorological
     situation, manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on
     standby) with the SWAT standby member (If the SWAT standby member is unavailable,
     coordinate with the WF Commander, Operations Manager, WWO, or WF assistant
     NCOIC). If deemed necessary the SWAT standby member will report to the weather
     station no later than 30 minutes after notification by the weather technician or as soon as
     possible. Once the SWAT standby member has arrived they will assist in evaluating the
     situation, determine the need to recall additional personnel, and execute the SWAP
     duties/responsibilities in Attachment 10.
     5.8.1.3. Upon arrival at the weather station the SWAT standby member, time permitting,
     will conduct a METCON with the 26 OWS Technician/Zone Supervisor.
     5.8.1.4. The FMQ-19 will be placed in Augment Mode if severe weather is expected to
     occur.
     5.8.1.5. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather actually occurs the following
     procedures will be executed if necessary.
        5.8.1.5.1. OPREP-3 BEELINE Reporting procedures. When damage to the
        installation or aircraft has occurred due to weather, provide the information in
        Attachment 13 to the 1st Special Operations Wing Command Post. OPREP-3 must
        be coordinated with 26 OWS to ensure appropriate information is included. A copy
        of OPREP-3 information will be sent to AFSOC/A3W.
        5.8.1.5.2. If the event is to be used as one of the semi-annual SWAP tests, complete a
        memorandum for record documenting the event. Also, contact 26 OWS flight
        leadership and provide them with the memorandum or an e-mail for their records.
     5.8.1.6. The WF personnel’s home and cell phone numbers will be reviewed monthly or
     when a change in personnel occurs to ensure the most current numbers are available for
     SWAP.

                                           Chapter 8

                                   TROPICAL WEATHER

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. Hurlburt Field is located in a hurricane threat zone. The hurricane season lasts from
   June through November; however, hurricanes have occurred at other times throughout the
   year. The intensity of the storm surge and high winds will depend on the strength of the
   hurricane/tropical storm. Serious threats that can occur with the hurricane are storm surge,
   tornados, extreme wind gusts, and flash flooding. These natural phenomena cause extensive
   damage and degrade the mission of the 1 SOW.
   8.1.2. The National Hurricane Operations Plan establishes policies, procedures and
   responsibilities for all locations on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.
   8.1.3. The WF will use the tropical cyclone forecasts issued by the National Hurricane
   Center (NHC). No deviation from the official forecast position, track, movement, maximum
   wind speed, or intensity trend is authorized. The WF is authorized to tailor the official
   tropical cyclone forecasts into a specific mission forecast product for the 1 SOW. Tailoring
   may include factors such as specific local effects such as terrain or relative position to the
   storm.
   8.1.4. The 26 OWS will perform METWATCH and serve as the liaison between the NHC
   and the WF.
       8.1.4.1. The 26 OWS will use the wind forecasts from the tropical cyclone bulletins and
       tailor the forecasts for terrain effects to issue TAFs and weather warnings, watches, and
       advisories. 26 OWS will produce a TC-TAP when Hurlburt Field is expected to receive
       sustained winds > 35-knots during the next 96 hours as a result of a tropical cyclone.
       8.1.4.2. The WF will translate the official tropical cyclone forecast and OWS forecasts,
       to include TC-TAP when available, into a specific mission forecast for Hurlburt units.
8.2. Hurricane Categories. The extent of damage expected with a tropical cyclone is
dependent upon the strength or wind speed. Hurlburt Field uses the Saffir/Simpson Hurricane
Scale to classify hurricanes. The Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Scale is a 1-5 rating based on the
hurricane's present intensity. This is used to give an estimate of the potential property damage
and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining
factor in the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental
shelf in the landfall region. Note that a “major” hurricane is one that is classified as category
three or higher.

Table 8.1. Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Scale.
                                         Category One
Winds 74-95 mph (64-82 kts). Storm surge generally 4-5 ft above normal. No real damage to
building structures. Damage primarily to unanchored mobile homes, shrubbery, and trees. Some
damage to poorly constructed signs.
HURLBURTFIELDI15-101 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                           27


                                         Category Two
Winds 96-110 mph (83-95 kts). Storm surge generally 6-8 feet above normal. Some roofing
material, door, and window damage of buildings. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees
with some trees blown down. Considerable damage to mobile homes, poorly constructed signs,
and piers. Coastal and low-lying escape routes flood 2-4 hours before arrival of the hurricane
center. Small craft in unprotected anchorages break moorings.
                                        Category Three
Winds 111-130 mph (96-113 kts). Storm surge generally 9-12 ft above normal. Some structural
damage to small residences and utility buildings with a minor amount of curtain wall failures.
Damage to shrubbery and trees with foliage blown off trees and large trees blown down. Mobile
homes and poorly constructed signs are destroyed. Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising
water 3-5 hours before arrival of the center of the hurricane. Flooding near the coast destroys
smaller structures with larger structures damaged by battering from floating debris. Terrain
continuously lower than 5 ft above mean sea level may be flooded inland 8 miles (13 km) or
more. Evacuation of low-lying residences with several blocks of the shoreline may be required.
                                         Category Four
Winds 131-155 mph (114-135 kts). Storm surge generally 13-18 ft above normal. More
extensive curtain wall failures with some complete roof structure failures on small residences.
Shrubs, trees, and all signs are blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Extensive
damage to doors and windows. Low-lying escape routes may be cut by rising water 3-5 hours
before arrival of the center of the hurricane. Major damage to lower floors of structures near the
shore. Terrain lower than 10 ft above sea level may be flooded requiring massive evacuation of
residential areas as far inland as 6 miles (10 km).
                                         Category Five
Winds greater than 155 mph (135 kts). Storm surge generally greater than 18 ft above normal.
Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Some complete building
failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. All shrubs, trees, and signs blown
down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Severe and extensive window and door damage.
Low-lying escape routes are cut by rising water 3-5 hours before arrival of the center of the
hurricane. Major damage to lower floors of all structures located less than 15 ft above sea level
and within 500 yards of the shoreline. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground
within 5-10 miles (8-16 km) of the shoreline may be required.

8.3. Hurricane Conditions (HURCON)/Response Phases. The prerequisite for any
preparatory and survival situation is a positive means of relaying warning or disaster information
to organizations and assigned personnel. HURCON/Response Phases is the tool Hurlburt Field
uses to ensure pre-disaster information is passed. These conditions/phases give sufficient
preparation time to safeguard personnel, aircraft, equipment, and facilities. HURCON/Response
Phases are determined by the 1 SOW/CC or a designated representative and disseminated
throughout the base by all available means.

   one is currently being reported).
HURLBURTFIELDI15-101 28 FEBRUARY 2013                                                          37


   A2.5.2. Ends (15 minutes after last occurrence of thunder).
A2.6. Precipitation. (AFMAN 15-111).
   A2.6.1. Hail begins or ends. (AFMAN 15-111).
   A2.6.2. Freezing precipitation begins, ends, or changes in intensity. (AFMAN 15-111).
   A2.6.3. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends. Note that, except for freezing rain,
   freezing drizzle, hail, and ice pellets, a SPECI is not required for changes in type or the
   beginning or ending of one type while another is in progress. (AFMAN 15-111).
A2.7. Squall. A strong wind characterized by a sudden onset in which the wind speed increases
at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots for at least one minute. A SPECI is not required to
report a squall if one is currently in progress. (AFMAN 15-111).
A2.8. Wind Shift. The wind direction changes by 45 degrees or more in less than 15 minutes
with sustained winds of 10 knots or more throughout the wind shift. (AFMAN 15-111).
A2.9. Runway Visual Range (RVR).
   A2.9.1. Visibility conditions for reporting RVR are first observed (i.e. < RVR 6000 ft or
   prevailing visibility < 1 SM), and when the conditions no longer exist. (AFMAN 15-111).
   A2.9.2. RVR for the active runway is observed to decrease to less than or, if below, increase
   to equal or exceed:
   A2.9.3. 6000 feet (AFMAN 15-111 and DOD FLIP).
   A2.9.4. 5000 feet (AFMAN 15-111 and DOD FLIP).
   A2.9.5. 4000 feet (DOD FLIP).
   A2.9.6. 2400 feet (AFMAN 15-111)
   A2.9.7. RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for the runway in use, and when it
   is first determined that the RVRNO report is no longer applicable, provided conditions for
   reporting RVR exist.
   A2.9.8. Reporting RVR values: When runway 18 is active the RVR value from runway 36
   will be evaluated at the time of SPECI/METAR observations and carried as a local remark
   whenever the prevailing visibility is equal to or less than 1 SM or the RVR reading is
   less than 6000 ft. The remarks will appear as RVR36/xxxx (xxxx being the value in feet).
   A SPECI will not be initiated based on RVR36 values unless runway 36 is the active runway.
   Note: This information is provided for ATC to authorize aircraft to land using the inactive
   runway if the RVR value is greater than or equal to 2400 ft (airfield minimum) and the
   aircraft commander so desires when the reported prevailing visibility and ceiling are below
   airfield minimums.
A2.10. Miscellaneous.
   A2.10.1. Volcanic Ash. When first observed. (AFMAN 15-111).
   A2.10.2. Any other meteorological situation which, in the opinion of the technician, is

             WEATHER WARNING /WATCH NOTIFICATION DIAGRAM

A6.1. The JET is the primary method of disseminating weather advisories, warnings and
watches to key installation agencies.
A6.2. When the JET is inoperable notifications from weather will be done via telephone
according to the attached BACK-UP diagram.
A6.3. Upon receipt, the 1 SOW/CP, 1 SOSS/OSAB, 1 SOMSG/SFS, 1 SOW/MOCC, and 1
SOFSS/CC, will notify all agencies that are listed in the attached dissemination diagrams.
   A6.3.1. The PRIMARY method of disseminating weather advisories, warnings and watches
   from the 1 SOW/CP to installation users is through the use of computer pop-up’s with the
   ReachPlus Popup Alters Client. A select few users are also notified via radio. The
   installation LAN protocol, for all NIPRNET (unclassified work station) users is configured
   so that pop-up messages transmitted by the CP will be received by all (installation and host)
   computer users immediately, within 3 minutes of transmission. Users who do not
   immediately receive pop-ups must contact their respective CSA’s, and if necessary submit a
   work order (ticket), to correct the deficiency.
   A6.3.2. The BACK-UP method of disseminating weather advisories, warnings and watches,
   when the pop-up system is down or major computer outages are present, will be via
   phone/conference calls, radio, Giant Voice, etc. as detailed in the back-up dissemination tree.
A6.4. Organizations will establish their own PRIMARY and BACK-UP checklists, as required,
to ensure all other internal and subordinate agencies/units are notified as required of advisories
and warnings. Forward a copy of unit established checklists, flowcharts, or plans (and changes
as they occur) to 1 SOSS/OSW.

                  RESOURCE PROTECTION NOTIFICATION CHAIN

A11.1. Resource Protection Notification Chain. Due to limited staffing and the time-critical
nature of this information, 26 OWS personnel cannot individually notify every agency requiring
weather watches, warnings, and advisories; hence, the application of a notification chain that
exploits installation command and communications channels. Procedures developed to this end
ensure weather personnel do not spend more time communicating than monitoring weather
conditions. All units receiving these weather products must be involved in a continuous program
of evaluation and improvement of the weather dissemination system, including inter-unit
dissemination. Agencies must make certain that weather dissemination procedures ensure those
needing information receive it. Individual commanders of units in need of weather information
are responsible for having their units listed in the notification chain that follows.
