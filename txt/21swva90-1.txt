                         Inspector General Complaint System
1. The Air Force has a responsive complaint system. You can get help quickly and fairly when
you ask a question. You can make your complaint at any level and you donâ€™t have to worry about
being intimidated when you ask for help. No one may take an action against you just because
you contacted the IG. If you think an adverse action has been taken against you because you
contacted the IG, tell the Inspector General or a member of the Inspector General staff.

2. The Inspector General complaint program also includes Fraud, Waste, & Abuse, and is
described in AFI 90-301. The instruction tells you how to submit a complaint, and with whom
you should speak. You may go to the Inspector General at any level, but experience has shown
that complaints can best be solved by commanders and supervisors. For this reason, you are
encouraged to discuss your problems with your supervisor or your commander.
