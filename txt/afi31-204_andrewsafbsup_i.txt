This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-2, Law Enforcement. It
assigns responsibilities and establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air
Force installations in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas (OCONUS) areas.
This includes, but is not limited to, granting, suspending, or revoking the privilege to operate a
privately owned vehicle (POV); registration of POVs; administration of vehicle registration and
driver performance records; driver improvement programs; police traffic supervision; and off-
installation traffic activities.

This interim change eliminates the requirement for privately owed vehicles to be registered with
the Air Force or other DoD agency to be operated on an Air Force installation. The IC re-titles
Chapter 3 from “Motor Vehicle Registration” to “Privately Owned Vehicle Operation
Requirements.” A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.

Chapter 3, REPLACED. This chapter has been substantially revised and must be completely
reviewed.

                                  DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
   2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a
   privilege granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must
   comply with the laws and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on
   the installation. Consequently, everyone operatin
      2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
      2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license
      and/or AF Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card,
      supported by a DD Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine
      acceptable identification media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each
      installation commander must determine if international drivers licenses are recognized
      and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdiction, and if so, will their use be authorized on
      the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor use of
      international drivers licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
      assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders should assimilate
      local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
      2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of
      motor vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety
      inspection, or other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement.
      Note: In some instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is
      registered may require, as a condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state
      or jurisdiction, a safety or other inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another
      state or jurisdiction. Though not enforceable (in another state), failure to comply may
      invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/operator in a precarious legal
      position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to comply with their "home
      state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state requirements.
      Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/or
      registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
      2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the
      installation commander.
      2.1.1.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Personnel operating POVs on Andrews AFB will
      have a current state driver's license or permit, international driver’s license, valid vehicle
      registration, and current proof of insurance in their possession at all time. Vehicle drivers
      not in possession of these required items will not operate motor vehicles on Andrews
      AFB. If a vehicle driver is detained on base due to a violation of this section, it will be
      their responsibility to correct the problem before operating the vehicle on base. The
      vehicle must be parked in an area where it does not interfere with traffic flow and
      removed as soon as possible. Abandoned vehicle procedures will be initiated for vehicles
      left for 72 hours without registration. The vehicle will be towed immediately if it causes
10                                AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010


        traffic/parking problems. If the vehicle registration is expired for more than 3 months it
        may be towed.
        2.1.1.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Personnel will have in their possession a current
        state driver's license and an AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator
        Identification Card, when operating all government vehicles. Also, an AF Form 483,
        Certificate of Competency, is required when operating vehicles on the flight line.
        2.1.1.7. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Rental vehicles used for official business by
        military or DoD personnel will be allowed to proceed through installation gates in the
        same manner as marked government vehicles. The driver must show proof of rental
        contract and must have a copy of their TDY travel orders.
        2.1.1.8. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Personnel operating a two-wheeled motor vehicle
        will have a current motor vehicle driver's license, motorcycle endorsement, or moped
        operator's permit, as applicable by their licensing state, this card will be verified by the
        entry controller.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
     2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the
     installation commander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor
     vehicles:
        2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off
        base as determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
        2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command
        instructions, and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop,
        inspection, search, and impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry
        gates and in Air Force restricted areas.
        2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted
        areas) of POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to
        enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
     2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
     installation commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and
     impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
     appropriate legal review. Note: A theater commander or those commanding unified forces
     may direct policy covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
     must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential
tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to
accepting installation driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained,
apprehended, or cited for any impaired driving offense committed while driving or in physical
control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force installation.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment
of their POV if their POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with
traffic operations; 3) Creates a safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                23 FEBRUARY 2010                                       11


unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, controlled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned.
Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or contractor for the cost of towing,
storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their motor vehicle because of a
situation described above.
   2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction,
   the definitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to
   enforcement action under paragraph 2.4 Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and
   definitions into the local installation traffic code and make them known to the general public.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation commanders may suspend
or revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and
unrelated to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement
to this instruction. Make these known to the general public.
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
       2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or
       when lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also
       suspend or revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation
       parking standards, or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in
       nature. Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation policy for non-
       moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
       installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register; unauthorized
       modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make these
       standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
       known to the general public.
       2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw
       anyone's authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the
       installation.
       2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV
       driving privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves
       active duty military personnel, their family members, retired members of the military
       service, and DoD civilian personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location
       of an intoxicated driving incident. Installation commanders can only suspend privileges
       of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents occurring on the installation or in the areas
       subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a review of available evidence as
       specified in paragraph 2.6, suspend driver’s privileges pending resolution of the
       intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
           2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine
           blood alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other
           drugs.

            2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood
            alcohol by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a
            suspension for a BAC or BrAC level below 0.10.
            2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an
            intoxicated driving incident occurred.
        2.5.1.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) All reserve and guard members apprehended for
        alcohol related driving offenses on weekends contiguous with their active duty orders,
        even though the orders may be expired, will be issued a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces
        Traffic Ticket. All reserve and guard members not on active duty orders will be charged
        via the DD Form 1805 IAW Maryland Vehicle Law. Civilians will be charged via DD
        Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice, with DUI and/or DWI, IAW
        Maryland Vehicle Law. All active duty personnel will be issued a DD Form 1408 when
        apprehended for a DUI/DWI.
        2.5.1.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) The installation commander has authorized unit
        commanders to suspend driving privileges of personnel assigned to their units for traffic
        violations for a period not to exceed 30 days.
        2.5.1.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Vehicle operators cited for illegal parking in a
        designated handicapped space or zone will be issued the appropriate citation and lose
        their installation driving privileges for a period of 30 days from receipt of the driving
        privilege revocation letter for the second offense. Violators will lose installation driving
        privileges for a period of 6 months from receipt of the driving privilege revocation letter
        for a third offense.
     2.5.2. Revocation.
        2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a
        period of not less than one year in the following circumstances:
            2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit

      2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and
      driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when
      receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
          2.5.2.2.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) All personnel assigned to Andrews AFB are
          required to out-process through VMPF and Reports and Analysis. Security Forces
          Management Information System (SFMIS) is then updated and driving records are
          forwarded to gaining installation. Units not utilizing SFMIS, will be sent a hard copy
          of the individuals orders and driving record, to include dependents, via certified mail.
          2.5.2.2.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Air Force installation commanders will honor
          revocations issued by other installation commanders regardless of service component
          affiliation. Information is routed through SFMIS to Reports and Analysis, who in
          turn will update the system. Copies will be sent certified mail if SFMIS is
          unavailable.
      2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the
      revocation period from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during
      which full driving privileges were restored pending resolution of charges.
      2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively
      or concurrently.
      2.5.2.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Individuals arrested for operating a motor vehicle
      while under the influence (DWI/DUI) by civilian law enforcement authorities will be
      transported to the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC)/Bldg. 1845, by their first
      sergeant or commander, within 12 hours from release from civil custody. Once 316
      SFS/S5AR has the driving privilege revocation letter ready to be served to the individual,
      the individual and first sergeant or commander will report to 316 SFS/S5AR.
          2.5.2.5.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Unless accompanied by dependents, the base
          vehicle registration, DD Form 2220, DOD Registered Vehicle Decal, AF Form

     2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that
     person in writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate
     this notice with the base legal office.
     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3 and 2.5.2.1, do not suspend or revoke a
     person's driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered
     an administrative hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or
     revocation takes effect once making or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual
     circumstances should you make verbal notifications. Unless an application for a hearing is
     made within the prescribed period, suspension or revocation takes place on the prescribed
     date and time. Installation commanders determine the time period for staying a suspension
     or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hearing. For offenses
     outlined in para 2.5.1.3 and 2.5.2.1, an installation commander will authorize an immediate
     preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
     statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete
     chemical testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
        2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as
        soon as possible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
            2.7.2.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) The installation commander has approved the
            utilization of a pre-signed suspension/revocation letter, signed by the 316 MSG/CC.
            This letter along with all supporting documentation will be forwarded to the 316
            MSG/CC for final assembly of evidence.
        2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary
        suspension for intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-
        installation, non-DoD affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary
        suspension for intoxicated driving either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the
        person is employed on the installation, send the notice to their commander or reasonable
        equivalent.
        2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification
        for intoxicated driving:
            2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph
            2.5.2 of this AFI.
            2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation
            or resolution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or
            designee).
            2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be
            represented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel.
            Commanders determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel
            requests.
            2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative

          letter to the address shown in the letter.
          2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is
          determined by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated
          driving remains in effect until the installation commander makes a final decision.
          However, if no decision is made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or
          revocation, restore full driving privileges until the accused is notified of the final
          hearing results.
   2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1)
   The law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or
   was in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other
   drugs; 2) The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3)
   The person was asked to submit to a test for alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or
   urine and was informed of the consequences for refusing to take or complete such a test; 4)
   The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath, or urine; failed to complete the
   test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of allowed blood alcohol
   content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation apprehension or in
   violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing methods used
   were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
      2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1 for intoxicated driving, the
      revocation is mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
          2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the
          effective date of the revocation.
          2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension
          letter, or send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written
          notice, or the showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
          2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously
          granted. Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration
          of all or partial driving privileges.
   2.7.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) DD Form 1408: If an Air Force member or a member of
   one of the other services assigned to Andrews AFB, wishes to request an administrative
   hearing, they will submit a written request within 10 days of receiving the citation to 316
   SFS/S5AR. The 316 MSG Deputy Commander (316 MSG/CD) will chair administrative
   hearings.
   2.7.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) DD Form 1805: Recipients of DD Form 1805 will be
   referred to the US Magistrate.
2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle
   incident to Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
16                                 AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010


     2.8.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) A copy of all violation reports on military and DoD
     civilian employees apprehended for intoxicated (drug or alcohol) driving are forwarded to the
     Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control.
2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding
determines lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not
amounting to intoxicated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
     2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
     2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in
     violation of the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
     2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another
     preliminary suspension or revocation.
     2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend
     or revoke driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
     2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s
     training program.
2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
     2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication,
     installation commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose
     authority to drive on military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service
     authority. Ensure the individual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host
     nation, etc.) are still valid.
     2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or
     reinstatement to any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation
     by a state, federal, or host nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and
     for on base privileges only), coordinate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This
     option applies only to installations exercising exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline
     procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges in the base supplement to this AFI
     or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in which there is extreme
     hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the granting of
     limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is the
     more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential
     liability inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or
     other license is allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative
     separation may be appropriate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone
     ineffective and incapable of performing their military duties, and a change in duty position is
     not reasonable.
2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is
     discovered driving in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or
     installation commander may also take administrative or disciplinary action.
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I               23 FEBRUARY 2010                                      17


   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the
   offender completes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or
   other program deemed necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.
2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
   2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal
   suspension and revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should
   honor the reciprocal agreements with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On
   receipt of written notice, the receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if
   the violations or incidents occurred within its own jurisdiction.
      2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal
      military reciprocity:
          2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically
          terminate the individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only
          comparable military administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point
          assessment) for those off-base violations reported by local, state, or host nation
          authorities.
          2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license
          is issued when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one
          year or more only) following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or
          for refusal to submit to a BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the
          revocation and the BAC/BrAC level.
   2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the
   host nation concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation
   commanders. When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an
   agreement concerning reciprocity exists, the installation commander must have prior
   authorization to negotiate and conclude such an international agreement in accordance with
   applicable directives.

                            TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision.
   A strong traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision,
   and control of motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws
   and regulations together with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle
   accidents are also important. Finally, every successful program must include meaningful
   interaction, education, and communication with the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest
   and most efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic
   planning is circulation control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other
   concerned staff agencies develop the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway
   engineering representatives from adjacent civilian communities to ensure the installation plan
   is compatible with plans developed by the state and surrounding local communities. As a
   minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include
      measures for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated
      traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic
      engineer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan.
      This is normally a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position
      should have an infrastructure planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow
   patterns, and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated
   traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor
   routes, locations for traffic control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or
   enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency
   (MTMCTEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering
   problems. MTMCTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.

        4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
     4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance
     with AFR 75-88, Highways for National Defense.
     4.1.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) In reference to traffic circulation, the Chief, Security
     Forces will:
        4.1.6.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Provide staff assistance and guidance in matters
        pertaining to traffic control.
            4.1.6.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Coordinate                with appropriate agencies
            sponsoring major functions on traffic control requirements. Sponsors will provide
            parking detail and entry control assistance as required.
            4.1.6.1.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Assign personnel to perform traffic control
            duties at traffic control points when needed during normal and emergency operations.
            4.1.6.1.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Ensure traffic control points (TCP) are
            manned when deemed appropriate.
            4.1.6.1.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) The chief of safety will conduct investigations
            and collect data on accidents IAW safety directives.
4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
     4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles
     on the installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent
     military authority is empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements.
     Installation traffic codes must contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree
     possible, conform to the code of the state or host nation in which the installation is located.
     The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code and for ensuring it meets all local and
     legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the following:
     4.2.1. (ANDREWSAFB) The 316 SFS, under the supervision of the Chief of Security
     Forces (CSF) is responsible for the enforcement of all traffic laws and instructions on this

     when driving motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles
     powered by a motorcycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6 for information concerning
     off-road vehicle use. Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance
     concerning the legal definition, operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized
     bicycles, and other such devices on installation roadways. Such guidelines will be
     modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or the safe and orderly flow
     of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing safety
     requirements.
        4.2.3.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Operators and passengers of two- and three-

            4.2.3.2.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) The number of people riding in a vehicle will
            be restricted to the designed seating capacity.
        4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is
        prohibited while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of
        hearing protection when conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when
        driving in noise hazard areas. This restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by
        motorcycle operators and their passengers.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation
     driving privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state
     traffic codes applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that
     state’s criminal offense code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United
     States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts
        the vehicular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not
        considered criminal offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these
        laws applicable to military installations having concurrent or exclusive federal
        jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to installation commanders to establish additional
        vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regulations for their installations. Those found
        guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on installations under provisions of
        DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or imprisonment for not more
        than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you cannot assimilate
        traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in a
        prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
            4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate
            violations of traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally,
            this applies to installations under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
        4.2.5.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Rules of the road. The traffic laws of the State of
        Maryland are formally adopted as the traffic laws governing Andrews AFB MD, except
        when they conflict with existing federal laws, DOD instructions, Air Force District of
        Washington (AFDW) instructions, AFI 31-204, this instruction, or directives of the 316
        WG/CC.
     4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee
     determines if, when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas,
     the operation of off-road vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict
     requirements concerning age, safety training, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-
     street" safety practices such as reflective vests, gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not
     apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity. However, ensure full compliance
     with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary, develop additional
     procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
     supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to
     designating any off-road vehicle use area.
4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                23 FEBRUARY 2010                                      25


   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement should emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers.
   You can reach these goals by developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National
      Highway Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic
      Control Devices for Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with
      drivers, and act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a
      defective vehicle in operation.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with
      suspended or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a
      citation, or warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the
      influence of alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection
      techniques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs
      prevents their safe operation of a motor vehicle.
4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and
enforcement programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police
   training and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the
   same brand and model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible,
   attend the same or similar certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet
      training and certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the
      installation is located. Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and
      prerequisites for attending by contacting the state agency responsible for police traffic
      radar training. Notwithstanding the above information, the CSP may establish other local
      training and certification programs for operators of speed-measuring devices. If
      exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and training standards are
      admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil authorities.
      This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts
26                                AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                  23 FEBRUARY 2010


        used to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge
        advocate and attorney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
            4.4.2.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Laser/Radar operators will complete 16 hours
            of practical use with a certified instructor before certification. The operator is
            responsible for tracking his/her own hours. Upon completion of all phases of training,
            the applicable 3PO series of STS will be annotated to indicate completion of all
            phases of instruction. At this point, Security Forces will send all trainee information
            to the manufacturer who will issue a certificate and competency card.
        4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's
        training program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar
        certification courses.
        4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the
        effectiveness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-
        measurement radar. On successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
            4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths,
            and injuries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement
            policy and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s
            major components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar
            instrument(s).
            4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and
            courtroom testimony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
     4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required
     by the state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification
     and training standards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit
     commanders when personnel PCS.
     4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
        4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
        4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-
        measuring devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the
        International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.
4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
     4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
        4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
        4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the
        installation commander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                23 FEBRUARY 2010                                        27


       property damage; however, the installation commander may establish different damage
       amounts for each category.
   4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel
   according to local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident
report form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.
4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident
   to the security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries
   to military personnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines
   what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop
   a local notification matrix or other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate
   base and civilian agencies. Develop and publish these notification procedures locally.
       4.6.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Stop the vehicle(s) as close as possible to the point
       of impact without obstructing traffic more than necessary.
       4.6.1.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Do not move the vehicle until the investigating SF
       member gives permission.
   4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident
   information. Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible,
   obtain copies of major accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
   4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
       4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if
       minor vehicle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may
       delegate this authority to on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy
       in this area locally.
          4.6.3.6.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) For minor accidents, (non-injury, minor
          functional vehicle damage) vehicle operators have 72-hours from time of occurrence
          to report it to Security Forces Control Center. However, it is highly advisable to
          report vehicle accidents at the time of occurrence to meet personal insurance claim
          requirements.
   4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police
   within 72 hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information
   should include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit
28                                AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                  23 FEBRUARY 2010


     (or address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license
     number(s). You should also include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances
     behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is any accident in which there are no
     fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount established by the installation
     commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving a fatality, injury, or
     property damage above the amount established by the installation commander. The
     installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
     property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident
     investigative techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident
     occurred.
        4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor
        vehicle accident:
            4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
            4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is
            sought
            4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes,
            compression, or any other visible damage to the body.
        4.6.4.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) A major accident is any accident resulting in an
        injury or death, damage to private or government property, vehicle damage (other than
        the involved vehicles) exceeding $10,000, or incapacitation of the vehicle(s).
     4.6.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Accident Reports. Vehicle accident reports, traffic
     citations, and written statements given in connection with vehicle accidents, become official
     Air Force records. Any request for such reports by civil agencies or private parties, such as
     insurance companies, claim adjusters, etc., will be referred to the 316 SFS/S5AR. In
     accordance with AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey For Air Force Property, Vehicle
     Control Officer’s will investigate the accident and file a report of survey as required within
     30 days of the accident.
     4.6.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) When a GOV is involved in a major or minor accident it
     will be turned into 316 LRS/LGRV within 24 hours or the next duty day of the accident.
4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
     4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes.
     When frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents,
     and other factors in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act
     information, make accident data and trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data
     for reporting and analytical purposes. With the exception of requests filed under the
     Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies cleared to receive accident and
     incident data.
     4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation
     reports will indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where
     applicable, if air bags deployed.
4.8. Parking.
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I              23 FEBRUARY 2010                                       29


  4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation.
  Strong enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing
  traffic accidents and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and
  awareness initiatives in areas where illegal parking is a problem. When education and
  awareness fail, installation commanders may authorize more serious enforcement measures
  such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use towing and booting if less severe
  means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revocations, etc., prove
  effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
     4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing
     or booting to specific offenses.
     4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for
     immobilizing unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in
     high offense areas or to compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more
     effective for moving vehicles that pose safety hazards. Some examples include double
     parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
     4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing
     or booting. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
     4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how
     to have the boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
  4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders
  determine reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility
  design and layout, traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine
  the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing
  reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic
  control instruction, or base parking plan. The publication must address approval, issue,
  control, and review of reserved parking and should give special consideration to bicycle,
  motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated under the uniform
  federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
     4.8.2.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Refer to Andrews AFB Instruction 32-1, Sign
     Standards for specific guidance on reserved parking on Andrews Air Force Base.
     4.8.2.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Loading zones will be appropriately marked.
     4.8.2.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Security forces and fire department units performing
     official duties may park in any reserved parking areas, with exception of handicapped
     spaces, during emergency response or weapons and funds escort activities.
     4.8.2.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Reserved Parking Designations
         4.8.2.4.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Reserved parking will be designated as
         "Parking by Permit."
             4.8.2.4.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Designations of parking spaces by name;
             grade or title is strictly prohibited, unless approved by the 316 MSG/CC after
             consideration by the TSCG.
             4.8.2.4.1.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Permanent              reserved   parking    spaces
30                                AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                  23 FEBRUARY 2010


                specifically designated for airman of the month, NCOs/officers of the quarter are
                not authorized. Commanders, however, may internally authorize the use of
                parking spaces allotted for the unit commander and first sergeant for such
                purposes.
        4.8.2.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Each unit on the installation will control requests for
        reserved parking around facilities for which they are responsible.
            4.8.2.5.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Naval Air Facility (NAF) will control reserved
            parking at buildings and facilities under their control. The NAF reserved parking will
            be controlled by the office of the NAF Security Officer.
            4.8.2.5.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Handicapped          Parking:    Only    vehicles
            prominently displaying one of the following media will be authorized to park in
            designated spaces reserved for the handicapped:
                4.8.2.5.2.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Handicapped special vehicle registration
                plates from any state.
                4.8.2.5.2.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Disabled driver/person parking permit
                placard (displayed on the dashboard or hung on mirror inside of vehicle).
            4.8.2.5.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Reserved parking for GOVs in support of the
            mission is authorized. Areas will be posted with the appropriate signs with time
            limits indicated on them.
            4.8.2.5.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Reserved parking spaces will be effective
            during normal duty hours only, except for GOVs and handicapped spaces.
            4.8.2.5.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) A car pool is defined as two or more
            occupants. Car pool parking spaces will be assigned and designated signs posted by
            each organization.
            4.8.2.5.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Reserved VIP parking during special activities
            is the responsibility of the agencies hosting the activity.
            4.8.2.5.7. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Commanders and first sergeants may park
            their POVs in reserved GOV slots when on official business.
     4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space
     assignments and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is
     placed on a vehicle bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification.
     MAJCOMs (or installation commanders if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop
     policy concerning the issue and control of the identification media discussed above.
     4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators,
     especially within off-street parking facilities.
        4.8.4.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Each unit will be responsible for enforcing parking
        violations in areas under their control. The unit commander will designate a traffic
        warden in writing. A copy of this designation will be forwarded to 316 SFS/S5SL. The
        prospective warden will contact 316 SFS/S5SL for a training appointment prior to issuing
        citations. Under no circumstances will traffic wardens attempt to enforce any traffic laws
        other than parking violations. A traffic warden's authority is strictly limited to the
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I             23 FEBRUARY 2010                                      31


     parking area for which their unit is responsible. Traffic wardens will contact the SFCC at
     extension 981-2001, for assistance should any problems or complaints arise due to their
     enforcement activities.
        4.8.4.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Traffic wardens will issue DD Form 1408 to
        violators. Citations will be completed in black ink in legible handwriting.
        Inappropriately completed citations will not be processed.
            4.8.4.1.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) The pink violator's copy of the citation
            will be placed securely on the violator's vehicle.
            4.8.4.1.1.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Traffic wardens will forward the yellow
            and white copies of the DD Form 1408 to 316 SFS/S5AR, through the SFCC,
            Bldg. 1845. Citations will be submitted within 24 hours of issuance.
  4.8.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Parking Citations (non-moving citations) when the
  vehicle owner has been identified:
     4.8.5.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) DD Form 1408 will be used to cite all parking
     violations for military or reservist on active duty or weekend drill duty.
     4.8.5.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) DD Form 1805 will be used to cite all parking
     violations for civilian or reservist not on active duty or weekend drill duty.
  4.8.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Parking Citations (non-moving citations) when the
  vehicle owner has not been identified:
     4.8.6.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) All parking citations will be on DD Form 1408.
     When the individual reports to the SFCC, as required, if he/she is a civilian or reservist
     not on active duty or weekend drill duty, his/her DD Form 1408 will be voided and
     he/she will be issued a DD Form 1805.
  4.8.7. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) POV Parking:
     4.8.7.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Vehicles will park parallel to curbs on streets,
     roadways, and designated one-way access lanes, headed in the direction of traffic
     movement and will not impede the normal flow of traffic or emergency vehicle access.
     Where spaces are marked, vehicles must park between the designated lines.
     4.8.7.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) In areas where there is no sign or yellow curb
     prohibiting parking, vehicle parking is allowed provided the vehicle does not impede
     traffic or emergency vehicle access to facilities or parking lots.
     4.8.7.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Bicycle and two-wheel vehicle operators may not
     park their vehicles on striped safety zones in parking lots.

        4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the
        matter because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only
        proprietary legislative jurisdiction.
        4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
        4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the

  Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control.
     4.9.4.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) DD Form 1408: If an Air Force member or a
     member of one of the other services assigned to Andrews AFB, wishes to appeal or rebut
     a traffic citation, they will submit a written rebuttal to their unit commander within 10
     days after receiving the citation. Unit commanders who determine the violation was
     committed will disapprove the rebuttal at the unit level. Annotate the citation with a
     finding of guilty with traffic points assessed and return to 316 SFS/S5AR for input in
     SFMIS. If the unit commander determines there is a basis for the rebuttal, they then send

          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for
          processing and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit
          commander, section commander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received,
          review it for action taken, annotate the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313,
          Driver Record, with the moving or non-moving violation and any points assessed.
          File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the
   following:
       4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating
       motor vehicles.
       4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which
       adequately documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
       4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety
       test consists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus.
       Also consider any local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the
       above standard Air Force tests.
       4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears
       intoxicated, but is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical
       attention.
       4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
   4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
       4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
       4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
   4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products
   list published in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as
   specified in paragraph 4.13 and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14 and
   4.15 relating to voluntary and involuntary testing.
   4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will
   develop their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian
   institutions or manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the
   installation staff judge advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure
36                                 AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010


     your program meets local requirements for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at
     the intervals determined by the CSP and staff judge advocate.
4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
     4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other
     enforcement measures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a
     person is tested per paragraph 2.3, evaluate the results of the test as follows:
        4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent,
        presume the person is not under the influence of alcohol.
            4.11.1.1.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Military Levels of impairment are governed
            by the UCMJ which sets the legal limit of impairment as 0.05 grams of alcohol per
            210 liters of breath or 0.05 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.
        4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired.
        Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person
        was under the influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5
        Note: The 0.10 threshold delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when
        assimilating a more stringent local, state, or host nation standard.
            4.11.1.2.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Civilian Levels of impairment are governed
            by Maryland Law and are set as follows: Driving While Impaired: 0.05 grams of
            alcohol per 210 liters of breath or 0.05 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood
        4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or
        host nation standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person
        is considered to have been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving
        privileges according to para 2.5.1.3
            4.11.1.3.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Civilian Levels of impairment are governed
            by Maryland Law and are set as follows: Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol Per
            Se: 0.08 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath or 0.08 grams of alcohol per 100
            milliliters of blood
     4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1 are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the
     blood based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will
     modify military standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation
     standard. Refer to Assessment #3, Table 5.1
     4.11.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Alcohol Restriction (Under Age 21): 0.02 grams of
     alcohol per 210 liters of breath or 0.02 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood; Military
     members under age are governed by a zero tolerance law.
     4.11.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Impairment Level:
     0.04 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath or 0.04 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of
     blood
     4.11.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Guard or Reserve members not on active duty orders are
     governed by MD law.
4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                        37


   4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following
   circumstances:
      4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally
      accepted scientific and medical methods and standards.
      4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
      4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing
   devices, then apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1)
   During the initial traffic stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction
   with other field sobriety testing techniques as long as the state or host nation does not
   prohibit such use, and 2) According to the manufacturer's operating instructions.
      4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the
          breath specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew
          tobacco, or ingest any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to
          manufacturer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation
          requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current
          instruction manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's
          manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
      4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon
      death of any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction,
      medical authorities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or
      mishap. Conduct tests for the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the
      blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as soon as possible and where practical within eight hours
      of death. Include the test results in the medical reports.
      4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath
      sample from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.
4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal
   driving behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving
   behavior. If you reasonably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired,
   perform field sobriety tests. The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and
   recording results of such tests. Use the standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10
   Specific procedures for administering them can be found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor
   Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for procedures and guidance concerning
   the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving reduction measures.
4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
38                                 AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                  23 FEBRUARY 2010


     4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3
     4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
        4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a
        motor vehicle on the installation.
        4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the
        influence of alcohol or drugs.
        4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that
        failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may
        result in revocation of on-base driving privileges.
     4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the
     driver that the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to
     voluntarily submit to or complete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the
     right to have an attorney present before deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing
     will follow policies and procedures in paragraph 4.12 Also advise the driver that you can use
     the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied consent provisions of this
     instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under Article 15 of the
     UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
        4.14.3.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Persons accepting installation driving privileges
        shall be deemed to have given their consent to evidential tests for alcohol or other content
        of their breath, blood and/or urine.
     4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
     or any medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may
     refuse a blood extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both.
     You must outline these procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for
     nonpunitive refusal in readily available medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or
     other reasonable areas where blood samples might be drawn from those suspected of drunk
     driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a medical doctor.
     4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do
     not administer a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15
4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
     4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped,
     apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor
     vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated.
     Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence, and regulatory rules concerning requesting and
     granting authorizations for searches govern the extraction of body fluids in furtherance of
     other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual extraction of blood samples
     is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of Clinical Services.
     4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure
     authorizations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and
     who subsequently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced
     to submit to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions
     are considered only when an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death,
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010                                        39


   serious personal injury, or significant property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe
   the individual was driving or was in control of a vehicle while under the influence of an
   intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the following procedures: 1) A search
   authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate obtained pursuant to Rule
   315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction; 2) A
   search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear indication
   that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay
   necessary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the
   evidence sought; and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the
   servicing staff judge advocate and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official
   fail because of the unavailability of the appropriate commander or military magistrate.
      4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves
      unsuccessful (due to nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered
      by Rule 315(d), Military Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an
      individual located in the facility at the time an authorization is sought.
          4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the
          medical facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff
          judge advocate.
          4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule
          315(d) need not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person
          can perform the extraction.
          4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
          individual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary
   purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions
   defining medical care, such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR
   160-12. Only qualified medical personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable
   measures to accomplish the procedure. Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to
   the extraction is normally provided by law enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting
   under orders from the member’s commanding officer or designee. Do not use any form of
   life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
      4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical
      attention. Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions
      when other medical treatment is required.
4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3 can request additional testing. These
   tests are paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base
   hospital or research laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in
   a military or civilian court of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an
   overseas area) approves the test and test method. Complete all tests as soon as possible,
   noting any delay on the resulting documents.

     4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make
     those arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid
     when circumstances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason
     additional testing is not completed.
4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not
under military control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and
incidents of interest to local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the
sharing and exchanging of information with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures
are generally well documented in formal agreements with the host nation. Local procedures
must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of traffic and related incident reports received
from other investigative agencies.
     4.17.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Incident/accident reports of interest to local authorities
     will be provided as requested. Receiving, processing and securing of off base incident
     reports provided to Reports and Analysis will be handled in the same manner as a SFMIS
     report.
4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
     4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws
     when operating government vehicles on or off base.
     4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before
     moving government vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits
     such as weight, length, width, or other standards.
     4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement
     agencies and encourage the following:
        4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators
        involved in accidents or incidents.
        4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of
        government motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious
        violations of civil traffic laws.
        4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or
        restrict the driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.
4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
     4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to
     coordinate military and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation
     commanders should cooperate and provide proper support and participation.
     4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic
     workshop program to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local
     communities. Sound and practical traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic
     enforcement, engineering, and education. Civilian and military legal and law enforcement
     officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public affairs officers should take part.

               DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents,
moving and parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments
involving military and DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel
operating motor vehicles on a military installation. In filling out the form, use the following
codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or
   “V” victim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no
   liability determined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P”
   private; “V” vehicle; and “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
 Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation
 commander.

    a. Subject will have 3 days from the date of the issued letter and citation to provide 316 SFS/S5AR
 valid insurance. If insurance was valid prior to the citation being issued and is presented to 316
 SFS/S5AR within 3 days the citation/revocation letter will be voided.
    b. If insurance is acquired after the date of the citation a 6 month revocation will still be in effect.
 2. Driving with no or suspended/revoked state vehicle registration.
    a. Subject will have 3 days from the date of the issued letter and citation to provide 316 SFS/S5AR
 valid registration or will receive a 6 month revocation letter.

 month revocation will still be in effect.
    c. Fleeing the scene of an accident/failure to leave identification after causing an accident etc.
1.When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or
host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
2.No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied consent
violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial,
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise
addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another
revocation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of
24 months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy
systematically and not on a case-by-case basis.
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                23 FEBRUARY 2010                                      47


5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative
device to impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a
disciplinary measure or a substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to
interfere in any way with the reasonable exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to
issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate installation driving privileges.
5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein
are mandatory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on
and off the installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel
operating GOVs and POVs on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and
all other individuals subject to this instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an
individual submits a rebuttal, assess points according to the Table 5.2 Also assess points to
individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court, or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of
pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the point system for non-moving
violations.

  5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805
  will serve as a basis for determining point assessment.
  5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving
  violation (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an
  inquiry. The commander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative
  action.
  5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9
  5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as
  appropriate:
     5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
     acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
     5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any
     person who acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-
     month period.
     5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief,
     appears to have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on
     driving ability.
     5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill,
     awareness, or attitude.
     5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation,
     counseling, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all
     cases in which alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation,
     incident, or accident.
  5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by
  this instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
  5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one
  violation or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic
  points within 24 consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and
  revocation periods for offenses not covered in Table 5.1; however, any revocation must be
  for a period of 6 months or more. The installation commander may impose a longer
  suspension or revocation period (to include offenses in Table 5.1) based on the person’s
  overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and severity of moving violations,
  and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all cases, military members
  must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training before
  reinstatement of driving privileges.
  5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for
  24 consecutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during
  records update while recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations.
  Completion of a revocation based on points requires removal from the driver record of all
  points assessed before the revocation.

     5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving
     violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain
     posted on individual driving records for the period of time indicated below.
        5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
        5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.
        5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.
5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a
person assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released
from military service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
     5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other
     entries on their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining
     installation. The gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue
     any Air Force suspension or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of
     traffic points. Traffic points for persons transferred will continue to accumulate as specified
     in para 5.4.7
     5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and
     AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military
     personnel released from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate
     reenlistment, change of officer component, or military and civilian retirement when
     continued vehicle registration is authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139
     records on civilian personnel who are terminating on-base employment or on-base
     registration.
     5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or
     other entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for
     service members. Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving
     privileges. Do not delete points accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding
     suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or chargeable accidents from the driver records
     except per para 5.4.7 and 5.4.8

                                           Chapter 6

                    IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement
personnel when towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This
policy is based on:
   6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow
   of vehicle traffic movement.
   6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable
   search and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.
6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
   6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public
   safety or convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity,
   or is stolen or abandoned.
   6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist.
   When possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If
   reasonably feasible, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first
   have permission from the owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle.
   However in such cases, the security police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for
   safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
      6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
          6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with
          the orderly flow of traffic.
          6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track,
          in a fire lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations
          or creates a safety hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
          6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
          6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
      6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
          6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the
          owner fail.
          6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
          6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
          6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore
          unable (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
          6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the
          public roadways.
52                                AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010


            6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or
            physically incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or
            safekeeping.
            6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.
        6.2.3.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) on Andrews
        AFB may be impounded for criminal investigation or follow-up on a traffic accident
        investigation.
6.3. Towing and Storage.
     6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs
     depending on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
     6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation
     for use as an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted
     wrecker service provided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor
     impoundment areas and maintains keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
     6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or
     involvement in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
     6.3.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Towing Vehicles.
        6.3.4.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Illegally parked vehicles or vehicles suspected of
        being abandoned will be reported to 316th Security Forces Investigations (316 SFS/S3SI)
        for disposition. S3SI will arranging for towing and disposition of these vehicles.
        6.3.4.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) 316 SFS may immediately tow vehicles from street
        or parking lots for the following reasons:
            6.3.4.2.1. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) To prevent injury.
            6.3.4.2.2. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) To eliminate safety hazards.
            6.3.4.2.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) To ensure normal flow of traffic.
            6.3.4.2.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) To provide adequate space for fire-fighting
            equipment.
            6.3.4.2.5. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) To ensure posted fire lanes are clear.
            6.3.4.2.6. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) To ensure snow removal emergency routes are
            clear.
        6.3.4.3. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) If the owner cannot be contacted within 72 hours,
        the vehicles will be treated as abandoned. Personnel are not authorized to store their
        personal vehicles on the installation for more than 72 hours, unless the vehicle is at the
        Auto Hobby Shop or the AAFES Car Care Center waiting for repairs.
        6.3.4.4. (Added-ANDREWSAFB) Vehicles will only be towed on base by 316
        LRS/LGRDDO, an authorized private towing agency, or with a towing bar specifically
        designed for towing. Any other method of towing is prohibited. The 316 LRS/LGRDDO
        will only tow vehicles in emergency situations (i.e. vehicle is blocking the road) and they
        will only be towed to the nearest parking lot. The 316 LRS/LGRDDO does not accept
AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I               23 FEBRUARY 2010                                        53


      any responsibility for damage that may be caused to the vehicle during the towing
      procedure.
6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
   6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
      6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD
      5525.4), on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this
      action with an entry in the security police blotter.
      6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the
      vehicle. Have the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted
      wrecker service is used, complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
      6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD
      Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action
      taken.
          6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory
          listing personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless
          necessary to identify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public.
          In most cases, listing the container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
          6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
      6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD
      5525.4), by certified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise
      the owner of the impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s
      intentions concerning the vehicle.
   6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
      6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes.
      Release recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary
      purposes, or to the law enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
      6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request
      the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff
      such requests through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and
      support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the
      vehicle if civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as
      determined by the installation commander.
6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in
conjunction with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the
following general situations:
   6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and
   crime-related impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle
   unless evidence or contraband is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as
   evidence of criminal activity. When in doubt, obtain proper search authority before
   searching.
54                                 AFI31-204_ANDREWSAFBSUP_I                 23 FEBRUARY 2010


     6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal
     incident or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and
     sufficient probable cause exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present
     but is unwilling, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to
     safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may search vehicles without search authority
     when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is a risk of loss or destruction of
     evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search incident to apprehension.
6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
     6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law
     enforcement, or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority,
     release vehicles and property when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above.
     Review Title 10, USC 2575, Disposition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive
     4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking
     action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner or an authorized agent.
     6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts
     to contact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to
     assume responsibility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt
     to secure release of the vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD
     Form 2507. The 60-day waiting period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle
     to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed letter, power of attorney, or other legally
     recognized document.
        6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the
        vehicle as abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise
        directed, installation commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use
        for, or disposal of, abandoned property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale,
        Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are potential options. Consider local, state, or
        if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process vehicles through the Defense
        Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO and DoD directives.

Andrews AFB Inst 31-205 (Installation Traffic Code). Violations citing other provisions of
Federal Law or the Assimilative Crimes Act are processed following the procedures set
forth in AR 190-29.
A3.2. (ANDREWSAFB) For individuals who are cited for Driving While License or 45, [32
CFR §210.3], the violation notice should be marked as mandating the appearance of the violator
in court. There is no collateral forfeiture authorized.
A3.3. (ANDREWSAFB) For all other violations of Andrews AFB Inst 31-204, [32 CFR
§210. 3], the citing officer has the discretion under AR 190-29 to mark the violation as either a
mandatory appearance offense (due to the potential of incarceration) OR to mark the violation as
a collateral offense. If cited as a collateral offense, the officer will annotate the DD Form 1805
to list a $25 fine (which is accompanied by the mandatory $25 processing fee printed on the
Violation Notice) requiring a total a sum payable of $50 to the Clerk, United States Courts).
Individuals who fail to pay the fine are required to appear at court and are subject to a sentence
including jail time and the fine set at the discretion of the judge. Note: individuals who fail to
pay the collateral forfeiture and then fail to appear at court are subject to suspension of their
driving privileges both on and off of the installation. The judge may issue a collateral warrant
authorizing the arrest of individuals who fail to appear on these cases until such time as the cited
fine (plus administrative processing fee) is paid.
