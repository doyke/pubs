SUMMARY OF CHANGES

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change introduces a MAJCOM-focused end-to-end sourcing methodology via the
Expeditionary Combat Support Consolidated Planning Schedule (ECS CPS) and a revised
reclama methodology; delineates roles and responsibilities between functional area managers and
commanders/DCSs/functional directors; establishes Band "B" as baseline AEF; and eliminates
the third character for the posturing code construct. Additionally, other changes include
clarifications and/or minor modifications to existing AEF policies. A margin bar indicates newly
revised material.

(AFGSC) This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

                         AN OVERVIEW OF JOINT PLANNING

Section 1A—Purpose

1.1. Purpose. To provide an overview of the joint planning process and the interrelationships of
the associated national level systems that produce national security policy, military strategy,
force and sustainment requirements, and plans. The four major interrelated systems affecting the
development of joint operational plans are the National Security Council System (NSCS), the
Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS), the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution
Process (PPBE), and the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES). Subsequent
chapters in this instruction will provide detailed planning guidance.

Section 1B—Background

1.2. Joint Planning. A coordinated process used by commanders, decision-makers, and
supporting staffs to determine the best method of accomplishing assigned tasks and missions.
Joint planning is conducted within JOPES, but has its origins in and is related to the NSCS,
JSPS, and PPBE. To provide decision makers with information to support these processes and
systems, wartime deployment and in-place requirements are quantified and documented for the
combatant commanders and compared to available resources.
1.3. National Security Council System (NCSC). The National Security Council (NSC),
established by the National Security Act of 1947, is the principal forum for deliberation of
national security policy issues requiring Presidential decision. The NSCS provides the
framework for establishing national strategy and policy objectives, developing policy options,
considering problems requiring interdepartmental consideration, developing recommendations
for the President, and monitoring policy implementation
   1.3.1. National Security Council (NSC). The President chairs the NSC. In addition to the
   President, its statutory members are the Vice President and the Secretaries of State and
   Defense. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) is the statutory military advisor to
   the Council, and the Director of National Intelligence is the intelligence advisor. The NSCS
   provides the institutional channels through which the CJCS discharges a substantial part of
   his statutory responsibilities. The CJCS regularly attends NSC meetings and presents the
   views, including dissenting and minority views, of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The NSCS
   generates Presidential Decision Directives (PDD), which are NSC documents established to
   inform US Government departments of presidential action. NSCS policy decisions provide
   the basis for military planning and programming.
   1.3.2. National Security Strategy (NSS). The NSS is a broad document published by the
   President and the NSC, outlining the defense, economic, internal and international security
   objectives of the United States.
1.4. Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS). As described in CJCSI 3100.01A, Joint
Strategic Planning System, JSPS is the primary formal means by which the CJCS, in consultation
with the other members of the JCS and the combatant commanders, carries out planning and
policy responsibilities within the Department of Defense (DOD). These responsibilities include:
16                                                   AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


  1.4.1. Providing advice and assistance to the President and Secretary of Defense (SecDef) as
  to the strategic direction of the Armed Forces and the preparation of policy guidance.
  1.4.2. Preparing military strategy, strategic plans, and strategic assessments.
  1.4.3. Providing advice to the SecDef on the effect that critical force capability deficiencies
  and strengths will have on accomplishing national security objectives, implementing policy,
  and executing strategic plans.
  1.4.4. Providing advice on program recommendations and budget proposals to conform to
  priorities established for the combatant commanders and in strategic plans.
  1.4.5. JSPS Components. The JSPS provides the means to systematically review the
  national security environment and United States (US) national security objectives, evaluate
  risks and threats, assess current strategy and existing or proposed programs and budgets, and
  propose military strategy, forces, and programs necessary to achieve our national security
  objectives in a resource-limited environment. Its components are shown in Figure 1.1 The
  Joint Strategy Review (JSR) is the principal mechanism for this study. During the JSR
  process, a series of papers and briefings (intermediate products) are developed by the Joint
  Staff, staffed with the Services and unified commands, and presented to the CJCS and the
  other members of the JCS.
     1.4.5.1. National Military Strategy (NMS). A decision to modify the strategic
     direction of the Armed Forces based on the JSR would be reflected in the NMS. The
     NMS articulates the Chairman’s recommendations on how the United States should
     employ the military element of power in support of the NSS. The NMS defines the
     national military objectives, establishes the strategy to accomplish these objectives, and
     addresses the military capabilities required to execute the strategy. The NMS also
     describes the strategic landscape and includes a discussion of the potential threats and
     risks.
     1.4.5.2. Joint Planning Document (JPD) The JPD is one of the documents the
     Chairman uses to communicate advice to the SecDef. The JPD contains
     recommendations to the SecDef on the content of the SecDef’s Strategic Planning
     Guidance (SPG) in terms of broad capabilities required to support the NMS.
     1.4.5.3. Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG). The SPG is the plan for the development
     and employment of future forces. The SPG articulates the SecDef’s defense strategy and
     force structure requirements.
     1.4.5.4. Joint Programming Guidance (JPG). The JPG provides programming
     guidance to military and defense agencies to develop their Program Objective
     Memorandums (POM). It provides the SecDef’s threat assessment, policy, strategy, force
     planning, and resource planning guidance within broad fiscal constraints. It is the link
     between the JSPS and the PPBE. This relationship is shown in Figure 1.2
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                                 17


Figure 1.1. JSPS Components




1.5. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE). The PPBE is the third
major system related to the overall joint planning and execution process. Planning, Programming
and Budgeting is an on-going process which enables senior leadership to assess alternative ways
to achieve the best mix of force, requirements, and support attainable within fiscal constraints. A
major goal is to strategically link any major decision for acquisition, force structure, operational
concepts, and infrastructure, for example, both to the JPG and to program and budget
development. The PPBE is concerned with allocating resources (force, equipment, and support)
to meet the war fighting needs of the combatant commanders. It translates strategy and force
requirements developed by the military in the NMS into budgetary requirements that are
presented to Congress. Key products in the PPBE include the Program Objective Memorandum
(POM), Budget Estimate Submission (BES), the President’s Budget (PB), Program Change
Proposal (PCP), and Budget Change Proposal (BCP).
   1.5.1. Program Objective Memorandum (POM). DOD formulates 2-year budgets and
   uses the off year to focus on budget execution and program performance. In even-numbered
   years, the JPG kicks off development of the POMs. Each military department and defense
   agency prepares and submits its POM to the SecDef. The POM identifies total program
   requirements for the next six years and includes rationale for planned changes to the Future
   Years Defense Program (FYDP) baseline. It is based on the JPG’s strategic concepts and
   guidance and includes an assessment of the risk associated with the current and proposed
   forces and support program. A key objective of POM development is to provide requisite
   capabilities and meet critical needs within a balanced program weighted by mission area
   needs.

   1.5.2. Budget Estimate Submission (BES). BES is the Service budget estimate that is
   submitted for joint review by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Comptroller and
   the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) analysts. Within the Air Force, the BES cycle
   begins with preparatory analysis in the spring, but it goes into high gear with receipt of the
   Program Decision Memorandum (PDM) and BES guidance from OSD in late summer. It
   normally ends when the budget estimate is submitted. The entire budget is reviewed to
   ensure the requests are properly priced, program schedules are appropriate, and performance
   goals are in line with the objectives of the SecDef. Program Budget Decisions (PBD)
   document approval of the estimates for inclusion in the President’s Budget. These decisions
   evaluate, adjust, and approve all resources in the budget request. If the Air Force appeals a
   PBD, the reclama is processed through the Deputy Secretary of Defense who makes the final
   decision.
   1.5.3. President’s Budget (PB). Once all the final budget decisions are made, the DOD
   budget then becomes a part of the PB that will be submitted to the Congress. Once the
   President has signed Congress’s appropriation act into law, OMB can begin apportioning
   funds to the federal departments. The Services execute the budget, new forces and
   capabilities are procured, and the combatant commanders update their operation plans
   (OPLAN), as required.
   1.5.4. Program Change Proposal (PCP). During the off year, a PCP is submitted instead
   of a POM to accommodate real world changes, and as part of the continuing need to align the
   defense program with the defense strategy.
   1.5.5. Budget Change Proposal (BCP). During the off year, a BCP is submitted instead of
   a BES. BCPs accommodate fact-of-life changes (e.g., cost increases, schedule delays,
   management reform savings, workload changes, etc.) as well as changes resulting from
   congressional actions.

1.6. Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). CJCSI 3100.01F, Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan (JSCP), provides guidance to the combatant commanders, Services Chiefs, and Defense
agencies to accomplish tasks and missions based on near-term military capabilities. The JSCP
implements deliberate planning guidance reflected in the Contingency Planning Guidance (CPG)
and provides updated strategic guidance developed after publication of the CPG.
   1.6.1. The JSCP Basic Volume:
       1.6.1.1. Provides a strategic planning direction for contingency plans to be developed
       following JSCP distribution. The Joint Staff will coordinate the publication schedule and
       effective dates of plans.
       1.6.1.2. Details planning guidance, force apportionment guidance, assumptions,
       constraints, and tasks. Supplemental instructions are issued separately.
       1.6.1.3. Tasks the combatant commanders to prepare contingency plans by level of detail
       and apply security cooperation guidance.
       1.6.1.4. Establishes synchronizing, supported and supporting relationships.
       1.6.1.5. Supports and implements, through resultant combatant command OPLANs, the
       objectives of the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the
       National Military Strategy.
       1.6.1.6. Serves as a coherent framework for providing military advice to the President
       and the Secretary of Defense and follows, implements, and augments the President and
       Secretary of Defense’s guidance forwarded in the CPG and the Unified Command Plan
       (UCP), as well as the Secretary of Defense’s Security Cooperation Guidance and Global
       Force Management Guidance.
   1.6.2. JSCP Supplemental Instructions. Previous JSCP Annexes have been renamed
   supplemental instructions and are listed in Enclosure E to the JSCP. The supplements provide
   guidance that will result in plans balanced between the details necessary for specific
   contingencies tasked and the breadth and flexibility required for unknown or unforeseen
   contingencies that may be necessary during contingencies. CJCS instructions in the 3110
   series (see Attachment 1) identify current supplements to the JSCP.
1.7. Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC). The JPEC consists of headquarters,
commands and agencies involved in the training, preparation, movement, reception,
employment, support and sustainment of military forces.
1.8. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). JOPES is the DOD directed
single, integrated joint command and control system for conventional operation planning and
execution (to include theater-level nuclear and chemical plans). It includes policies, procedures,
reporting structures, and personnel, supported by the command, control, communications,
computers and intelligence (C4I) systems and is used by the joint community to conduct joint
planning during peace and crisis. Joint operation planning is a process coordinated through all
levels of the national structure for joint planning and execution. The focus of the joint operation
planning process is at the combatant commanders, who use it to determine the best method of
accomplishing assigned tasks and direct the actions necessary to accomplish the mission. JOPES
is designed to facilitate rapid building and timely maintenance of plans and rapid development of
effective options through adaptation of approved operation plans during crisis. JOPES allows for
 20                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


the effective management of operations in execution across the spectrum of mobilization,
deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment and demobilization. JOPES is supported
by a networked suite of Automated Data Processing (ADP) applications, tools, and databases,
which reside on the Global Command and Control System (GCCS). JOPES ADP systems
include the mechanisms to create and maintain time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD) and
to submit CCDR movement requirements to USTRANSCOM. JOPES ADP is commonly
referred to as JOPES, including throughout this AFI. All joint, conventional Time Phased Force
Deployment Data (TPFDD) are developed by and reside in JOPES ADP. JOPES also assists in
identifying shortfalls, which are converted to joint operation requirements to the PPBE. JOPES
ADP is detailed in Chapter 4. The term "the use of JOPES is directed" in JOPES orders directs
all tasked organizations to use JOPES in developing plans/order to accomplish the tasked
mission(s). This means organizations must follow the guidance set out in Joint Pub 5.0 and well
as all of the CJCS Instructions governing JOPES. There are various CJCS manuals (CJCSM) that
govern JOPES:
   1.8.1. CJCSM 3122.01A, JOPES Volume I (Planning Policies and Procedures), provides
   policy guidance and procedures for the peacetime and crisis action development,
   coordination, dissemination, review, approval and implementation of joint OPLANs and
   CONPLANs tasked by the JSCP or other CJCS directives.
   1.8.2. CJCSM 3122.03B, JOPES Volume II (Planning Formats and Guidance), along with
   its classified supplement, CJCSM 3122.04A, JOPES Volume II Supplemental Planning and
   Execution Formats and Guidance, is functionally oriented. It prescribes standard formats and
   minimum content requirements for OPLANs and CONPLANs. CJCSM 3122.03B
   supplements JOPES Volume I with planning guidance and CJCSM 3122.04A provides
   formats for selected classified appendices and tabs.
   1.8.3. CJCSM 3122.02C, JOPES Volume III (Crisis Action TPFDD Development and
   Deployment Execution), establishes procedures for the development of TPFDD and the
   deployment of forces within the context of JOPES in support of joint military operations.
   1.8.4. CJCSM 3150.16A, JOPES Reporting Structure (JOPESREP) sets forth guidelines and
   standards to be used in the organization and development of information reporting to the
   JOPES database. This CJCSM encompasses only JOPES-related Joint Planning and
   Execution Community (JPEC) data.
   1.8.5. JOPES Volumes I and III are reviewed periodically by the Joint Staff (JS) and Service
   headquarters. Recommended changes may be submitted at any time to the War and
   Mobilization Plans Division (AF/A5XW). Air Force component headquarters are required to
   send an information copy of these recommendations to their parent unified command.
1.9. Adaptive Planning. Adaptive Planning (AP) is now the process supporting contingency
planning within DOD. AP represents a major departure from previous approaches and cuts
across established functional areas. AP provides more and better options, establishes increased
opportunities for consultation and guidance during plan development, triggers updates of existing
plans, and promotes increased agility in plan implementation.
   1.9.1. Adaptive Planning allows the combatant commander to develop a full range of
   flexible options and respond to rapidly changing strategic and military conditions. It
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              21


   increases emphasis on “front end” elements of planning threat analysis, mission analysis,
   assumption development, feasibility assessment, and concept of operations development.
   1.9.2. DOD is using spiral development to implement AP through three transitional stages:
   an Initiation Stage, an Implementation Stage, and an Integration Stage. As AP is
   implemented, these three stages may overlap.
   1.9.3. AP entered the Initiation Stage upon Contingency Planning Guidance (CPG) 05
   approval.
   1.9.4. Only top priority plans will use the AP process during the Initiation Stage.
   1.9.5. At maturity, AP will create and revise plans rapidly and systematically, as
   circumstances require; they will be “living” plans. Living plans will provide a foundation for
   transition to crisis planning. AP requires the regular involvement of senior leaders and will
   result in contingency plans containing a range of viable options.
   1.9.6. Combatant commanders will use Adaptive Planning Technology to develop force and
   sustainment requirements, and Force Flows for the appropriate contingency plans tasked in
   the JSCP.
1.10. Global Force Management (GFM). GFM aligns force assignment, apportionment, and
allocation methodologies in support of the National Defense Strategy (NDS), joint force
availability requirements, and joint force assessments. GFM presents comprehensive insight into
the global availability of U.S. military forces; and provides senior decision makers a vehicle to
quickly and accurately assess the impact and risk of proposed allocation, assignment, and
apportionment changes as outlined in the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance
(GFMIG) as well as Joint Staff directives (i.e. Joint Staff Force Sourcing Business Rules and
SecDef Orders Book (SDOB) Process).
   1.10.1. Within GFM, the force allocation process allocates Service rotational forces to
   satisfy combatant commander operational requirements for military capabilities to support
   the defense strategy and President's NSS. The GFM allocation process consists of two
   specific processes --- rotational force allocation in support of combatant commander (CCDR)
   annual force needs and emergent force allocation in support of CCDR emerging or crisis-
   based requests for capabilities and forces. Unit emergent requirements are codified using the
   request for forces/capabilities (RFF/RFC) for units and out of cycle requests for Joint Task
   Force Headquarters individual augmentation manpower using the Joint Manning Document
   (JMD) process.
       1.10.1.1. For annual rotational force allocation, Combatant Commanders (CCDRs)
       submit their requirements through a stepped process culminating in the SecDef–approved
       Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP). Details of this process are
       outlined in Joint Staff’s biennial GFM Implementation Guidance (GFMIG). For
       emergent requirements, the CCDR initiates the GFM allocation process by identifying a
       requirement and submitting a request for forces/request for capability (RFF/RFC) to the
       Joint Staff (see Figure 1.3.). The RFF/RFC provides CCDRs with a means to obtain
       required support not already assigned or allocated to the command. In accordance with
       CJCSM 3122.01A, Enclosure R, and CJCSM 3122.02C, Appendix A to Enclosure F, the
       supported Air Force component headquarters will review all RFFs/RFCs for USAF
       capabilities being requested and place the requirements(s) in the applicable TPFDD prior
22                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


     to the supported CCDR forwarding to the Joint Staff. The emergent requirements with
     solution are placed into a MOD to the GFMAP. Air Force sourcing of both rotational
     and emerging requirements is detailed in Chapters 8 and 9.
  1.10.2. The Global Force Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP) Annexes, approved by the
  SecDef, allocate specific rotational forces to combatant commanders. In the event of an
  emerging crisis, the allocation annex may be adjusted or suspended by the SecDef.
  1.10.3. Global Force Management Board (GFMB). The GFMB is charged with
  assessment of force allocation, apportionment, and assignment proposals in support of the
  GFM process. The GFMB consists of representatives from the Joint Staff, Office of
  Secretary of Defense agencies, Services and combatant commands and is chaired by a flag
  officer or equivalent representative.
     1.10.3.1. The GFMB establishes strategic guidance prior to developing force
     management options and recommendations.
     1.10.3.2. The GFMB prioritizes operational requirements globally and provides a
     prioritized list of rotational requirements for supplying trained and ready forces and
     capabilities to support combatant commander requirements.
     1.10.3.3. The GFMB will assess and evaluate the continued allocation of rotational
     forces for incorporation into a revised rotational schedule.
  1.10.4. Joint Force Provider (JFP). In accordance with the GFMIG, JFCOM,
  TRANSCOM, and SOCOM are the designated JFPs for conventional forces, mobility forces,
  and special operations forces, respectively. JFP roles and responsibilities are outlined in the
  current GFMIG as well as Joint Staff directives. The Joint Staff tasks JFPs to recommend
  global force sourcing solutions for global CCDR requirements; these sourcing solutions may
  be from assigned forces, forces assigned to other CCDRs, or Service-retained forces.

       1.10.4.1. JFPs task their Service components to develop recommended Service sourcing
       solutions. Air Force components to JFPs (ACC, AMC, and AFSOC) (hereinafter referred
       to as Air Force force provider (AF FP)) serve as the primary POC for all Service sourcing
       matters pertaining to their respective JFP (Note: A new Joint Staff J3 deputy director,
       J31, Global Conventional Joint Force Coordinator (GCJFC), was established and
       performs functions as the Conventional JFP acting through the Service headquarters;
       ACC, based on HAF-delegated authority, will continue working as the conventional AF
       FP under GFM. The rest of this AFI will use the JFP/AF FP terminology for
       TRANSCOM/AMC, SOCOM/AFSOC and J31/ACC). In this role, these AF FPs provide
       global recommended sourcing solutions and feasibility risk analyses as defined by
       GFMIG and Joint Staff directives (Note: AF FPs must coordinate with applicable
       sourcing agencies (i.e. AFPC/DPW, HAF FAMs and/or FOAs for centrally managed
       functional areas) before recommending sourcing solutions). The Air Force sourcing
       process is detailed in Chapters 8 and 9.

     1.10.4.2. Joint Expeditionary Tasking (JET). If a standard force solution (i.e. a mission
     ready, Joint capable force with associated table of organization and equipment executing
     its core mission) cannot be made, the JFP may recommend a non-standard force solution.
     While the Joint Staff has defined three categories of non-standard force solutions, the Air
     Force collectively refers to its contribution to these as JET. A JET sourcing solution
     becomes a factor when the traditional force provider for the requested force or capability
     cannot fill the requirement or there is no traditional force provider. This type of solution
     will most likely not be requested in either USAF UTCs and/or AFSCs and will require
     the requester to provide the necessary information to convert the requested force,
     capability, or military occupational specialty (MOS) into capabilities that identify what
     personnel and specific training are required to meet the tasking. The supported
     component headquarters will translate the request into potential UTCs and/or AFSCs, or
     closest organic Air Force capability. The process used to source JET solutions follows
     the same procedure as sourcing traditional forces but usually requires more staffing time.
     This time is used to understand the capability being requested, translate it into AFSCs or
     UTCs, and arrange for training, sourcing, equipping, mobilizing (if required), and
     deploying.
        1.10.4.2.1. JET is the overarching methodology that provides alternative force
        sourcing when the preferred force solution is not an option. There are three JET
        sourcing categories: (1) Joint Force/Capability Solution, (2) In-Lieu-Of (ILO)
        Solution, and (3) Ad Hoc Solution.
            1.10.4.2.1.1. Joint Force/Capability Solution.      A Service providing a
            force/capability in place of another Service’s core mission; however, the
            capability is performing its core mission (e.g. RED HORSE replacing an Army
            Combat Engineering Heavy Battalion, AF EOD Detachment replacing Army
            EOD Company). This JET solution requires no special training, outside of a
            functional area, beyond combat skills training.
            1.10.4.2.1.2. ILO Solution. A standard force, including associated table of
            organization and equipment, deployed/employed to execute missions and tasks
            outside its core competencies (e.g. Direct Support Supply Company, filled by
            Army reserve Petroleum, Oil and Lubricant Unit.
            1.10.4.2.1.3. Ad Hoc Solution. A consolidation of individuals and equipment
            from                                                                    various
            commands/services forming a deployable/employable entity, properly manned,
            trained and equipped to meet the supported CCDR’s requirements (e.g. Provincial
            Reconstruction Team (PRT) sourced with Navy & Air Force personnel).

                                           Chapter 2

                         OVERVIEW OF AIR FORCE PLANNING

Section 2A—Purpose

2.1. Purpose. To provide an overview of the Air Force’s force presentation and the planning
policies, processes, and systems used to support the joint planning process. This includes the Air
& Space Expeditionary Force (AEF), War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Deliberate and Crisis
Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES), and the Air & Space Expeditionary Task
Force (AETF) force modules.

Section 2B—Background

2.2. Function of the AEF. The Air Force supports global combatant commander (CCDR)
requirements through a combination of assigned, attached (rotational), and mobility forces that
may be forward deployed, transient, or operating from home station. The AEF is the force
generation construct used to manage the battle rhythm of these forces in order to meet global
CCDR requirements while maintaining the highest possible level of overall readiness. Through
the AEF, the Air Force establishes a predictable, standardized battle rhythm ensuring rotational
forces are properly organized, trained, equipped, and ready to sustain capabilities while rapidly
responding to emerging crises.

Section 2C—Guidance

2.3. AEF Force Generation Construct. The Air Force’s Total Force is part of the AEF. There
are four major elements of the AEF structure: readily available force, Enabler force, in-place
support, and Institutional Force. The first three elements are components that primarily
constitute the Air Force’s warfighting capability and are therefore postured in UTCs (see Chapter
7); the fourth element provides the Air Force’s sustainment capability necessary to meet SECAF
statutory functions outlined in 10 USC § 8013(b).
   2.3.1. Readily Available Force. The readily available force is the primary pool from which
   the Air Force fulfills GFM Allocation Plan (GFMAP) requirements. To meet these
   requirements, the Air Force aligns its warfighting capabilities (i.e. forces from combat,
   combat support, and combat service support organizations) into a baseline of five AEF
   blocks, each intended to contain an equivalent capability from which to provide forces.
   During periods of increased requirements, capability areas from these five blocks may be
   realigned within the Global AEF construct to a Tempo Band that provides a greater pool of
   capability, deploying that capability at a higher deploy-to-dwell rate (i.e. the ratio of time
   deployed in support of a contingency versus the time in a dwell state). The baseline AEF
   (Band “B”) is organized to support a one-to-four deploy-to-dwell ratio. The alternative
   Tempo Bands are organized to support an increasing deploy-to-dwell ratio with Bands “C”,
   “D”, and “E” supporting one-to-three, one-to-two, and one-to-one ratios respectively. Bands
   “B” through “E” each encompass a 6 month AEF vulnerability window. Band “A” supports
   a one-to-four ratio but with a 4 month vulnerability period vice 6 months and is reserved
   exclusively for those functional areas whose CCDR requirements are predominantly 4
28                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


  months in duration. Two additional Tempo Bands are designed to support Air Reserve
  Component (ARC) forces in capability areas that might require mobilization. Tempo Bands
  “M” and “N” are designed to support mobilization-to-dwell ratios of one-to-five and one-to-
  four respectively. When forces are realigned to a different Tempo Band, each block within
  the Tempo Band is intended to contain an equivalent capability.
     2.3.1.1. (DELETED) .
  2.3.2. Enabler Force. The Enabler force includes common user assets, such as global
  mobility forces, special operations (SOF) and personnel recovery forces, space forces, and
  other uniquely categorized forces that provide support to authorized organizations within and
  outside the Department of Defense (DOD). Most high demand/low supply (HD/LS) assets,
  National Air Mobility System, and Theater Air Control System (TACS) elements are
  postured as Enabler forces and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Due to their
  unique nature, these forces cannot be easily aligned in one of the Tempo Bands; however,
  every effort must be made to develop a sustained plan. Enabler force details are in Chapter 7
  (Note: ARC is not required to posture assets as Enablers).
  2.3.3. In-place support. There are two types of in-place support -- those forces that almost
  exclusively employ in direct support of a Combatant Commander mission, and those that
  represent the minimum number of requirements to support critical home station operations.
  In-place support forces are also included in the AEF Tempo Bands. Details on in-place
  support forces are in Chapter 7.
  2.3.4. Institutional Force. The Institutional Force consists of those forces assigned to
  organizations responsible to carry out the SECAF Title 10 functions at the Air Force level
  (i.e. organize, train, equip, recruit, supply, etc (see Table A8.2. for examples)). These
  organizations will not posture UTCs in the AEF Capability Library (unless a waiver is
  granted by AF/A3/5 (see paragraph 10.2)). Although these organizations as a whole do not
  represent a warfighting capability, the individuals assigned to these organizations are
  inherently deployable. Details on AEF association, sourcing, and employment of individuals
  in the Institutional Force are in Chapter 14.
     2.3.4.1. (DELETED) .
  2.3.5. AEF Capability Library. The blocks within the five primary and two ARC Tempo
  Bands, plus the Enabler force make up the AEF Capability Library as depicted in Figure 2.1
  The AEF Capability Library consists of 100% of the USAF’s postured capability and
  encompasses one iteration of each of the 41 AEF blocks plus the Enabler force. The AEF
  Capability Library contains a finite capability that at any given time identifies forces that
  constitute the total force that has been made available or allocated for scheduling and
  provides a composite of capabilities from which AETFs are task organized to meet mission
  requirements.

2.4. AEF Schedule, Battle Rhythm, and Timeline.
   2.4.1. AEF Schedule. The AEF Capability Library is the basis for the AEF Schedule (see
   Figure 2.2). The AEF Schedule operates on two 12-month life cycles that align with the
   GFM Cycle and coincide with fiscal years. Prior to the beginning of every AEF cycle,
   functional areas will revalidate the Tempo Band alignment of their respective capability areas
   and realign forces if necessary. It is the Air Force goal that functional areas align to the least
   strenuous band to minimize risk to the force. Every 12 months, a new 24-month AEF
   Schedule will be established. The various actions that lead up to the AEF Schedule are
   outlined in paragraph 2.4.3
 30                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


Figure 2.2. AEF Schedule.




   2.4.2. AEF Battle Rhythm. The AEF operates on a 24-month life cycle. This cycle
   includes periods of normal training, preparation, and deployment vulnerability. However,
   each Tempo Band within the AEF construct operates under a different battle rhythm (see
   Figures 2.3.1 through 2.3.5).
      2.4.2.1. For most forces (those other than Band “E”), the majority of the AEF battle
      rhythm is spent in normal training during which forces concentrate on unit missions and
      basic proficiency events in accordance with applicable Air Force directives and Air Force
      Specialty Code (AFSC) requirements. This may include Joint, Air Force, or MAJCOM
      exercise participation (exercises of less than 60 days duration) such as Red Flag and
      Silver Flag. Most contingency and deployment training should take place during this
      period. This training and exercise period is also used to fill the unit's assigned/committed
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            31


     mission requirements, filling contingency requirements for 30 days or less and crisis
     response (including HUMRO and OPLAN) needs.
        2.4.2.1.1. Post-deployment reconstitution is included in this period. During the
        month immediately after deployment, the unit is focused on recovery. PCS/PCA
        moves into and out of the unit will be deconflicted to the maximum extent possible to
        occur during the 3-month period immediately after the vulnerability period.
     2.4.2.2. Prior to a unit’s deployment, a 2to 3-month deployment preparation period
     focuses unit activities on specific deployment preparation activities and area of
     responsibility (AOR) specific events, if known. Exercises of less than 30 days may be
     supported if the training is appropriate to deployment preparation (e.g. Eagle Flag).
     2.4.2.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC personnel may be tasked to support installation exercises
     during the deployment preparation period as long as the exercise participation does not
     interfere with required deployment preparations.
     2.4.2.3. The 4-month (Band “A”) or 6-month (Bands “B” through “E”) vulnerability
     period is the period of time the forces aligned in a specific AEF block are susceptible to
     initial deployment. Forces will not initially deploy outside of the vulnerability period
     except in cases of reach forward. Only one AEF block from each Tempo Band will be
     vulnerable at a time. Individuals and equipment must not participate in any activity that
     directly impacts their availability to deploy during their AEF vulnerability period unless
     specifically approved by applicable wing commander/equivalent. Exercise estimated tour
     lengths (ETLs) of 30 days or more are sourced from forces in their AEF vulnerability
     period.
     2.4.2.4. Enabler forces do not operate within a 24-month life cycle/battle rhythm. The
     Enabler battle rhythm is provided by the HAF/MAJCOM FAM as a part of the Enabler
     nomination request package. For forces aligned in the Enabler force, unit commanders
     should develop a deployment schedule that provides a measure of predictability to
     associated Airmen. However, operational requirements may force deviations from the
     applicable battle rhythm. MAJCOM/CVs will ensure appropriate mechanisms are in
     place to ensure Airmen postured as an Enabler are provided a measure of
     predictability/stability and do not violate CSAFor SecDef-redlines with respect to dwell.
     2.4.2.4. (AFGSC) AFGSC unit commanders will establish/review/update the
     deployment schedule annually and provide a copy of the schedule to the applicable
     AFGSC FAMs. Commanders will also establish procedures to ensure they do not violate
     CSAF or SecDef redlines. If a deviation is required for less than the redline with respect
     to dwell, the AFGSC/CV is approving authority.

      2.4.3.1. Joint GFM Cycle Actions. Approximately 18-24 months prior to the start of
      each GFM cycle, Joint Staff will publish a planning order outlining various milestones
      necessary to staff and publish the associated GFMAP. The timing of these actions
      directly affects the timeline needed to develop and implement the AEF Schedule.

       2.4.3.2. AEF Schedule Preparation Timeline. The AEF Schedule timeline is required to
       meet the Joint Staff GFM Master Timeline. These milestones will be modified as
       necessary to meet the GFM Master Timeline. Prior to each 24-month AEF Schedule, Air
       Force leaders, planners, and Functional Area Managers (FAM) at every level review
       lessons learned, make assessments of significant force structure changes that have
       impacted the Air Force or a particular functional area, and consider initiatives that may
       impact the way we posture, schedule, present, or execute combat capability. A
       significant increase or decrease in combatant commander requirements will also warrant
       adjustment in the rotational battle rhythm of a particular functional area. AF/A3/5 will
       publish specific milestones to support the AEF Schedule timeline. As co-chairs of the
       AEF Steering Group, AF/A5X and AFPC/CC will monitor the tasks associated with
       planning for the upcoming AEF Schedule. Air Force planners and commanders, as well
       as HAF, MAJCOM, and component headquarters FAMs must ensure their actions are
       completed in accordance with published timelines.
       2.4.3.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will monitor the applicable tasks associated with
       planning for the upcoming AEF Schedule. AFGSC FAMs will complete all required
       actions in accordance with the schedule and inform HQ AFGSC/A3CW of significant
       issues affecting the ability to support AEF planning, scheduling and/or execution.

requirements across the range of military operations (ROMO). Individuals assigned to
 38                                                   AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


institutional organizations, will also be associated to a specific AEF vulnerability period (see
Chapter 14).
   2.5.1. Forces aligned to the AEFs in the vulnerability period but not tasked to deploy will
   remain in an on-call status to reinforce forward-deployed forces or provide additional
   capability for the duration of the AEF vulnerability period (Note: ARC forces do not serve in
   an on-call status). If tasked, their deployment commitments may extend outside their
   vulnerability period. In such cases, AFPC/DPW will coordinate with supported component
   headquarters to synchronize deployments with AEF vulnerability periods (see Chapter 8).
   2.5.2. Regardless of AEF vulnerability period, all AEF forces, including those that recently
   redeployed and meet all reconstitution requirements, are vulnerable for OPLAN tasking at all
   times if the AF determines the need to reach forward (Note: SecDef approved RFF that
   requires the deployment of assets (with DOC tasked response times) in excess of UTCs in
   applicable vulnerability period removes the need to accomplish reach forward coordination).
   Airmen who deploy within their vulnerability period for 45 days or less will be considered
   for a second deployment within their vulnerability period.
   2.5.3. All Airmen will be given an AEF Indicator (AEFI) (Note: Reserve components will
   determine and publish component-specific AEFI policy). For individuals assigned to
   warfighting organizations, the AEFI will correspond to the same AEF block as the unit’s
   UTCs; for individuals assigned to the Institutional Force, the AEFI will correspond to an
   AEF vulnerability period determined by the Airman’s commander, or equivalent (Note: For
   functional areas that are centrally managed by HAF or FOA, AEFIs will be determined
   through coordination between unit commander, MAJCOM FAM, and HAF FAM). Except in
   cases of reaching forward, or instances listed in paragraph 2.4.2.1., individuals will deploy
   during their associated AEF block’s vulnerability period. Changing an individual’s AEFI
   will only be done under extenuating circumstances. See paragraph 14.3. for details on
   determining and managing Airmen’s AEFIs.
2.6. Air Force Forced-to-Source Mechanics. If requirements exceed forces readily available
within the AEF vulnerability period, the AEF is designed to meet increased requirements via
internal Air Force “forced-to-source” decisions working within the force assignment process and
the SecDef's allocation plan. Forced-to-source decisions arise out of two situations-- increased
requirements tasked to a force provider via the GFMAP (see paragraph 2.6.1.) or from a
decreased resource capacity (see paragraph 2.6.2.). Various forced-to-source methods include,
reaching deeper (using forces in the current AEF block that exceed the maximum simultaneous
deployable capability), reaching forward (using forces in the next AEF block), rebanding
capability area (an out-of-cycle realignment of the functional area into a different tempo band),
and/or mobilization of ARC forces. In addition, HAF DCS may authorize AFPC to source from
an alternate pool (using Institutional Force for unit-like (i.e. non-IA) requirements or warfighting
force for IA requirements) within the applicable AEF vulnerability period. With the exception of
re-banding, all the above methods are within a specific force provider's internal capability to
provide the forced-to-source solution. To ensure forced-to-source decisions are properly vetted
the Air Force will use Table 2.1. Sourcing solutions requiring a change to the GFMAP will be
vetted and approved via the GFM process.

Note 1: MAJCOM/CVs may make alternate pool or reach deeper decisions as a means to meet
requirements without seeking applicable HAF-level approval

Note 2: Utilization of Enabler force may be considered as a mitigation strategy to sourcing from
an alternate pool or “reaching deeper;” however, use of Enabler forces must be approved by
applicable MAJCOM/A3 (or Enabler lead agency)

Note 3: Reaching forward should be used for “initial increase” in requirements, if necessary. It
may be necessary to re-band out of cycle to meet increased demand or during the subsequent
AEF Schedule

Note 4: Reaching forward, reaching deeper, or re-banding requires coordination with the
applicable MAJCOM/A3s; if applicable, MAJCOMs will coordinate with respective assigned
CCDR or supported outside agency

Note 5: Assumes moving to more stringent Tempo Band (e.g. from Band “C” to Band “D”)

Note 7: Need to consider mobilization/additional mobilization as a mitigation strategy

Note 8: Reaching deeper involves exceeding the maximum simultaneous deployable capability.
If using assigned/committed forces (i.e. sum of DP/AP-coded), coordination with
supported/owning CCMD/J3 or outside agency is required

Note 9: If sourcing solution entails utilizing assigned forces, final coordination will be through
applicable AF FP via the GFM process

Note 10: SecDef approval is required to rotate forces without minimum dwell
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            41


  2.6.1. For emergent requirements that have not yet been ordered in the GFMAP, the AF FP
  will review if the Air Force can fulfill within the current AEF vulnerability window. If not,
  AF FP will notify AF/A3/5 of the need for forced-to-source mitigation if the Air Force is
  tasked with the requirement. AF/A3/5, in coordination with applicable DCS/equivalent, will
  make a mitigation decision in accordance with Table 2.1. (see paragraph 8.14.8.2.2. plus
  subparagraphs for detailed process). AF/A3/5 will notify AF FP, AFPC/CC, and MAJCOMs
  of forced-to-source mitigation decision.
     2.6.1.1. The Air Force will not seek forced-to-source assessments to support, or continue
     to support, exercises, unless specifically directed by AF/A3/5.
     2.6.1.2. Some capabilities may need to surge at different rates and durations to meet
     combatant commander requirements.
     2.6.1.3. Enabler assets may also be used for sourcing upon approval by the applicable
     MAJCOM A3 (ref. paragraphs 7.12.8.2 and 9.9.1). For assigned forces, the supporting
     air component should informally coordinate with their CCDR and notify the AF FP of the
     results. If a nonconcur, the AF FP should attempt to find another solution. If the
     disputed solution is the only reasonable one, the AF FP will notify the component and
     J31 and put the nomination forward via the GFM process.
  2.6.2. For forced-to-source decisions which resulted from MAJCOM(s) reclama and
  subsequent “Significant” or “High” forced-to-source assessment (see paragraph 10.21.5.6.4),
  AF FP will provide AF/A3/5 with MAJCOM assessments. A3/5, in conjunction with
  applicable HAF DCS, will review assessments and direct a forced-to-source solution (for
  unassigned/SECAF-retained forces performing Service missions), sourcing nomination (for
  assigned forces), or proceed with a Service reclama.
  2.6.3. Functional areas aligned in Band “D” experiencing demand that exceeds postured
  capabilities within the AEF vulnerability window should consider involuntary recall of ARC
  forces (see paragraph 3.8).

2.8. AEF Composition. The operations, command and control, and ECS elements required to
task organize an AETF are resident in each AEF vulnerability period. Those capabilities may
include aircraft-oriented and/or non-aircraft-oriented forces. A Numbered Expeditionary Air
Force (NEAF) is the largest AETF and consists of multiple Air Expeditionary Wings (AEW)
with subordinate Air Expeditionary Groups (AEG) and Air Expeditionary Squadrons (AES). An
AEW is structured in accordance with the Air Force combat wing structure and is capable of
establishing and operating an expeditionary base as well as exercising C2 of subordinate units at
geographically separated locations. Normally, only one AEW will be at a single location.
Subordinate units, regardless of size, will be organized as an AEG or AES. When an AETF is
comprised of AEGs at multiple operating locations, each AEG will normally be attached to the
nearest AEW in the same AETF. An AEG does not normally possess the capability to establish
and operate a base; therefore AEGs are typically tenant units at a deployed location.
   2.8.1. DELETED.
       2.8.1.1. DELETED.
       2.8.1.2. Determining the exact number of AESs, AEGs, and/or AEWs that can be
       generated is dependent on elements such as environment (permissive/non-permissive),
       available infrastructure, and duration of the requirement. Each AETF Force Module, in
       its entirety, may not be required for each location.
       2.8.1.3. Critical enabling capabilities and/or ECS may be exhausted before the full
       capability within the AEF vulnerability period has been committed. The resulting residual
       capability can either be directed to support an existing location or can be added as a
       dependent element to support another operation.
2.9. Presentation and Command & Control (C2) of AEF Forces. The Air Force presents the
full range of Air Force capabilities to the Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander via an Air & Space
Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The AETF is presented under the command of a single
Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).
   2.9.1. AETFs are sized and tailored to meet the specific mission requirements. AETFs are
   sized as Air Expeditionary Groups (AEG), Air Expeditionary Wings (AEW) or Numbered
   Expeditionary Air Forces (NEAF). Reference AFPD 10-4 for further detail.
   2.9.2. The AETF commander (COMAFFOR) must be ready to quickly assume the C2
   functions necessary to command, control and coordinate air, space and information
   operations (IO).
       2.9.2.1. The component NAF is organized and trained to support the UCC across the full
       range of military operations, with a core C2 capability that can be readily adapted to a
       specific theater requirement. The component NAF headquarters with it’s AOC weapons
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             43


       system will provide the required operational-level C2 capability, tailored for a specific
       AETF.
       2.9.2.2. Due to the unique characteristics of air, space and information power (speed,
       range, flexibility, etc.), if there are multiple simultaneous JTF operations in a given
       theater, the AETF will normally be organized at the theater level, to optimize AF
       capabilities across all JTFs.
   2.9.3. AETF forces (wings, groups, and/or squadrons) will be under the command of the
   COMAFFOR.
       2.9.3.1. Administrative control (ADCON) and specified ADCON are Service
       responsibilities and will be detailed in the appropriate G-series orders.
       2.9.3.2. Operational Control (OPCON) and Tactical Control (TACON) are combatant
       command authorities and will be delegated by the combatant commander (CCDR), as
       required, to the JTF commander and then to the COMAFFOR.
2.10. AEF Command and Control (C2). Air Force C2 operates under two central themes: the
principle of unity of command and the tenet of centralized control and decentralized execution.
Deployed active duty AEF force packages are operationally and administratively allocated to the
COMAFFOR. Operational control of ARC forces is assigned to the theater command elements;
however, administrative control of ARC forces remains with the National Guard Bureau and
HQ/AFRC. Detailed C2 concepts are contained in the AFPD 10-4; AFDD 2, Operations and
Organizations; and AFDD 2-8, Command and Control.
2.11. AETF Deployment. AETFs may deploy to meet known rotational, crisis response and
combatant commander theater engagement and theater security cooperation (TSC) requirements.
Unit readiness, proper positioning of air mobility assets, TPFDD development, deployment
requirements manning document (DRMD) development, and expeditionary site planning for
reception, beddown, and employment are keys to the process.
   2.11.1. CJCS orders provide the mission and authority to task and deploy forces to support
   operations. MAJCOM/USAF component/unit supporting plans, installation deployment plans
   (IDPs), and expeditionary site plans (ESPs) provide procedural deployment details.
   2.11.1. (AFGSC) All CJCS and USAF orders (Planning, Warning, Alert, Deployment
   Preparation, Deployment and Execution) will be transmitted through Command Post
   channels in accordance with directives. HQ AFGSC/A3C will also transmit all applicable
   CJCS and USAF order to AFGSC Installation Command Posts, Installation Deployment
   Readiness Cells (IDRCs) and Crisis Action Team (CAT) if activated. Where time-critical
   tasks are required, AFGSC/CC may issue verbal orders. In such situations, record copy
   orders will follow as time allows, normally within 72 hours.
   2.11.2. Although CJCS taskings will not always match the requirements established during
   the planning process, this prior preparation will enhance time-critical execution of AETF
   operations.

2.13. AEF Agile Combat Support. Agile Combat Support (ACS) underpins the ability of the
AEF to provide force capabilities that can rapidly respond by creating, sustaining, and protecting
all air and space power capabilities to accomplish mission objectives. ACS produces the combat
support capabilities critical to decisive air and space power. By focusing on the expeditionary
capabilities of ACS, expeditionary combat support (ECS) concepts assure AEFs are supported
and are able to operate with a small support footprint and streamlined infrastructure
requirements.
    2.13.1. ECS is the tailored ACS capability deployed to expeditionary sites, which supports
    AEFs employed in global operations. ECS functions include, but are not limited to the
    following: air traffic control and airfield management, chaplain, civil engineer (crash rescue,
    fire protection, explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), power production, and nuclear,
    biological, and chemical (NBC)), communications and information, contracting, financial
    management and comptroller, historian, judge advocate, logistics readiness (logistics plans,
    supply, fuels, vehicle operations, vehicle maintenance, traffic management and aerial port
    operations), maintenance and munitions, manpower, medical, military equal opportunity,
    counterintelligence (AFOSI), personnel, postal services, protocol, public affairs, safety,
    security forces, and services.
2.14. The USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP). The WMP consists of five volumes
and is the Air Force’s supporting document to the JSCP. The five WMP volumes provide the Air
Staff, Air Force planners, and Air Force commanders with current policies, planning factors, and
CJCS apportioned forces for conducting and supporting operations. The WMP establishes
requirements for developing mobilization and planning programs to support and sustain
contingency operations of the programmed forces. It encompasses all basic functions necessary
to match facilities, personnel, and materiel resources with planned wartime activity.
    2.14.1. The WMP volumes, access instructions, and restrictions are available electronically
    using    either   the   GCCS      or     the    A5XW        SIPRNet      homepage       at:
    http://c2www.af.pentagon.smil.mil/xoxw/.
       2.14.1.1. AF/A5XW is the Air Staff agency responsible for maintenance and update of
       information contained in the classified WMP volumes.
       2.14.1.1. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A5P is the focal point for the WMP. AFGSC OPRs for
       the volumes of the USAF WMP is contained in Table 2.2

    2.14.2. Volume 1 (WMP-1), Basic Plan and Supporting Supplements. WMP 1 provides
    a consolidated reference source for general policies and guidance for mobilization planning
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              45


  and the support of combat forces in time of war. The Basic Plan addresses the general
  situation, mission, concept of operations, and execution tasks for Air Force forces in regional
  conflicts. WMP-1 functional supplements provide a more detailed guidance for near-term
  support forces to aid Air Force planners in developing war and contingency plans. It provides
  the basic guidelines, references, and considerations needed to develop Air Force plans and to
  conduct operations during war and contingencies. As a central reference source, WMP-1,
  along with this document, aids in standardizing Air Force plans and the planning process.
     2.14.2.1. Logistics supplement to WMP-1 provides guidance for directing Logistics
     Sustainability Analysis (LSA) as directed by CJCSM 3122.03B and CJCSI 3110.03C,
     Logistics Supplement to the JSCP. The LSA anticipates combat support challenges and
     resolves them before they become showstoppers. The LSA addresses the areas of
     materiel, infrastructure, logistics support forces, and lift in detail. It identifies
     deficiencies, assesses the risk or impact on operations and any known get-well dates or
     alternative solutions, and assigns a level of risk associated with the deficiency. Only
     significant deficiencies requiring external assistance need addressing.
     2.14.2.2. Other Air Force providers of combat forces, resources and capabilities also
     provide their assessment of sustainability to the A-4. The entire intent of the LSA is to
     provide a broad assessment of key combat logistics support and enabler capabilities
     required to execute the combatant commander's planned operation.
     2.14.2.3. It is the responsibility of functional areas managers (FAMs) and planners at all
     levels to analyze and review WMP-1 guidance for their respective functional areas.
     FAMs will work closely with Air Staff to ensure compliance with guidance, resolve any
     contentious issues, and ensure the most effective management of forces.
         2.14.2.3.1. MAJCOM inputs to WMP-1 supplements will be submitted to the Air
         Staff FAM for revision. It is the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA staff FAMs’ responsibility to
         ensure their respective units receive any new guidance pertaining to their functional
         areas.
         2.14.2.3.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC FAMs will coordinate inputs to the functional
         annexes of the USAF WMP-1 with HQ AFGSC/A5/8 prior to submission to their
         Headquarters Air Force counterparts. AFGSC FAMs will ensure the contents of the
         functional annexes to the USAF WMP-1 are communicated to their installation
         counterparts.
  2.14.3. Volume 2 (WMP-2), Plans Listing and Summary. W MP-2 is the single-source
  document that provides the listing of all active plans with TPFDDs. At a minimum, this list
  will include JSCP tasked plans and their associated "working slices" (the Air Force portion of
  the TPFDD).
     2.14.3.1. The WMP 2 is made up of two parts. Part 1 consists of a listing of Combatant
     Commander plans required by the JSCP. This listing is provided and maintained by the
     Joint Staff/J7 directorate staff.
     2.14.3.2. Part 2 consists of the supporting plans that are written by component
     headquarters in support of part 1. Component headquarters will provide WMP-2 updates
     by forwarding plan details (i.e., plan name, number, description, with or without TPFDD,
     office of primary responsibility (OPR), date, and classification) to AF/A5XW.

     AF/A5XW will maintain an updated listing on their Global Command and Control
     System (GCCS)/ Secret Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET) homepage at:
     http://c2www.af.pentagon.smil.mil/xoxw/.
  2.14.4. Volume 3 (WMP-3), Combat and Support Forces. WMP-3 has four parts. Part 1
  contains combat forces. Part 2 is the Air Force Unit Type Code (UTC) Availability and
  contains all postured UTC capability in the Air Force. Part 3 contains the Air Force
  Readiness Spares Package (RSP) authorization document. Part 4 is the Capability Annexes to
  the Air & Space Expeditionary Force Presence Policy (AEFPP).
     2.14.4.1. WMP-3, Part 1, lists all available combat forces by type aircraft, unit
     identification, unit availability date, and scenarios or theaters for which they are
     apportioned in accordance with the CJCS force apportionment for contingency planning.
     The forces listed are a snapshot of available Air Force aircraft (current or programmed)
     apportioned to each combatant command as of the 1st quarter of each fiscal year (FY) as
     specified in the WMP-3 Part 1 database and that correspond to the CJCS force
     apportionment.
         2.14.4.1.1. Once the JSCP has been finalized, combatant commands’ force
         apportionment may change based on deactivation of units, conversion of units from
         one mission design series (MDS) to another, or additions to the Air Force's force
         structure. If there are differences between JCSP apportionment and WMP-3 Part 1,
         WMP will take precedence.
         2.14.4.1.2. The WMP-3 Part 1 is maintained by AF/A5XW with inputs on force
         structure from AF/A8P and input on specific data elements, wartime information, and
         unit selections from the MAJCOMs and component headquarters.
         2.14.4.1.3. When building OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDDs, component headquarters
         will use only the forces identified in the WMP-3 Part 1 for their apportioned
         theater/scenario.
     2.14.4.2. WMP-3, Part 2, UTC Availability, is the official comprehensive data source for
     identifying all Air Force UTCs. It contains all postured UTC capability in the Air Force
     listed by UTC/ unit identification code (UIC)/Record Number. This UTC availability
     represents the Air Force's commitment to support CJCS requirements, combatant
     commander, and Service unique requirements, and documents all conventional and
     Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) capabilities for all active, guard and reserve
     units.
         2.14.4.2.1. The UTC Availability will be maintained by each force-providing
         organization
         2.14.4.2.1. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW maintains UTC Availability for AFGSC.
         AFGSC FAMs will ensure the accuracy and currency of their functional area UTCs
         by reviewing UTC Availability at least quarterly and providing changes to HQ
         AFGSC/A3CW to update UTC Availability.
         2.14.4.2.2. Each listed UTC contains the mission capability statement as well as
         deployment characteristics of the UTC in terms of personnel and cargo tonnage
         requiring transportation.

     2.14.4.3. WMP-3, Part 3, formerly Mission Capability Statements (MISCAPs), is the
     RSP and contains the wartime spares authorized for aviation units for wartime
     contingencies. The type of RSP each aviation unit is authorized is identified in the WMP-
     3 Part 1 database.
     2.14.4.4. WMP-3, Part 4 (new) is the Capability Annexes associated with the AEFPP.
     The AEFPP Capability Annexes describe how the Air Force makes its forces available in
     the assignment, apportionment, and allocation to combatant commanders.
  2.14.5. Volume 4 (WMP-4), Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA). WMP-4 is governed by
  this instruction and AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and
  Procedure. WMP-4 documents the deployment, positioning, and employment of activity of
  Air Force aviation units for each geographical location (GEOLOC) having aircraft passing
  through or operation from it in support of all regional operation plans (OPLAN) and certain
  concept plans (CONPLAN). WMP-4 also contains Mission Oriented Items (MOI) and Non-
  Aircraft Unit Related Ration Requirements.
  2.14.5. (AFGSC) AFGSC FAMs provide the applicable portions of the WMP-4 to their
  subordinate units.
     2.14.5.1. The WAA is presented in WMP-4, Parts 1 and 2. Part 1 (Current Year) and Part
     2 (Outyear 1) correspond to the JSCP planning cycle. The WAA resides in the Wartime
     Aircraft Activity Report database that is updated using the Logistics Feasibility Analysis
     Capability (LOGFAC) system, which is accessible using GCCS. See Chapter 4.
     2.14.5.2. The MOI is presented in WMP-4, Part 3. This portion of WMP-4 identifies
     missile preposition requirements by type and quantity in support of
     OPLANs/CONPLANs.
     2.14.5.3. The Non-Aircraft Unit Related Rations Requirement is presented in WMP-4,
     Part 4. This portion of WMP-4 has the capability of identifying meals ready-to-eat
     (MRE) requirements at deployment and employment locations. It also includes MRE
     requirements in support of personnel assigned to, and/or being deployed to missile sites.
     MRE requirements to support aircrews associated with wartime aircraft activity in Parts 1
     and 2 are contained the War Consumables Distribution Objectives (WCDO).
     2.14.5.4. As necessary, MAJCOMs will reproduce applicable portions of WMP-4 and
     distribute them to subordinate units, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and
     Air National Guard (ANG) units.
     2.14.5.4. (AFGSC) Updated WMP-4 portions will be distributed by HQ AFGSC/A4R
     to applicable wings through the IDRCs as necessary.
  2.14.6. Volume 5 (WMP-5), Basic Planning Factors and Data. WMP-5 provides
  approved US Air Force planning factors by aircraft type and theater, serving as a basis for
  establishing worldwide support for programmed force levels. These factors, derived for
  aircraft apportioned in WMP-3 in support of the JSCP, are used to develop the WMP-4,
  providing the basis for planning and pre-positioning of war reserve material. They indicate
  the USAF position on supportable sustainment levels for USAF aviation assets, but are not
  intended to restrict employment options of Unified Combatant Command commanders.

   However, exceeding WMP-5 sortie rates/flying hours will shorten the sustainable duration
   below that prescribed in strategic planning guidance.
2.15. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES). DCAPES
is the Air Force’s war planning system and provides an Air Force feed to JOPES automated data
processing (ADP). The objective of DCAPES is to enable improved and streamlined operations
planning and execution processes which include associated policy and procedures, along with
organizational and technology improvements. DCAPES provides standard data files, formats,
application programs, and management procedures that are Air Force unique and joint guidance
compliant and used primarily for force planning, sourcing equipment and personnel
requirements, transportation feasibility estimation, civil engineering support, and medical
planning. DCAPES is detailed in Chapter 4.
2.15. (AFGSC)Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution                   Segments
(DCAPES). HQ AFGSC/A3CW is the functional system manager for DCAPES.
   2.15.1. DCAPES supports all phases of operations planning and execution at the HAF, major
   command, component, and wing/squadron level. It provides data manipulation capability to
   Air Force planners to perform rapid OPLAN development, conduct feasibility and capability
   analyses, and support mobilization, deployment, sustainment, redeployment, demobilization,
   reconstitution, and personnel accounting of forces.
   2.15.2. JOPES provides the joint architecture for establishing and communicating Air Force
   requirements supporting the JSCP and Air Force WMP. The primary means of
   communicating planning data among Air Force commands and agencies will be through the
   exchange of JOPES TPFDDs, DCAPES detailed plan requirements data, and Logistics
   Planning Files (LPF).
   2.15.2. (AFGSC) All AFGSC involvement with TPFDDs will occur using the GCCS
   JOPES/DCAPES systems. TPFDDs will be made available to Command subordinate
   activities for planning immediately following each OPLAN's force list
   development/refinement. Each OPLAN's JOPES/DCAPES database will be made available
   to AFGSC installation planners via GCCS. Each AFGSC installation commander will
   designate an installation (organizational) lead for OPLAN TPFDDs.
   2.15.3. DCAPES and JOPES share common business rules and automated data processing
   (ADP) procedures and policies to plan and execute joint military operations. Air Force
   planners at all levels will use DCAPES to support the combatant commander’s selected
   course of action (COA) in a timely manner.
   2.15.4. DCAPES is CJCSM 3150.16 compliant, and supports JOPES ADP by establishing a
   standard Air Force support system in GCCS for joint operation planning and execution.
   DCAPES uses the JOPESREP for exchanging formatted data among the unified commands,
   Services, Service components, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM),
   the JS, and DOD agencies. DCAPES transactions that support JOPES procedures are the
   mechanisms for submitting movement requirements to USTRANSCOM.
   2.15.5. DCAPES supports accurate and timely sourcing which includes validation and
   verification. DCAPES also supports sourcing and tailoring of lower levels of detail beyond
   the JOPES level of detail.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                                49


2.16. Packaging Air Force Capability. The Air Force will use the AETF force modules (FM)
and Operational Capability Packages (OCP) for standardized force packaging. Standardizing the
planning and execution of how forces are presented will ensure a repeatable and effective
process. The Air Force implements this requirement through the multiple AETF FMs. The AETF
FMs incorporate a balance of required combat, ECS, and C2 UTCs required to accomplish the
mission to open, establish, operate, and sustain an airbase. Currently, the AETF FMs consist of
Open the Airbase, Command and Control, Establish the Airbase, Generate the Mission, Operate
the Airbase, and Robust the Airbase.
   2.16.1. Planning will be accomplished using the AETF FMs and OCPs. Air Force planners
   who build and submit TPFDD requirements will use the AETF FMs as a starting point for
   TPFDD development. The AETF FMs are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
   2.16.2. These are not the only FMs in JOPES. Planners will continue to use
   additional/different FMs to link capabilities together in contingency and operational plans.
   2.16.3. The AETF FMs provide a baseline for Air Force planners. Variations to the force
   modules, to include capability to close an airbase, are contained in operational capability
   packages (OCPs). OCPs are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
2.17. Training for Air Force Planners. War planners and functional area managers at all
levels play a significant role in support of the operational planning process. They are responsible
for supporting, developing, and managing planning and execution requirements to support all
possible wartime contingencies. Continual involvement in the war planning process is essential
to accomplishing the Air Force's wartime mission. There are several formal and informal courses
available to provide individuals basic operational and wartime planning instruction.
   2.17.1. Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC). CWPC teaches the basic
   planning process to war planners at all levels. The depth of instruction is sufficient to bring
   students to a level of comprehension that enables them to carry out their duties more
   effectively and decrease the steep learning curve associated with war planning. CWPC is
   highly desired for individuals seeking fundamental knowledge as war planners. AF/A5XW is
   the Air Staff CWPC sponsor.
   2.17.1. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW is the course manager for the AF Contingency
   Wartime Planners Course (CWPC) for AFGSC. Responsibilities include student scheduling
   and MAJCOM quota management.
   2.17.2. DCAPES Functional Training. This training is for DCAPES functional users
   (logistics, manpower, personnel, and/or operations planners) who currently use JOPES
   Editing Tool (JET) and/ or DCAPES on a regular basis. Additional users include data
   analysts from headquarters staff positions, and MAJCOM Manpower and Equipment Force
   Packaging (MEFPAK) System managers currently involved in the UTC MEFPAK
   management process. MAJCOM and HQ level DCAPES and JOPES functional managers are
   OPRs for scheduling DCAPES functional training.
   2.17.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW is the overall OPR for DCAPES training. Some
   functional aspects of the training are monitored by HQ AFGSC/A1K and A4R. HQ
   AFGSC/A3CW is the course manager for DCAPES MAJCOM Functional Area Manager
   Course for AFGSC. Responsibilities include student scheduling and MAJCOM quota
   management.

  2.17.3. JOPES Editing Tool (JET) Users. Current JET users will preferably be graduates
  of the Joint Deployment Training Center (JDTC) courses (discussed below) or will have one-
  year experience on JET at HAF, MAJCOM, or component level. Candidates and attendees
  should be CWPC graduates. Students who are not CWPC graduates but require this class
  may take the CWPC online primer available on the Air University CADRE CWPC website.
  http://www.cadre.maxwell.af.mil/warfarestudies/cwpc/cwpcprimer/crsmap.htm. As a
  minimum, students should accomplish the "Planning Systems and Tools" segment. All
  students must have basic computer skills (e.g., mouse, keyboard, and editing tools facility).
  MAJCOM and HQ level DCAPES and JOPES functional managers are OPRs for scheduling
  JET training. The JDTC at Fort Eustis, Virginia is the OPR for this course.
  2.17.3. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW is the course manager for JOPES training courses for
  AFGSC. Responsibilities include student scheduling and MAJCOM quota management.
  2.17.4. JOPES Support Personnel Course (JSPC). JSPC is a course designed for JOPES
  support personnel who use JOPES applications in the support of the Joint Planning and
  Execution Process. The course emphasizes the role and use of JOPES applications in support
  of the six Crisis Action Planning phases, with special emphasis on procedures and
  applications outlined in CJCSM 3122.02B. Students are taught to build, modify, and delete
  TPFDD requirements, participate in TPFDD validation, and then monitor the deployment
  execution. The JDTC at Fort Eustis, Virginia is the OPR for this course.
  2.17.5. JOPES Action Officer Course (JAOC). JAOC is a course designed in response to
  the Joint Planning and Execution Community’s request for JOPES training for action officers
  from all Services directly working in or in support of a unified command. Candidates use
  their working knowledge of JOPES systems in order to write and enforce sound TPFDD
  guidance, find and correct errors, perform update functions, perform all phases in the
  Validation and Movement process, and produce TPFDD-based decision support information.
  The JDTC at Ft Eustis Virginia is the OPR for this course.
  2.17.6. COMAFFOR Senior Staff Course (CSSC). CSSC is a mentored seminar for Air
  Force colonels exercising executive responsibilities, recommending force application and
  movement, maintaining situational awareness, developing responsive courses of action and
  adaptive plans in command and control organizations above base level. COMAFFOR Special
  and A-Staff Directors are specifically targeted, as are Air Force colonels supporting
  combatant commander staffs. In a seminar setting, senior officers examine critical
  COMAFFOR and combatant commander situations and lessons learned thru case studies and
  mentor interaction. AF/A3O is the Air Staff CSSC sponsor.
  2.17.7. Joint Air Operations Planning Course (JAOPC). JAOPC helps prepare
  individuals to serve on the staff of a Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander
  (C/JFACC) and educates them in the fundamental concepts, principles, and doctrine required
  to develop the Air portion of a joint/combined Campaign Plan. JAOPC teaches the basic Air
  Estimate Planning process. While this process is the standard by which the C/JFACC plans
  the air war, it is also almost identical to the Joint Operational Planning Process (JOPP), by
  which the Joint Forces Commander plans the theater campaign. AF/A5XS is the Air Staff
  JAOP sponsor.
  2.17.8. AFFOR Intermediate Staff Course (AISC). AISC trains selected intermediate
  staff officers with the roles and responsibilities of the AFFOR Staff across the full range of
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                        51


  military operations from peacetime steady-state to major combat operations. AISC targets
  captains through lieutenant colonels and E-5 through Senior NCOs who may deploy to
  COMAFFOR Staffs. The course is conducted in a classroom environment to train students to
  perform duties in pre-deployment functions, planning functions, tools and systems, AFFOR
  processes, reach back operations (OSF, RAT), AOC integration, and exercise participation.
  ACC/A3Y is the Air Staff AISC sponsor.

               OPERATIONS PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION

Section 3A—Purpose

3.1. Purpose. Provide an overview of operational plan development and execution in support of
the joint planning process. This chapter will provide a fundamental understanding of
contingency, crisis action, and sustainment plan development, the hierarchy of plans, and the
processes that support them.

Section 3B—Background

3.2. Planning Processes. Planning is a continuous, iterative, and highly structured process that
allows for an orderly transition from peace to war and post-hostilities operations. Planning
enables proactive, risk-informed global force management decisions resulting in the timely
allocation of forces/capabilities necessary to execute a combatant commander’s mission.
Planning ensures the systematic deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of
U.S. Forces to meet commander requirements across the Range of Military Options (ROMO).
The Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC) utilizes two general planning processes:
crisis action and contingency planning (formerly called deliberate planning). Crisis action
planning is driven by current events in real time and normally occurs in emergencies and in the
context of time-sensitive situations. Contingency planning is accomplished in the absence of an
active crisis in response to scenarios and threats identified by combatant commanders and in
national guidance such as the JSCP. Global Force Management (GFM) processes will
increasingly govern the planning process. Currently, crisis action and contingency planning use
different planning cycles.
   3.2.1. The JPEC accomplishes planning. The JPEC includes the CJCS, Joint Staff and
   Services, the supported and supporting commands and their components, defense agencies,
   non-DOD departments and agencies, and Allied Commands and agencies.
   3.2.2. The resulting plans are implemented through a series of universally understood orders.
   These orders provide the mechanism for bringing together the resources, equipment, and
   personnel needed in a military response. Both contingency and crisis planning are driven by
   joint processes and conducted within JOPES.
   3.2.3. This chapter provides an overview of the planning process. CJCSM 3122.01A,
   CJCSM3122.03B, and CJCSM 3122.02C provide detailed guidance and instructions on the
   planning process. Subsequent chapters in this instruction augment the JOPES volumes with
   detailed Air Force guidance and instructions.
   3.2.4. DELETED

Section 3C—Types of Plans

3.3. Types of Plans. Planning results in different types of plans depending on the level of detail
required. These are operational plans (OPLANs), concept plans (CONPLANs), functional plans
(FUNCPLANs), supporting plans and operation orders (OPORDS).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              53


   3.3.1. OPLANs. An OPLAN is a written description of the combatant commander's concept
   of operations to counter a perceived threat. An OPLAN includes all required annexes,
   appendices, and a supporting TPFDD. It may be used as the basis of a campaign plan (if
   required) and then developed into an operations order (OPORD).
   3.3.2. CONPLANs. A CONPLAN is an operational plan in an abbreviated format that may
   require considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN. The objective of
   concept planning is to develop sound operational and support concepts that can be rapidly
   expanded into an OPORD if necessary. Unless specified in the JSCP, detailed support
   requirements are not calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. A CONPLAN may or
   may not have an associated TPFDD.
   3.3.3. Functional Plans (FUNCPLAN). Functional plans involve military operations in a
   peacetime or permissive environment. These types of plans are tasked by the JSCP for
   humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, peacekeeping, or counter-drug operations. Functional
   plans are written using the JOPES procedures and formats specified for a CONPLAN
   without a TPFDD.
   3.3.4. Supporting Plans. Supporting plans are prepared as tasked by the supported
   combatant commanders in support of their contingency plans. They are prepared by
   supporting combatant commanders, subordinate joint force commanders, component
   commanders, or other agencies. These commanders may, in turn, assign their subordinates
   the task of preparing additional supporting plans.
   3.3.5. Operation Order (OPORD). OPORDs are prepared under joint procedures in
   prescribed formats during crisis action planning. They appear in the form of a directive
   issued by a commander to subordinates to effect the coordinated execution of an operation
   (e.g. air operations, training exercises, etc.). Normally, a combatant commander issues
   OPORDs to the Service component headquarters to effect the coordinated execution of an
   operation.

Section 3D—Planning

3.4. DCAPES, Force Modules, and UTCs. Air Force planners, regardless of organization, will
use DCAPES, force modules, and UTCs during the planning process. DCAPES is the Air Force
feeder to JOPES. DCAPES use is directed because it provides a variety of capabilities to Air
Force planners and agencies not found in JOPES that are necessary for management and
oversight of Air Force planning and execution. Force modules and UTCs are the building blocks
of AEWs, AEGs, and AESs -the way the Air Force presents and sources capabilities to the JPEC.
DCAPES, force modules, and UTCs are detailed in later chapters of this instruction.
3.5. Air Force Planning. Planning, whether legacy or Adaptive has contingency and crisis
action components.
   3.5.1. Contingency Planning (formerly referred as Deliberate Planning). Combatant
   commanders, their components, and supporting commands accomplish contingency planning
   during peacetime conditions. Planners use scenarios and threats identified in national
   guidance, such as the JSCP, along with the combatant commander's evaluation of their AOR,
   to develop a series of plans that span a wide range of operations.
54                                                   AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


     3.5.1.1. This formal process develops responses to potential crises, determines forces
     required to achieve objectives, prepares deployment plans, and continually evaluates
     selected courses of action (COAs). This process results in a series of formal plans within
     each theater that contain lists of apportioned forces and their time-phased deployment
     schedules.
     3.5.1.2. The process for contingency planning is cyclic and continual and is almost
     identical whether the resulting operation plan is a fully developed OPLAN, CONPLAN,
     or FUNCPLAN. Operations plans remain in effect until canceled or superceded by
     another approved plan. While in effect, they are continuously maintained and updated.
  3.5.2. Crisis Action Planning. Crisis action planning is driven by current events in real
  time and normally occurs in emergencies and in the context of time-sensitive situations.
  Planners base their efforts on the actual circumstances that exist when crisis action planning
  occurs. Detailed guidance and instructions are located in JOPES Volumes I-III.
     3.5.2.1. Ideally, an existing contingency plan addresses the crisis situation. If there is not
     a contingency plan that can be used or modified to respond to the crisis, planners must
     start from scratch.
     3.5.2.2. Each MAJCOM must establish complementary procedures and must ensure
     adequate procedures exist for subordinate command and agency use.
     3.5.2.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CX is the overall AFGSC OPR for Crisis Action
     Planning. All HQ AFGSC A-Staff/Functional Directorates will have primary and
     alternate POCs trained and proficient in their functional area. Commanders of AFGSC
     installations, Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) and Geographically Separated Units (GSUs)
     will ensure they have primary and alternate POCs trained and proficient in contingency
     and crisis action planning for each of their functions that may be involved in contingency
     planning and execution. These POCs will be included as members of their organizational
     CAT and will support operations in which contingency or crisis action planning processes
     are employed.
     3.5.2.3. These procedures must be periodically exercised during joint and unilateral
     command post exercises and field training exercises to ensure the required capability is
     available.
     3.5.2.3. (AFGSC) AFGSC participation in any exercise involving crisis action planning
     will employ real world processes whenever possible. Exercise simulations/deviations
     will be kept to an absolute minimum.
     3.5.2.4. The JPEC’s Global Force Management (GFM) process developed policy and
     procedures in support of Commander, U.S. Joint Forces Command (CDRUSJFCOM) as
     the DOD primary joint force provider (JFP). Commander, Air Combat Command
     (COMACC), as the Air Force component commander to USJFCOM, is the Air Force’s
     primary Service force provider. MAJCOM and AEFC roles in sourcing crisis
     requirements will mature under GFM. The GFMB and CDRUSJFCOM will establish
     complementary procedures to determine sourcing recommendations and issues related to
     risk to sourcing other requirements, sustainability assessment and issues identified by
     other combatant commanders and JFCOM Service components. The AEFC and each
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            55


     MAJCOM must establish complementary procedures. MAJCOMs must ensure adequate
     procedures exist for subordinate command and agency use.
     3.5.2.4. (AFGSC) For crisis action planning events, HQ AFGSC/A3CW will ensure the
     appropriate execution plan and applicable newsgroups are reviewed at least daily or more
     frequent as the situation dictates. AFGSC FAMs must be readily available for time-
     sensitive tasking verifications.
     3.5.2.5. The primary JFP, in coordination with other combatant commanders and
     Services:
         3.5.2.5.1. Determines global joint combat and ECS (joint term: combat support and
         combat service support) sourcing solutions that satisfy validated combatant command
         requests for capability/forces (RFC/RFF) of conventional forces. The sourcing
         solutions are provided as a recommendation to the JCS for SecDef approval and
         include: capability substitution options, mobilization requirements, and an assessment
         of applicable military risk associated with the recommended sourcing options.
         3.5.2.5.2. Coordinates and recommends actions to sustain the level of capabilities or
         globally available forces to respond to validated combatant commander requirements.
  3.5.3. General tasks, roles and responsibilities for Air Force planners.
     3.5.3.1. The Air Force Planning and Execution Community (AFPEC). The AFPEC
     is the Air Force complement to the JPEC. The AFPEC membership includes HAF, Air
     Force component headquarters, MAJCOMs, AEFC, and ARC.
     3.5.3.2. Headquarters, U.S. Air Force (HAF):
         3.5.3.2.1. HAF advises component headquarters planners, via the WMP-3 Parts 1-4,
         of the resources available to support joint requirements.
         3.5.3.2.2. HAF Regional Plans and Issues (AF/A5XX) is the Air Force POC for
         contingency plan reviews. AF/A5XX tasks HAF and relevant Air Force component
         and MAJCOM OCRs to review plans and provide comments in accordance with
         CJCSM 3141.01C, Procedures for the Review of Operation Plans. Tasked HAF
         Agencies and OCRs determine whether the scope and concept of operations are
         sufficient to accomplish the task assigned; assess the validity of the assumptions;
         evaluate compliance with CJCS tasking, guidance, and consistency with joint and Air
         Force doctrine; and evaluate acceptability in regards to expected costs and military
         and political supportability. AF/A5XX tasks HAF OCRs to review plans in
         accordance with CJCSM 3141.01C.
     3.5.3.3. Component Headquarters:
         3.5.3.3.1. Component commanders, joint task force commanders, and subordinate
         unified commanders support concept development, COA development, and other
         tasks as directed by the supported command and the JFP.
         3.5.3.3.2. Planners from various functional areas may be tasked to produce
         "estimates of the situation." These estimates help determine supportability of courses
         of action by appropriate staff directors. The format for the estimate of the situation
56                                              AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


     may be tailored to suit the functional area and specific needs of the OPLAN being
     supported.
     3.5.3.3.3. The commander's estimate and other planning guidance should be used by
     the planner as a reference document for drafting the functional area input to the plan.
        3.5.3.3.3.1. CJCSM 3122.02B gives sample formats.
     3.5.3.3.4. The combatant command and its components develop an executable
     operational plan in support of the concept of operations. The forces and capabilities
     necessary to execute the plan are identified in a detailed transportation-feasible force
     flow (the TPFDD).
     3.5.3.3.5. In contingency planning, the combat and support units, materiel and
     personnel are entered into the TPFDD using the AEFPP Capability Annexes (WMP
     3, Part 4) as a baseline. The normal process consists of sequentially refining forces,
     logistics, and transportation data in a series of conferences to develop a TPFDD that
     supports a feasible and adequate plan. Under the adaptive planning construct, the
     supported CCDR may combine any of these Force Flow Conferences to meet
     planning timelines. Supporting commands and MAJCOMs will assist with TPFDD
     sourcing, verification and validation and supporting plan development (see Chapter
     8).
        3.5.3.3.5.1. Forces conference. Services source and tailor major combat forces
        for the plan. The Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) capabilities (for Air Force
        forces) and combat support and combat service support forces (for other Services)
        are sourced next. AF/A5XW sources ECS requirements in the Air Force slice of
        contingency plans except for in-theater assets that are sourced by the component
        headquarters.
        3.5.3.3.5.2. Logistics conference. Participants identify the quantities of supplies,
        equipment, and replacement personnel required to sustain the forces selected
        during force planning.
        3.5.3.3.5.3. Transportation conference. Participants ensure the strategic
        movement of forces and supplies is transportation feasible. This includes
        adherence to diplomatic clearance requirements outlined in the DOD 4500.54-G,
        DOD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), as well as Joint doctrinal guidance and
        Host Nation agreements and arrangements.
        3.5.3.3.5.4. The supported component headquarters planners develop the total
        force package required for the operation starting with the major combat forces
        selected from those apportioned for planning in the CJCS force apportionment
        and identified in the WMP-3 Part 1.
        3.5.3.3.5.5. Planners will coordinate with their ARC counterparts to the
        maximum extent possible regarding the usage of ARC forces.
        3.5.3.3.5.6. The supported component headquarters will ensure that contingency
        and crisis planning factors comply with HN agreements and DOD 4500.54-G.
        This planning must include deployment, employment and sustainment
        requirements across the regional combatant command area of responsibility
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            57


           (AOR), including en route countries as necessary. Ensure that US Embassy or US
           Defense Representative receive a copy of CJCS Orders to assure that U.S.
           Embassies have sufficient time, input and manpower to support coordination with
           HN.
        3.5.3.3.6. For contingency planning, component headquarters planners identify
        requirements for all Air Force forces and sustainment. Requirements for contingency
        plans will be forwarded to A5XW for sourcing using procedures outlined in Chapter
        8.
        3.5.3.3.7. In crisis action planning, potential supporting force providers monitor
        COA development and begin preliminary planning for providing forces, including
        necessary mobilization and sustainment. The supported component headquarters will
        use TPFDDs developed during the contingency planning process, if available, as a
        starting point to refine force requirements. If a contingency TPFDD is unavailable,
        component headquarters planners will use the Military Decision Making Process in
        Joint Pub 5.0 to determine the force, support, and transportation requirements to
        build, deploy, and support the AETF required to complete the tasked mission.
        3.5.3.3.8. In execution, the supported component headquarters directly aids the
        combatant commander’s OPORD execution, force flow scheduling and monitoring,
        and force employment.
        3.5.3.3.9. In execution, the supporting Air Force force providers execute their
        supporting plans, providing forces and movement visibility within DCAPES.
        3.5.3.3.10. Supported component headquarters complete a CRM code review 180
        days prior to each AEF pair. CRM codes are changing on a routine basis as they
        accommodate changing deployed command ACR requests.
     3.5.3.4. MAJCOMs:
        3.5.3.4.1. Supporting MAJCOMs will submit supporting plans according to the
        instructions of the component headquarters with primary planning responsibility. The
        component headquarters will review the submitted OPLANs and advise the
        MAJCOMs if the OPLANs require changes. MAJCOMs will adjust supporting plans
        as required. Necessary planning guidance is published in this instruction, JOPES
        Volume I-III, and the U.S. Air Force WMP.
        3.5.3.4.2. Supporting MAJCOMs providing supplemental guidance to this instruction
        will include guidance and procedures for command-gained units to review OPLAN
        and      identify    discrepancies     between      taskings    and     actual     unit
        capabilities/authorizations. Mission-limiting discrepancies are to be identified to the
        MAJCOM OPLAN OPR and appropriate functional area managers through command
        channels. Such reviews are commonly referred to as unit supportability estimates or
        feasibility studies.
        3.5.3.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A5P is the HQ AFGSC OPR for Unified
        and Specified Command plans and reviews all plans for impacts upon AFGSC. HQ
        AFGSC/A5P tasks HQ AFGSC A-Staff/Functional Directorates to review plans and
        provide substantive comments. HQ AFGSC/A5P consolidates the AFGSC position
 58                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


          on the plan being reviewed and provides comments/recommended changes to AF or
          the AF Component Commander. HQ AFGSC/A5P furnishes issues that surface
          during plan review to other AF agencies responsible for those areas.
          3.5.3.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW provides Command planning
          information to AEF conferences and is the Command's single point of dissemination
          for notifying units to prepare for rotational deployments.
          3.5.3.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) HQ           AFGSC/A3CW       supports   the    AFGSC
          Expeditionary Combat Support Scheduling Integrated Product Team (ECS SIPT)
          representative by coordinating participation of the Command's on-call forces; un-
          tasked, but available (residual) AEF forces. HQ AFGSC/A3CW is the AFGSC OPR
          for receiving, sourcing and verifying Supported Commanders' TPFDDs. HQ
          AFGSC/A5PO is the AFGSC OPR for attending Operation Plan (OPLAN) planning
          conferences and participating in required OPLAN development and refinement
          conferences.
          3.5.3.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) Each AFGSC installation-level document will be
          assigned the same plan identity number as the AFGSC plan or directive it supports or
          implements. The supported AFGSC plan will always be shown as a reference in the
          installation-level plan.

Section 3E—Crisis Action Planning Orders

3.6. Crisis Action Planning Orders. Several orders are used to direct preparations, planning,
deployment, and execution of plans in response to crises. A brief discussion of each order
follows. See CJCSM3122.01A for a more detailed discussion.
   3.6.1. The Warning Order (WARNORD). The CJCS Warning Order initiates COA
   development and applies to the supported command and supporting commands. It is
   normally published by the CJCS during Phase II planning. The WARNORD establishes
   command relationships (designating supported and supporting commanders) and provides the
   mission, objectives, and known constraints. It establishes a tentative C-day and L-hour. It
   may apportion capabilities for planning purposes or task the combatant commander to
   develop a list of forces required to confront the crisis. A warning order does not authorize
   movement of forces unless specifically stated. If the crisis is progressing rapidly, a
   planning order or alert order may be issued instead.
       3.6.1.1. When a WARNORD is issued, the Air Force component headquarters
       commander prepares a TPFDD in DCAPES for the Air Force portion of the supported
       commander’s TPFDD in JOPES in accordance with CJCSM 3122.01A and CJCSM
       3122.02B. The AEFC sources for Air Force requirements. . See Chapter 8 for details.
   3.6.2. The Planning Order (PLANORD). The CJCS can send a PLANORD to the
   supported commander and JPEC to direct execution planning before a COA is formally
   approved by the SecDef and President of the United States (POTUS). If the PLANORD is
   used in lieu of a WARNORD, the PLANORD will include a COA, provide combat forces
   and strategic lift for planning purposes, and establish a tentative C-day and L-hour. The
   PLANORD will not be used to deploy forces or increase readiness unless approved by the
   SecDef.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                                59


       3.6.2.1. When a PLANORD is issued, the Air Force component headquarters
       commander prepares a TPFDD in DCAPES for the Air Force portion of the supported
       commander’s JOPES TPFDD in accordance with CJCSM 3122.01A and CJCSM
       3122.02B. The AEFC sources Air Force requirements. See Chapter 8 for details.
   3.6.3. The Alert Order (ALERTORD). The SecDef approves and transmits an
   ALERTORD to the supported commander and JPEC announcing the selected COA. This
   order will describe the COA sufficiently to allow the supported commander and JPEC to
   begin or continue the detailed planning necessary to deploy forces. If the ALERTORD is
   used in lieu of a WARNORD, the PLANORD will include a COA, provide combat forces
   and strategic lift for planning purposes, and establish a tentative C-day and L-hour. In a time-
   sensitive crisis, an Execute Order may be issued in lieu of an ALERTORD.
   3.6.4. The Execute Order (EXORD). This order is issued by the authority and direction of
   the SecDef and directs the deployment and/or employment of forces. If the EXORD was
   preceded by a detailed Alert Order or PLANORD, then the EXORD simply directs the
   deployment and employment of forces. If nature of the crisis results in an EXORD being the
   only order dispatched, then the EXORD must include all the information normally contained
   in the warning, alert, and planning orders. The goal of the crisis action planning system is to
   reserve the EXORD solely for initiating or terminating the employment of U.S. military
   forces. The DEPORD is the appropriate instrument to change force structure during an
   operation.
   3.6.5. The Prepare to Deploy Order (PTDO), Deployment Order (DEPORD) and
   Redeployment Order. Issued by the SecDef, these orders are used to prepare forces to
   deploy or deploy forces without approving the execution of a plan or OPORD. Prior to
   issuance, JFCOM develops a draft DEPORD with recommended sourcing solutions. The
   Joint Staff coordinates the draft DEPORD with agencies and OSD then forwards the
   proposed DEPORD to SecDef for approval.
       3.6.5.1. When a PTDO or DEPORD is issued, the AEFC, through ACC, sources Air
       Force requirements. See Chapter 8.
   3.6.6. Upon receipt of the CJCS Orders, the HAF Crisis Action Team (AFCAT) (or Air
   Force Operations Group (AFOG) if the CAT is not stood up) will transmit an order to all
   U.S. Air Force components and commands. This order will delineate all Air Force assets and
   taskings as well as relationships and tasking authority between the supported component
   headquarters and supporting Air Force commands and agencies.

Section 3F—Air Force Planning and Crisis Execution

3.7. Transition from Rotational Operations to Crisis. A thorough understanding of the AEF
alignments, sustainable force levels, and surge trigger points is essential for all Air Force
planners. Armed with this information, Air Force planners can meet crisis action requirements
while minimizing the impact on current operations.

   3.7.2. DELETED.

  3.7.3. Crisis Action TPFDD Development. Supported combatant commander planners
  have two options in Crisis Action TPFDD development: create a Crisis Action TPFDD by
  using or modifying an existing TPFDD, or develop a new TPFDD (no-plan scenario).
  Supported component headquarters should request AEFC participation in Crisis Action
  TPFDD development or modification prior to execution, for supportability or feasibility
  assessment, and to maximize the use of forces presented in the on-call AEF pair. See
  Chapter 8.
  3.7.4. Sourcing Crisis Action and Rotational Requirements. Per AFPD 10-4, tasking
  authority for the SECAF rests with the CSAF. The CSAF through the AF/A3/5 develops a
  single Air Force position and directs MAJCOMs, in coordination with AFPC/DPW, to source
  capabilities to meet requirements. AFPC/DPW sources and the applicable MAJCOM/FOA or
  designee verifies sourcing solutions to meet crisis action requirements using a hierarchical
  progression (see paragraph 9.9.1) that first examines whether there are suitable and capable
  residual forces in the current vulnerability period or through ARC volunteerism. When
  emerging requirements exceed capabilities in the on-call AEFs and available Enablers, then
  the Air Force either surges (see Table 2.1) or submits a reclama if SecDef redlines are met.
     3.7.4.1. AEF lead wings. When designated in the approved AEF sourcing, lead wings
     provide forces and AEW/AEG leadership. All expeditionary wing and group
     commanders deploying for less than 365 days will be selected from current "sitting" or
     graduated wing/group commanders. For a 365 day deployment, a current command list
     Airman approved by the gaining COMAFFOR can fill the wing/group commander
     requirement. The designated lead wings will fill AEW/AEG senior leadership positions
     from their wing’s current commanders, Command CMSgt, and group superintendants
     unless permanent party leadership is in place at the deployed location. For example, the
     lead Wing/CC will be the AEW/CC and subordinate group commanders/superintendants
     from the lead wing will fill the AEW Operations Group, Maintenance Group, and
     Mission Support Group commander/superintendant positions (Note: Medical Group
     command and control elements will typically not be sourced using the lead wing
     construct).
         3.7.4.1.1. Non-aligned Expeditionary Air Support Operations Group (EASOG)
         command rotations of less than 365 days will be filled by sitting/graduated ASOG
         commanders. 365-day EASOG rotations (both aligned and non-aligned) will be filled
         from the current ASOG command list. Aligned EASOG commanders will dual-hat as
         the Corps Air Liaison Officer (ALO) and be selected early enough to meet aligned
         pre-deployment training requirements with the Corps they will deploy with (i.e. Pre-
         deployment academics, MRX, etc).
     3.7.4.2. Expeditionary squadron commanders should be selected from sitting
     commanders, then graduated commanders. MAJCOM vice commanders (or equivalent)
     may select a qualified officer from the MAJCOM Squadron Commander Selection List if
     there are no other qualified and available sitting or graduated commanders.

         3.7.5.2.1. DELETED.
         3.7.5.2.2. DELETED.
  3.7.6. Disengagement. Entering a surge period requires an analysis of all Air Force
  commitments in order to determine if the Air Force can disengage from other commitments
  to minimize surge operations or its effects. This information must flow rapidly to the AFCAT
  (AFOG), which is responsible for notifying senior leaders. When required, the CSAF will
  address the issue of disengagement from rotational commitments with the theater combatant
  commander and the CJCS. If disengagement is not an option, CSAF may order currently
  deployed forces to remain in-place. History has shown that as one theater escalates into a
  crisis response, other theater combatant commanders may increase their rotational
  requirements to offset potential increased risks.
  3.7.7. Rotation of Crisis Forces. The AEF structure allows the Air Force to maximize its
  available combat and ECS capability for the warfighter. Standardized AEF rotations are a
  key component of the AEF. Even during crisis operations, Air Force capabilities rotate
  within the applicable AEF battle rhythm to the maximum extent possible while still meeting
  SecDef-approved GFMAP requirements. In cases where forces are stressed, the HAF FAM,
  in coordination with AFOG, will ensure appropriate approval/notification is obtained. See
  Table 2.1 Rotations at a less stringent battle rhythm will resume at the beginning of the next
  GFM cycle in order to maximize the Air Force’s total combat potential. The supported
  component headquarters, in coordination with AFPC/DPW, will plan the rotation of crisis
  forces and build replacement ULN requirements in an operational TPFDD using the AEF
  battle rhythm. See Chapter 9.
  3.7.8. Sourcing Crisis Action Capability Requirements. Support for a crisis is based on
  established SecDef, CJCS, and AF/A3/5 directives. In response to the supported combatant
  commander’s request for capability/forces and the component headquarters’ identification of
  requirements, the AEFC sources capabilities/forces to fill requirements in support of crisis
  operations using the comprehensive AEF rotation schedule. Owning MAJCOMs will verify
  the sourcing solution and the supported component headquarters will validate the sourcing
  matches the requirement. Finally, the supported combatant commander will validate the
  requirements and transportation plan after which the United States Transportation Command
  (USTRANSCOM) plans the necessary strategic lift. The gaining MAJCOM may use
  mobilized or volunteer Air Reserve Component (ARC) forces in accordance with the
  procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8 and AFI 10-402, Mobilization Planning. See Chapter
  8 for detailed sourcing guidance.
  3.7.9. Shortfalls, Reclamas, and UIC Changes. When a sourced capability becomes
  unavailable or cannot meet the capability required, the unit/MAJCOM/FOA must initiate the
  reclama/shortfall/UIC Change process. Reclamas will only occur under the most extenuating
  circumstances. See Section 10C for detailed procedures (Note: Supporting CCDR can
  submit reclamas through applicable JFP in accordance with Joint process in order to fulfill
  UCP mission). When the Air Force is unable to provide the capability requested, the Air
  Force submits a Service shortfall to the Joint Staff (see paragraph 10.21.6 plus subparagraphs
  for details).
 62                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   3.7.10. Sourcing Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Forces. Air Reserve
   Component (ARC) forces are available for tasking in accordance with this instruction, AFI
   10-402 and the AFPD10-4. See Chapter 8.
3.8. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Utilization. A substantial part of the Total Air Force
capability resides in the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard. As such, the Air Force
relies on its Total Force to meet its taskings. While they may seamlessly operate alongside the
active US Air Force, they are subject to different levels of activation and different degrees of
operational and administrative control. The two types of activation are “volunteerism” and
“involuntary recall to Active Duty.”
   3.8.1. Volunteerism : The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) is allowed to place a
   member of a reserve component under SECAF jurisdiction on active duty, or retain Airman
   on active duty, with the consent of that member. However, a member of the Air National
   Guard of the United States may not be ordered to active duty under this authority (10 USC
   12301(d)) without the consent of the governor or other appropriate authority of the State
   concerned.
   3.8.2. Mobilization Planning. When UTC requirements exceed, or are forecast to exceed,
   the AC and ARC volunteer capability within the on-call AEF block for those capabilities
   postured in Tempo Band “C,” the HAF FAM in coordination with the MAJCOM and ARC
   FAMs, will develop a Two-Year Utilization Plan using SecDef planning guidance of a 1:5
   mobilization-to-dwell ratio (Tempo Band “M”). This plan will help provide predictability,
   enhance planning and meet SecDef mobilization approval timelines if mobilization is
   required.
       3.8.2.1. Unique UTC capabilities with a limited supply or which reside substantially in
       the ARC may necessitate different mobilization trigger points.
   3.8.3. Mobilization Sequence. When available postured AC and volunteer ARC UTCs are
   inadequate to sustain a 1:2 deploy-to-dwell (Tempo Band “D”), the HAF FAM should
   initiate the mobilization process in accordance with the Two-Year Utilization Plan. Due to
   the lead time in acquiring ARC mobilization approval, the mobilization process must be
   initiated 1 year prior to the scheduled employment period. Utilization of AC/ARC UTCs is
   based on the assumption mobilization authorization will be made available at the appropriate
   time (may vary within different functional areas) and accomplished in the following order
   when involuntary activation is authorized.
       3.8.3.1. When requirements exceed available AC postured in Tempo Band “D” to
       include volunteer ARC UTCs, AFRC/CV and/or NGB/CF, if not previously
       accomplished, will approve the re-aligning of affected ARC UTCs into Tempo Band
       “M.” .
       3.8.3.2. The SECAF may approve the utilization of ARC UTCs up to a 1:4 mobilization-
       to-dwell ratio (Band “N”), if required. When UTC requirements exceed postured AC
       UTCs in Tempo Band “E” and RC UTCs in Tempo Band “M” applicable ARC UTCs
       will be realigned into mobilization Band “N” in accordance with the ARC utilization plan
       upon approval of AFRC/CV and/or NGB/CF as appropriate allowing assured ARC
       access at a 1:4 mobilization-to-dwell ratio. The SecDef is approval authority for a
       mobilization-to-dwell rate less than 1:4.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             63


       3.8.3.3. Should UTC requirements exceed the capability inherent within the Selective
       Reserve category (Unit, Active Guard/Reserve, and Individual Mobilization
       Augmentees), other Reserve Component categories (e.g. Individual Ready Reserve,
       Retired Regular, Retired Reserve, etc.) can be accessed in accordance with AFI 10-402,
       Mobilization Planning and Personnel Readiness.
   3.8.4. Mobilization Reassessment. When AC UTCs (i.e. the warfighting forces) can
   sustain known requirements above a 1:2 deploy-to-dwell, the requirement for continued
   mobilization will be assessed and ARC UTCs may be re-postured into the baseline AEF
   (Note: Mobilization trigger only requires AC warfighting forces to be at or below 1:2
   deploy-to-dwell).
   3.8.5. When mobilization is required, the mobilization processes, procedures and systems
   outlined in AFI 10-402 apply.
3.9. Base Level Planning. Base level planning is required for contingency and crisis action
planning. As a minimum, base-level plans must address mobility, mobilization (if appropriate),
reception, employment, deployment, sustainment, and redeployment planning required for the
combat forces to accomplish its mission. All installations with a wartime mission, regardless of
size or location must develop base support plans according to AFI 10-404, Base Support and
Expeditionary Site Planning.
3.10. Sustainment Planning Responsibilities. HQ AFMC/A4R validates all logistics planning
factors developed by Air Force and other DOD organizations. HAF DCS Installations, Logistics
and Mission Support (AF/A4/7) reviews these planning factors to ensure they are consistent with
policy guidance. Table 3.1 identifies OPRs for determining materiel consumption rates and
developing factors for specific JOPES classes and subclasses of supply.

       HQ AFMC/A4R inputs the updated factors to the LFF become CJCSM 3150.23B, Joint
       Reporting Structure (JRS) Logistics Factors Report.
       3.10.4.4. Inform the Air HQ AFMC/A4R on proposed policy changes relative to
       commodity management, authorization tables, and wartime consumption factors affecting
       wartime resupply planning factors.
3.11. Non-unit Related Sustainment Planning. JOPES sustainment planning is used to
develop information to estimate materiel movement requirements generated during the operation.
This process is used to determine the feasibility of the planned concept of operations and to show
the size of the logistics effort required
   3.11.1. Wartime resupply planning factors are used solely for transportation feasibility
   analysis. They are used to assess strategic lift requirements when actual requirements cannot
   be determined. They are not to be considered standards to be used in accomplishing actual
   movement of materiel in the execution of any plan.
   3.11.2. Sustainment is distinguished by two categories: actual sustainment and JOPES
   notional sustainment. Actual sustainment begins as soon as forces arrive at employment
 68                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   bases. JOPES notional sustainment, however, is artificially constrained to provide
   sustainment only after PWRMS are depleted. The PWRMS cutoff day depends on the pre-
   positioning policy for a given class of supply.
   3.11.3. Wartime resupply planning factors are based on anticipated wartime consumption
   rates for each class of supply. If actual wartime requirements and sourcing data can be
   developed by class of supply for a given OPLAN, estimated wartime consumption rates and
   notional factors are not used. An example of the approach to development and use of actual
   requirements in lieu of notional factors is presented in paragraph 3.11.4 below which
   addresses sustainment planning for air munitions, tanks, racks, adapters, and pylons (TRAP).
   3.11.4. Air munitions and TRAP planning has been facilitated through the use of the
   wholesale supply system capability to support actual time-phased requirements. To quantify
   movement requirements of an OPLAN, specific air munitions and TRAP requirements are
   separately developed by the applicable component headquarters. When specific air munitions
   and TRAP requirements are developed by required delivery date, information necessary to
   source the munitions and TRAP is provided to the appropriate commodity manager (ACP
   Hill), in the proper format, by the component headquarters. Since actual time-phased air
   munitions and TRAP requirements can be forecasted, notional factors are not used for air
   munitions and TRAP sustainment classes VA and VIIJ, respectively.
   3.11.5. Air munitions requirements computation methodologies are outlined in the Non-
   nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis, Part Two, Section II.
   3.11.6. The Precision Engagement Division (AF/A5RW) is the OPR for questions about
   planning strategic lift of air munitions and TRAP in wartime.
3.12. Sustainment Planning. ACS sustainment planning is a crucial element of crisis action
and contingency planning. The Air Force accomplishes this planning via a Logistics
Sustainability Analysis (LSA). LSA is an analytical process used to predict ACS operational
capability requirements, gaps and priorities. The process and methodology support Defense
Planning Guidance and major theater OPLAN assessments, Crises Action Planning,
Supplemental Budgeting estimates. Air Force Material Command AFMC/ A4R validates all
logistics planning factors developed by Air Force and other DOD organizations. HAF Deputy
Chief of Staff (DCS) Installations, Logistics and Mission Support (AF/A4/7) reviews these
planning factors to ensure they are consistent with policy guidance, ACS CONOPS Objectives,
Capability Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) scenarios and priorities. This assessment
provides a broad assessment of key ACS support and enabler capabilities required to execute the
DPG and combatant commander’s plans. As a general rule, the Air Force uses the supported
component headquarters’ directorate of logistics, or equivalent, as its agent for analysis.
   3.12.1. The LSA is accomplished in accordance with JSCP, CJCSI 3110.03C, and CJCSM
   3122.03B.
   3.12.2. The LSA must be submitted to the supported commander for inclusion in the theater
   LSA for the OPLAN.
   3.12.3. Air Force supporting commands are also required to accomplish an LSA and submit
   results to supported COMAFFOR.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               69


   3.12.4. The LSA addresses the four pillars of ACS sustainability (Materiel, Infrastructure,
   Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) Forces, and Lift). It highlights deficiencies and their
   associated risk to supporting the warfighting air component.
         3.12.4.1. Supporting the four pillars are sustainment elements that need to be examined
         for sustainability. Those include, but are not limited to the following:

  Materiel. The assessment must examine the initial availability, long term sustainment, and
  availabilityof host nation support of the following:

3.12.4.2. Each of these areas is assessed individually as well as synergistically to obtain an
accurate sustainability picture. Criteria will normally be provided by the unified combatant
commander and should be followed. If criteria are not specified then the following may be used:

Table 3.6. Logistics Sustainability Analysis Stoplight Chart.




   3.12.5. In addition, risk must be assigned to each evaluation area that is less than
   supportable. Use the definitions of Unacceptable, High, Moderate, or Low, defined in CJCSI
   3110.03C.
3.13. Transition from Crisis Action Surge to Sustainable Operations. The component
headquarters and the AEFC must continuously and adaptively assess and plan for forces
necessary to meet current and future operations. When conditions allow, the Air Force objective
is always to return to a lower, sustainable operations tempo in order to ensure our readiness to
respond to the next crisis. Forces may require reconstitution and the combatant commander may
require long-term capabilities supported by rotational forces. Because transitioning to a
sustainable reduced operations level may not occur over a timeframe that allows for the
systematic drawdown of deployed forces and the reconstitution of returning forces, LSA best
practices require reconstitution planning to occur at the same time ACS planning is done to
support crises action support assessments. This planning enables the ACS community to more
accurately fuse business and warfighting domain demands with the ability to forecast and
respond to supplemental funding requests, predict equipment stress, and adaptively adjust global
supply chain activities which reach back into production.
   3.13.1. Reconstitution. Functional areas that entered surge operations must be
   reconstituted. Reconstitution is the restoration of combat capability following operations.
   Reconstituting capability to meet future threats sets the force and presents a tremendous
   challenge; one that must be met within the constraints of budgetary realities with an eye
   toward our transformational force and the demands of ongoing deployed operations. The Air
   Staff FAM, MAJCOM, ARC, and AEFC will develop and execute a reconstitution plan. In
   cases where reconstitution is necessary for multiple functional areas or across the AEF
   construct, AF/A5XW will work with the AEFC to provide the AFCAT (AFOG) an overall
   assessment and COA for CSAF approval. Response to crises and expeditious reconstitution
 72                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   (when necessary) to a rotational posture with the least possible impact on the AEF schedule
   remains critical to the AEF concept. See 9.17 and Chapter 12, for further guidance.
       3.13.1.1. Several agencies are invaluable to the component headquarters, AEFC, and
       MAJCOM staffs in evaluating reconstitution plans (e.g., for CAF aviation, the CAF
       SIPT; for CONUS-based MAF aviation, HQ AMC/A3 in association with AFRC and
       ANG; for ECS, the ECS IPT and AEFC functional schedulers).
       3.13.1.2. Planners must balance post-crisis or post-contingency redeployment
       requirements with the need to repopulate the AEFs. Planners should attempt to execute a
       first-in, first-out replacement plan while continuing to meet combatant commander
       mission requirements (e.g., one unit/ UTC may have been first to deploy to a crisis, but
       because its capability is still required or due to its position in the AEF schedule, may
       redeploy after a unit/UTC that arrived later in the crisis). In coordination with AF/A3O,
       MAJCOMs and ARC, the AEFC will monitor residual AEF capability, and AEF UTC
       Reporting Tool (ART) assessments, to measure the impact on AEF forces.
       3.13.1.3. Air Staff, MAJCOM, ARC FAMs and the AEFC will monitor current and
       emerging requirements to ensure anticipated rotational requirements are supportable.
   3.13.2. Establishing Standing Rotational Operations. A component headquarters should
   identify requirements that necessitate sustained rotation support to the AEFC, AFCAT
   (AFOG) and AF/A3/5. Missions not previously supported by the AEF require AFCAT
   confirmation that the SecDef order (e.g. DEPORD, EXORD) or modification to the order
   allows the support with AEF scheduled forces. The AEFC will work with the component
   headquarters to incorporate new requirements into the requisite PID. The component
   headquarters must provide reporting and funding instructions. See Chapter 9.
3.14. Establishing Contingency Organizations. Planners will use existing organizational
structures. Organizational structures at each employment location will parallel peacetime
structures. Provisional units will be identified during planning by the component headquarters to
expedite their use during contingency execution. Refer to AFI 38-101.
3.15. AEF After Action Report (AAR). AEF commanders will submit After Action Reports in
accordance with supported component headquarters guidance.

                        PLANNING AND EXECUTION SYSTEMS

Section 4A—Purpose

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides basic information on war planning and execution
information technology (IT) systems used by in the U.S. Air Force. It provides an overview of IT
management and administration, including information on system access and training.

Section 4B—Systems

4.2. Overview.
   4.2.1. Definitions
       4.2.1.1. Family Of Systems (FOS) – A set or arrangement of independent (not
       interdependent) systems that can be arranged or interconnected in various ways to
       provide different capabilities. The mix of systems can be tailored to provide desired
       capabilities dependent on the situation. Under today's warfighting, assembly of forces for
       contingencies is primarily ad hoc, based on a generic set of requirements rather than
       preplanning that designates specific forces for a particular contingency. Thus,
       interoperability of the independent platforms is a key consideration in the ad hoc
       deployment of a "family-of-systems".
       4.2.1.2. System of Systems (SOS) – A key principal to the understanding of a "system-
       of-systems" is the notion that a system performs a function not possible with any of the
       individual parts acting alone. A "system-of-systems" may be physically bounded in a
       single platform or consist of a collection of separate, but interdependent, interconnected
       platforms performing different functions. Thus, a system can be viewed as any organized
       assembly of resources and procedures united and regulated by interaction or
       interdependence to accomplish a set of specific functions. In this context, a "system-of-
       systems" can be viewed as a set or arrangement of interdependent systems that are related
       or connected to provide a given capability. The loss of any part of the system will
       degrade the performance or capabilities of the whole.
       4.2.1.3. Umbrella Systems – System providing a single interface to access, interpret,
       and/or manipulate data from multiple functionally independent systems. This use of the
       term can be viewed as the "front end" of a SoS as defined above.
       4.2.1.4. Applications - Programs written to perform a specific task or function, i.e. a
       word processor or spreadsheet. This is in contrast to the operating system, a general-
       purpose program to control the computing environment.
       4.2.1.5. Support Tools – A specific module of capability programmed into an
       application.
       4.2.1.6. Reference Files - Present data created and maintained outside the umbrella
       system for use by the system in interpreting and presenting native data to the user. For
       example, these files specify codes for locations, readiness status of units, movement
 74                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      details for UTCs or individual equipment items and are available to translate those codes
      to "plain English."
   4.2.2. Architecture. Global Command and Control System (GCCS) is the DOD’s
   automated system that integrates the strategic command, control, communications, and
   intelligence functions (See Figure 4.1). GCCS is based on strict compliance with the
   Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) and
   Configuration Management. GCCS is a secret level system that makes planning information
   available at all levels (including base level). Access to GCCS is provided through the
   SIPRNET, the secret layer of the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN). GCCS
   supports planning for mission areas such as operations, mobilization, deployment,
   employment, sustainment, and intelligence. It enables joint force commanders to synchronize
   the actions of air, sea, land, space, and special operations forces. Its flexible range enables
   operational use from actual combat to humanitarian assistance. GCCS is a standard platform
   for a large group of software applications. These software applications provide senior-level
   decision makers and their staffs with enhanced capability to plan and conduct joint military
   operations. They also provide unique capabilities and functions to assist planners in
   retrieving, assessing, sharing, and transmitting information. The JOPES, DCAPES, and
   WMP System applications are available through GCCS. GCCS provides a single integrated
   Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) application
   environment on which JOPES resides. GCCS is the joint data sharing/collaborative system
   supporting both secret (GCCS) and top secret (GCCS-TS) information. GCCS supports the
   Common Operational Picture, Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS),
   GCCS Newsgroups, JOPES related data and other systems.
4.3. Joint War Planning & Execution Systems and Applications
   4.3.1. Joint Operational Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Automated Data
   Processing (ADP)
      4.3.1.1. Overview. The JOPES ADP mission applications and files described below are
      used for joint command and control. These applications interface with Service
      applications for essential joint planning data. The Air Force interface is accomplished by
      DCAPES, which will be discussed later in this chapter. These systems reside on GCCS.
      4.3.1.2. Major Capabilities
          4.3.1.2.1. Time Phase Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). The TPFDD is the
          database used to coordinate the movement of forces into their operational locations.
          The TPFDD includes forces from all Services and their movement requirement.
          These forces compete for the limited available lift to have their assets in-place first.
          JOPES Volume III establishes the methods and procedures the JPEC will follow to
          coordinate its efforts to develop a TPFDD.
          4.3.1.2.2. JOPES Edit Tool (JET). JET provides a capability for the planner to
          create and modify a TPFDD file and build a force list. JET provides the means for
          planners to build the force list in the TPFDD. Planners use JET to define the force
          requirements by unit type codes (UTC), associate these UTCs with tasked units,
          routing from origin to destination, and route UTC into the theater.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             75


         4.3.1.2.3. Rapid Query Tool (RQT). RQT provides a capability for the planner to
         query and produce reports from a TPFDD file. RQT provides the means for planners
         to produce relevant time phased force deployment listings (TPFDL). These TPFDLs
         are used to coordinate the deployment flow and ensure each UTC’s movement is in
         the proper sequence. A TPFDL can be sorted by different data fields. Common data
         sorts used by planners are by Service, UTC, dates (ALD, LAD, RDD, etc.),
         destination, origin, transportation mode, and functional area.
         4.3.1.2.4. Scheduling and Movement (S&M). S&M enables the planner to report
         and track movement of TPFDD requirements.
         4.3.1.2.5. Medical Analysis Tool (MAT). MAT provides medical planners with a
         means of determining the overall medical feasibility of an existing or proposed
         OPLAN. This is a JOPES direct support tool.
         4.3.1.2.6. Joint Engineer Planning and Execution System (JEPES). Provides the
         planner a means to analyze facility, material, and force level support requirements for
         civil engineering personnel. This is a JOPES direct support tool.
         4.3.1.2.7. Web Hoc Query (WHQ). WHQ provides users with a means to develop,
         save, and print tailored queries extracting data from the JOPES core database via the
         SIPRNET.
         4.3.1.2.8. Airfield Information. Airfield information is provided via access to the
         National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency website. (JOPES direct support tools)
         4.3.1.2.9. Standard Reference Files. These standard reference files specify codes
         for locations, cargo and passenger movement details for UTCs or large equipment
         items, movement details for UTCs or individual equipment items.
             4.3.1.2.9.1. Geographic Location File (GEOFILE). The GEOFILE provides
             codes for specific locations. Properly used, these codes aid force movement
             planning. Planners must be careful they use the correct code to ensure the required
             location is listed. For example, Charleston seaport, airport, and military airport
             each have different geographic codes.
             4.3.1.2.9.2. Type Unit Characteristics (TUCHA) file. The TUCHA file
             contains the deployment data for all approved DOD UTCs, including the number
             of passengers and the cargo increments and the weights and dimensions. This
             standard reference file is used when planners develop the TPFDD. When a
             planner enters a UTC in a TPFDD, the information from this file is copied into the
             TPFDD. This cargo data is the level four information needed to plan the forces
             movement.
             4.3.1.2.9.3. Type Unit Equipment Detail File (TUDET). The TUDET contains
             the dimensional and weight data for large pieces of equipment. It may be looked
             up using the nomenclature or national stock number.
  4.3.2. Global Status of Resources and Training (GSORTS). The GSORTS database
  record provides unit readiness status and current location. The GSORTS database record
  reflects the readiness level of selected units in terms of training, equipment, and personnel
 76                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   against the level required to undertake assigned missions. Planners may review the data in
   this database while selecting units to support an operation
   4.3.3. Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST). While not a JOPES
   tool, JFAST complements JOPES by assisting the planner with analyzing OPLAN feasibility
   in terms of intertheater movement. It also provides a capability to generate non-unit-related
   cargo (CIN) and personnel (PIN) requirement estimates based on the forces to be supported
   and the duration of the planned operation.
   4.3.4. Joint Capabilities Requirements Manager (JCRM). JCRM is a web-enabled tool
   which facilitates GFM policy, processes and tools. JCRM supports automatic requirements
   generation, validation, Force Presentation assignment, sourcing and orders writing processes
   in both planning and execution environments. Key elements of the tool are in direct support
   of JOPES and compliment the Adaptive Planning and Execution process. The primary
   functions of JCRM are to (1) account for forces and capabilities committed to ongoing
   operations and constantly changing unit availability (2) create added value during CCDR's
   decision-making (3) identify the most appropriate and responsive force or capability that best
   meets the CCDR requirement.
4.4. Air Force War Planning and Execution Systems (WPES)
   4.4.1. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES).
      4.4.1.1. Overview. The Air Force planning and execution community supports JOPES
      by feeding Air Force unique data through DCAPES. DCAPES is the standard automated
      data processing (ADP) system designed to provide communication of OPLAN
      requirements and resource monitoring capability by integrating planning data with
      operations, logistics, manpower, and personnel processes to enable planners to develop
      and access near-real time data from Service and joint systems.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            77


Figure 4.1. War Planning & Execution Systems (WPES).




      4.4.1.2. Major Capabilities. The supported component headquarters will communicate
      the employment resource requirements to the supporting commands and wings/bases
      using DCAPES. Communication with units at base level is necessary to ensure unit
      deployment planning supports the component headquarters’ requirements and identifies
      and compensates for shortages. Air Force planners and readiness offices use DCAPES at
      various command levels to translate contingency planning, JCS exercise, real world crisis
      execution, or local exercise taskings into detailed unit requirements down to the AFSC
      and tool box level. Air Force planners, readiness personnel, FAMs, and unit deployment
      managers (UDMs) use the data in DCAPES to prepare resources for movement and
      accomplish force accountability at the deployment and employment locations. Command
      or base-level unique systems may be used only if a request for incorporation of the
      system into DCAPES is evaluated, approved, and filed at AF/A5XW. If the request is
      rejected, use of the unique system must be terminated. As depicted in Figure 4.1,
      DCAPES is the cornerstone system and will migrate to the Air Force’s WPES under
      increment 2b. Additionally, many of the systems depicted in the diagram are discussed in
      greater detail in this chapter.

     4.4.1.2.1. Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK). The
     Manpower And Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) is the process for
     developing and describing standard, predefined manpower and equipment force
     capabilities and determining the deployment characteristics of these capabilities in
     support of JOPES and DCAPES, LOGMOD, AND MANPER. These standard
     descriptions of the units and elements are used for wartime, contingency, and force
     planning to all levels of command. MEFPAK operates within the DCAPES software
     on GCCS.
        4.4.1.2.1.1. Standard force capabilities are uniquely identified in MEFPAK by
        UTCs, which are integral parts of contingency and crisis action planning. UTCs
        are the data records identified in TPFDDs that identify what forces are deploying.
        4.4.1.2.1.2. UTCs depict a force capability with personnel and/or equipment
        requirements. The unique five-character UTC designator is controlled by the Joint
        Staff. A UTC becomes standard when it’s registered in MEFPAK and entered in
        the TUCHA with complete movement characteristics. These standard unit
        descriptions/force capabilities are collected in two components of the MEFPAK:
        the MANFOR and the LOGFOR. UTC packages are the basic building blocks for
        determining detailed planned manpower and equipment requirements data.
        4.4.1.2.1.3. The MANFOR is a component of DCAPES. Standard UTCs are used
        in DCAPES and JOPES to identify manpower and logistics requirements for
        deployment, movement planning, and plan execution. UTCs are available through
        UTC Availability and maintained in the WMP-3, Part 2 by AF/A5XW.
        4.4.1.2.1.4. The MEFPAK summary report reflects standard Air Force UTC
        personnel and cargo movement characteristics used by Air Force planners for
        general war planning.
        4.4.1.2.1.5. DCAPES supports MEFPAK and provides the capability to update
        GCCS files containing personnel/logistics deployment capabilities available for
        deployment. DCAPES specifically provides unit type management functions to
        the Air Staff. These functions allow selected Air Staff users to aggregate data
        related to Air Force standard unit types, create summary products, and feed the
        data to joint systems.
        4.4.1.2.1.6. DCAPES assimilates data from MEFPAK, converting the data into a
        format needed by JOPES.
        4.4.1.2.1.7. The process starts when UTCs are registered in the Headquarters Air
        Force (HAF) Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) system. Next the
        manpower and logistics detail are built by the MEFPAK responsible agency in
        DCAPES and LOGMOD.
        4.4.1.2.1.8. MEFPAK generates summary information for the JCS in the Type
        Unit Data Report (TYPREP) file. The JCS distributes the TYPREP as the
        TUCHA to the Combatant commanders for use in JOPES for developing the
        TPFDD and in determining OPLAN transportation feasibility. Note: Joint
        planning above the component level doesn’t require the personnel and equipment
        detail contained in the MEFPAK.

        4.4.1.2.2. Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)
           4.4.1.2.2.1. MANFOR is a component of MEFPAK and DCAPES. It’s a database
           containing the UTC and title, MISCAP, and manpower detail for each applicable
           UTC. The MANFOR subsystem automates creating and maintaining manpower
           details for the Manpower Force Elements (MFE) associated with UTC packages.
           4.4.1.2.2.2. MANFOR passes UTC data to the master Air Force file maintained
           by the Air Force Manpower Agency Readiness Branch. It interfaces with the
           Manpower and Personnel Module base-level (MANPER-B) module to permit unit
           involvement in the UTC manpower requirements development process.
           4.4.1.2.2.3. Objectives of the MANFOR:
              4.4.1.2.2.3.1. Provide joint and Air Force planners with standardized force
              capabilities documenting manpower requirements for execution, operations,
              and deployment planning documents.
              4.4.1.2.2.3.2. Provide a means to communicate standard wartime, force
              planning, and contingency manpower requirements to all levels of command
              within the Air Force.
              4.4.1.2.2.3.3. Provide Air Force input to the JOPES TUCHA database.
              4.4.1.2.2.3.4. Establish a baseline for communication among the MEFPAK
              responsible commands.
              4.4.1.2.2.3.5. Serve as the foundation for individual            requirements
              documentation by operations planners at all levels.
              4.4.1.2.2.3.6. The objective of MANFOR is achieved through the
              development of an Air Force-level approved, standard master database of
              force capabilities available in joint and Air Force command and control
              systems.
        4.4.1.2.3. Logistics Forces (LOGFOR)
           4.4.1.2.3.1. LOGFOR is used to collect and store the material requirements
           (called the logistics detail (LOGDET)) for UTCs. The LOGDET defines the
           standard equipment requirements for each UTC. The LOGDET is provided at the
           national stock number (NSN) level. LOGFOR functions include:
              4.4.1.2.3.1.1. Providing equipment planning data for deploying units.
              4.4.1.2.3.1.2. Providing the foundation for individual force capability
              strategic airlift requirements estimates for planning.
              4.4.1.2.3.1.3. Providing inputs to the JOPES TUCHA database.
              4.4.1.2.3.1.4. Equipment planning data for use by Air Force units in their
              deployment plans. Standard UTC LOGDET data is developed and maintained
              by pilot units in the LOGFOR module of LOGMOD. UTC suffix zero denotes
              standard equipment requirements for all like units and serves as a baseline for
              non-pilot units when initially developing and maintaining their LOGPLAN
              files based on OPLAN/CONPLAN and AEF tasking.

            4.4.1.2.3.1.5. A baseline for communication among the MEFPAK responsible
            commands.
            4.4.1.2.3.1.6. LOGDET is generic and capable of worldwide deployment.
            4.4.1.2.3.1.7. Detailed logistics force definition data are available in the
            DCAPES LOGFOR subsystem and LOGPLAN system of each MAJCOM.
            4.4.1.2.3.1.8. Detailed manpower force definition data for standard UTCs are
            available in the DCAPES MANPER MANFOR located in each MAJCOM
            and base with a MANPER system. Force definition data for specific plans,
            reflecting the actual use of standard UTC data as well as tailored and
            nonstandard requirements, are contained in the plan requirements database
            prepared for each plan either at the supported component headquarters,
            intermediate headquarters or employment base.
     4.4.1.2.4. Air Force JOPES Editing Tool (AFJET). AFJET provides the United
     States Air Force with the ability to view or edit OPLAN related data from the JOPES
     Level 2 data down to the personnel Line Level Detail (LLD) and the Increment, Item
     and Suffix cargo detail. The DCAPES Increment I AFJET User’s Guide, located on
     the DCAPES main window, is an authoritative description of the DCAPES AFJET
     functions that are available to DCAPES users.
     4.4.1.2.5. Air Force Query Tool (AFQT). The AFQT module provides the United
     States Air Force with a user-friendly, fast and efficient user interface to accomplish
     the following capabilities:
        4.4.1.2.5.1. Dynamic Query Tool (DQT). JOPES and DCAPES core database
        query creation, report generation.
        4.4.1.2.5.2. Storing, execution and maintainability of user-defined queries
        coupled with any associated retrieval parameters.
        4.4.1.2.5.3. Scheduling and Movement retrieval and reporting capability.
        4.4.1.2.5.4. Predefined reports generation.
        4.4.1.2.5.5. Management and control of deferred job scheduling.
        4.4.1.2.5.6. Creation, generation and maintainability of user defined ad-hoc and
        tabular reports.
     4.4.1.2.6. Scheduling and Movement (S&M). S&M is the JOPES application that
     handles command and control information on deployment activity and status. It
     functions as a vehicle for reporting and tracking movement of TPFDD requirements.
     S&M allows you to review, update, schedule, and create manifests for both
     Transportation Component Command (TCC) carrier and organic movement before
     and during deployment. It provides the capability to review and analyze an extensive
     variety of requirement and movement data.
     4.4.1.2.7. Unit Type Management (UTM) Module. The UTM is the DCAPES
     module for managing UTCs. The module has three tools, one for registration, one for
     UTC maintenance, and one for reports. The UTC Registration Tool allows users to
     request a new UTC, request a change to an existing UTC, or request that an existing
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           81


        UTC be cancelled. When a request is approved, the registration of that request creates
        or changes the title record for that UTC. UTM allows users to add a new UTC or
        change a working copy of an existing UTC. This tool also allows selected users to
        import and view logistics data from the Logistics Module (LOGMOD) Logistics
        Force Packaging System (LOGFOR) system, create or maintain manpower data, and
        create or maintain MISCAPS.
        4.4.1.2.8. The Analysis and Feasibility Tool (AFT). AFT provides the Air Force
        with the ability to perform analysis of operational requirements and comparisons of
        operational requirements to the various Manpower and Personnel resources available
        to the Air Force planner. The DCAPES Increment I AFT User's Guide document is an
        authoritative description of the DCAPES AFT functions that are available to
        DCAPES users.
        4.4.1.2.9. Air Force System Services (AFSS). AFSS provides importable and
        exportable data in standalone files. This includes LOGMOD, TUCHA, WMP, and
        MANPER-B. Other features include Purge Data Utility (PDU), toggle to external
        systems, throttle user accounts and roles, and User Account Maintenance (UAM).
  4.4.2. War and Mobilization Planning (WMP).
     4.4.2.1. Overview. While the WMP documents were discussed earlier in this
     instruction, the WMP system is an automated planning tool which includes an integrated
     database containing WMP-3 Part 1 (Combat Forces), WMP-3 Part 2 (UTC Availability
     (formerly AFWUS) and Multiple UTC Groups (MUG), WMP-3 Part 3 (RSP), WMP 4,
     (NSAU and MISPRO), WMP-5 (Rates & Factors), and a TPFDD Development tool. In
     addition, it contains a capability to create a data file that uses the WMP-3 Part 1
     apportionment and MUGs that can be imported into a DCAPES/ JOPES TPFDD. The
     WMP System also includes sourcing methodology that supports the AF’s contingency
     planning process. The WMP-1, WMP-2, and WMP–3, Part 4 are stand-alone documents.
     4.4.2.2. Major Capabilities. Planning Guidance in the WMP Volumes: Volumes 1, 3,
     and 5 provide planning policy/guidance, forces, and planning factors/data, respectively,
     to assist the Air Force planner in developing supporting OPLANs, CONPLANs, or
     FUNCPLANs. Volumes 2 and 4 are products of plans. They are produced and managed
     by the Air Staff but usually maintained or developed at the MAJCOM and/or air
     component command level.
        4.4.2.2.1. WMP Volume 1 is not a system and is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
        4.4.2.2.2. WMP Volume 2 is not a system and is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
        4.4.2.2.3. WMP Volume 3 lists the combat and support UTC availability and is the
        reference for forces planning. It is produced in four parts: Combat Forces, Support
        Forces, Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Authorization Document, and AEFPP
        Capability Annexes. Note: The current WMP-3 Part 2is the UTC Availability
        (Formerly Air Force Wide UTC Availability System (AFWUS)), which will be
        integrated into DCAPES.
            4.4.2.2.3.1. WMP-3 Part 1. As mentioned earlier, the WMP-3 Part 1 is the Air
            Force’s supporting plan to the JSCP. WMP-3 Part 1 converts the CJCS force
82                                        AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


     apportionment, listed by number of squadrons, elements and/or primary mission
     aircraft inventory (PMAI) into the specific units that will support the combatant
     commanders. The units identified in the WMP-3 Part 1 for each combatant
     commander must be the same units utilized in each combatant commander’s
     TPFDD. Due to the dynamic nature of force structure changes, budget revisions,
     and combatant commander requirements, the WMP-3 Part 1 data is constantly
     updated. The WMP-3 Part 1 module consists of 4 main functions; edit, command
     updates, HQ review, and modify PPBES/FY.
        4.4.2.2.3.1.1. The edit function provides the capability to add, delete and
        modify records in the database, a function accomplished by AF/A5XW. The
        programmed force structure, obtained through the "force tabs" from AF/A8P,
        is provided for the POM, BES and PB for an eight year period and is used to
        update the WMP-3 Part 1 force structure.
        4.4.2.2.3.1.2. The command update function enables the MAJCOMs and
        component headquarters to provide "recommended" changes to individual
        data elements in the WMP-3 Part 1 database. In addition, users are able to
        provide "general comments" concerning any record/unit within the database.
        Requests for WMP-3 Part 1 review are sent out by AF/A5XW on a regular
        basis, but mainly during a new JSCP update cycle. Recommended changes to
        WMP-3 Part 1 are encouraged at any time.
        4.4.2.2.3.1.3. The HQ review module enables AF/A5XW to review the
        commands’ “recommended” changes. These “recommended” changes are
        either “accepted” or “rejected” and those that are “accepted” are automatically
        updated in the database.
        4.4.2.2.3.1.4. The modify PPBES/FY function allows AF/A5XW to copy one
        PPBES to another and either add or delete FYs for any PPBES.
     4.4.2.2.3.2. WMP-3 Part 2 UTC Availability. The corresponding owning force
     provider maintains all UTC availability records. The MUGs are maintained by
     AF/A5XW; however, the owning force provider may have access to update. The
     goal is to maintain a current listing of all Air Force UTCs available to rapidly
     support combatant commander requirements and other contingencies. For specific
     guidance on UTC availability and posturing, see Chapter 7.
        4.4.2.2.3.2.1. Overview. The single-source official, master database that lists
        Air Force capability, in terms of UTCs, for use in contingency and crisis
        action planning
        4.4.2.2.3.2.2. Major Capabilities. UTC Availability provides the users with
        the following capabilities and functions:
          4.4.2.2.3.2.2.1. Capability to view any/all database records regardless of
          MAJCOM or Component (Active/ANG/AFRC).
          4.4.2.2.3.2.2.2. Capability to add single or multiple records with the same
          UTC/ UIC.
          4.4.2.2.3.2.2.3. Capability to delete individual or multiple records with the
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             83


                 same UTC/UIC.
                 4.4.2.2.3.2.2.4. Capability to modify individual data element cells or a
                 single data element for multiple records.
                 4.4.2.2.3.2.2.5. Capability to add new "FRAGGED" records using the
                 fragmentation code (FRAG) function.
           4.4.2.2.3.3. WMP-3 Part 3 RSP. The WMP-3 Part 3 identifies the
           authorizations for Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) for airborne assets. The
           WMP System generates an RSP report that includes authorizations and
           computations. The report is used to generate the RSP Authorization Document,
           commonly referred to as the Blue Book.
           4.4.2.2.3.4. WMP-3 Part 4 – AEFPP Capability Annexes is not a system and is
           discussed in detail in Chapter 2.
        4.4.2.2.4. WMP Volume 4 WAA. This five-part document reflects the most current
        MAJCOM planning, positioning, and employment activity of aviation forces tasked
        in support of OPLANs and CONPLANs with TPFDDs. It shows planning,
        positioning, and employment of programmed Air Force aircraft by
        OPLAN/CONPLAN, base, MDS, and mission.
        4.4.2.2.5. WMP Volume 5- Basic Planning Factors. It is a programming document
        comprised of planning factors and data. It includes the only U.S. Air Force-approved
        wartime sortie rates, attrition rates, sortie duration, and crew ratio rates by MDS used
        for War Reserve Materiel (WRM) planning. It provides approved US Air Force
        wartime planning factors, (e.g., sortie rates and sortie duration) from which the
        expenditure of many war consumables (e.g., fuel, oil, lubrication, chaff, flares,
        operational rations (Meals Ready to Eat, MRE), etc.) can be estimated.
           4.4.2.2.5.1. The WMP-5 module consists of the WMP-5 Calculation Program and
           the WMP-5 sortie rates and factors modifications function. The WMP-5
           calculation program combines WMP-3 Part 1 force structure and the WMP-5
           rates and factors to produce flying hours and sorties for wartime assets
           determination. The WMP-5 rates and factors are maintained by AF/A5XW and
           are the source for the WMP-5 document. The WMP-5 calculation program is
           normally run by AF/A5XW; however, if other users need calculations, access
           may be granted upon request.
           4.4.2.2.5.2. AF/A5XW will maintain the WMP-5 database and the WMP-5
           system tables that support the WMP-5 Calculation Program.
           4.4.2.2.5.3. MAJCOMs will verify that the rates are supportable by their aviation
           units.
        4.4.2.2.6. TPFDD Data File Creation. This process provides users the ability to
        build a data file in the appropriate TPFDD format using apportioned forces from the
        WMP-3 Part 1 or specific units desired for an exercise or contingency. Expeditionary
        Combat Support (ECS) requirements are inserted into the data file using the support
        UTCs in the aviation MUGs, base operating support (BOS) MUGs, Functional MUGs
84                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


        and BDR MUGs. Once all MUGs are placed in the data file, the requirements can be
        adjusted as necessary.
  4.4.3. Logistics Module (LOGMOD).
     4.4.3.1. Overview. A logistics-planning program that receives and maintains the cargo
     and personnel details for UTCs and taskings. It maintains detailed cargo records as well
     as personnel records (levy file positions and the personnel to fill them) and provides a
     command and control capability through the Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE)
     module.
     4.4.3.2. Major Capabilities. There are four modules: Logistics Force Packaging
     (LOGFOR), Logistics Planning Module (LOGPLAN), Deployment Schedule of Events
     (DSOE), and Unit Deployment Management. LOGMOD-Stand Alone (LSA) is used as a
     back up to LOGMOD. This system is a unit level program that manages personnel and
     cargo data in an off-line mode. LSA contains similar capabilities as LOGMOD and is a
     tool available when LOGMOD is not. LOGMOD operates in unclassified mode. There is
     no direct interface between LOGMOD and DCAPES.
        4.4.3.2.1. The Logistics Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides the
        capability to create and maintain the standard logistics details consisting of supplies
        and equipment for each UTC in the Air Force. The product of LOGFOR is called the
        Logistics Detail (LOGDET).
        4.4.3.2.2. The Logistics Planning Subsystem (LOGPLAN) provides the capability to
        tailor or customize the plan unique UTC database of equipment and supplies for each
        tasking (OPLAN/CONPLAN) that includes Air Force assets. Tailored UTC
        information developed in LOGPLAN must be manually transferred to DCAPES to
        ensure TPFDD includes correct movement requirements data. This database is called
        the Logistics Plan File (LPF). LOGPLAN subsystem capabilities:
            4.4.3.2.2.1. The Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE) module provides users
            with an automated capability to plan, schedule, and monitor the deployment
            actions that support the movement of forces.
            4.4.3.2.2.2. The Unit Deployment Management module is used by the UDM in
            preparation for and execution of deployment taskings.

  4.4.5. Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS).
     4.4.5.1. Overview. As highlighted in Figure 4.1, MilPDS feeds DCAPES with all
     personnel information required to support the War Planning and Execution process. Mil-
     PDS supports over 250 processes throughout the life cycle that incorporates personnel
     transactions at the squadron, wing, MAJCOM, and Air Force Personnel Center level.
     4.4.5.2. Major Capabilities. MilPDS is used in the management of every aspect of an
     Airman‘s career. It collects, processes, and provides personnel data through relational
     databases to reduce data redundancy and ensure that data is current, accurate, and
     available. It contains an AEF Association data field for documenting a member‘s aligned
     AEF (Note: Reserve components will determine component-specific AEFI policy).
  4.4.6. AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART).
     4.4.6.1. Overview. CSAF-directed system at the AEF Center that was developed to
     measure AEF readiness. It is a secure, web-based tool that resides on the SIPRNET. It
     addresses readiness at the UTC level.
     4.4.6.2. Major Capabilities. ART enables commanders to report the ability of a
     standard UTC to perform its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) anywhere in the
     world at the time of the assessment and identify capability through the next AEF pair. It
     highlights missing resources and helps to quantify missing requirements for additional
     justification when submitting budgets. It also provides the ability to evaluate a UTC prior
     to tasking, picks the UTC with the best capability to meet the tasking, and helps to
     forecast shortfalls. Unlike SORTS, ART is the only assessment system that goes down to
     the UTC level. Note: ART does not measure a UTCs availability to deploy, only its
     ability to meet its MISCAP should it be tasked.
  4.4.7. Enhanced Contingency-Rotational AEF Scheduling Tool (ECAST).
     4.4.7.1. Overview. ECAST is a functionality based, UTC management and scheduling
     system. It provides the AEF Center with a tool to "schedule" or "initiate sourcing of"
     rotational or contingency requirements and manage AEF Library linkage. ECAST
     manages residual forces, supports scheduler ’s decision making, and meets deployed
     commander ’s missions. It is a permission-based, role-oriented application residing on the
     SIPRNET.
     4.4.7.2. Major Capabilities. ECAST is an automated tool enabling AEFC Functional
     Schedulers to schedule UTCs for contingency/exercise, links scheduled UTCs to AEF
     Library resources, and manages residual lists of full and partial UTCs. It also accesses
     ART data for decision-making and provides access to links and lookup tables. ECAST
     can also handle shortfall/reclama processing data and maintain visibility of new
     requirements. It keeps track of daily transaction reports for verification of updates and
     allows users to look up requirements and scheduling status. ECAST also uses data and

     reports for analytical needs and management of processes. It receives data from
     DCAPES, maintains history of scheduling actions, and maintains detailed notes about
     scheduling decisions.
  4.4.8. Predictive Readiness Assessment System (PRAS).
     4.4.8.1. Overview. The Air Force is currently concluding the third year of development
     for a Predictive Readiness Assessment System (PRAS) capable of assessing and
     predicting future Air Force unit combat readiness. The system will provide the Air Force
     with a tool to predict the readiness implications of combat and combat support forces as
     they change and respond to taskings.
     4.4.8.2. Major Capabilities. Key input variables will include demand for forces,
     funding, logistics, personnel, infrastructure, and readiness reporting indicators. Final
     development will result in a tool that analyzes leading readiness indicators and provides
     the Air Force with a set of interrelated impacts to help us make future operational and
     resource allocation decisions.
  4.4.9. Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC).
     4.4.9.1. Overview. Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) supports
     logistics and operational planning staffs at Headquarters United States Air Force (HAF),
     Major Command, and unit level. LOGFAC enables users to develop assessments of the
     capability of available stocks to support contingency operations. Users can develop the
     command War Consumable Distribution Objective, answer "what-if" materiel
     requirement and supportability questions, develop cost analysis of various support
     options, and monitor WRM stock levels. LOGFAC also provides MAJCOMs the
     capability to develop their respective inputs to the WMP-4.
     4.4.9.2. Major Capabilities.
        4.4.9.2.1. War Consumables capability is used to generate the War Consumables
        Distribution Objective (WCDO). The WCDO is a report printed by base identifying
        how much fuel, munitions, bullets, and other consumables are required for storage to
        support the planned aircraft activity identified in the WMP-4 at each base.
        4.4.9.2.2. Force Supportability capability is used to "what if" the war/scenario. Using
        this capability, a MAJCOM can decide if they have enough munitions, bullets, fuel,
        and other consumables on hand to support a given TPFDD force or operations plan.
        4.4.9.2.3. Assets and Material Rating (AMR) capability provides asset visibility. This
        capability is used much like SORTS to provide information on the status of
        consumables and BEAR Assets. The AMR capability provides reports showing on-
        hand versus required quantities for war consumables and reports showing the in-
        commission status of Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) sets such as
        the 550i and 550f.
        4.4.9.2.4. Wartime Aircraft Activity Reporting capability is used to update the
        WMP-4 Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) that displays for each planned operating
        base the wartime aircraft activity by major command and Operations Plan.

      4.5.2.1. Oversight. The responsible functional communities for the War Planning and
      Execution Systems that are depicted in this chapter are primarily AF/A5XW, AF/A4RX,
      AF/A1PR and AF/ A1MR.
      4.5.2.2. Access. Initially, individuals must obtain a GCCS account through the local
      GCCS Terminal Area Security Officer (GTASO). Second, individuals must request a
      DCAPES account (associated with the GCCS account ID) through their MAJCOM
      Functional Readiness POC and System Administrator. The process for obtaining account
      access is:
          4.5.2.2.1. MAJCOMs will ensure all users attend in-residence DCAPES user training
          prior to receiving write permissions to the DCAPES database. The in-residence
          training consists of a traveling team or the formal AETC DCAPES Planners and
          DCAPES FAM Course. These are technical training courses that focus on the
          utilization of DCAPES applications. If a user has not completed in-residence
          DCAPES training, MAJCOMS can give users read-only privileges provided a user
          has completed the respective Computer-Based Training (CBT) for their area of
          responsibility. Information on applying to the schoolhouse or gaining access to the
          CBTs will be posted on http://www.a3a5.hq.af.smil.mil/a5x/a5xw/index.htm as it
          becomes available.
          4.5.2.2.2. Write permission must be limited to trained users whose duties justify the
          level of access.
          4.5.2.2.3. Under no circumstance should an untrained or novice user be given
          unmonitored access to an account with write capabilities.
          4.5.2.2.4. Each Service, combatant commander, or MAJCOM is responsible for
          determining access request procedures for that portion of GCCS under their
          operational control.
          4.5.2.2.4. (AFGSC) All requests for DCAPES and GCCS user access will be
          forwarded to HQ AFGSC/A3CW for processing and forwarding to the GCCS system
          administration office and input to the system. All requests for access by AFGSC
          personnel to Joint and Air Force War Planning and Execution Systems (WPES) will
          be submitted through local administrators to HQ AFGSC/A3CW.

        4.5.4.5.2. FM/Sub-FM will ensure utilization of DCAPES user list and creation of a
        DCAPES Global Access List that captures all users assigned to their respective
        agency.
           4.5.4.5.2.1. This user list will be used to send out messages/information (via e-
           mail, etc.) to all DCAPES users managed by the respective FM/Sub-FM dealing
           with any GCCS/ DCAPES issues (i.e. database unavailable, communication out,
           database maintenance, etc.).
           4.5.4.5.2.2. The list facilitates in userid reconciliation. For example, if e-mail
           distribution lists are used, "undeliverable" e-mails identify a user who has moved
           from one location to another, and identifies personnel who may no longer need
           GCCS/DCAPES access.
        4.5.4.5.3. FM/Sub-FM will notify ISSO/GTASO verification is complete or needs to
        be re-accomplished.
        4.5.4.5.4. ISSO/GTASO will notify the User Account Manager (UAM) that
        verification process is complete or needs to be re-accomplished.
           4.5.4.5.4.1. The FM/Sub-FM and UAM may be the same individual. However,
           there are many instances in the AFPEC that they are not, therefore requiring this
           level of coordination
        4.5.4.5.5. UAM builds an account for the user in DCAPES/JPERMS.
           4.5.4.5.5.1. UAM also coordinates with appropriate Work Group Manager
           (WGM) to ensure user has a profile (USERID and password) built on the PC
           client (Windows).
        4.5.4.5.6. Once User ID is built, FM to FM/Sub-FM to Sub-FM will coordinate for
        user access to applicable OPLANs from respective war-fighting combatant
        commander.
        4.5.4.5.7. Sub-FMs will notify UAMs permission has been granted.
        4.5.4.5.8. UAM notifies ISSO/GTASO that account set-up process has been
        complete.
        4.5.4.5.9. UAM provides the User ID and default password to the ISSO/GTASO via
        secure communications.
        4.5.4.5.10. ISSO/GTASO notifies user and directs user to change password upon
        initial Login.
           4.5.4.5.10.1. If user doesn’t change password, UAM or GTASO will disable
           account.
           4.5.4.5.10.2. User secures and stores default password for future use.
           4.5.4.5.10.3. If the user’s account is disabled, the UAM/WGM resets the account
           password.
        4.5.4.5.11. User will ensure password is marked with proper security classification.

UNIT TYPE CODE (UTC) DEVELOPMENT, REGISTRATION, AND MAINTENANCE

Section 5A—Purpose

5.1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide the background, guidance and
procedures for the development, registration, maintenance, and reporting of UTCs.
   5.1.1. Air Force Planners and FAMs will use the DCAPES module, Unit Type Management
   (UTM) for all UTC development, registration, and maintenance activities. Users with
   DCAPES UTM permissions can find specific instructions in the UTM User’s Guide.

Section 5B—Background

5.2. UTC Definition. A UTC is a potential capability focused upon accomplishment of a
specific mission that the military Service provides. It can consist of manpower force element
(MFE) only, equipment (LOGDET) only, or both manpower and equipment.
   5.2.1. UTCs are represented by a 5-character alphanumeric code. The assignment of a UTC
   categorizes each type organization into a class or kind of unit having common distinguishing
   characteristics, controlled by the Joint Staff and AF/A5XW. The first character of the UTC
   and the function it represents are provided in CJCSM 3150.24B Vol I and II, Type Unit
   Characteristics Report (TUCHAREQ). For some functional areas, the Air Force further
   defines the first two or three character in order to identify distinct capabilities within that
   functional area (see Table 5.1).
   5.2.2. War planners use UTCs to document total Air Force manpower and logistics
   requirements needed to support the national military strategy during operational planning and
   execution activities. These requirements are documented in a JOPES/DCAPES TPFDD (See
   Chapter 8 for details) in support of an OPLAN, CONPLAN or OPORD.
   5.2.3. The Mission Capabilities Statement (MISCAP) associated with a UTC defines the
   basic mission the UTC is capable of accomplishing. More information on MISCAPs is
   detailed later in this chapter.
   5.2.4. UTCs by definition define capabilities. Generally, one and two person UTCs are
   discouraged unless they represent a stand-alone capability essential to support the warfighter.
   One and two person UTCs will be carefully evaluated during the Manpower and Equipment
   Force Packages (MEFPAK) approval process to ensure the stand-alone standard is met
   before approval is granted.
       5.2.4.1. Specialized, combat-oriented organizations that deploy as a cross-functional,
       self-sustaining team must design their UTCs to be cross-functional rather than a grouping
       of functional UTCs to ensure that the entire organizational capability is aligned together.
       For example, a Materiel Management authorization in an Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
       should be included in a maintenance (H-series) UTC vice a supply (JF-series) UTC.
   5.2.5. Right Sized. A right-sized UTC is one that provides a generic building block
   capability. This provides greater flexibility to planners and enables optimal support to the
   warfighting combatant commander or component.
 94                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   5.2.6. Modular/scalable. UTCs can be used across the range of military operations (ROMO),
   whether for peacekeeping operations, humanitarian relief operations (HUMRO), rotational
   operations, small-scale contingencies, or combined with additional UTCs to meet OPLAN
   requirements. Small UTCs that build upon each other may be necessary to provide greater
   capability at a given location. A key element in modular/scalable UTCs is that the resources
   that make up a UTC are mutually exclusive of each other, in other words, no authorization is
   in more than one UTC. There are exceptions such as aviation and maintenance UTCs that
   support USSTRATCOM requirements (formerly known as SIOP), which could be dual
   postured; these are not mutually exclusive.
   5.2.7. A UTC is usable when it has been registered in DCAPES with MFE and/or equipment
   estimates. It is considered complete when it is registered in TUCHA, with all MFE and/or
   equipment detail. Once the UTC has been registered in the manpower and equipment force
   packaging (MEFPAK), the UTC can then be postured by an organization in the UTC
   Availability and with the exception of A-UTCs, can be used in a TPFDD for planning and
   execution purposes. (See Chapter 7)
   5.2.8. A cross-functional UTC is one made up of MFE from different functional areas. A
   cross-functional force module (See Chapter 6) is one made up of standard UTCs from
   different functional areas.
5.3. Types of UTCs
   5.3.1. There are two types of UTCs standard and non-standard
      5.3.1.1. Standard
          5.3.1.1.1. A standard UTC is a UTC in the MEFPAK and Type Unit Characteristics
          (TUCHA) data file that has complete movement characteristics in both files. Such
          UTC would be of fixed composition.
          5.3.1.1.2. Standard UTCs are used in JOPES/DCAPES to identify manpower and
          logistics requirements for deployment, movement planning, and plan execution.
          5.3.1.1.3. The Deployment Indicators (DEPIDS) for this UTC are generally E, P, 1,
          2, or 3. (See Table 5.3)
          5.3.1.1.4. A deployable UTC is one in which the MFE and/or equipment can be
          deployed to another location.
          5.3.1.1.5. A non-deployable UTC is one that is inherently not deployable, i.e.
          moveable to another location, generally ends in AAA, AA or A and has a DEPID of
          9.
              5.3.1.1.5.1. There is no MISCAP, MFE, or equipment for these UTCs.
              5.3.1.1.5.2. These UTCs generally end with "AA". Examples are PFAAA,
              1DAAA, and 7FSAA
              5.3.1.1.5.3. A unit is assigned a non-deployable UTC when the unit is created and
              documented in the Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) file.
                 5.3.1.1.5.3.1. Staffs responsible for establishing UICs will review the
                 MEFPAK list of DEPID 9 UTCs and select the one best describing the type of
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              95


                 organization.
                 5.3.1.1.5.3.2. The DEPID 9 UTC defines the organization type and allows
                 each type organization to be categorized into a kind or class with common
                 distinguishing characteristics. They are important to SORTS and appear as the
                 Unit UTC on AF Form 723, SORTS DOC Statement. Unit UTCs facilitate the
                 rapid categorization of like units by filtering. For example: filtering for UTC
                 3FAAA will produce all tactical fighter units.
             5.3.1.1.5.4. Non-deployable UTCs are used when units create the Basic Identity
             Data Element (BIDE) data necessary for registration in SORTS.
             5.3.1.1.5.5. DEPID 9 UTCs will not be placed in TPFDD or in UTC Availability
             to indicate in place requirements/capabilities.
      5.3.1.2. Non-Standard.
          5.3.1.2.1. A non-standard UTC is a UTC in the MEFPAK and TUCHA file that does
          not have complete movement characteristics. The two types of non-standard UTCs
          are "Z99" and "Associate" UTCs. Examples are 3FZ99 and QFZZZ.
          5.3.1.2.2. There are occasions when a planner does not have a standard UTC in
          which to move his manpower and/or equipment. A "Z99" non-standard UTC in the
          TUCHA will allow a planner to enter the UTC "shell" into a TPFDD. The planner can
          then build specific detailed requirements in the TPFDD using DCAPES. Non-
          Standard UTCs should never be used to define cross-functional requirements.
          Planners should always use the appropriate functional "Z99" UTC.
          5.3.1.2.3. Unit manpower that cannot be captured in a standard UTC will be postured
          into an "Associate" UTC (A-UTC). A-UTCs are placeholders for all funded military
          authorizations that cannot be described or do not fit into an existing standard UTC.
          Each functional area has an A-UTC to represent that functional area. The Associate
          UTCs themselves are not deployable, but the individuals filling the authorizations that
          are associated with the UTC are deployable (See Chapter 7 for UTC utilization and
          posturing guidance).
          5.3.1.2.4. An A-UTC is a placeholder for deployable capability. In other words, the
          UTC itself is not deployable and cannot be put into a TPFDD. This type of UTC is
          used during the UTC posturing process to indicate authorizations that an organization
          has and cannot posture in a standard UTC or to posture above base level staff
          authorizations not in standard UTCs
          5.3.1.2.5. A-UTCs have DEPID of 6. There is no MISCAP, MFE, or equipment for
          these UTCs in the MEFPAK.
             5.3.1.2.5.1. The MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA) for all Associate UTCs is
             AF/ A5XW. AF/A5XW will ensure Air Staff FAMs are involved in the
             development process.
5.3.1.2.5.2 These UTCs end with a ZZZ, ZZ, or Z, such as 3BZZZ, 9ACZZ, or 9ACPZ. The
current list of approved A-UTCs can be obtained through DCAPES or AF/A5XW website (
https://www.xo.hq.af.mil/xox/xoxw/index.htm).

5.4. UTC Attributes. UTCs have many attributes, which provide the description, status,
responsible organization, type, and transportation requirements.
   5.4.1. MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA) – Formerly known as the MEFPAK
   Responsible Command, is an organization designated by a HAF FAM to develop and
   maintain detailed data on a UTC for use throughout the Air Force.
   5.4.2. Deployment Indicator (DEPID) DEPID is a code identifying the deployment status of
   a UTC. (Table 5.3)
   5.4.3. Unit level code (ULC) The ULC indicates the relative organizational level of the unit
   or element (Table 5.4).
   5.4.4. Authorized Personnel (AUTH) AUTH is the sum of the specific manpower required to
   perform the mission defined in the MISCAP.
   5.4.5. Passengers (PAX) PAX is the portion of AUTH that requires transportation.
   Generally, it differs from AUTH only for 3-series UTCs (aviation) in which aircrew fly the
   aircraft to the deployed location, hence requiring no separate transportation.
   5.4.6. Total Short Tons (ST) Total weight of the equipment in the UTC in short tons. A short
   ton equals 2000 pounds.
      5.4.6.1. Bulk ST Total weight of the bulk equipment in the UTC in short tons. Cargo
      suitable for a 463L pallet.
      5.4.6.2. Oversized ST Total weight of the oversized equipment in the UTC in short tons.
      Cargo that exceeds the usable dimension of a 463L pallet.
      5.4.6.3. Outsized ST Total weight of the outsized equipment in the UTC in short tons.
      Cargo requiring wide-bodied aircraft.
      5.4.6.4. Non-Air Transportable ST Total weight of the equipment in the UTC that is not
      air transportable in short tons. Cargo too large for airlift.
      5.4.6.5. Table Of Allowance Total ST Total weight of the Table of Allowance equipment
      in the UTC in short tons.
      5.4.6.6. Organic ST Total weight of the equipment in the UTC that is moved organically,
      i.e., carried in the aircraft in the UTC, in short tons.
   5.4.7. The MISCAP is used by War planners to determine which UTCs can fill their
   requirements. (See paragraph 5.12.3.1.7 for details).
   5.4.8. Pilot Unit A pilot unit is responsible for developing and maintaining standard
   manpower and or logistics detail for each UTC for which it has been assigned responsibility
   by the MRA. Each and every UTC that has been approved and registered in the MEFPAK
   and TUCHA will have a Pilot Unit assigned. This is a change from previous guidance where
   UTCs with LOGDETs were the only UTCs with an assigned Pilot Unit.
   5.4.9. Aviation UTC information will include Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI),
   Mission Prefix, Mission Basic, Design Number, and Design Series.
   5.4.10. Title Description The title of a UTC consists of a brief description and is constructed
   using the instructions in Table 5.2 below and is standardized for data automation purposes.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                                97


   For aviation and maintenance UTCs, the title description usually includes the PMAI, Mission
   Design Series (MDS), component, etc.
5.5. Packaging of Air Force UTCs. These standard unit descriptions/force packages are
collected in MEFPAK through its two components: the Manpower Force Packaging System
(MANFOR) and the Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR). These are described in
paragraphs 5.7 and 5.8 below.
5.6. Manpower and Equipment Force Packages (MEFPAK). The MEFPAK supports the Air
Force in developing and describing standard, predefined manpower and equipment force
capabilities and determining the deployment characteristics of these force capabilities in support
of JOPES and DCAPES, Logistics Module (LOGMOD), and Manpower and Personnel Module
–Base (MANPER-B). MEFPAK operates within the DCAPES software on GCCS. DCAPES
supports MEFPAK and provides the capability to update GCCS files containing
personnel/logistics deployment capabilities available for deployment. DCAPES specifically
provides unit type management functions to the Air Staff. These functions allow selected Air
Staff users to aggregate data related to Air Force standard unit types, create summary products,
and feed the data to joint systems.
   5.6.1. MEFPAK was established to provide standard descriptions of the units and elements
   to be used for wartime, contingency, and force planning at all levels of command. Force
   packages are uniquely identified in MEFPAK with a 5-character alphanumeric designator
   called a UTC. Full UTC capability is not reached until a UTC is made available in the UTC
   Availability. A UTC becomes usable when it appears in the MEFPAK. Because MEFPAK
   data are distributed Service-wide, using a pre-coordinated UTC, at any stage in its
   development, reduces the amount of detailed planning and coordination needed during
   OPLAN development, review, and execution. This process should greatly reduce the use of
   "Z99" non-standard UTCs. The UTC will be considered complete only when registered in the
   Joint Type Unit Characteristics (TUCHA).
5.7. Personnel Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)
   5.7.1. The MANFOR is a component of MEFPAK and DCAPES. It is a database containing
   the UTC, UTC title, mission capability statement (MISCAP), and manpower detail for each
   applicable UTC. The MANFOR provides Air Force planners with standardized force
   capability outlining manpower requirements for operations planning, execution documents,
   and readiness measurement. It also provides an easy way to communicate standard planning
   manpower requirements to all Air Force units. MANFOR lists the specific manpower
   required to perform the mission defined in the UTC’s MISCAP.
   5.7.2. UTCs are generally built to accommodate 30-days of sustained capability before
   having to be augmented with new supplies or personnel. Personnel UTCs are generally built
   to accommodate 30-days of sustained capability before having to be resupplied or augmented
   with new supplies or personnel. Sustaining capability is based on 30-days of consumable
   supplies to support personnel working the wartime sustaining Manpower Availability Factor
   of six (6) 10-hour shifts. Surge operations typically last the first 30 days of an operation and
   entail (6) 12-hour shifts. Consumable supplies to support surge may be above and beyond
   normal UTC configurations. In developing UTCs, the FAM must ensure they have
   considered the difference between 24-hour availability and 24 hour coverage. The distinction
   is whether or not the mission requires personnel to be present around the clock vice mission
 98                                                   AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   accomplishment by recalling personnel when they are technically off-shift. The difference
   can mean tremendous costs in personnel resources to meet the capability. The Manpower
   plans function should assist in making these determinations and will help compute actual
   manpower costs.
       5.7.2.1. Manpower Force Element (MFE). Manpower detail contains the following
       elements:
           5.7.2.1.1. Standard AF Functional Account Code must be reflective of the
           employment function (mandatory).
           5.7.2.1.2. AFSC (mandatory)
           5.7.2.1.3. Grade (mandatory for officer and civilian requirements; enlisted may be
           omitted)
           5.7.2.1.4. Special Experience Identifier (if necessary)
           5.7.2.1.5. Command Remarks (if applicable)
           5.7.2.1.6. Quantity (mandatory)
       5.7.2.2. The objectives of MANFOR are achieved through the development of Air
       Force-level approved, force packages, built in DCAPES, and available to joint and Air
       Force command and control systems. MANFOR:
           5.7.2.2.1. Provides joint and Air Force planners with standardized force capabilities
           documenting manpower requirements for execution, operations, and deployment
           planning documents.
           5.7.2.2.2. Provides a means to communicate standard wartime, force planning, and
           contingency manpower requirements to all levels of command within the Air Force.
           5.7.2.2.3. Provides Air Force input to the JOPES TUCHA database.
           5.7.2.2.4. Establishes a baseline for communication among the MEFPAK responsible
           agencies.
           5.7.2.2.5. Serves as the foundation for individual requirements documentation by
           operations planners at all levels.
       5.7.2.3. The Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) provides the updated MANFOR file.
5.8. Logistics Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR). LOGFOR is a component of
MEFPAK and resides in LOGMOD. LOGFOR is updated by the LOGMOD system. It is used to
collect and store the materiel requirements (called the logistics detail (LOGDET)) for UTCs. The
LOGDET defines the standard passenger and equipment movement requirements for each UTC.
Pilot units develop and maintain UTCs for 30-days of sustainment, bare base capability, generic
to all like units, using the UTC MISCAP, Weapon/Non-Weapon System Allowance Standard
mobility-coded (Use Code "A") assets, Equipment Supply List (ESL), direction from HAF
FAMs and/or MAJCOM UTC FAMs, and non-pilot unit inputs. The only time UTCs will be
developed with less than 30-days of sustainment; (bare base capability) is when the situation is
identified in the MISCAP. The UTC MISCAP, Allowance Standard, HAF FAM direction, and/or
MAJCOM UTC FAM approval may authorize additional UTC requirements (such as
general/special purpose vehicles, aircraft fire bottles, Meals Ready-to-Eat, bottled water,
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              99


weapons, and mobility bags) in standard Air Force LOGDETs. The ESL is the primary source
document used by Civil Engineering to establish equipment requirements in LOGDET. For
further guidance see AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer
Emergency Force (BEEF) Program.
   5.8.1. LOGFOR functions include:
      5.8.1.1. Providing passenger and equipment planning data for deploying units.
      5.8.1.2. Serving as a UTC standard for communications among MEFPAK responsible
      agencies(those commands designated with pilot unit responsibility).
      5.8.1.3. Providing the foundation for individual force capability strategic airlift
      requirements estimates for planning.
      5.8.1.4. Providing inputs to the JOPES TUCHA database.
      5.8.1.5. LOGFOR is used to collect and store logistics detail (LOGDET) for UTCs.
      LOGFOR provides equipment-planning data for use by Air Force units in their mobility
      plans.
      5.8.1.6. Standard UTC LOGDET data is developed and maintained by pilot units in the
      LOGFOR module of LOGMOD.
          5.8.1.6.1. Non-Pilot units are required to procure and maintain the UTC equipment
          and supplies authorizations in order to provide the sustained 30 days of bare base
          capabilities required to support contingency and wartime missions.
      5.8.1.7. LOGMOD UTC suffix. LOGMOD systems at both the MAJCOMand base-level
      include a suffix to the UTC, which denotes various stages of development for the UTC.
      Definitions of UTC suffixes are in Table 5.6
   5.8.2. Following are descriptions of the levels of detail contained within LOGMOD.
      5.8.2.1. Aggregate (Level 1) includes total number of personnel, total short tons, total
      measurement tons, and total square feet.
      5.8.2.2. Summary (Level 2) includes total number of authorized personnel and number
      of passengers requiring transportation, total short tons, measurement tons (including
      barrels), and total square feet of bulk, oversize, outsize, and non-air-transportable cargo
      (by UTC and cargo increment number (CIN)).
      5.8.2.3. Cargo Category Code (Level 3) includes total number of authorized personnel
      by Officer, Enlisted, and Civilian (by UTC), total short tons and/or measurement tons
      (including barrels), total square feet of cargo as identified by the UTC, or CIN three-
      position cargo category code.
      5.8.2.4. Increment (Level 4) includes total number of passengers by Service specialty
      code (i.e., AFSC), by UTC, individual dimensional data (expressed in length, width, and
      height in number of inches) of cargo by equipment (as defined by individual national
      stock number) by UTC, and further defined as a group of equipment (consolidated) or
      single piece of cargo planned for shipment.
      5.8.2.5. Item Number (Level 5) includes total number of passengers by Service specialty
      code (i.e., AFSC) in deployment sequence (by line number), individual weight (in
 100                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       pounds) and dimensional data (expressed in length, width, and height in number of
       inches) of equipment in deployment sequence number by line number. Further defined as
       a piece of cargo on an increment. An item is normally a single piece of equipment, or
       loaded container of equipment, that is loaded on an increment.
       5.8.2.6. Level 6. Increment includes total individual weight (in pounds) and dimensional
       data (expressed in length, width, and height in number of inches), as defined by
       individual national stock number of equipment in deployment sequence number by ULN.
       5.8.2.7. Level 7. Item Number further defines pieces of cargo on an increment. An item
       is normally a single piece of equipment, or loaded container of equipment, that is loaded
       on an increment.
       5.8.2.8. Suffix Item (Level 8) includes something loaded in an item (when the item is a
       container) and placed on an increment.
   5.8.3. LOGDET is the Air Force logistics input to the TUCHA. Upon completion by pilot
   units and approval by the MEFPAK responsible agency (MRA) and Air Staff UTC FAM,
   standard UTC equipment requirements (as reflected in suffix zero LOGDET) are captured
   via the Type Unit Data Report (TYPREP) file and given to joint planners as the Air Force’s
   input to the TUCHA file. AF/A4LX (HAF LOGDET Manager) provides Defense
   Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Joint Staff Support Center (JSSC) with Air Force
   inputs for inclusion in the joint TUCHA database. MRAs submit LOGFOR updates to
   AF/A4LX in accordance with this AFI. MRAs will review LOGDETs at least biennially (see
   paragraph 5.17).
   5.8.4. Air Force logistics input to the TUCHA. The TUCHA is used to update Joint
   Operations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) using personnel strength and short ton
   information developed by the pilot unit. Without these movement characteristics, the United
   States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) cannot determine or validate accurate
   airlift requirements for units identified within the Time Phased-Force Deployment Data
   (TPFDD) development/refinement process.
5.9. Type Unit Characteristics (TUCHA). Using DCAPES, MEFPAK updates occur
continuously in real time and the TUCHA is updated as often as the joint community allows.
Currently this is done quarterly; however, with the flexibility of the DCAPES/MEFPAK process,
it is possible, and the goal is, to update the TUCHA seamlessly. There could be some delay
before a UTC that is useable in DCAPES becomes visible in the joint TUCHA. The MEFPAK
Summary Report, able to be produced on demand in DCAPES, reflects standard Air Force UTC
personnel and cargo movement characteristics used by Air Force planners for general war
planning.
   5.9.1. UTCs with DEPID codes of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, E, or P and required detail data are registered
   in TUCHA. UTCs that fail critical edit checks will not be reported in TUCHA until the error
   is corrected.
   5.9.2. UTCs registered in MEFPAK without required detail data will be canceled if detail
   data is not received within the time frames stated in Table 5.5
5.10. Type Unit Data Report (TYPREP). Joint planning above the component level does not
require the amount of personnel and equipment detail contained in the MEFPAK. The Air Force
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             101


provides UTC level 1, 3, and 4 details to the Joint Staff (JS) in the TYPREP. The Joint Staff
distributes the TYPREP as the TUCHA to the combatant commanders for use in JOPES for
developing the TPFDD and in determining OPLAN transportation feasibility.
5.11. UTC Utilization. UTCs are the primary means for identifying forces described in JOPES
and DCAPES. They are also used for Air Force support of Status of Resources and Training
System (SORTS) reporting, AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART) reporting, Air National Guard
(ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) force structuring, and as building blocks to
task organize AETFs.
   5.11.1. As stated earlier, joint and Air Force war planners use UTCs to document total Air
   Force manpower and logistics requirements needed to support the national military strategy
   during contingency planning. These requirements are documented in JOPES TPFDDs and
   within DCAPES. The TPFDD listing is identified in Annex A, Appendix 1, of the OPLAN
   and lists total requirements (expressed in UTCs) and units tasked to fill those requirements
   represented as UICs. Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 of this manual provide instructions on how
   UTCs are used in OPLAN and TPFDD development. As a rule, only UTCs with a DEPID of
   1, 2, 3, E, or P are used in TPFDD files. UTCs with a DEPID 6 (Z99) may be used in a
   TPFDD if no standard UTC provides the required capability (see 5.3.1.2.2). However, A-
   UTCs (DEPID 6) will not be used in TPFDD development for contingency planning until:
       5.11.1.1. DELETED.
       5.11.1.2. DELETED.
   5.11.2. UTCs cannot be utilized in TPFDDs until they are registered in MEFPAK via the
   UTC Registration application in DCAPES. UTC Registration, a part of the UTC
   Management (UTM) module of DCAPES, provides the users with the capability to ADD,
   CHANGE, or CANCEL UTCs. The ADD function is also referred to as “UTC
   Development.”
       5.11.2.1. When performing any of the functions in UTC Registration, the users must
       initially place a UTC in a particular “state” or “status” (Table 5.7).
          5.11.2.1.1. The "Working" state indicates that a UTC request is in its initial stage of
          development and has not yet been staffed for coordination beyond its developer,
          however all UTC functions must be vetted through the corresponding HAF FAM
          prior to submission. If UTCs need to be “approved” by the HAF Functional Area
          leadership, then “approval” needs to be accomplished at this point in the process. All
          UTCs requiring HAF Functional Area leadership “approval” need to be coordinated
          with the HAF Functional Manager’s leadership prior to “submitting” in the UTC
          Management, Registration module.
          5.11.2.1.2. The "Published" state indicates that the UTC request has been published
          by the initiator for coordination and all agencies with access to UTM can review the
          UTC and provide inputs to the corresponding MRA prior to submission. AF/A5XW
          can view a “published” UTC but can’t make any direct corrections to the UTC.
          5.11.2.1.3. The "Submitted" state indicates that the UTC request has been submitted
          to the HAF MEFPAK Manager (AF/A5XW) for review, HAF FAM coordination and
          final AF/A5XW approval. UTCs requiring HAF Functional Area leadership

          “approval” must have this approval prior to “submitting” and must state approval
          completion in the “Rationale/Justification” (“HAF Functional Area leadership has
          approved this UTC request”). UTCs requiring HAF Functional Area leadership
          “approval” that lack this information will be sent back to the MRA as “Incomplete”.
          5.11.2.1.4. The "Coordinated" state indicates that the HAF MEFPAK Manager
          (A5XW) has initiated actions on the HAF to gain approval of the UTC request. This
          usually means that a "UTC Coordination Report" has been e-mailed to the HAF FAM
          or other approving agency.
          5.11.2.1.5. The "Incomplete" state can mean several things. First, it can indicate that
          a problem was discovered with the UTC request and it has been sent back for
          resolution. Second, a request may be determined to be invalid if rejected by the HAF
          FAM or if the request is a duplicate of a previous request. Third, this could mean that
          the UTC requires HAF Functional Area leadership approval prior to submission and
          the justification is missing the required statement. It is the responsibility of the
          requesting agency to take action to "clean up" (remove) the "Incomplete" UTCs in the
          UTM system.
          5.11.2.1.6. The "Approved" state indicates that all coordination activities at the HAF
          have been completed. The HAF MEFPAK Manager (A5XW) is the agency that
          places the request in this state.
          5.11.2.1.7. The "Disapproved" state indicates that the UTC request has been
          disapproved. This state ensures that the UTC and its five character designation will
          never be used again. This is a very dangerous state since the five characters may need
          to be used at a later time. The "Incomplete" state is often the better selection. The
          HAF MEFPAK Manager (A5XW) is the agency that places the request in this state.
          5.11.2.1.8. The "Registered" state indicates that the UTC request has been approved
          by AF/A5XW and registered into the MEFPAK. The HAF MANFOR Manager
          (AFMA) usually places the request into this state. This will now allow MFE and
          LOGDET activities to take place for "New" UTC requests. At this point, the UTC can
          be used for planning and execution purposes and can be postured in the UTA.
              5.11.2.1.8.1. Once a "new" UTC has been registered in the MEFPAK, the Pilot
              Unit/MRA has 90 days to update the MFE and LOGDET.

Section 5C—Guidance

5.12. Types of UTC Registration Requests. UTC Registration requests are accomplished in
the UTM module utilizing the UTM registration function in DCAPES. This function provides
three Actions; ADD (see paragraphs 5.12.1. through 5.12.5.), CHANGE (see paragraph 5.12.6.),
and CANCEL (see paragraph 5.12.7.). The choice button defaults to the "ADD" option.
   5.12.1. UTC Development (ADDs). UTC development is the process of adding a UTC to the
   MEFPAK, building the manpower and or logistics detail, and getting the UTC added to the
   TUCHA. New UTCs will be requested when a desired capability does not exist in a standard
   UTC. In addition, the following guidelines will help determine when a UTC must be
   developed:
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            103


     5.12.1.1. New equipment types enter the inventory.
     5.12.1.2. Deployable units experience a significant change in either operational concept
     or mission.
     5.12.1.3. Significant program changes occur in manpower or equipment.
     5.12.1.4. Significant program or operational changes occur.
     5.12.1.5. Air Force organization requires a change in the way an existing capability
     functions.
  5.12.2. A HAF FAM, MAJCOM, ANG, FOA, or DRU usually initiates the development of a
  UTC. Using the guidelines in paragraph 5.12.1.1 through 5.12.1.5, request new UTCs as
  soon as you know, at least 120 days prior to initial operational capability (IOC) or if a
  capability has been deployed during at least two AEF rotations without an existing UTC.
  Requests for new UTCs will be submitted to AF/A5XW via DCAPES. Following AF/A5XW
  review, AF/A5XW will forward the UTC request to the appropriate Air Staff FAM, or
  equivalent, for concurrence/non-concurrence. The MRA will ordinarily be assigned to the
  command making the UTC request; however, this is not always the case. MRA assigns a
  pilot unit to develop the UTC and again, it may not always be from the same command. In
  this case, coordination between the two commands must take place. See paragraph 5.15 for
  process details and Attachment 4, UTC Development Instructions.

  5.12.3. New UTC requests are created in the Unit Type Management (UTM) module
  utilizing the UTM registration function in DCAPES. In the UTM Registration function, the
  "Action" choice button gives the user the option of "ADD", "CHG", or "CNX".
     5.12.3.1. "ADD" is the default option for a new request. The user will be prompted to
     supply and enter all of the following mandatory information:
         5.12.3.1.1. Proposed UTC designation. The proposed UTC designation can include
         the full five positions or any part thereof; e.g., 3F, 3FG, 3FGA5.
         5.12.3.1.2. Proposed UTC title. The title is constructed using the instructions in
         Table 5.2 and is standardized for data automation purposes. It is built using the
         Aviation, or Non-Aviation templates in the UTM tool in DCAPES.
         5.12.3.1.3. Deployment indicator code (DEPID), which identifies the deployment
         capability and composition of the UTC (Table 5.3).
         5.12.3.1.4. Unit level code (ULC), which indicates the relative organizational level of
         the unit or element (Table 5.4).
         5.12.3.1.5. Approximate authorized strength. Include hours of operation if not
         included in MISCAP.
         5.12.3.1.6. Summary level logistics data (approximate number of short tons).
         5.12.3.1.7. Proposed MISCAP. The MISCAP defines the mission the UTC is capable
         of accomplishing. If applicable, clearly define substitution rules (e.g. AFSC, skill
         level requirement, grade, SEIs, equipment), to include thresholds on the maximum
104                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


         number of positions that could be substituted; if functional AFIs define substitution
         rules, these should be included (or at a minimum cross-referenced) in the MISCAP.
         Spell out all acronyms and abbreviations used in the title and MISCAPs. Include any
         other pertinent information. Aviation UTCs must reference the WMP-5 for sortie and
         attrition rates and durations. Crew ratios are unclassified and may be placed in the
         MISCAP, but the authoritative source is AFI 65-503. Every MISCAP is required to
         have the UTC point of contact and date of the last UTC review. This is the last item
         in the MISCAP and the format is: MAJCOM POC: OFFICE SYMBOL, DSN xxx-
         xxxx. REVIEWED MMM YY. This is required for all UTCs to include new ADDs.
            5.12.3.1.7.1. The MISCAP is the only part of the UTC that could be classified.
            Air Force UTCs are generally not classified, but if they must be classified,
            MISCAPs containing monthly flying hour utilization must be classified at least
            CONFIDENTIAL. Classification of MISCAPs must not exceed SECRET.
            Executive Order (EO) 12958 requires originator data to be contained in all
            classified MISCAPS.
            5.12.3.1.7.2. Pilot units will ensure secure transmission (i.e. SIPRNET, classified
            FAX, etc) of UTC detail with classified MISCAPs when transmitting from base to
            MRA. Although many aviation MISCAPs are classified, the manpower detail
            (MANFOR) is not. If classified MISCAPs are combined with the UTC MANFOR
            in a single document or transmission, both will be marked according to the level
            of classification of the UTC MISCAP. UTC LOGDETs will never be classified,
            as pilot units develop them in an unclassified system (LOGMOD).
         5.12.3.1.8. For aviation UTCs, indicate the number of crew members that must be
         subtracted from authorized personnel to obtain an accurate passenger count.
            5.12.3.1.8.1. DELETED.
         5.12.3.1.9. Rationale or justification for UTC development (see Attachment 4, Item
         14).
         5.12.3.1.10. Proposed pilot unit. A pilot unit is responsible for developing and
         maintaining standard manpower and logistics detail for each UTC it has been
         assigned. The goal is a uniform capability for all units that will use the UTC. Refer to
         paragraph 5.15.12 of this instruction for more details about Pilot Unit
         Responsibilities. Ensure you inform the proposed pilot unit of your intentions.
         5.12.3.1.11. HAF FAM office symbol and phone number with whom the requirement
         was coordinated or the HAF agency directing the development.
         5.12.3.1.12. Office symbol and phone number of the Command FAM/Agency POC
         who is responsible for the request and can answer specific questions concerning
         request activities.
         5.12.3.1.13. Listing of all points of contact at the command for cross-functional
         UTCs.
         5.12.3.1.14. Impact on AETF force modules (FMs), if any. If there are none, so state.
         If the UTC is in an FM (See Chapter 6 for details), then indicate the FMID.

     5.12.3.3. New UTCs and changes to UTCs automatically send a message to the
     DCAPES news group: c2news.af.pentagon.smil.mil-hqaf.mefpak.updates.
  5.12.4. Validated manpower and logistics detail data must be submitted within 90 days of
  UTC registration in MEFPAK. Based on amount of anticipated LOGDET, MAJCOM
  LOGDET Manager may set a suspense of less than 90 days. If there are fewer than 90 days
  until that update, manpower and logistics detail will be included in the following update. See
  Table 5.5
     5.12.4.1. A UTC registered in the MEFPAK can be used at any stage of development.
     This allows the Air Force to minimize the use of "Z99" non-standard UTCs while taking
     advantage of any initial UTC development actions already underway. To ensure JOPES
     acceptance of this level of data is achieved, the standard indicator code in the TPFFD will
     reflect an "8" indicating Unit reported data. For specific details, see Chapter 7.
  5.12.5. Rule sets for building UTCs:
     5.12.5.1. UTC Right Sizing. A right-sized UTC is one that provides a generic building
     block capability. This provides greater flexibility to planners and enables optimal support
     to the warfighting combatant commander or component. When integrated with other
     right-sized UTCs, it provides greater mission capability needed to support an AEG,
     AEW, or AETF. Right-sized UTCs will minimize the need for fragging and tailoring in
     both the contingency and crisis action planning processes. In order for a UTC to be
     considered right sized, it must meet the following criteria:
         5.12.5.1.1. Modular/Scalable. UTCs will be modular/scalable. They can be used
         across the range of military operations (ROMO), whether for peacekeeping
         operations, humanitarian relief operations (HUMRO), rotational operations, small-
         scale contingencies, or combined with additional UTCs to meet OPLAN
         requirements. Small UTCs that build upon each other may be necessary to provide
         greater capability at a given location. A key element in modular/ scalable UTCs is
         that the resources that make up a UTC are mutually exclusive of each other. For
         aviation units, squadrons will be tasked with a lead element and one to three follow-
         on elements depending on number and type of aircraft. Unless specifically designed
         otherwise, a UTC can be deployed to any AOR and originate from a unit from any
         MAJCOM.
106                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


         5.12.5.1.2. UTCs should be developed so that the entire UTC can be tasked from a
         single organization. This will eliminate the need to fragment the UTC across multiple
         units. For aviation UTCs, it will still be necessary to task resources from other key
         organizations (e.g., maintenance, intelligence, supply, etc.).
             5.12.5.1.2.1. The single organization rule also applies to blended units,
             Reserve/Guard associate or Active -associate units, and other future total force
             organizational initiatives. For these units, separate UTCs must be developed for
             the Active component and the Air Reserve component portions of the unit.
             5.12.5.1.2.2. Specialized, combat-oriented organizations that deploy as a cross-
             functional, self-sustaining team must develop UTCs that encompass all functions
             necessary to carry out the entire organizational capability.
         5.12.5.1.3. Unless specifically designed otherwise, UTCs must be capable of stand-
         alone operations within their functional area. The UTC should be able to perform its
         mission from a bare base or established main operating base or, if designed to meet
         main operating base requirements, must be able to combine with additional UTCs to
         meet requirements of bare base operations.
      5.12.5.2. Parent/Child UTCs. Parent/child UTCs will not be approved and should no
      longer be postured; however, to understand this concept, the following is provided. UTCs
      are considered to be parent/child UTCs when the same manpower position is in more
      than one UTC in the UTC Availability. A funded Air Force manning position will be
      aligned to no more than one UTC. When posturing additional UTCs, it is imperative not
      to create parent/child relationships. The following definitions are provided to avoid the
      creation of parent/child UTCs:
         5.12.5.2.1. A UTC is a parent if any of the authorizations in the larger parent UTC
         are also aligned to one or more corresponding subset or children UTCs.
         5.12.5.2.2. Child UTCs are UTCs that provide a partial capability of the parent and in
         which all the authorizations in the child UTC are also found in the parent UTC.
         5.12.5.2.3. A UTC is also considered to be a child if, when combined with other
         child UTCs, the compilation of all authorizations and capability in the child UTCs
         approximates the authorizations and capability of the parent.
      5.12.5.3. As stated earlier, oneand two-person standard deployable UTCs should be
      avoided unless the UTC represents the logical team or package size to support combatant
      commander TPFDD requirements (i.e., chaplains, historians, comptrollers, public affairs,
      PERSCO teams, aircraft battle damage repair, etc.) These types of UTCs will be
      scrutinized to determine if they are necessary.
      5.12.5.4. Creation of cross functional UTCs should be avoided unless they comprise a
      unique mission capable "team" that depends on the integrated use of several functional
      disciplines. Members of cross-functional team UTCs work together and represent their
      functional expertise towards a common mission goal. Note: MAJCOM FAMs must
      coordinate with all applicable FAMs when building cross-functional UTCs and this
      coordination will be included in the UTC submission.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          107


     5.12.5.5. 3-Level limitations. The establishment of an apprentice level deployable
     "requirement" in UTCs is discouraged except where AFSC specific technical skills can
     be applied in the deployment environment. While the use of 3 Levels for deployments is
     not common, the Air Force does utilize them, e.g., Third Country National (TCN) escort
     or postal augmentation UTC requirements during rotational operations. In addition, it is
     also important to point out additional limitations:
        5.12.5.5.1. Trainee practice on combat ready equipment may have a negative impact.
        Asset(s) may become operationally unusable.
        5.12.5.5.2. The need to forward deploy an infrastructure to ensure trainees meet
        testing gates.
        5.12.5.5.3. Procedures to disqualify trainees who do not pass training requirements
        under hostile environments.
        5.12.5.5.4. Time off from the work center to accomplish CDCs. Note: They are
        already in10-hour sustainment duty days. Web access constraints and consumption of
        bandwidth needed for operational purposes make downrange training of 3-levels
        impractical.
        5.12.5.5.5. The potential to increase UTC manning because every 3 skill level
        requires direct supervision that limits supervisors from duties they were there to
        perform in the first place.
        5.12.5.5.6. A few functional areas have postured 3 Levels in A-UTCs (see Chapter
        7) that are nondeployable by definition and do not represent a deployable capability
        by policy.
        5.12.5.5.7. Establishing a UTC requirement for a 3 level resource means the person
        tasked to deploy can be anywhere on the training timeline. They could be fresh out of
        school or nearing award of their journeyman AFSC. It also impacts the decision-
        making authority of the commander in assessing qualifications of individual
        personnel to deploy. Additional guidance can be found in AFI 10-403, Deployment
        Planning and Execution for deployment policy.
     5.12.5.6. Vehicles should not be included in functional area UTCs. All vehicles will be
     postured in UF-series UTCs only. A waiver for this policy may be requested through
     AF/A4/7. Exception: special units (e.g. RED HORSE, Combat Comm, ASOS/ASOG,
     CRC) postured in Enabler libraries may have vehicles imbedded within their functional
     UTCs.
     5.12.5.7. When all the details of a UTC are developed (personnel data and/or logistics
     data), the UTC is then registered in the TUCHA file maintained by the Joint Staff. The
     UTC is registered in the TUCHA and provides standard planning data and movement
     characteristics for personnel, cargo, and accompanying supplies associated with type
     units. Since the Air Force utilizes the Pilot Unit concept above, the TUCHA updates
     JOPES using personnel strength and short ton information developed at pilot unit level in
     most cases. Without these movement characteristics, USTRANSCOM cannot determine
     or validate accurate airlift requirements for units identified within the TPFDD
     development/refinement process.

  5.12.6. UTM Changes. "CHG" allows the user to change any of the UTC attributes (but not
  LOGDET). Once a “Working Copy” of the UTC is generated and the UTC is identified, the
  following data elements will automatically be provided: MRA, Updated Date, Created Date,
  Status, DEPID, ULC, Pilot Unit, UTC Title and MISCAP. To place the UTC into
  “Published” status, no additional data elements need to be filled in. Once the UTC is ready
  to be placed into “Submitted” status, the following are mandatory data elements that need to
  be provided to modify the UTC:
      5.12.6.1. Pilot Unit Phone Number.
      5.12.6.2. HQ FAM Office Symbol and Phone Number with whom the modification was
      coordinated or the HAF agency directing the modification.
      5.12.6.3. Command FAM Office Symbol and Phone Number of the Command
      FAM/Agency POC who is responsible for the request and can answer specific questions
      concerning the modification.
      5.12.6.4. Rationale/Justification. Submitting MRA must provide the rationale for the
      modification.
      5.12.6.5. Impact of Core UTCs. Submitting MRA should provide information in regard
      to the impact on any of the AETF force modules.
  5.12.7. UTM Cancels. "CNX" provides the capability to submit a UTC for cancellation.
      5.12.7.1. When a UTC is no longer needed, the MRA can request that the UTC be
      canceled. Since this is a registration action, it must be coordinated with other commands
      that are using the UTC.
      5.12.7.2. If a UTC is submitted for cancellation by one MRA, but in fact is used by other
      commands, a formal request can be made to that other command to assume MEFPAK
      responsibility for the UTC. The request is submitted to the HAF MEFPAK Manager
      (AF/A5XW). Once it has been coordinated with the HAF FAM it will be “approved” and
      then “registered” by AFMA under the new MRA.
      5.12.7.3. When a MRA builds the “Working Copy” for a UTC to be cancelled and the
      UTC is identified, the following data elements will automatically be provided: MRA,
      Updated Date, Created Date, Status, DEPID, ULC, Pilot Unit, UTC Title and MISCAP.
      To place the UTC into “Published” status, no additional data elements need to be filled
      in. Once the UTC is to be placed into “Submitted” status, the following are mandatory
      data elements that need to be provided to modify the UTC:
         5.12.7.3.1. HAF FAM Office Symbol and Phone Number with whom the
         cancellation was coordinated or the HAF agency directing the cancellation.
         5.12.7.3.2. Command FAM Office Symbol and Phone Number of the Command
         FAM/Agency POC who is responsible for the request and can answer specific
         questions concerning the cancellation.
         5.12.7.3.3. Rationale.    Submitting MRA must provide the rationale for the
         cancellation.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           109


          5.12.7.3.4. Impact of Core UTCs. Submitting MRA should provide information in
          regard to the impact on any of the AETF force modules. Need the UTC/UTCs that
          may be replacing the cancelled UTC in the AETF force modules.
      5.12.7.4. UTCs that are canceled will remain in the MEFPAK (as a DEPID 0) and in
      TUCHA for one year. This should provide sufficient time for the TPFDD to be updated
      with the current UTC and, if the details are needed, they will still be available. The
      deletion action from the MEFPAK will be automatic after one year.
5.13. UTC Maintenance. The Maintenance module within DCAPES allows the user to view all
UTC information: UTC, CMD (Major Command), UTC Title, DEPID (Deployment Indicator),
ULC (Unit Level Code), MISCAP Class (Mission Capability Classification), Last Reg Update,
Last MFE Updated, and Last Log update. In addition, the MISCAP, LOGDET, and MFE details
can be viewed from this tool.
   5.13.1. With the appropriate roles and permissions in the UTM tool, changes to the UTC can
   be accomplished in this module. This level of permission is reserved for HAF and MRA
   MEFPAK Managers. It is important to note that LOGDET changes are currently
   accomplished via LOGMOD with the intent to incorporate this function into DCAPES.
   5.13.2. The end result of this maintenance is a changed UTC, but without electronic
   coordination. It is possible, with "appropriate roles and permissions", to change any UTC.

5.15. UTC Development Duties & Responsibilities
5.15. (AFGSC)UTC Development Duties & Responsibilities. HQ AFGSC FAMs are the HQ
AFGSC OPR for new UTC development. HQ AFGSC FAMs work with HQ AFGSC/A1MW
and A4R in the development of new UTCs. Requirements for new standard UTCs will be
coordinated with HQ AFGSC/A3CW. HQ AFGSC/A3CW submits requests for new UTCs to
HQ USAF for approval.
   5.15.1. This section lists responsibilities of major players in the UTC development process:
   AF/ A5XW (HAF MEFPAK Manager), AF/A4RX (HAF LOGDET Manager), AFMA (HAF
   MANFOR Manager), Air Staff FAMs, MEFPAK Responsible Agencies (including,
   command FAMs, Manpower Function, Supply, and Logistics Plans offices), Pilot/Non-Pilot
   Units, and using MAJCOMs.
   5.15.2. AF/A5XW:
110                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      5.15.2.1. Acts as reviewing, coordinating and approving agency for all UTC requests.
         5.15.2.1.1. Reviews all UTCs submitted via UTC Registration to ensure UTC
         designations and UTC titles comply with Table 5.1. Reviews MISCAPs to ensure
         accuracy and makes corrections as necessary, ensures that all necessary data is
         provided, DEPID designations are correct and Rationale/Justification and Impact on
         Core UTCs are logical and valid.
         5.15.2.1.2. Forwards all submitted UTCs to the appropriate HAF FAM for review
         and coordination. Ensures timely responses.
         5.15.2.1.3. Once HAF FAM provides concurrence, AF/A5XW will “approve” UTC.
         If HAF FAM nonconcurs, coordinates with MRA to alleviate and solve problem and
         requests resubmission of UTC.
      5.15.2.2. Acts as the HAF MEFPAK Manager for the Air Force.
      5.15.2.3. Missing, incomplete, erroneous UTC data “Submitted” will be sent back to the
      submitting organization as “Incomplete”. Errors will be identified in the memo.
      5.15.2.4. In coordination with AF/A4RC, AFMA/MASR and the JS (JOSC), determine
      when Air Force will request the next TUCHA update.
      5.15.2.5. Tracks all UTCs that have surpassed the 90-day suspense for having
      incomplete manpower and/or logistics detail. AF/A5XW will notify corresponding MRA
      MEFPAK Manager of discrepancies. After 180 days, A5XW division chief will notify
      senior AF leadership for further action. Further delays in completion will result in UTC
      being cancelled unless satisfactory rationale is provided.
  5.15.3. AF/A4RX (Plans and Integration Division):
      5.15.3.1. Acts as LOGFOR OPR for the Air Force.
      5.15.3.2. Receives, updates, and reviews LOGDET data from MEFPAK Responsible
      Agency.
      5.15.3.3. Provides TYPREP submission to Defense Information Systems Agency
      (DISA)/Joint Staff Support Center (JSSC) for updating TUCHA.
         5.15.3.3.1. Type Unit Data Report (TYPREP). Joint planning above the component
         level does not require the amount of personnel and equipment detail contained in the
         MEFPAK. The Air Force provides UTC level 1, 3, and 4 details to JS in the
         TYPREP. JS distributes the TYPREP as the TUCHA to the combatant commanders
         for use in JOPES for developing the TPFDD and in determining OPLAN
         transportation feasibility. UTCs with DEPID codes of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, E, or P and
         required detail data are registered in TUCHA (DEPID 6 & 9 do not have detailed
         data). UTCs that fail critical edit checks will not be reported in TUCHA until the
         error is corrected.
      5.15.3.4. Conducts review of accuracy of LOGFOR data submitted by MEFPAK
      responsible agencies and identifies critical edit errors for timely correction.
      5.15.3.5. Approves Air Force standard LOGDET.
      5.15.3.6. Updates the MEFPAK with LOGFOR data on a monthly basis.

  5.15.4. HAF FAMs:
     5.15.4.1. Act as Air Force validator of all new, changed, and canceled UTCs. Coordinate
     with AF/ A1MR and AF/A4RX and forward UTC action requests to AF/A5XW.
     5.15.4.2. Conduct a biennial review of MEFPAK data to ensure manpower and logistics
     detail are at least the minimum needed to fulfill the MISCAP. Ensure that data is
     accurately recorded in MANFOR and LOGFOR.
     5.15.4.3. Assign a MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA) to develop UTC detail data.
     5.15.4.4. If HAF FAM requires functional area leadership to approve any UTC add,
     change or cancellation, ensure this coordination is completed prior to MRA “submitting”
     UTC in UTM. Completion of this FAM functional area leadership coordination must be
     addressed in the Rationale/Justification portion of the UTC submission.
     5.15.4.5. Once AF/A5XW has requested HAF FAM UTC coordination, provide
     expedient response; no longer than 30 days.
  5.15.5. AFMA:
     5.15.5.1. Acts as MANFOR OPR for the Air Force.
     5.15.5.2. Reviews and registers new UTC data in the MANFOR database.
     5.15.5.3. Updates, and reviews MANFOR data from MEFPAK Responsible Agencies
     for administrative accuracy.

     revalidated on a regular basis.
     5.15.5.5. Creates MANFOR file in conjunction with AF/A4RX who creates the
     LOGFOR file for submission to TUCHA file.
     5.15.5.6. Provides MANFOR updates as needed; data provided for MANPER-B users
     and posted to the REDMINI, a classified file server located at AFPC to distribute Data
     Pattern Traffic (DPT) packages to the appropriate MANPER system(s).
     5.15.5.7. Notifies   MEFPAK        Responsible   Agencies,    Air   Staff FAM,
     AF/A5XW/A1MR/A4RX, HQ ANG, HQ AFRC, and other interested commands and
     agencies of completion of each update of the MANFOR data in DCAPES.
     5.15.5.8. Processes HAF updates.
     5.15.5.9. Is responsible for working changes and updating UTCs for the following
     commands: AFESA, 11WG, USAFA, HQ USAF, and AFOSI.

  5.15.6. MEFPAK Responsible Agency (MRA)
112                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      5.15.6.1. A MEFPAK Responsible Agency is an organization designated by a HAF
      FAM to develop and maintain detailed data on a UTC for use throughout the Air Force.
         5.15.6.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A3CW is the MRA for AFGSC-owned
         UTCs.
      5.15.6.2. Appoints a MEFPAK Manager, usually either the command plans or
      Manpower office, as a single point of contact for UTC actions.
      5.15.6.3. Coordinates fully on proposed UTCs within its headquarters and with any
      commands possessing forces that could be represented by the proposed UTC, including
      HQ AFRC and ANG, to ensure UTC meets all user requirements. If a coordinated
      position cannot be reached, forwards issue to appropriate HAF FAM and
      AF/A5XW/A1MR/A4RX for resolution.
      5.15.6.4. Submits requests for proposed UTCs through DCAPES to AF/A5XW and
      appropriate HAF FAM.
      5.15.6.5. Provides a proposed implementation date for new UTCs to the FAM.
      5.15.6.6. Reviews and certifies accuracy and currency of its UTCs at least biennially.
      This review must include all elements of the UTC.
      5.15.6.7. Coordinates fully all proposed force changes with any command possessing
      force availability, including ANG and AFRC. This will ensure all posturing commands
      agree and have adequate time to communicate changes to their units. If a coordinated
      position cannot be reached, forwards issue to appropriate HAF FAM and
      AF/A5XW/A1MR for resolution.
         5.15.6.7.1. HQ AFRC and ANG can and should be appointed MRA for their
         respective UTCs. However, coordination with other MAJCOMs, such as ACC and
         AMC is necessary when those MAJCOMS are affected by any UTC actions. MRA
         responsibility for gaining command UTCs will be decided between HQ AFRC, ANG,
         and the gaining command.
  5.15.7. The MRA MEFPAK Manager:
      5.15.7.1. Submits requests for new, changed, or canceled UTCs in DCAPES.
      5.15.7.2. Notifies MRA FAM of UTC designation for new UTCs.
      5.15.7.3. Reviews and analyzes MANFOR and LOGFOR updates to determine UTC
      accuracy and ensures corrective actions are taken during the next update.
      5.15.7.4. In coordination with the appropriate FAM(s), reviews and analyzes TUCHA
      data for UTCs the command uses but is not the MEFPAK responsible agency; and
      provides feedback to the responsible MRA to ensure inaccuracies are corrected.
      5.15.7.5. Reviews MISCAPs at least biennially or as required with MRA FAMs.
      5.15.7.6. Develops and provides guidance and assistance to MRA FAMs in UTC
      development and maintenance.
      5.15.7.7. Oversees development for and submits the following data:
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           113


        5.15.7.7.1. Planned Passenger and Equipment Detail. These data are used for a
        deploying unit. The supported component headquarters tailors these data, if
        necessary, based on asset and facility status in receiving theater at execution time.
        5.15.7.7.2. LOGDET, which must be coordinated among the using commands and
        approved by the MRA.
        5.15.7.7.3. Manpower Detail.
     5.15.7.8. Conducts, in coordination with OFAMO, initial and annual MRA FAM training
     to all assigned MRA FAMs. Training will include MRA duties such as manpower and
     logistics detail development, MISCAP development, and UTC review procedures.
     5.15.7.9. Ensures    coordination    between      supporting      MEFPAK         offices
     (MANFOR/LOGFOR) regarding registration actions affecting their portions of the
     system. For example, UTC delete actions currently require a separate set of processes to
     remove the UTC from the LOGFOR.
     5.15.7.10. Coordinate FAM UTC deletion requests with the appropriate plans office to
     accomplish TPFDD screening and update as well as corrections to the UTC Availability.
     5.15.7.11. Establish a risk mitigation process to address the utilization of 3-skill level
     requirements in MEFPAK responsible UTCs. The process should, at a minimum address
     risk reduction and require leadership approval.
     5.15.7.12. Ensure UTCs that require HAF Functional Area leadership “approval” are
     approved at the HAF level prior to “submitting” in UTM Registration. Once “approved”
     by HAF Functional Area leadership and UTC is “submitted”, ensure approval statement
     is included in the Rationale/Justification (“HAF Functional Area leadership has approved
     this UTC request”).
     5.15.7.13. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A3CW is the MRA MEFPAK Manager for
     AFGSC-owned UTCs.
  5.15.8. The MRA Supply:
     5.15.8.1. Approves/disapproves AF Form 601/TACR, Equipment Action Request and/or
     allowance change request via the TACR screen in the Air Force Equipment Management
     System (AFEMS), and informs pilot unit equipment management (EM) element of
     approval or disapproval.
     5.15.8.2. Coordinates AF Form 601/TACR action with appropriate MRA agencies which
     forward AF Form 601/TACR to the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) depot for
     approval.

  5.15.9. MRA Manpower Office:
     5.15.9.1. Updates MISCAPs and manpower detail based on coordinated inputs of
     MEFPAK Manager, FAM, and pilot unit.
     5.15.9.2. Analyzes specific manpower detail of UTCs submitted by FAMs and /or pilot
     units for UTC/UMD mismatches and accuracy. Ensures all aviation maintenance UTCs
     are built based on the command implementation of the Logistics Composite Model
114                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      (LCOM) standards. However, there are other planning factors involved in the
      development of maintenance UTCs.
      5.15.9.3. Provides UTC manpower detail to FAMs for review.
      5.15.9.4. Ensures the UTC concept for manpower requirements does not exceed funded
      authorizations
      5.15.9.5. Ensures MANFOR data are processed and input to MEFPAK in accordance
      with Table 5.5
      5.15.9.6. Reviews and validates manpower requirements in MEFPAK responsible UTCs
      on a biennial basis with the FAM.
      5.15.9.7. Performs AFSC and functional account code (FAC) indirect conversions in
      accordance with applicable conversion guidance.
  5.15.10. MRA LOGDET Manager (usually Logistics Plans office):
      5.15.10.1. Assists MRA FAM in designating a pilot unit to develop standard logistics
      detail for new UTCs. MEFPAK Responsible Agencies will work closely with
      NGB/A4RX or HQ AFRC/ LGX any time an ANG or AFRC unit needs to be designated
      as a pilot unit.
         5.15.10.1.1. MRA FAMs and NGB/A4RX will work with ANG FAMs to select a
         candidate for pilot unit appointment. NGB/A4RX will coordinate, in writing, all
         requests for UTC registrations, cancellations, transfers, and title/DEPID changes with
         the MRA MEFPAK Manager.
         5.15.10.1.2. NGB/A4RX will accomplish internal ANG coordination prior to pilot
         unit appointment, including obtaining written concurrence of The Adjutant General
         (TAG) of the unit’s state. When coordination is complete between ANG and the
         MEFPAK-responsible command, NGB/A4RX will release a message appointing the
         pilot unit, info copying the MEFPAK Responsible LOGDET Manager and UTC
         FAM.
      5.15.10.2. Notify Pilot Unit that UTC has been registered and the 90-day clock has
      started. Based on amount of anticipated LOGDET, the LOGDET manager may set
      suspense less than 90 days.
      5.15.10.3. Monitors pilot unit's progress in developing LOGDET in accordance with
      Table 5.5 MRA Logistics Plans/LOGMOD and LOGMOD Stand Alone Manager are
      responsible for the command’s UTCs requiring logistics detail. Units (both pilot and non-
      pilot) requiring LOGMOD/ LOGMOD Stand Alone procedural or technical assistance
      will contact the MRA LOGMOD/ LOGMOD Stand Alone Manager as their first line of
      defense prior to requesting assistance from the Operations and Sustainment Systems
      Group (OSSG) Field Assistance Branch (FAB). If the MRA LOGMOD/LOGMOD Stand
      Alone Manager cannot provide adequate assistance, base-level units will be directed to
      the FAB for resolution. LOGMOD/LOGMOD Stand Alone Training will be provided to
      units by the appropriate agency (see AFI 10-403). Active Duty units will contact the
      MRA LOGMOD Manager. ANG units will contact NGB/A4RX. (See AFI 10-403 for
      more details).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          115


     5.15.10.4. Reviews the pilot unit data transfer file on the HQ USAF central file server.
     Provides a copy of LOGDET for MRA FAM to review prior to submission to AF/A4RX.
     MRA LOGDET Managers will notify pilot units (i.e., telephone or electronic mail) if
     their LOGDETs have been disapproved and will provide appropriate information (e.g.,
     LOGMOD Database Verification listings) to pilot units when the aforementioned
     discrepancies require corrective action. Command LOGDET Managers will disapprove
     LOGDETs when:
        5.15.10.4.1. LOGMOD database verification errors exist.
        5.15.10.4.2. Incorrect LOGMOD increment types exist.
        5.15.10.4.3. LOGDET pallet increments do not list 463L pallet, top net, side nets and
        dunnage as items 1-4.
        5.15.10.4.4. Incorrect or missing Special Handling Indicator (SHI) codes exist.
        5.15.10.4.5. Incorrect or missing hazardous codes exist.
        5.15.10.4.6. Incorrect deployment echelons codes exist.
        5.15.10.4.7. Incorrect cargo category codes exist.
        5.15.10.4.8. Internal Slingable Units (ISUs), Cadillac Bins, or Brooks and Perkins
        containers exist.
     5.15.10.5. Forwards LOGFOR data to AF/A4RX quarterly, or as changes occur. Upon
     review and approval by the MRA and applicable ANG and AFRC UTC FAMs, MRA
     LOGDET Managers will immediately "approve" UTC LOGDETs to AF/A4RX for
     inclusion in the next quarterly update cycle.
     5.15.10.6. Provides LOGFOR data to MRA FAM at least biennially or as changes occur.
     5.15.10.7. Provides results of quarterly LOGFOR updates to MRA MEFPAK Manager.
     Upon update release, identify UTC LOGDET discrepancies, as reflected in the MEFPAK
     Summary listing, to the MEFPAK Manager and MRA, ANG and AFRC FAMs. Upon
     completion of each quarterly UTC update cycle, administered by, MRA LOGDET
     Managers will conduct a thorough review of the most current MEFPAK Summary listing
     and identify their respective UTCs that are marked with an asterisk. An asterisk in the
     MEFPAK Summary denotes that one or more UTC data elements (MANFOR or
     LOGFOR) are in error or were not available at the time of TYPREP creation. Pilot units
     who have not developed and reported standard equipment UTC requirements (LOGDET)
     to the MRA UTC FAM for review and approval will be identified to the MRA Manager
     and the MRA UTC FAM for immediate resolution. Failure to comply with these
     directives will result in UTC cancellation unless otherwise directed by the MRA UTC
     FAM. ANG/ AFRC-unique UTCs will be identified to NGB/A4RX and HQ AFRC/A4X,
     respectively, for immediate resolution.
     5.15.10.8. Provides quarterly MANFOR/LOGFOR UTC updates to base-level
     Manpower and Logistics Plans offices, advising them of UTC changes. This update will
     identify all of the commands newly registered, cancelled, and deleted UTCs, MEFPAK
     transfers (UTCs transferred from one MRA to another), and UTC Title and DEPID code
     changes.
116                                             AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      5.15.10.8.1. Newly registered UTCs will identify appointed pilot units and assigned
      suspense dates for LOGDET reporting to the MRA (ANG units are appointed as pilot
      units by NGB/ A4RX with an info copy to the MEFPAK Responsible Agency).
      5.15.10.8.2. Cancelled UTCs relieve pilot units of all responsibility for maintaining
      and reporting UTC LOGDET. Non-pilot units will delete cancelled UTCs from their
      LOGPLAN database from all LOGPLAN PIDs, to include LOGMOD DSOE. Upon
      cancellation of a UTC, MRA LOGDET Managers will delete the pilot unit working
      LOGDET (Suffix 1, 5, 8, or9) from LOGFOR. The HAF LOGMOD Manager will
      change the DEPID code for the current approved LOGDET in LOGFOR to a zero. A
      zero DEPID code prevents all LOGMOD users from copying cancelled LOGDET
      detail to their LOGPLAN database. Cancelled UTCs will remain in LOGFOR for a
      period of one year in the event the UTC must be reinstated. Cancelled UTCs will
      continue to appear on unit DOC statements, the UTC Availability, and
      OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDDs until the appropriate MAJCOM/ANG UTC FAM
      revises and publishes updated documents. Recommend all non-pilot units obtain
      MAJCOM UTC FAM guidance, in writing, relieving them from cancelled tasking
      until the aforementioned documents have been corrected.
      5.15.10.8.3. Deleted UTCs are those that have been cancelled for a period of one
      year, are no longer on Air Force/Base level file, and will be deleted from LOGFOR
      by the HAF LOGMOD Manager (AF/A4RX).
      5.15.10.8.4. UTCs transferred from one MRA to another will reflect a newly
      designated pilot unit in the MANFOR/LOGFOR Quarterly UTC Update released by
      the MRA LOGDET Manager. Upon receipt of this update, designated pilot units will
      review the existing LOGDET and ensure it is in compliance with Air Force and
      MAJCOM directives.
         5.15.10.8.4.1. When UTCs are transferred from one MRA to another, a pilot unit
         transfer will follow. The previous pilot unit will be relieved of all responsibility
         for maintaining and reporting the UTC’s LOGDET; however, the unit is not
         relieved of UTC tasking unless the MAJCOM UTC FAM provides written
         guidance to that effect or until the appropriate tasking documents have been
         updated (i.e., UTC Availability, OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDDs, etc).
         5.15.10.8.4.2. MRAs will not designate pilot units to maintain another MRA’s
         UTC(s) without proper coordination with and approval from the other MRA and
         AF/A5XW.
         5.15.10.8.4.3. The MRA LOGMOD Manager will update UTC title changes in
         the LOGFOR UTC Header Record after the results of each Quarterly UTC
         Update are published.
         5.15.10.8.4.4. When UTCs with a DEPID code change from P to 1, 2, 3, 4, or E,
         pilot units will have 90 days from UTC registration or DEPID Code change to
         develop and report the UTC in the LOGFOR module of LOGMOD to the MRA
         LOGDET Manager. UTCs with a DEPID change from 1, 2, 3, 4, or E to P require
         units to delete UTCs from their LOGPLAN database from all LOGPLAN PIDs,
         to include LOGMOD DSOE. Upon changing of the DEPID Code, MRA
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              117


            LOGMOD Managers will delete the pilot unit working LOGDET (Suffix 1, 5, 8,
            or 9) from LOGFOR. The HAF LOGMOD Manager will delete the current
            approved LOGDET from LOGFOR.
     5.15.10.9. In accordance with AFIs 10-403 and 25-101, the MRA Command LOGDET
     Manager will ensure Internal Slingable Units (ISUs, Cadillac Bins or Brooks & Perkins
     containers) are not loaded in lieu of or as a substitute for 463L pallets within the standard
     Air Force LOGDET for UTCs for which it is responsible. The LOGDET OPR at
     MAJCOM level will direct pilot units to build standard UTC with 463L pallets and notify
     units not in compliance to take immediate corrective action. Note: Units are to develop
     logistics plan files for known taskings (i.e., OPLANs, CONPLANs, etc.). In these files
     they may outload in ISU containers provided they tailor to meet the unique
     mission/location and optimize their packing in a manner that prevents exceeding the
     gross weight of the standard UTC.
  5.15.11. The MRA FAM:
     5.15.11.1. Upon assignment, contacts MRA MEFPAK Manager to receive formal
     training on pilot unit responsibilities and LOGDET development/review.
     5.15.11.2. Submits requests for UTC development to MRA OPR
     5.15.11.3. Submits requests for UTC cancellations to MEFPAK Manager, including
     reason UTC is no longer required.
     5.15.11.4. Fully coordinates all UTC development, changes, and cancellations with all
     using commands and with ANG, HQ AFRC, HAF/FAM, and pilot unit if either has
     tasked non-pilot units in accordance with the UTC Availability.
     5.15.11.5. Develops the manpower detail for their assigned UTCs and submits changes
     to the command Manpower Plans Office for submission to HQ USAF (as required).
     5.15.11.6. Reviews and updates MISCAPs and manpower detail biennially or as
     required.
     5.15.11.7. Designates a pilot unit from within the MRA to develop standard LOGDET
     for new UTCs and provides pilot unit with MISCAP. ANG and AFRC pilot unit
     designations will be coordinated with NGB/A4RX and HQ AFRC/A4X and applicable
     FAMs at those agencies. Information copies of pilot unit appointment should be provided
     to the MRA logistics plans office and pilot unit's local logistics plans function. MRA
     UTC FAMs will not designate a pilot unit from another MAJCOM without proper
     coordination and approval from the proposed pilot unit MAJCOM FAM and AF/A5XW.
     5.15.11.8. Ensures LOGDET is accurate and consistent with current AS and policy
     statements in AFI 10-403 and AFI 25-101. Upon receipt of a LOGFOR Materiel Listing
     from the LOGDET Manager, conduct a thorough comparison of the UTC LOGDET
     against the appropriate AS (Use Code "A" items) for consistency to ensure the pilot unit
     has not exceeded authorizations. FAMs will use Air Force Equipment Management
     System (AFEMS), or request assistance from the MAJCOM Allowance Standard
     Manager (MAJCOM Supply) when comparing the LOGDET against the appropriate AS.
     LOGFOR Materiel Listings will be provided to MRA FAMs on the occasion of a first-
     time report of a newlydeveloped LOGDET, when designated pilot units submit their
118                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      UTCs to the LOGDET Manager as a result of semi-annual LOGDET reporting, and upon
      request from the MRA UTC FAM.
      5.15.11.9. Develops common user lift passenger requirements and advises MRA
      LOGDET office.
      5.15.11.10. Reviews LOGDET biennially and as required. Coordinates updates with
      designated pilot unit and appropriate staff agencies prior to implementation. Works with
      pilot unit to determine requirement and frequency of pilot unit conferences to ensure all
      non-pilot units (users of the same UTC) validate and plan for programmed manpower and
      equipment changes (i.e., Force Structure, UMD, Allowance Standard, MISCAP changes,
      etc).
      5.15.11.11. Requests assistance from MRA manpower plans office to assist in UTC
      management and accountability.
      5.15.11.12. Works closely with MRA plans, manpower, and logistics plans offices to
      ensure MANFOR and LOGFOR data are complete and accurate.
      5.15.11.13. Reviews LOGDET data quarterly to ensure pilot units are accurately entering
      data into the system. When notified by MRA LOGDET Manager of overdue or missing
      LOGDET reports, the MRA UTC FAM will contact the pilot unit directly to ascertain the
      reason for the overdue report.
      5.15.11.14. Maintains copies of MANFOR and LOGFOR data for each UTC managed.
      5.15.11.15. Maintains information on availability and tasking of UTCs for which they
      are responsible. Ensures that units can fill whole or partial UTC requirements they are
      being tasked to support for mobility and contingency planning purposes from manpower
      authorized in the unit. Units will not be tasked to provide UTCs or portions thereof that
      exceed unit manpower document (UMD) authorizations.
      5.15.11.16. Monitor pilot unit's progress in development of LOGDET in conjunction
      with MRA logistics plans office. Ensure LOGDET is submitted within timelines stated in
      Table 5.5
      5.15.11.17. Accomplish MEFPAK risk mitigation processes when developing UTCs that
      establish 3-skil level requirements.
      5.15.11.18. Ensure UTCs that require HAF Functional Area leadership “approval” are
      approved at the HAF level prior to “publishing and submitting” in UTM Registration.
      Once “approved” by HAF Functional Area leadership, UTC can be “submitted”. Ensure
      approval statement is included in the Rationale/Justification (“HAF Functional Area
      leadership has approved this UTC request”).
  5.15.12. Pilot Unit. A pilot unit is responsible for developing and maintaining standard
  manpower and logistics detail for each UTC it has been assigned. The goal is a uniform
  package for all units that will use the UTC. Pilot units are appointed, in writing, by the
  corresponding MRA FAMs. The MRA FAM will formally appoint pilot units, via message
  traffic, by their unit designator. If the pilot unit is a tenant unit residing on another
  MAJCOM’s installation and is not considered a wing, MRA LOGDET Manager will identify
  the appropriate unit designator. The Pilot Unit Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), Plans
  and Integration Section (LGRDX) acts as the overall point of contact when tasked to develop
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         119


  the required UTC detail. Based on the UTC Functional Grouping, the Installation
  Deployment Officer (IDO) is responsible for assisting the UDM(s) in the development and
  reporting of UTC detail (i.e., MANFOR and LOGFOR) to the MRA. The pilot unit:
     5.15.12.1. Submits and coordinates UTC changes through its MAJCOM. For ANG units,
     submit all UTC changes to NGB/A4RX for staffing with info to ANG OFAMO.
     5.15.12.2. Develops manpower detail in conjunction with the MRA FAM, MRA
     Manpower office, and base Manpower office. For personnel-only UTCs (DEPID code P),
     units will contact the MRA UTC FAM before developing and reporting manpower detail.
     In many cases the MRA FAM retains control for developing and maintaining the UTC
     MANFOR, in which case the unit would only be required to review and provide
     recommended changes.
     5.15.12.3. Develops LOGDET using the appropriate AS (e.g., i.e., Weapons System
     Table of Allowances (WSTA), Equipment Supply Listing (ESL) as the source document
     based on the mission capability of the UTC. The following will be included:
        5.15.12.3.1. Equipment items that are coded as mobility equipment in appropriate
        AS.
            5.15.12.3.1.1. Pilot unit UDMs or functional area representative(s) for a
            designated UTC will use Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) to
            ensure all AS mobility-coded (Use Code "A") items are loaded in the standard
            UTC LOGDET prior to reporting to MRA LOGDET Manager. Pilot units will
            obtain access to AFEMS via the nearest Logistics Readiness Squadron Equipment
            Management Element, formerly known as Equipment Liaison Office (ELO)).
            Pilot units that are geographically separated and/or not collocated on a military
            installation with a Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) will request assistance
            from the nearest military installation Logistics Readiness Squadron customer
            service representative for AFEMS access. ANG and AFRC units may require
            assistance from their respective supply representatives at Numbered Air Force
            (NAF), ANG, HQ AFRC, or Gaining MAJCOM level.
            5.15.12.3.1.2. All AS equipment LOGDET information at the item/suffix item
            level will reflect primary National Stock Numbers, applicable Allowance Source
            Codes (ASC), tasked quantities (see note), dimensional data for items (length,
            width, height, and weight), and all applicable hazard classes/divisions in
            accordance with AFMAN (I) 24-204, as well as all corresponding Special
            Handling Indicator (SHI) codes. Note: Regardless of the tasked quantity, item
            level weights will always be input as the single weight of one item.
        5.15.12.3.2. Approved readiness spares capability, readiness spares package (RSP)
        for aviation UTCs.
        5.15.12.3.3. Any non-equipment, non-RSP items necessary to directly support
        MISCAP (e.g., administrative supplies). However, do not include items in the
        LOGDET of one UTC that support another (e.g., do not include extra light-alls in an
        aviation UTC to support a security force entry control point). All non-equipment
        (non-AS) or non-RSP LOGDET information at item/ suffix item level will reflect
        primary National Stock Numbers (see note 1), tasked quantities (see note 2),
120                                             AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      dimensional data at item level (length, width, height and weight), all applicable
      hazardous classes/divisions in accordance with AFMAN 24-204(I), as well as all
      corresponding Special Handling Indicator (SHI) codes. Note 1: While standard Air
      Force LOGDETs must contain primary National Stock Numbers (NSNs), not every
      item/suffix item is guaranteed to have an NSN as reflected in the Allowance
      Standard, FEDLOG, or Standard Base Supply System (SBSS). In the event an NSN
      does not exist, pilot units will associate the proper supply Federal Stock Class (FSC),
      along with a "P" and the part number for the item, to create a usable NSN (e.g.
      7510P3409A). If the item does not have a stock number or part number, the pilot unit
      will assign the proper supply FSC, along with a brief nomenclature of the item, to
      create an NSN (Ex: 7510STAPLER). For CE, use of a NSL number (Ex: 7510-00-
      NSL-001) will serve the same purpose when associated to a specific part. Note 2:
      Regardless of the tasked quantity, item level weights will always be input as the
      single weight of one item.
      5.15.12.3.4. Packaging material (pallets, nets, cargo bins, etc.) to ensure the most
      efficient packaging method is recommended to affected units to optimize their
      deployment footprint.
         5.15.12.3.4.1. LOGMOD automatically assigns standard planning information
         (weights, dimensional data, and quantities) to items 01, 02, and 03 when
         pilot/non-pilot units develop pallet increment types. The overall dimensions of a
         463L Pallet are 88 inches by108 inches, by 2 1/4 inches thick. However, the
         usable dimensions of the upper surface are84 inches by 104 inches. This allows
         for two inches around the periphery to attach straps, nets, or other restraint
         devices. An empty 463L pallet weighs 290 pounds (355 pounds with nets) and has
         a maximum, netted load capacity of 10,000 pounds. The desired load capacity is
         7,500 pounds (to help prolong pallet life). Internal Slingable Units (ISUs),
         Cadillac Bins, Brooks & Perkins containers, and married pallets/pallet trains are
         not considered LOGMOD Pallet Type Increments and will not be loaded as such
         in the LOGFOR module of LOGMOD.
         5.15.12.3.4.2. Pilot/non-pilot units will load pallet dunnage as Item 04 for all
         pallet increments using the following movement characteristics: Length 88, Width
         4, Height 4, Weight 30 pounds, with a quantity of three. Since dunnage is a local
         purchase item, pilot/ non-pilot units will use the appropriate Federal Supply Class
         (FSC) to create the National Stock Number (NSN). The appropriate FSC is 5510,
         Lumber and Related Basic Wood Materials, which includes dimensional lumber,
         wood flooring, etc. Dunnage (e.g., lumber or timber) is placed under 463L pallets
         to prevent damage to the lower pallet surface and to aid in transportation with a
         forklift. The minimum dimensions of a piece of dunnage are 4x4x88 inches long.
         Use three pieces to support each loaded 463L pallet while on the ground. Just
         about any type of material can be used as dunnage. However, wood is cheapest
         and the most readily available type. All 463L pallets will be shipped with
         dunnage. This is both required for deployment and redeployment and must be
         provided by the user (ref TO 35D33-2-2-2 and TO 35D33-2-3-1).
         5.15.12.3.4.3. Pilot units will ensure Internal Slingable Units (ISUs, Cadillac
         Bins, or Brooks & Perkins containers) are not loaded in lieu of, or as a substitute
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            121


            for 463L pallets and nets within standard Air Force LOGDETs. Possession of
            ISUs does not relieve a unit of their responsibility/requirement to maintain 463L
            pallets and nets in sufficient numbers to meet the determined requirement.
            Exception: in accordance with AFI 25-101, Bare Base UTCs can only be shipped
            containerized and are therefore exempt from this guidance for items that must be
            containerized. This does not include RSP for BEAR Systems and items that may
            be shipped in other than containers provided within the UTC buy. MRA
            LOGDET Managers will identify all LOGDETs that contain ISUs to the pilot unit
            for immediate corrective action.
            5.15.12.3.4.4. Units are not prohibited from loading ISUs in LOGPLAN UTCs
            for OPLAN or notional tasking as long as the gross weight of the standard UTC
            LOGDET is not exceeded. Deviations from this guidance are prohibited.
            5.15.12.3.4.5. Pilot units will ensure the palletized increments within the standard
            UTC LOGDET do not exceed 10,000 pounds. Non-pilot units will ensure
            palletized increments within the LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD do not exceed
            10,000 pounds.
            5.15.12.3.4.6. Pilot units will physically build, weigh, and measure each
            increment of cargo when developing and maintaining standard UTC LOGDETs.
            5.15.12.3.4.7. Within the UTC LOGDET, Pilot Units will list the contents (suffix
            items) for items identified as containers. In other words, Pilot Units must reflect
            the specific equipment/non-equipment requirements, to include NSN,
            Nomenclature, tasked quantities, Hazard/Special Handling Indicator codes,
            sensitive/controlled items, and ASCs, that all like units are required to deploy in
            order to meet the mission of the UTC MISCAP. The following exceptions apply:
            Do not list contents for MRSP except those that are hazardous or Use code "A"
            (Allowance Standard asset), Do not list the contents for Consolidated Tool Kits
            (CTKs) except those that are hazardous or Use code "A" (Allowance Standard
            asset), miscellaneous administrative supplies (pens, pencils, paper, etc.) except
            those that are hazardous or Use code "A" (Allowance Standard asset), medical
            supplies except those that are hazardous or Use code "A" (Allowance Standard
            asset) or individual civil engineer kits except those that are hazardous or Use code
            "A" (Allowance Standard asset). Note: LOGMOD is not designed for making
            frequent changes to fluctuating quantities of such expendables as pencils, forms,
            hand tools or narcotics. Inventory and Deployment Packing lists for CTKs and
            miscellaneous administrative supplies are the responsibilities of the owning unit.
            Logistics Readiness Squadrons and Medical units will use automated inventory
            and packaging lists generated by their functional systems (i.e., R-43 for supply
            and Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) for medical). Civil
            Engineering pilot units will use the Equipment and Supply Listing (ESL) to define
            the contents of civil engineering kits; printed copies of pertinent ESL will be
            placed on or within individual kits.
     5.15.12.4. Coordinates recommended changes to LOGDET and manpower detail with
     non-pilot units. To effectively coordinate all recommended changes, pilot units must
     know who their non-pilot units (users of the same UTC) are and in turn, non-pilot units
122                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      must know who the pilot unit is for UTCs for which they are notionally tasked. Pilot units
      may also identify UTC non-pilot units by obtaining access to the Air Force UTC
      Availability, via Global Command and Control System (GCCS) platform or contacting
      the MRA LOGDET Managers directly for assistance.
      5.15.12.5. If unit determines that mission cannot be accomplished with equipment
      currently authorized, the base unit equipment custodian:
         5.15.12.5.1. Determines that use code "A" is applicable.
         5.15.12.5.2. Prepares an AF Form 601/TACR or allowance change request via the
         TACR screen in the AFEMS with full justification.
         5.15.12.5.3. Coordinates with base Logistics Readiness Flight.
         5.15.12.5.4. Coordinates with wing Manpower office to ensure increase in equipment
         does not contain a manpower impact.
      5.15.12.6. All manpower increases/decreases will be staffed with base Logistics
      Readiness Flight to ensure adjustment does not adversely affect equipment-to-operator
      ratio.
      5.15.12.7. The unit's Logistics Readiness Flight validates AF Form 601/TACR received
      from custodian and determines need for requested equipment. If requirement is valid, the
      unit logistics plans office sends a message addressed to non-pilot units, with information
      copies to MRA FAM, citing specific changes required (to include stock numbers and
      other information that identifies the problem and recommended action).
      5.15.12.8. MAJCOM LOGDET Managers will assist in disseminating recommended
      changes to non-pilot units.
      5.15.12.9. The wing Manpower office will ensure the UTC concept for manpower
      requirements does not exceed funded authorizations.
      5.15.12.10. If majority of units concur with recommended change and action does not
      involve an AS change, the pilot unit sends a message to MRA FAM requesting approval
      to change LOGDET/ manpower detail.
      5.15.12.11. If majority of units concur with recommended change and an AS change is
      required, the pilot unit must ensure that unit equipment custodian prepares AF Form
      601/TACR. The EM element of the pilot unit Logistics Readiness Squadron approves AF
      Form 601/TACR or allowance change request via the TACR screen in the AFEMS and
      forwards it through supply channels. Upon MAJCOM approval or disapproval of AF
      Form 601/TACR, the unit EM element advises unit deployment manager (UDM) and
      wing manpower function office of approved changes or disapproval so manpower
      impacts can be assessed. A request to change LOGDET can only be made if equipment is
      included in the applicable AS. Other pilot units possessing similar systems determine if
      proposed changes are relevant to their weapons systems and, if so, initiate action
      described in 5.18
      5.15.12.12. If consensus is for disapproval, sends a message containing a synopsis of
      disapproval to all affected addressees.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           123


        5.15.12.12.1. Pilot units will not load pending AS mobility items into the LOGDET
        until approval of AF Form 601/TACR and addition of the item(s) is reflected in the
        AS. Pilot units are not prohibited from adding pending AS items into LOGPLAN for
        the purpose of exercising UTCs. Pilot units may also physically deploy pending AS
        items, if required, with MRA UTC FAM written approval. The pilot unit Logistics
        Readiness Flight will maintain copies of the submitted AF Form 601/TACR on file,
        for inspection purposes, until such time as the AF Form 601/TACR has been
        approved and the applicable AS has been updated.
        5.15.12.12.2. Non-pilot units will not add nor deploy pending AS items to
        LOGPLAN UTCs without written approval from the pilot unit and MAJCOM UTC
        FAM.
     5.15.12.13. Prepares necessary LOGMOD transactions to reflect accepted changes and
     informs all agencies involved via message.
     5.15.12.14. Provides LOGDET data to MAJCOM logistics plans office according to
     established time frames.
     5.15.12.15. Enters in "last report date" column the date when LOGDET is submitted to
     the MAJCOM.
     5.15.12.16. The pilot unit will, during the biennial review process, build, measure, and
     weigh all palletized cargo and any increments of cargo for UTCs that have had major
     ASC, MISCAP, primary aircraft authorized (PAA), or equipment changes within the last
     2 years (since the last biennial review) or has any other indication that the weights and
     measures have changed. Equipment end items (e.g., vehicles, AGE, trailers, home-station
     hard-wired/bolted down end items) are not required to be remeasured and reweighed
     during the annual review process as these items have static weights and dimensions that
     should not change.
     5.15.12.17. Conduct pilot unit conferences every two years, scheduling them to
     maximize non-pilot unit availability. Pilot unit representation will be comprised of the
     Logistics Readiness Officer in Charge and/or Installation Deployment Officer (IDO),
     LOGMOD Administrator or designated representative, as well as the appropriate
     functional area representatives, to assist in the development, maintenance, and reporting
     of UTC detail (i.e., MISCAP, MANFOR, and LOGFOR). Attendance at pilot unit
     conferences by all non-pilot units is critical. MAJCOM UTC FAMs will coordinate
     conference scheduling with the assistance of the MAJCOM LOGMOD Manager. Note:
     Pilot unit conferences for small, personnel only UTCs are not required every two years.
     For those UTCs, pilot unit conferences are required on an as needed basis when major
     changes are projected. Telephone, video, or other electronic means will suffice in lieu of
     traditional conferences.
     5.15.12.18. If a pilot unit can’t meet the 90-day suspense for MANFOR and/or LOGDET
     completion, they must submit an extension request. The extension must be developed by
     the pilot unit, signed by the wing commander, endorsed by the appropriate MAJCOM 2-
     digit and forwarded to AF/A5X. Extension request will include: justification, ECD, any
     request for assistance and POC.

  5.15.13. Non-Pilot Unit. Non-pilot units are units having a weapon system or functional
  tasking the same as the pilot unit. The non-pilot unit is not normally subordinate to the pilot
  unit, except when the MAJCOM retains control of the UTC composition or a parent
  organization develops a UTC to be distributed to its subordinate units. Refer to AFI 10-403
  for more details.
      5.15.13.1. Advises pilot units of its correct message address for UTC information and
      unit identification code (UIC) (see paragraph 5.15.12.4 above). While the LOGFOR
      Module of LOGMOD should accurately identify a UTC’s pilot unit, units should contact
      their MAJCOM LOGDET Managers if there is question or for further information.
      5.15.13.2. Evaluates pilot unit recommended changes to the AS and manpower detail
      and provides comments, concurrence, or nonoccurrence directly to the pilot unit within
      30 calendar days, or one unit training assembly (UTA) for ANG and AFRC units.
      5.15.13.3. Loads Air Force approved LOGDET in standard UTC reference file as
      standard UTC for deployment planning. On a semi-annual basis, non-pilot units will
      download the most current Air Force approved LOGDET (UTC suffix zero) for UTCs in
      which they are tasked, into a standard LOGPLAN UTC reference file (Plan ID). Units
      will then conduct a thorough comparison between the current downloaded UTCs and
      existing UTCs in their Pseudo and UTC Availability PIDs to ensure tasked Unit
      Deployment Managers (UDMs) are aware of standard UTC requirements. Significant
      differences between the LOGDET and LOGPLAN UTCs will be identified, documented,
      and resolved by the non-pilot unit.
         5.15.13.3.1. Non-Pilot units are required to procure and maintain the UTC equipment
         and supplies authorizations in order to provide the sustained 30 days of bare base
         capabilities required to support contingency and wartime missions. All Non-pilot
         units will establish a process for budgeting and procuring equipment (i.e., non-
         expendable items) and expendable items required to support the mission of the UTC.
         Documentation, such as Memo-Due Out's and Memo-Due In's, in order for unit
         commanders to properly account for UTC items on-hand or on order, which are
         required for deployment.
      5.15.13.4. To accurately identify the correct pilot unit for a UTC, non-pilot units will
      view the pilot unit working LOGDET (UTC suffix 1, 5, 8, or 9) within the LOGFOR
      module of LOGMOD. It is ultimately the non-pilot units’ responsibility to identify
      themselves and provide the pilot unit with enough information for the LOGDET
      coordination process to function efficiently. Non-pilot units will provide pilot units with
      their correct organizational information (i.e., unit designation/ office symbol, point of
      contact (POC) name(s), defense switched network (DSN) and commercial telephone
      numbers, electronic mailing address, and street address) to ensure pilot units are able to
      coordinate recommended LOGDET changes prior to submission to MAJCOM FAM for
      review and approval.
      5.15.13.5. Provides feedback on the pilot unit's developed LOGDET/manpower detail to
      ensure data integrity.
      5.15.13.6. Maintains copies of the standard UTC LOGDET.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                                125


      5.15.13.7. Submits AF Form 601/TACR directly to pilot unit for consideration and
      coordination with other non-pilot units when originating a request for change in mobility
      equipment authorizations. Non-pilot unit UDMs will submit all AF Forms 601 through
      the wing LOGMOD Administrator or Installation Deployment Officer (IDO).
   5.15.14. Using MAJCOMs:
      5.15.14.1. Review and evaluate MANFOR data developed by MRA/pilot unit to ensure
      UTC adequately defines manpower force requirements.
      5.15.14.2. Provide comments and coordination with MRA.
5.16. Reporting
   5.16.1. MANFOR Reporting. Each MRA will ensure that they have completed all of their
   changes, cancellations, etc prior to the date that runs the MANFOR update. The semiannual
   AFSC conversions and functional account code (FAC) conversions are accomplished on 31
   Oct and 30 Apr of each year. The MRA Manpower Office will perform all conversions
   provides an updated MANFOR file for the MANPER-B system as required.
   5.16.2. LOGFOR Reporting. Each MRA will submit its LOGFOR update to AF/A4RX.
   LOGDET data for all newly approved UTCs must be reported in LOGFOR by the next
   LOGFOR update. Only those UTCs with changes need to be reported as AF/A4RX pulls data
   from the central file server at HQ SSG/LGX.
5.17. MEFPAK Biennial Review
   5.17.1. The MRAs, for their respective UTCs, are tasked biennially to ensure the accuracy,
   consistency, and currency of the title, MISCAP, and logistics/manpower detail of its UTCs.
   Significant changes in UTC manpower requirements or concepts of operation must be
   coordinated with all potential using commands, the ANG, AFRC, AF/A1MR, and approved
   by AF/A5XW and the appropriate HAF functional area manager.
      5.17.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW                   will     establish,   maintain,   and
      communicate the UTC Biennial Review Schedule.
      5.17.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will initiate, coordinate, and monitor
      the UTC biennial review process.
   5.17.2. The validation will be done using the following criteria:
      5.17.2.1. Is the UTC still needed?
      5.17.2.2. Does the MISCAP state the true capability of the UTC?
      5.17.2.3. Is the pilot unit still accurate? The accuracy of UTC detail is increased when
      the assigned pilot unit actually possesses, operates, or maintains the tasked capability.
      5.17.2.4. Are the manpower detail and LOGDET correct for the stated mission
      capability?
      5.17.2.5. Are all AFSCs and functional account codes still valid?
      5.17.2.6. Is the manpower-to-equipment ratio adequate and valid?
      5.17.2.7. Does the UTC contain enough operators for the amount of equipment identified
      in the LOGFOR?
126                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      5.17.2.8. If the equipment requires operators/maintainers, are the correct AFSCs listed?
      5.17.2.9. Are operators/maintainers identified in the UTC but no equipment?
      5.17.2.10. For aviation UTCs, have all sortie rates, crew ratios, and aircraft sortie
      durations(ASDs) been deleted from the MISCAP and replaced with the reference to
      WMP-5?
      5.17.2.11. Are similar aviation UTCs (same MDS and MISCAP) consistent with regard
      to the number of personnel and short tons? Inconsistencies in these UTCs could impact
      combat readiness. In particular, these errors could lead to under-equipping a deploying
      unit or overstating requests for strategic lift. An example of inconsistency is a similar
      (same MDS and MISCAP) pair of UTCs in which one UTC is for 12 primary mission
      aircraft inventory (PMAI) and the other UTC is for 6 PMAI yet the larger one contains 10
      times the amount of logistics support equipment (149.9 vs. 14.2 short tons). In this
      example, the MRA should either update the logistics data or alter the MISCAP to define
      the difference.
      5.17.2.12. Are all cross-functional UTCs required to provide full capability identified in
      the MISCAP and the cross functional Table in DCAPES for inclusion in planning?
  5.17.3. The review process will include coordination with:
      5.17.3.1. Air Staff and MAJCOM functional area managers.
      5.17.3.2. Pilot units.
      5.17.3.3. Other MAJCOMs that use the UTC.
      5.17.3.4. AFRC and/or ANG if applicable.
         5.17.3.4.1. Any MRA which recommends a change to a UTC that applies to the
         ANG or AFRC or which impacts the forces of another command must coordinate the
         change with the ANG, HQ AFRC, the affected command, and the HAF FAM before
         updating the UTC.
  5.17.4. After a UTC is reviewed and updated, MEFPAK responsible agencies will update the
  MISCAP to indicate the date of the most recent review.
5.18. LOGDET Development and Maintenance.
  5.18.1. Developing UTC LOGDET.
      5.18.1.1. Pilot units will develop new UTCs to meet worldwide deployment, 30-day bare
      base capability, prioritizing cargo increments as detailed below. This guidance
      emphasizes the need to develop UTCs as they were intended, to manage critical airlift
      resources to meet combatant commander taskings. The end objective is to provide
      TRANSCOM, supported component headquarters, and MAJCOM Crisis Action Teams
      the ability to most efficiently communicate and analyze movement requirements in
      OPLAN TPFDDs. Civil Engineering is an exception to this process, AFCESA/CEXX
      will work with Air Staff and MRAs in development of new UTCs and defining ESL
      requirements.
      5.18.1.2. Pilot units will not load mobility bags, weapons, ammunition, bottled water, or
      Meals Ready-to-Eat (MRE) into the standard UTC LOGDET unless directed by the UTC
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          127


     MISCAP or the MAJCOM UTC FAM. Mobility bags, weapons, ammunition, bottled
     water, and MREs may be loaded into LOGPLAN UTCs as additive requirements for
     OPLAN or notional tasking when directed by the UTC MISCAP, HHQ guidance, or the
     MAJCOM UTC FAM. Weapons and ammunition will be identified as "Sensitive Cargo"
     at item level in all LOGFOR and LOGPLAN UTCs.
     5.18.1.3. Pilot units will not load general-purpose vehicles when developing/maintaining
     standard LOGDET unless directed by the UTC MISCAP, by HHQ guidance, or the
     MAJCOM UTC FAM. Non-pilot units will not load general-purpose vehicles when
     developing/maintaining LOGPLAN UTC information in LOGMOD/LSA unless
     authorized in the UTC MISCAP, reflected in the UTC LOGDET (developed by the pilot
     unit), or directed by HHQ or MAJCOM UTC FAM.
  5.18.2. Maintaining and Reporting UTC LOGDET.
     5.18.2.1. Biennial LOGDET Validation. Pilot units will conduct a biennial validation on
     their LOGDET(s) to coincide with the MAJCOM LOGMOD Manager’s biennial
     LOGDET validation. The premise of conducting biennial LOGDET validations is to
     ensure pilot units are complying with Air Force and MAJCOM directives, as well as
     maintaining standard UTC requirements for all like units. Specifically, pilot units will
     conduct a thorough comparison of the existing LOGDET against the appropriate
     Weapon/Non-Weapon System AS, as reflected in AFEMS, to ensure both are consistent.
     Questions regarding Allowance Standard references should be directed to the MAJCOM
     UTC FAM or local Logistics Readiness Squadron Equipment Management Element.
     Pilot units will coordinate all LOGDET changes with all known non-pilot units prior to
     reporting the LOGDET to MAJCOM LOGMOD Manager for MAJCOM UTC FAM
     review and approval.
     5.18.2.2. Biennial LOGPLAN Validation. At least biennially, Unit Deployment
     Managers (UDMs) and cargo increment monitors will validate their equipment
     requirements in LOGPLAN against the applicable AS and standard Air Force LOGDET.
     Units will conduct a thorough comparison of the existing LOGDET against the
     appropriate Weapon/Non-Weapon System AS, as reflected in AFEMS, to ensure
     consistency. UTCs with no associated AS will use the UTC MISCAP and approved
     LOGDET as the primary source document for LOGPLAN development. Questions
     regarding AS references should be directed to the MAJCOM UTC FAM or local
     Logistics Readiness Squadron Equipment Management Element.
     5.18.2.3. UDMs and/or cargo increment monitors will ensure they provide the wing/base
     LOGMOD Administrator with the correct Functional Account Codes (FACs) and Supply
     Org/Shop Codes when validating their UTCs. This information is necessary in order for
     the LOGMOD Administrator to maintain the local LOGPLAN Org/Shop table, as well as
     the local LOGPLAN Unit Org ID/FAC/Org Shop table.
        5.18.2.3.1. Pilot units will report their LOGDET(s) out-of-cycle when major changes
        to the UTC occur. Major changes include the addition or deletion of whole
        increments/pallet positions (which can affect the overall airlift requirements for all
        like units when tasked to deploy the UTC), modification/re-configuration of
        deployment echelons and/or re-sequencing/prioritization of increment numbers,
        validation of AS Use Code "A" assets, or when significant weight or dimensional
128                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


         changes occur (either increase or decrease) that can affect the overall airlift
         requirements necessary to deploy the UTC.
         5.18.2.3.2. Prior to reporting LOGDETs to MAJCOM LOGMOD Managers, pilot
         units will generate a LOGFOR Database Verification Report on each UTC being
         reported. UTCs reflecting errors will be corrected in each LOGDET, and all
         applicable LOGPLAN UTCs, prior to submission of LOGDET(s) to MAJCOM FAM
         for review and approval.
  5.18.3. OPLAN and Pseudo PLAN IDs (PIDs) : Units will maintain deployment-planning
  data unique to their unit UTC tasking in the LOGPLAN module of LOGMOD. Individual
  LOGPLAN PIDs will be created for each tasked OPLAN, CONPLAN with TPFDD, and/or
  notional tasking such as AEF. Units will only use HAF-approved Pseudo PIDs in LOGPLAN
  in lieu of actual OPLAN PIDs for contingency planning to minimize the risk of classifying
  LOGMOD. Units tasked under specific OPLANs will build each LOGPLAN PID using the
  first four characters of the approved corresponding Air Force-approved Pseudo PID, and
  leave the 5th character blank (Example: WOTJ_). In the DSOE module of LOGMOD, units
  will maintain corresponding information using the full five-character Air Force-approved
  Pseudo PID (Example: WOTJZ). Units must use a different character in the fifth position of
  the LOGPLAN PID because LOGMOD will not support the use of the same PID in both
  LOGPLAN and DSOE. The reason units are required to use the full five-character Pseudo
  PID in DSOE is because units will be required to pass DSOE data to their MAJCOM in order
  to populate contingency and execution TPFDDs with tailored deployment data. Specific
  instructions regarding the passing of data from DSOE are identified in an attachment in AFI
  10-403. A list of Air Force-approved Pseudo PIDs may be obtained from the MAJCOM
  LOGMOD Manager.
  5.18.4. Unit Line Number (ULN) Management : A ULN is a maximum seven character
  alphanumeric code that uniquely describes a unit entry (line) in a JOPES TPFDD. It is made
  up of three elements: a force requirement number (FRN equals 2-5 characters), a
  fragmentation code (FRAG equals1 character), and an insert code (INSERT equals 1
  character). LOGMOD Administrators can use actual ULNs, as reflected in TPFDDs/
  TPFDLs, in LOGPLAN for tasked OPLAN requirements. To minimize the risk of classifying
  their database, LOGMOD Administrators will ensure the correct Pseudo PID is assigned
  against tasked OPLAN UTCs in LOGPLAN. When using DSOE for real-world
  contingencies, Operational Readiness Exercises/Inspections (ORE/I), and/or local exercises,
  units will use tasked ULNs as they appear on the applicable tasking authorization document
  (Air Tasking Order (ATO), TPFDD/TPFDL, etc). When developing and maintaining the
  UTC Availability LOGPLAN PID, LOGMOD Administrators will designate ULNs or a
  series of ULNs to coincide with each unit’s tasked UTCs, i.e., Civil Engineering would use
  ULNs CES01 through CES99.
  5.18.5. Prioritization of Cargo. Although pilot units use deployment echelons and
  increment numbering to identify out-movement priority for cargo increments, non-pilot units
  (users of the same UTC) may have different priorities as to which cargo increments need to
  be available at the deployed location first. When differences between units occur, non-pilot
  units will use the movement priority field within the LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD to
  prioritize the out-movement of each cargo increment. As there are several ways of using the
  movement priority field within LOGMOD, non-pilot units will determine the most efficient
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            129


  method of use based on the following guidance. Note: Recommend units document the most
  efficient method of prioritizing cargo increments in their Installation Deployment Plan (IDP).
  Two of the most efficient ways of utilizing the movement priority field in LOGMOD are by
  UTC or within a UTC.
     5.18.5.1. Prioritizing by UTC means based on TPFDD requirements (i.e., ALD, RLD, or
     RDD). For example, units would assign "0001" to every increment within the first UTC
     scheduled to deploy and assign "0002" to every increment within the UTC scheduled to
     deploy second. By doing this, DCC Schedulers would have clear visibility as to which
     increments needed to deploy when creating a schedule of events in the DSOE module of
     LOGMOD.
     5.18.5.2. Prioritizing within a UTC means units will prioritize, by increment, within each
     UTC. To do this, units should look at each increment and determine which ones need to
     deploy first, second, third, etc based on unit-unique requirements. When doing so, units
     must consider the minimum equipment needed to support the MDS for weapons loading
     and/or regeneration of aircraft (for aviation UTCs) and essential equipment requirements
     necessary to establish base operations at the employed location (i.e., force protection,
     rapid runway repair, communications, billeting/ food preparations, etc). Example: Three
     different UTCs may all be required to be at the employment location at the same time (or
     on the same day), but only certain increments from each UTC need to be in-place for
     aircraft generation and base operations set-up. By prioritizing within each UTC, units
     would designate those essential increments, from each UTC, by assigning "0001" in the
     movement priority field. By doing this, deployment control center (DCC) Schedulers
     would have clear visibility over the higher priority increments (coded as 0001) as
     opposed to those with a lesser priority (coded as 0002, 0003, 0004, etc). Another option
     when using the movement priority field in LOGMOD is to assign UTC increments based
     on pre-planned load plans. Example: All increments scheduled to deploy on chalk 1
     would have a movement priority of 0001. Those increments scheduled to deploy on chalk
     2 would have a movement priority of 0002.
  5.18.6. Load and Packing Lists. All units will use Deployment Load and Packing lists
  from LOGMOD/LSA when deploying cargo. Load and Packing lists must be accurate and be
  attached in weatherproof pouch with the pallet/container. Note: Accurate load and packing
  lists are critical to ensure unit equipment is not delayed by customs at entry into other
  countries. Failure by units to create accurate documentation can delay equipment arrival to
  the beddown location and seriously affect the mission. The exceptions are: Medical units
  may use DMLSS packing lists and logistics readiness units may use Standard Base Supply
  System listings (R-43, etc.) for MRSP packing lists. Civil Engineering units will use the ESL
  to identify civil engineering kits. Copies of the ESL will be placed on or within individual
  kits. Units will not use manual Deployment Load and Packing lists except under the most
  unusual of circumstances (i.e., LOGMOD/LSA system failure).
     5.18.6.1. In accordance with AFI 10-403, units must include placards and military
     shipping labels as minimum forms of documentation/identification with each increment.
     Placard will be generated via LOGMOD/LSA and military shipping labels will be
     generated by CMOS or GATES. See AFI 10-403 for further details.
  5.18.7. UTC Tailoring.
130                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      5.18.7.1. Tailoring from a UTC. Tailoring UTCs in LOGPLAN is authorized under
      certain circumstances. Tailoring out cargo is permitted if the deploying unit has sufficient
      documentation stating what required assets are in-place and available at the deployed
      location "for their use" or if the equipment is not required for the mission. Pre-positioned
      assets identified in the War Plans Additive Requirements Report (WPARR), in
      conjunction with the Base Support & Expeditionary Planning Tool (BaS&E) and/or
      TPFDD War Reserve Material (WRM) UTCs, will be tailored from the standard
      LOGDET UTC gross weight. Tailored weights will be based on the gross incremental
      weight of each item and adjusted in the appropriate TPFDD. Since LOGMOD no longer
      has "Tailor Key" capability, units will tailor their LOGPLAN UTCs by adding, deleting,
      and modifying applicable increments, items, and suffix items.
      5.18.7.2. Tailoring to a UTC. Adding additional AS equipment items and/or vehicles
      of any sort to LOGPLAN UTCs is prohibited unless the pilot unit has added the item to
      the standard UTC or a unit has obtained MAJCOM UTC FAM approval in writing. Non-
      equipment items (admin supplies, weapons, mobility bags, munitions, expendables, etc.)
      may be added, without pilot unit or MAJCOM UTC FAM approval, to LOGPLAN UTCs
      if they are required to directly support the mission specified in the UTC MISCAP and the
      UTC does not exceed the LOGDET gross weight or total number of increment/pallet
      positions. When tailoring to a UTC(s), units must take care not to exceed the gross
      movement requirements of the UTC as airlift requirements are based on the standard
      UTC (LOGDET) weights, OPLAN TPFDD weights, and cube. The standard UTC should
      reflect the worst case, bare base capability to support the UTC MISCAP. Units will
      maintain documentation on equipment that has been tailored (added or deleted) from their
      LOGPLAN UTCs for historical and compliance inspection purposes. If non-pilot units
      have to add items to their LOGPLAN UTC(s) in order to meet mission requirements, the
      pilot unit and MAJCOM UTC FAM should be notified in case a change to the LOGDET
      is required for all like units. See AFI10-403 for further details.
         5.18.7.2.1. Based on standard UTC requirements, as developed by the designated
         pilot unit, non-pilot units/users of the same UTC(s) are prohibited from tailoring
         UTCs without written authorization from the MAJCOM UTC FAM or HHQ
         approval. This includes changing deployment echelons/increment numbers as
         reflected in the standard UTC LOGDET. When pilot units develop standard UTC
         requirements they are tasked to identify everything required to sustain a unit in a bare
         base environment for a period of 30 days, at which time re-supply will begin or may
         have already begun. As such, pilot units will develop these requirements based on the
         UTC MISCAP and Weapon/Non-Weapon System Allowance Standard that are the
         baseline for LOGDET development. Pilot units are required to prioritize the out-
         movement of cargo in such a manner that the minimum equipment needed to support
         the mission, i.e. MDS for weapons loading and regeneration, be deployed on the first
         available support airlift to the FOL. Pilot units prioritize the out-movement of
         equipment using deployment echelons and increment numbers. Once pilot units
         establish these priorities, for all like units who may be tasked for the same UTC,
         those designated non-pilot units are prohibited from changing established deployment
         echelons as identified in the standard UTC LOGDET. If non-pilot units have differing
         opinions as to what equipment should be deployed first, second, and third, they are
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               131


        required to identify their prioritization requirements using the Movement Priority
        field for each increment of cargo within the LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD.
  5.18.8. Standardization of UTC Cargo Increment Types. Pilot/non-pilot units will
  identify cargo increments, within LOGMOD, using the proper increment types.
     5.18.8.1. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign 463L pallets as LOGMOD Increment Type
     "pallet". Special shoring is always required when deploying palletized increments when
     the cargo may cause physical damage to the pallet. Special shoring is used to prevent
     metal-to-metal contact (damage) of the pallet and cargo loaded on the pallet. Note:
     Special shoring consists of dunnage and 3/4 inch plywood. Plywood will be used to cover
     the surface of the pallet susceptible to damage prior to loading any equipment or non-
     equipment items for deployment.
     5.18.8.2. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign self-propelled vehicles (i.e., equipment that is
     driven onto an aircraft) as LOGMOD increment type "rolling stock". Rolling stock
     (vehicles or vehicular cargo) has an engine and is self-propelled with at least two axles.
     Examples of rolling stock include vehicles such as bobtails, trucks, jeeps, forklifts, R-
     9/R-11 refuelers, MJ-1 bomb loaders, MB-4 Tug, etc.) Parking, roller, or sleeper shoring
     may be required when deploying rolling stock (vehicle) increments in order to prevent
     damage to Air Force assets (e.g., aircraft floor, deploying personnel, and the vehicle
     itself). Additional shoring (i.e., approach/bridge) may be required when deploying trailer
     type 1 increments.
     5.18.8.3. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign single axle vehicular cargo that is non-self-
     propelled(equipment that is pulled or winched onto an aircraft) as LOGMOD Increment
     Type "Trailer Type 1". Trailer Type 1 increments have no engine (non-self-propelled
     vehicular cargo) and have only one axle with wheels. Trailer Type 1 increments have an
     axle that is usually centered or located towards the rear of the increment, with a fixed or
     immovable hitch that cannot be stowed or removed. The hitch itself, which may have a
     kickstand or caster that is part of the increment frame, rests on the ground and bears
     weight. Note: Kickstands and/or casters will not be counted as an axle in LOGMOD.
     Hitch location, hitch weight, and tongue length are essential elements in Automated Air
     Load Planning System (AALPS). (Examples of Trailer Type 1: H-1 heaters, MC-2A
     compressors, LOX carts, etc). Parking shoring is always used when deploying Trailer
     Type 1 increments. Additional shoring (i.e., rolling, sleeper, and approach/bridge) may be
     required when deploying Trailer Type 1 increments.
     5.18.8.4. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign multi-axle vehicular cargo that is non-self-
     propelled (equipment that is pulled or winched onto an aircraft) as LOGMOD Increment
     Type "Trailer Type 2". Trailer Type 2 increments have no engine and have two or more
     axles. Trailer Type 2 increments have a hitch and tongue that is primarily used for
     movement and steering. The hitch/tongue can be fixed or positioned (removed/stowed)
     and bears no weight as it never touches the ground. Hitch location and tongue length are
     essential elements in AALPS. Examples of Trailer Type 2 increments are MHU-110
     trailers, ABDR trailers, nitro carts, -60 generators, NF-2 light-alls, 3000lb engine trailers,
     -86 generators, 40-foot flatbed trailers, etc. Additional shoring (i.e., parking, rolling,
     sleeper, or approach/bridge) may be required when deploying Trailer Type 2 increments.

      5.18.8.5. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign self-propelled vehicles that are driven and
      move using tracks vice wheels as LOGMOD Increment Type "track". Examples of track
      increments are M1-Abrams tank, bulldozers, etc. Rolling shoring is always required when
      deploying track vehicles. Additional shoring (i.e., parking, sleeper, or approach/bridge)
      may be required when deploying track vehicles.
      5.18.8.6. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign helicopters as LOGMOD Increment Type
      "skidded or wheeled". The helicopter configuration will determine the exact LOGMOD
      Increment Type to use.
      5.18.8.7. Pilot/non-pilot units will assign equipment that doesn't meet any other
      LOGMOD Increment Type as "other". Examples are wooden skid, nesting boxes, crates,
      married pallets, ISUs, Cadillac Bins, and Brooks & Perkins containers. Note: Married
      pallet increments fall under this category for two reasons: 1) Because LOGMOD
      calculates the second position of the cargo category code (CCC) based on Increment
      Type and dimensional data, in which case pallet increments are automatically assigned a
      length and width of 88 x 108. Since LOGMOD will not allow UDMs to modify the
      overall dimensional data for a pallet increment type, increment type "other" must be used
      to capture the true number and length of the married pallet, and 2) AALPS reads our
      pallet increment types as 88 x 108 but doesn't load plan the increment correctly, which
      causes the load planner to delete and re-add the increment to correct it. Units should use
      increment type "other," but include the overall dimensional data for the number of pallets
      trained together and input a quantity the correct number of pallets trained together for the
      01 Item.
         5.18.8.7.1. Container Codes (CC). Container Codes are automatically generated in
         LOGMOD during UTC LOGDET development and identify equipment data
         contained in/on all pallets, boxes, cartons, crates, and any additional items identified
         as containers. See Table 5.8 for container codes to be used.
      5.18.8.8. Pilot/non-pilot units will ensure the correct CCCs are loaded within each UTC,
      paying close attention to hazardous items. The first position in the CCC must reflect the
      proper code for all hazardous type items at the increment, item, and suffix item levels.
      Each Unit Deployment Manager and functional area representative within the designated
      pilot unit is overall responsible for ensuring all hazardous data input into LOGMOD is
      accurate. Note: Units should use AFMAN24-204(I), 49 CFR, existing Shipper’s Decs,
      and local Transportation personnel when verifying accuracy of hazardous information
      within a UTC. When loading hazardous information in LOGMOD, units should enter the
      hazard class/division identified in Key 12 of the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous
      Goods (SDDG) form. When entering the hazard class/division for vehicles with engines
      (internal combustion), Class 9 should be reflected in Key 12 of the SDDG not Class 8 for
      the battery, Class 3 for gas or Class 2.2 for the permanently attached fire extinguisher.
      Pilot units will also ensure all 99X hazard codes are updated to reflect the correct hazard
      class/division in the LOGDET. Note: Hazard code 99X is a default code that LOGMOD
      assigned to hazardous items during its upgrade from TG-2 (DOS based application) to
      TG-3 (Windows based application). It is very important to identify the correct hazardous
      information, as this will feed CMOS, AALPS, and the Global Transportation Network
      (GTN).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            133


     5.18.8.9. To optimize airlift, increments which are too small to palletize will be
     physically combined into a single increment and palletized whenever possible. When
     combining increments and/ or pallets, units must coordinate their efforts with the
     Deployment Control Center (DCC) Scheduler. For in-transit visibility (ITV) purposes,
     every increment for every deploying UTC must have its own Transportation Control
     Number (TCN), as reflected on the Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE) and in the
     CMOS TCN Detail file created by the DCC when disseminating cargo files from
     LOGMOD-DSOE to the CMOS operator. Only the remarks block on the DSOE will be
     used to reflect combined increments and which unit has lead responsibility for those
     increments.
  5.18.9. Use of Deployment Echelon Codes.
     5.18.9.1. Pilot units will ensure the correct deployment echelon codes are used within
     UTCs to aid in the out-movement and prioritization planning of each UTC. A deployment
     echelon is defined as a capability within a UTC that commanders must deploy as a single
     entity. Deployment echelons facilitate deployment planning by identifying a unit’s
     capabilities, material, and personnel requirements and designating the sequence of
     movement. Force echeloning is organizing units for movement. Force echeloning
     establishes a priority for movement within the deploying force to meet operational
     requirements and maximize available lift (surface or air). In LOGMOD, they are
     identified as two-position alphanumeric characters. The first position represents a type of
     deployment echelon relative to the equipment being deployed (Enroute Support, Initial
     Support, Tactical Support, etc). The second position represents an element/priority in
     which the equipment must be deployed (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc).
     5.18.9.2. To further prioritize the out-movement priority of cargo within the standard
     UTC LOGDET, pilot units will sequentially number every increment of cargo beginning
     with 0001, 0002, 0003, etc. Once pilot units establish these priorities, for all like units
     who may be tasked for the same UTC, those designated non-pilot units are prohibited
     from changing established increment numbers as identified in the standard UTC
     LOGDET. If non-pilot units have differing opinions as to what equipment should be
     deployed first, second, and third, they are required to identify their prioritization
     requirements using the Movement Priority field for each increment of cargo within the
     LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD. Based on standard UTC requirements, as established
     by the designated UTC pilot unit, non-pilot units (i.e., users of the same UTC) are
     prohibited from tailoring UTCs without written authorization from the MAJCOM UTC
     FAM or HHQ approval. This includes changing standard UTC LOGDET deployment
     echelons/increment numbers in the LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD.
     5.18.9.3. Echelon of Deployment Elements.
        5.18.9.3.1. All aviation (3-series) UTCs will be developed by pilot units using Air
        Staff (AF/ A3/5 and AF/A4MM) right-sizing guidance for modular/scalable UTCs. 3-
        series UTCs will include support equipment for aircrew members, operations, life
        support, and intelligence personnel only. Supply and maintenance equipment
        previously identified in MTW-sized aviation UTCs will be removed and placed into
        corresponding generation maintenance UTCs. Lead packages will be designed to
        deploy independently. Follow-on UTCs will be dependent packages that fall in on
134                                              AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      (provide additional aircraft capabilities to) initial lead packages. Note: I, O, Q, U and
      Y are not used.
      5.18.9.3.2. A1-9 Contingency Response Group Element (CRG-E) (formerly
      referred to as Tanker/Airlift Control Element (TALCE)). A functional airlift
      organization (provisional) established to provide support to air elements at an air
      facility. Normally, it includes an operations function such as movement control and
      communications, a support function, which relates to the air facility itself, and a
      liaison with appropriate airborne or other air units.
      5.18.9.3.3. B1-9 Base Support Element (BSE). A deployment echelon normally
      composed of personnel and materiel over and above the flight and tactical support
      element. The BSE will include all personnel and materiel required to support the most
      demanding operation plan, operation order, or tasking order under which a unit is
      tasked. This deployment echelon is normally used in 4F, JF, LW, PF, QF, RA, UFT,
      XFB, XFF, and XW series UTCs.
      5.18.9.3.4. C1-9 - Base Support Element. A deployment echelon normally
      composed of personnel and materiel over and above the flight and tactical support
      element. The BSE will include all personnel and materiel required to support the most
      demanding operation plan, operation order, or tasking order under which a unit is
      tasked. This deployment echelon is normally used in the 6K series UTCs.
      5.18.9.3.5. D1-9 - Base Support Element. A deployment echelon normally
      composed of personnel and materiel over and above the flight and tactical support
      element. The BSE will include all personnel and materiel required to support the most
      demanding operation plan, operation order, or tasking order under which a unit is
      tasked.
      5.18.9.3.6. E1-9 - Enroute Support Team (EST). Used in modular/scalable fighter
      and intra-theater airlift aviation/maintenance UTCs. A functional package of
      personnel and materiel, consisting of selected personnel skills, equipment, and
      supplies necessary to service and perform limited specialized maintenance on tactical
      aircraft at an enroute base so the aircraft can proceed to their destination base with a
      minimum of delay. If lead packages are already in place, and additional aircraft are
      required, the assumption is that the follow-on 6-ships will travel together and require
      only one EST. If they travel separately, the units will have to coordinate EST or en-
      route support to ferry the aircraft to the deployed location. For example, units may
      use FOL, sister-squadron support, main operating base (MOB) or collocated
      operating base (COB) support.
         5.18.9.3.6.1. E1 - EST-A (Enroute Support Team A). Used in initial (lead)
         packages only. Provides limited aircraft support (generation maintenance
         purposes) and normally pre- cedes and travels with aircraft to port of debarkation
         (POD). Examples: -60, Hobart, Mule, towbar, hydraulic/oil cart, etc.
         5.18.9.3.6.2. E2 - EST-B. (Enroute Support Team B). Used in the first follow-on
         package only. Provides additional limited aircraft support (generation
         maintenance purposes) for first follow-on aircraft capability, which normally
         precedes and travels with aircraft to POD. Examples: -60, Hobart, Mule, towbar,
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                       135


           hydraulic/oil cart, etc.
           5.18.9.3.6.3. E3-9. Reserved for future use.
        5.18.9.3.7. F1-9 - Preflight Team.
        5.18.9.3.8. G1-9 - Aerial Port Element.
        5.18.9.3.9. H1-9 - Air Force forces (AFFOR) or Wing Headquarters. The
        Headquart ers Support Element (HSE) is used in planning for deployment of the
        AFFOR and/or Wing Head- quarters elements. The HSE consists of people and
        materiel designed to establish command elements and a command structure for
        deploying forces. This deployment echelon is normally used in 7F and 9A series
        UTCs.
        5.18.9.3.10. J1-9 - Aircrew Members. Newly developed, modular/scalable 3-series
        aviation UTCs will use J1-9 deployment echelons to identify equipment directly
        supporting aircrew members, operations and intelligence personnel.
        5.18.9.3.11. K1-9 - Mission Support Element.
        5.18.9.3.12. L1-9 - Medical Support Element. A deployment echelon used to
        identify medical assets within an F-series UTC.
        5.18.9.3.13. M1-9 - Munitions Support Element (MSE). Allmunitions (HG- and
        HH-series) UTCs will be developed using deployment echelon codes M1-M4, MSE.
        MSE includes personnel and equipment, which normally precedes the deploying
        aircraft to provide munitions capability at the employed location. All MSE cargo
        increments will be developed to meet Initial Combined Air Operations Center
        (CAOC) Capability (ICC).
           5.18.9.3.13.1. Fighter aircraft MSE (18 to 24 primary mission aircraft inventory
           (PMAI)) will be developed using the following deployment echelons:
               5.18.9.3.13.1.1. M1 for 6 to 8 PMAI
               5.18.9.3.13.1.2. M2 for 9 to 14 PMAI
               5.18.9.3.13.1.3. M3 for 15 to 18 PMAI
               5.18.9.3.13.1.4. M4 for 19 to 24 PMAI
               5.18.9.3.13.1.5. Deployment echelons M1-M4 when deployed together
               comprise the complete 24 PMAI UTC package. If the UTC tasked required a
               tailored 12 PMAI, M1-M2 are the only echelons deployed. If the UTC
               deployed needed to increase its PMAI to 18, at the same location, them M3 is
               deployed.
           5.18.9.3.13.2. Bomber aircraft MSE (6 to 12 PMAI) will be developed using the
           following deployment echelons:
               5.18.9.3.13.2.1. M1 for 2 to 3 PMAI
               5.18.9.3.13.2.2. M2 for 4 to 6 PMAI
               5.18.9.3.13.2.3. M3 for 7 to 9 PMAI
136                                              AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


             5.18.9.3.13.2.4. M4 for 10 to 12 PMAI
             5.18.9.3.13.2.5. Deployment Echelons M1-M4 when deployed together
             comprise a complete 12 PMAI UTC package. If the UTC tasked required a 4
             PMAI, then M1-M2 deployment echelons are deployed. The basic concept is
             to use the second character of the deployment echelon to identify and
             prioritize the number of PMAI as described above.
      5.18.9.3.14. N1-9 - Nuclear Augmentation.
      5.18.9.3.15. P1-9 - Personnel. This deployment element is used to identify
      personnel tasked in RF series UTCs.
      5.18.9.3.16. R1-9 - Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR). This deployment echelon
      is used to identify personnel and materiel associated with the rescue UTCs. This
      deployment echelon is used in 9AR, 3TR, and HRR UTCs. (Pilot units may elect to
      use E1, E2, S1, and T1 in the 3TR series UTCs.)
      5.18.9.3.17. S1-9 - Initial Support Element (ISE). Used in modular/scalable fighter
      and intra-theater airlift aviation maintenance UTCs, this deployment echelon is
      organized and maintained for fighter, reconnaissance, bomber units, and other units.
      An ISE includes personnel and equipment, which normally precedes the deploying
      aircraft to provide initial support at the employment location. It is the basic building
      block for all aviation deployment packages. This deployment echelon is normally
      used in H-series UTCs.
         5.18.9.3.17.1. S1 - Advanced Echelon (ADVON) (also known as initial support
         element). Used in initial (lead) packages only. The ADVON portion of this UTC
         consists of a minimal amount of equipment required to support an initial
         maintenance site survey team of personnel to include Supply, Maintenance Chief
         and Munitions personnel to assess the FOL and prepare for initial aircraft
         recovery/bed down and to establish aircraft parking areas at the deployed location.
         Common examples of ADVON equipment are combined tool kits (CTK) to
         facilitate the breaking down and opening of pallets and containers, as they arrive
         at the FOL, and soap sample kits. Note: Follow-on UTCs will have no ADVON
         capability.
         5.18.9.3.17.2. S2 - Main Base. This portion of the UTC consists of equipment
         brought from home station to sustain and re/generate (turn) initial 12 Lead (6
         Lead for ARC forces) tactical aircraft at an established military or civilian airfield
         (Main Operating Base) for Initial Combat Capability (ICC).
         5.18.9.3.17.3. S3 - Bare Base –Remaining equipment not previously identified as
         S2 to support initial 12-ship Lead capability (initially a 6-ship lead for ARC
         forces). When the initial 12-ship Lead UTC deploys to a Bare Base location
         (runway and potable water source), all S2 and S3 equipment will be deployed
         simultaneously.
         5.18.9.3.17.4. S4-9. Reserved for future use.
      5.18.9.3.18. T1-9 - Tactical Support Element (TSE). Used in modular/scalable
      fighter and intra-theater airlift aviation maintenance UTCs. A TSE includes personnel
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                        137


        and materiel which, when combined with ISEs and ESTs, will provide a unit with the
        operational capabilities pre- scribed by the UTC MISCAPs.T1 T2T3 echelons will be
        used for ANG 3-ship follow-on packages. T4-9 deployment echelons are reserved for
        future use.
           5.18.9.3.18.1. Fighter units
               5.18.9.3.18.1.1. T2 – Main Base – This portion of the UTC consists of
               equipment to support the first follow-on 6-ship capability. This equipment is
               normally comprised of the following: Air cylinders, Nitro carts, Lox carts,
               Hydraulic carts, 3-4 NF-2 Light-alls, aircraft jacks and generators. Also
               included is the remaining 20% of the authorized MRSP for a full 18/24 PMAI
               capability. Some assumptions should be made during development of this
               portion of the UTC. For instance, it should be assumed that back shop support
               equipment will be available at the FOL. It should also be assumed that
               sufficient lighting will be available in maintenance areas. These assumptions
               allow remaining equipment to be identified with a Dep Ech of T3
               5.18.9.3.18.1.2. T3 – Bare Base – Remaining equipment not previously
               identified as T2 to support the 1st follow–on 6 ship. When this UTC deploys
               to a Bare Base location (runway and potable water source), all T2 and T3
               equipment will be deployed simultaneously.
               5.18.9.3.18.1.3. T4 – All remaining equipment (if any) required to support a
               2nd 6-ship Follow-on capability (3-ship for ARC forces) at the same operating
               location as the initial 12-ship Lead and 1st Follow-on 6-ship UTC.
               5.18.9.3.18.1.4. Deployment Echelons T2-T4 when deployed together
               comprises the complete 24 PMAI UTC package (15 PMAI for ARC forces). If
               the UTC tasked required a tailored 12 PMAI (6 PMAI for ARC), T-2 is the
               only echelons deployed. If the UTC deployed needed to increase its PMAI to
               18 (12 PMAI for ARC forces), at the same location, then T3 would be
               deployed.
           5.18.9.3.18.2. Bomber units
               5.18.9.3.18.2.1. T3 items required for Intermediate Level (IL) for any number
               of aircraft deployed (i.e., Phase Inspection, Special Handling Equipment).
               5.18.9.3.18.2.2. T4 equipment required to sustain 4-8 PMAI deployment
               5.18.9.3.18.2.3. T5 equipment required to sustain Follow-on packages.
               5.18.9.3.18.2.4. Deployment Echelons T3-T5, when deployed together,
               comprise a complete 12-16 PMAI UTC package (B-1s deploy 4x4x4, B-52s
               deploy 6x6, B-2 deploy 8x8).
        5.18.9.3.19. V1-9 - Air Force AudioVisual Service.
        5.18.9.3.20. W1-9 - Air Force Weather. This deployment echelon is used to
        identify personnel and materiel for weather UTCs. This deployment echelon is used
        in XW series UTCs.
        5.18.9.3.21. X1-9 - Miscellaneous Combat Support (CS).

          5.18.9.3.22. Z1-9 - Others. This deployment echelon is used to denote people
          and/or equipment not easily fitting into other deployment echelons. It is appropriate
          to use in LOGMOD when units load weapons, ammunition, mobility bags, bottled
          water, and MREs ("additive requirements"). Note: When loading mobility bags in
          LOGPLAN, remember that deploying individuals may be tasked to bulk palletize,
          check as shipped baggage, or hand-carry their C-1 Bags. If the tasking order does not
          specify, deploying individuals will retain one ensemble from the C-1 bag and stow it
          in the passenger compartment, for military or civilian/commercial aircraft, for
          immediate access.
   5.18.10. Functional Account Codes (FAC). Pilot units will use only standard Air Force-
   approved FACs when developing, maintaining, and reporting standard UTC LOGDETs to
   MAJCOM LOGMOD Managers. FACs originate in the manpower and personnel systems but
   are used in LOGMOD/ LSA to denote ownership, within a squadron, for cargo increments
   and/or cargo packaged on or within an increment. A FAC in LOGMOD consists of six
   characters; HQ USAF controls the first four digits (FAC) and the Major Commands controls
   the last two digits (shredout). MAJCOM UTC FAMs are responsible for establishing the 2-
   digit FAC shredouts to be used by their units. The FAC shredout is used to further define or
   identify an office/shop within a unit/squadron to denote ownership of equipment. When
   developing/maintaining LOGDETs, pilot units will only use the standard 4-digit FAC with a
   shredout "00" (zero, zero). The LOG PLAN section of LOGMOD is the only place users will
   assign a FAC shred-out other than "00" (zero, zero). A list of Air Force approved-FACs can
   be obtained from the MAJCOM LOGMOD/LSA Manager.
   5.18.11. For each UTC increment, and item/suffix item within each increment, UDMs are
   responsible for identifying the correct Unit Org ID and FAC within their unit/squadron that is
   responsible for packaging and deploying their respective assets. The wing LOGMOD/LSA
   Administrator is responsible for ensuring the Unit Org ID/FAC table is populated correctly
   based on UDM inputs.
   5.18.12. Functional Account Groupings and Basic Functional Accounts. The first
   character of a FAC represents the major groupings of functions (1XXX Command and
   Command Support, 2XXX- Mission Equipment Maintenance, 3XXX - Mission Equipment
   Operation, 4XXX - Direct Support, 5XXX – Medical, 6XXX - Research and Development,
   and 7XXX - Activities Outside the Air Force). The first and second characters of a FAC
   represent the basic functional account. The third and fourth characters of a FAC represent the
   shredouts of basic functional accounts (sub-functions) and shred-outs of sub-functions,
   respectively. The fifth and sixth (or last two) characters are used in the event a MAJCOM
   UTC FAM feels a need to further define or identify an office/shop within a unit/ squadron to
   denote ownership of equipment, in which case they would assign two additional characters to
   the standard FAC. For a detailed list of all Air Force approved FACs, contact the MAJCOM
   LOGMOD/LSA Manager.

Code

1        Standard       Indicates a deployable               Yes       Yes
                        organization with a standard
                        composition that is defined and
                        fixed by an appropriate, widely
                        used reference document.

2        Fixed          Indicates a deployable               Yes       Yes
         provisional    organization that is formed from
                        existing resources and is designed
                        to meet requirements of operation
                        plans. When formed, the
                        organization becomes deployable,
                        self-administering organization
                        that can be employed as an
                        individual unit. UTCs with this
                        DEPID are self-defining.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                         141


3      Augmentation   This organization is designed to      Yes   Yes
                      augment the capability of an in-
                      place organization to meet a
                      specific operation plan
                      requirement. When formed, this
                      organization is deployable, but
                      not self- administering. UTCS
                      with this DEPID are self-
                      defining.

4      Programmed     Indicates a type organization that    Yes   Yes2
                      is programmed to be activated in
                      the future. The activation date is
                      not related to the implementation
                      of operation plans but usually
                      depends on budget or other
                      internal Service considerations.
                      For planning purposes, type
                      organizations with this indicator
                      should be considered deployable
                      after the programmed activation
                      date. Estimated date may be
                      reported for programmed units.
                      Although estimated data are valid
                      for planning, they may not be
                      valid for actual deployment.
                      Since actual data are not usually
                      available until the unit is
                      activated and attains a combat-
                      ready status, estimated data
                      should be used. UTCs with this
                      DEPID are self-defining.

5      Non-TUCHA       Indicates a type organization
       build          with a standard composition that
                      is defined and fixed by an
                      appropriate, widely used
                      reference document. Type
                      organizations with this DEPID
                      provide deployable fragments or
                      detachments that are assigned
                      self-defining UTCs. Use for USN
                      and USCG units only.

6      Variable       Indicates type organization that is   No    No
                      authorized by Service or joint
 142                                             AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


                      documents. The organization is
                      deployable. Composition is not
                      fixed. UTCs with this DEPID are
                      not self-defining. Also, A-UTCs
                      will use this DEPID code;
                      however, they are not to be used
                      in a TPFDD.
                      Indicates type organization that
7      Group or                                             No    No
                      represents a generalized group or
       category
                      category of more specific UTCs.
                      The deployability of a group
                      depends on the deployability of
                      its members. The group UTC
                      should be self-defining if its
                      included members are self-
                      defining.

8      Task           Indicates a type organization      No       No
       organization   identified as a task organization.
                      The composition of task
                      organizations varies depending on
                      the specific assigned task or
                      mission. Service and joint
                      documents may provide broad
                      doctrinal guidance on task
                      organizations, but do not specify
                      the composition. Task
                      organizations are deployable.
                      UTCs are not self-defining.

9      Permanent      Indicates UTCs assigned to            No    No
       Base           permanent base installations,
                      facilities, and organizations. This
                      type organization may have been
                      established outside the United
                      States; however, it is not
                      deployable. Normally, this type
                      organization is deactivated rather
                      than transferred.

E      Augmentation   Indicates an equipment package   No         Yes
       (Equipment     that can be constituted from
       only)          existing logistic resources to
                      augment the capability of an in-
                      place operations plan
                      requirement. Equipment packages

                              with this indicator are deployable
                              and self-defining

P            Augmentation     Indicates a type organization that   Yes        Yes3
             (Personnel       represents an identified current
             only)            ability to form from existing
                              resources the capability to
                              augment an in-place organization
                              to meet a specific operations plan
                              requirement. When constituted,
                              organizations with this indicator
                              are deployable, but not self-
                              administering. UTCs with this
                              indicator are self-defining.

Table 5.6. UTC Suffix Definitions.
 UTC SUFFIX DEFINITION
 0              A standard HAF-approved and distributed UTC. A UTC with this code cannot be
                altered or deleted. To change a UTC, it must first be duplicated in the database to a
                higher suffix.
 1              UTC has been fully staffed at the MAJCOM and has been transmitted to HQ USAF for
                approval. It cannot be changed and should not be deleted.
 2              UTC has been fully staffed at the MAJCOM and is ready to be transferred to HQ USAF.
 3              UTC is in a fully extended condition; there is one C record on file for each position
                identified. It may be used to update individual lines with deployment echelon and so
                forth, where quantity grouping is impractical. When transferred from this code, the UTC
                is summarized by like records (identical data element value). This code can only be
                transferred to suffix 2.
 4              UTC has been transferred to the pilot unit manpower and organization (MO) office for
                their review.
 5              UTC has been updated and/or reviewed by the pilot unit Logistics Readiness Office and
                Manpower office and is ready for transfer or transferred to/received by the MAJCOM
                for review.
 6              UTC is MAJCOM controlled to indicate a tailored UTC for contingencies and exercises.
 7              UTC is base-level/MAJCOM controlled to indicate a tailored UTC or a MAJCOM or
                higher directed exercise.
 8              UTC is MAJCOM/base-level controlled to indicate a tailored UTC or one in the
                MAJCOM coordination stages.
 9              UTC was returned to the MAJCOM with changes during a HAF update or has reject
                conditions.

        FORCE MODULES AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES PACKAGES

Section 6A—Purpose

6.1. Force Module (FM)/Operational Capabilities Packages (OCP). A force module, as
defined in CJCSM 3122.01A, JOPES Volume 1 (Planning Policies and Procedures) is a
planning and execution tool that provides a means of logically grouping records, which facilitate
planning, analysis and monitoring. Force modules may include both forces and sustainment. The
elements of force modules are linked together or are uniquely identified so that they may be
extracted from or adjusted as an entity in the Joint Operational Planning and Execution System
(JOPES) databases to enhance flexibility and usefulness of the operations planning and execution
process. This chapter provides the policy for development and use of force modules in four
specific areas enabling force presentation: Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF)
FMs, Functional Area FMs, AETF Support FMs, and OPLAN specific FMs. In addition, this
chapter provides the policy for the development and use of OCPs. AETF FMs are the basis from
which combatant commander functional capability requirements are sourced. Functional Area
FMs provide an additional mechanism for packaging UTCs in larger groups for "teaming’ of
smaller/modular UTCs when needed. OCPs are a combination of pre-packaged FMs with UTCs
that provide a playbook type product to support numerous response options. For force module
and OCP execution guidance, see Chapter 8.

Section 6B—Background

6.2. Force Presentation.
   6.2.1. The AETF FMs are defined as a grouping of combat and expeditionary combat
   support (ECS) UTCs with accompanied supplies and required non-unit re-supply and
   personnel necessary to sustain forces with a base population of approximately 3,000 for a
   minimum of 30 days.
   6.2.2. The Functional Area FMs can also be a grouping of combat and expeditionary combat
   support (ECS) UTCs; however, they provide a more specific capability than the AETF FMs.
   They can be OPLAN-dependent or used for Force Tracking. (See CJCSM 3122.01A).
   6.2.3. The AETF Support FMs are defined as a grouping of ECS and equipment UTCs used
   to open, operate and sustain the AETF.
   6.2.4. OPLAN Specific FMs, which are developed and managed by supported commanders,
   Service components, or the AEFC, are designed to respond to a specific planning task.
   6.2.5. An OCP is a collection of tailored FMs/UTCs grouped together to support numerous
   response options. OCPs provide a means of logically grouping records, which facilitate
   planning, analysis and monitoring. OCPs may include both forces and sustainment. The
   elements of OCPs are linked together and uniquely identified so that they may be extracted
   from or adjusted as an entity in DCAPES to enhance flexibility and usefulness of the
   operations planning and execution process.

Section 6C—Guidance

6.3. AETF Force Modules. The AETF force modules are a method of packaging command
and control, operational mission, and ECS forces for presentation to a combatant commander
through the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR). The modules were developed to
provide a standardized template optimizing initial planning through rapid requirements
generation.
   6.3.1. The AETF force modules consist of six scalable, modular elements: Open the Airbase,
   Command and Control, Establish the Airbase, Generate the Mission, Operate the Airbase,
   and Robust the Airbase.
   6.3.2. When utilized in concert, the scalable AETF force modules provide capabilities
   required to open, establish, and operate an air expeditionary wing (AEW) or group (AEG).
   AEGs are normally formed utilizing the Generate the Mission force modules as tenant
   organizations at an Air Force, joint, or coalition operating location as long as the
   Service/nation responsible for providing base operating support can provide sufficient
   support capabilities for the AEG to establish adequate command and control over
   assigned/allocated forces.
   6.3.3. Each element is built on capabilities required to accomplish specific processes
   necessary to achieve desired effects. The capabilities contained within each module element
   are designed to work synergistically. Component headquarters may modify the capabilities
   within the FMs based upon the situation and mission requirements. The AETF force modules
   are all built on basic planning assumptions which are periodically validated at AETF FM
   workshops and maintained by AF/A5XW:

   6.3.4. Open the Airbase. This force module provides the capabilities to open an airbase,
   regardless of the follow-on mission. Open the Airbase forces will normally arrive first and
   assess the airbase for establishment of minimum airfield operating parameters, command and
   control, and supporting host-nation support capabilities. The lead agency for the Open the
   Airbase Force Module is AMC/A3.
       6.3.4.1. This module provides the initial capabilities for command and control, force
       protection, cargo and passengers handling, logistics, airfield operations, force
       accountability, finance and contracting, and reception and beddown of follow-on
       modules. It may support any Service or nation and provides capabilities to transition
       responsibilities to the follow-on forces.
       6.3.4.2. The capabilities contained in this module fall under the following eight
       categories: assess the airbase, establish minimum operating strip (MOS), protect the
       forces, initial command and control of forces, conduct airfield operations, establish
       communications, handle cargo/passengers, receive/beddown initial forces.
       6.3.4.3. The capabilities contained within the module should rapidly establish an initial
       operating capability (IOC) in approximately 24 hours from the arrival of forces. The
       primary constraint is the "Establish Minimum Operating Strip" capability. If extensive
       runway preparation is required then the IOC for this module is approximately 36 hours.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            155


     6.3.4.4. Assumptions. Basic assumptions were made in development of the Open the
     Airbase capabilities.
        6.3.4.4.1. Base opening forces are capable of rapid recovery and redeployment to
        meet combatant commander requirements. Follow-on modules will assume
        operations and are not to be integrated with or robust this module.
        6.3.4.4.2. No Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).
        6.3.4.4.3. No Theater Battle Management defensive capability.
        6.3.4.4.4. Limited chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield
        explosives (CBRNE) defensive and detection response.
        6.3.4.4.5. Base Defense support available at 1 hour (IOC) provides security for
        airfield, defined as the runway, immediate taxiway and parking area. Note: Base
        security, in this FM, does not include security of the Joint Security Area (JSA) and
        areas surrounding the runway, immediate taxiway and parking area.
        6.3.4.4.6. Average mean time between failures of material handling equipment
        (MHE) may impact offload of cargo.
        6.3.4.4.7. Initial air traffic control (ATC) capability for visual flight rules (VFR)
        operations can be provided within an hour by Air Force Special Operations Forces
        (AFSOF) using rucksack portable markings and communications equipment; next
        increment requires 6 hours.
        6.3.4.4.8. Initial airfield lighting can be provided within hour using rucksack portable
        equipment; next increment requires 12 hours.
        6.3.4.4.9. Adverse weather impacts are magnified due to limited ATC and lighting.
        6.3.4.4.10. Timely communication frequency and host nation approval (at HHQ) and
        limited communication bandwidth.
        6.3.4.4.11. Limited fire protection (one P-19/contracted equivalent).
        6.3.4.4.12. Limited medical care.
        6.3.4.4.13. Potable water is available via host nation or contracting.
        6.3.4.4.14. Aviation/jet fuel and ground fuel are available via host nation or
        contracting.
        6.3.4.4.15. Only hand-carried/deployed unit basic combat load ammunition will be
        available.
        6.3.4.4.16. Note: If above assumptions are not valid for the desired location,
        additional UTCs will be required.
     6.3.4.5. Constraints. The following issues may inhibit utilizing the module.
        6.3.4.5.1. Transition of control of airbase from seizure forces to the C2 capability
        within the Open the Airbase FM.
        6.3.4.5.2. Effective command and control prior to establishing permanent
        communications.
156                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


         6.3.4.5.3. Maximum on Ground (MOG) 2 / 12-hour operation limitation. Force
         modules do not accommodate for increases in flow of transportation requirements.
         Note: MOG - 2 assumes initial cargo flow is primarily rolling stock.
         6.3.4.5.4. Equipment accountability for initial chalks.
         6.3.4.5.5. Establishing refueling capability within 8 hours.
         6.3.4.5.6. Minimum lighting for night operations.
         6.3.4.5.7. Host nation interface without on-site legal counsel.
         6.3.4.5.8. Acquiring adequate potable water
  6.3.5. Command and Control. This module contains the capabilities to establish an AEW
  command and control structure to include an initial maintenance group, mission support
  group, operations group, and medical group staffs. If an AEG is required and established, the
  module can be scaled back to complete the appropriate command structure. This initial
  capability will be rounded out once the Establish the Airbase and Operate the Airbase FMs
  arrive. The leadership elements of the C2 force module will be sourced using lead/primary
  wing personnel to the maximum extent possible. The lead agency for the Command and
  Control Force Module is AF/A5X; AF/A3O is the OCR for this force module.
      6.3.5.1. This module begins at some point on or after C-0 and must be in place prior to
      any command elements leaving from the Open the Airbase FM.
      6.3.5.2. It will assume the command and control responsibilities for the airbase from the
      initial elements in the Open the Airbase FM upon arrival. Secure communications and
      intelligence are key capabilities to establishing control.
      6.3.5.3. The Command and Control FM provides only minimum basic initial command
      and control capability. The Command and Control FM is estimated to be IOC in
      approximately 16 hours from arrival at destination.
      6.3.5.4. Assumptions. A high level overview of capabilities within this module
      includes: Assume command and control of the airbase/establish AEW structure, establish
      command centers, establish interfaces and integration to support mission planning and
      execution, and establish permanent secure and non-secure voice and data capability.
      6.3.5.5. Constraints.
         6.3.5.5.1. Command and control capability will be adversely impacted until
         minimum communication links are established.
         6.3.5.5.2. Timely host nation and frequency approval capability
  6.3.6. Establish the Airbase. This module contains limited forces to bring the base to an
  initial operating capability. The Establish the Airbase FM contains capabilities designed to
  support most missions or weapon systems. It will facilitate the integration of those
  capabilities within the Open the Airbase and Command and Control FMs to provide the
  airfield’s earliest capability to execute its assigned mission. The lead agency for the Establish
  the Airbase Force Module is AF/A5X; AF/A4R is the OCR for this force module.
      6.3.6.1. This module will provide capabilities to build and modify existing and deployed
      support infrastructure (petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL), munitions storage and
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           157


     operating sites, maintenance shelters, tents, electrical), establish 24-hour day/night
     mission operations and communications.
     6.3.6.2. Establish the Airbase FM begins at some point after C-0 with its efforts
     assuming tasks from the Open the Airbase FM. The module is estimated to be IOC in
     approximately 4 days from arrival at destination.
     6.3.6.3. This dependency on integration with preceding modules may also limit the
     effectiveness of the Establish the Airbase FM further emphasizing the need to right-size
     the capabilities in the Open the Airbase and Command and Control FMs.
     6.3.6.4. In addition to integrating with or replacing capability included in Open the Base
     and Command and Control FMs, this FM also brings in capabilities previously excluded
     due to lack of immediate urgency. A high level overview of the capabilities within the
     module includes: 24-hour day/night mission operations, Airfield Operations, Aerial Port,
     Infrastructure, Site Preparation, POL, Vehicle Operations & Maintenance, Billeting,
     Finance, Contracting and Utilities, Force Protection, Emergency Response (Fire Crash
     Rescue, Medical, Security Forces, Safety and EOD), Personnel Accountability (Personnel
     Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO)), Munitions Management, and
     Communications.
     6.3.6.5. Assumptions. The assumptions involved in employing the Establish the
     Airbase FM as it is presently constructed are as follows:
         6.3.6.5.1. Strategic flow of resources will be maintained at a MOG 2 / 24-hour
         operation with limited resource impediments.
         6.3.6.5.2. Large aircraft fire fighting capability is limited.
         6.3.6.5.3. Required POL available.
         6.3.6.5.4. Explosive site plans and storage/operating infrastructure may be
         rudimentary or not exist requiring risk assessment and acceptance of explosive safety
         risks/constraints to meet operational mission tasking. Munitions Management Team
         will be tasked as part of this FM to work directly with Civil Engineering and Safety
         personnel to ensure capability to receive, store, and execute munitions operations
         upon arrival of the aviation munitions support UTCs. These personnel should be
         tasked from the lead wing and may be tailored out of the aviation support UTC.
     6.3.6.6. Constraints. There is limited emergency response capability.
  6.3.7. Generate the Mission. There are 13 Generate the Mission force modules. These
  force modules correspond to the 13 mission areas explained in AFTTP 3-1.1, Air Force
  Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, General Planning and Employment Considerations.
  These Generate the Mission FMs will produce the desired military effects as requested by the
  combatant commander. These force modules are a combination of three subordinate force
  modules: a Multiple UTC Grouping (MUG) and two mission platform packages. The lead
  agency for the Generate the Mission Force Module is AF/A5X.
     6.3.7.1. The MUGs contain the aviation and direct aviation support (i.e. maintenance,
     munitions, etc) associated with the aviation capability. The direct aviation support UTCs
     are those that are specifically identified on the aviation UTC’s MISCAP statement.
 158                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


          6.3.7.1.1. The MUGs will be identified by the specific type weapon system and
          number of aircraft supported. If there are distinct packages amongst components
          and/or commands or special capabilities, then there will also be distinct MUGs.
          Examples of MUG titles would be: B-52, 12 PAA, ACTIVE; C-130E (AWADS), 12
          PAA, USAFE, ACTIVE; F-16C, B40, 18 PAA, ACTIVE.
          6.3.7.1.2. The MUGs will include the lead aviation package, any corresponding
          follow aviation packages, and associated direct aviation support.
          6.3.7.1.3. If Munitions Management UTC deploys as part of the Establish the Base
          FM, these personnel may be tailored out of the munitions aviation support UTC.
       6.3.7.2. The mission platform packages contain "common" operations combat support
       capabilities that are required to support singular or multiple “like” aviation packages. The
       mission platform packages contain weather, intelligence, operations support, maintenance
       supervision, and communications.
          6.3.7.2.1. There are eight specific mission platform force modules (see Table 6.1):
          Fighter, Bomber, Tanker, Airlift, SOF, CSAR, command, control, intelligence,
          surveillance and reconnaissance (C2ISR), and Electronic Warfare.
          6.3.7.2.2. There is also a general mission platform package. This MPP includes
          common operations support UTCs that are required to support all aviation packages.
       6.3.7.3. The interrelationship between the 13 Generate the Mission FMs, the MUGs, and
       the Mission Platform packages is detailed in paragraph 6.3.10.1.2 below.
       6.3.7.4. These force modules are intended to provide a rapid response and conduct
       operations within 36 hours of initial arrival and have embedded sustainment for up to 30
       days of operations. Mission support elements may begin to flow before the C+0 day.
       6.3.7.5. The Generate the Mission FMs are estimated to be IOC in approximately 4 days
       from the C+0 (the start of the Open the Airbase module). If extensive operational
       planning is not required, then the IOC for this module is approximately 2 days. However,
       planners must ensure the flow of the Generate the Mission FM does not outpace the flow
       of critical support elements in the Command & Control, Establish the Airbase, and initial
       Operate the Airbase FMs.

      6.3.7.6. Assumptions. Required combat support and operational support is available
      upon aircraft arrival.
      6.3.7.7. Constraints. The ability to reach IOC is dependent upon the strategic flow of
      combat support capabilities and the deployment of required mission aircraft and
      operators.
   6.3.8. Operate the Airbase. The Operate the Airbase force module contains mission
   support forces needed to achieve full operating capability. Forces within this module make
   the initial operating capabilities of the airbase more robust with supplies and personnel to
   sustain forces for a minimum of 30 days. The lead agency for the Operate the Airbase Force
   Module is AF/A5X; AF/A4R is the OCR for this force module.
      6.3.8.1. This module will provide capabilities to enhance force protection,
      communications, cargo handling, quality of life activities such as chaplain, fitness,
      library, health care, feeding and sheltering, and reach-back capabilities. This module
      brings the airbase into full operating capability.
      6.3.8.2. The timing of forces flow begins on or after day C+2 and reaches closure on or
      before day C+14. The module is estimated to be IOC in approximately 7 days from
      arrival at destination.
      6.3.8.3. Assumptions. No significant assumptions were made for the implementation of
      this force module.
      6.3.8.4. Constraints. The following constraints may impede the utilization of this force
      module.
          6.3.8.4.1. The ability to augment BEAR 7 days from ramp to IOC.
   6.3.9. Robust the Airbase. The Robust the Airbase force module contains those support
   forces that would typically not arrive until 30 days after an operating location is established.
   The lead agency for the Robust the Airbase Force Module is AF/A5X; AF/A4R is the OCR
   for this force module.
      6.3.9.1. This module provides additional ECS forces to robust the capabilities already in
      place from the previous FMs until a rotational operation can be implemented.
      6.3.9.2. The Robust the Base FM is considered part of the baseline structure for the
      AETF.
   6.3.10. Guidelines for using and maintaining these AETF FMs.
      6.3.10.1. The AETF FMs will be maintained in DCAPES in 088-series PIDs as depicted
      in Table 6.2

          6.3.10.1.1. The Open the Airbase, Command and Control, Establish the Airbase,
          Operate and Robust the Airbase force modules are all stand-alone. All of the UTCs
          that constitute the force module will be included in the FMID.
          6.3.10.1.2. The Generate the Mission force modules will only contain the primary
          UTC(s) for the applicable MUG(s). Each MUG will have a unique FMID and include
          the primary UTC in the force module title. Depending on the MUG chosen, the
          general MPP and one of the eight Mission Platform force modules will also need to
          be selected to complete the Generate the Mission FM. Following is an example of
          how to use the Generate the Mission FM.
               6.3.10.1.2.1. Choose the Generate the Mission FM based on the desired effect,
               e.g., 8CS00, for Close Air Support.
               6.3.10.1.2.2. The UTCs listed in this FMID represent all of the primary UTCs
               that could support the mission (e.g. CAS would have UTCs for A-10s, F-16 -
               Block 30s, F-16 – Block 40s, B-1s, and B-52s; each MDS might be further
               identified as either Active, Guard, or Reserve).
               6.3.10.1.2.3. The primary UTC selected (e.g. 3FVF1 - A-10 Active) will also
               represent the FMID for MUG. Note: Some UTCs might be the primary UTC in
               more than one MUG.
               6.3.10.1.2.4. Since the platform chosen is a fighter, the Fighter Mission Platform
               FM and the general MPP will also need to be selected.
      6.3.10.2. The AETF FMs are designed to have limited tailoring because they are built to
      lowest common denominator. If a location already has a capability covered or designated
162                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      to support less than a population of 3,000, then and only then, would planners tailor the
      force module. When tailoring force modules, entire UTCs will be tailored out.
      6.3.10.3. If functional areas determine that certain capability is overor understated in the
      current AETF FMs, the Air Staff FAM and/or designated FM lead agency should contact
      AF/A5XW to propose modification to the force module.
  6.3.11. Posturing UTCs with respect to AETF force modules. When posturing UTCs, Air
  Staff FAMs should ensure there are sufficient UTCs postured as identified below. See
  Chapter 7 for details on posturing UTCs. See Chapter 10 for procedures to request a
  deviation to the respective Scheduling Integrated Product Team (SIPT) schedules if posturing
  UTCs in support of AETF FMs conflicts with the schedule(s).
      6.3.11.1. Each AEF vulnerability period should contain the capability to support and
      operate five AEW bases (eight with mobilization). Therefore, each AEF vulnerability
      period will have sufficient number of UTCs postured to fill eight Command and Control,
      eight Establish the Airbase, eight Operate the Airbase, and eight Robust the Airbase FMs.
      HAF FAMs will include this requirement in their FAM guidance.
      6.3.11.2. The Air Mobility Operations Enabler category (with augmentation from UTCs,
      in some functional areas, from the AEF Tempo Bands) will have sufficient number of
      UTCs postured to fill three Open the Airbase FMs simultaneously (four with ARC
      augmentation). HAF FAMs will include this requirement in their FAM guidance.
      6.3.11.3. The Generate the Mission FM is actually a combination of a MUG and a
      Mission Platform Package.
         6.3.11.3.1. Each base that is tasked with a primary UTC of the MUG should be able
         to posture all of the UTCs included in that MUG. Furthermore, all of the UTCs that
         constitute the MUG must be aligned to the same AEF Library.
         6.3.11.3.2. Each AEF pair, plus available forces from the Enabler library, should
         have a sufficient number of UTCs postured to build the applicable number of Fighter,
         Tanker, Bomber, Theater Airlift, Rescue, Special Forces, and C2ISR/Electronic
         Warfare Mission Platform Packages as outlined in the WMP 3 Part 4.
         6.3.11.3.3. Each AEF pair should have sufficient UTCs postured to support eight
         General MPP force modules.
  6.3.12. The AEFC will assign a FM identification/association code to those UTCs that match
  the FM construct and have a P-code of "DW*."(See Chapter 7)
      6.3.12.1. The AETF FM UTCs will not be fenced and can be used to meet any
      combatant commander’s requirements.
      6.3.12.2. All units (active, AFRC, and ANG) will be considered when the FM
      identifications are assigned. This is necessary to determine how many FMs can be built
      within each AEF Pair.

           6.3.13.11.1. MAJCOMs will ensure personnel are trained and equipped as required.
           6.3.13.11.2. MAJCOMs will validate/source consistent with force module policies
           and doctrine.
       6.3.13.12. Supported Component Headquarters
           6.3.13.12.1. Component headquarters will use AETF force modules as the initial and
           primary concept for TPFDD development and request of forces.
           6.3.13.12.2. Air Force component headquarters will ensure that host nation (HN)
           agreements and arrangements outlined in the DOD FCG or through separate
           negotiations will support the TPFDD or other planned deployments, employment or
           sustainment. Ensure, through the applicable Unified Command, that US Embassy or
           US Defense Representative receive a copy of CJCS Orders to assure that U.S.
           Embassies have sufficient time, input and manpower to support coordination with
           HN.
       6.3.13.13. Wings
           6.3.13.13.1. Wings will ensure personnel are trained to execute air and space
           operations using AETF force modules.
6.4. Functional/Cross-Functional Area FMs. Functional/Cross-Functional Area FMs
facilitate UTC requirements determination during TPFDD development. These FMs contain
modular-scalable UTCs that are commonly combined at time of execution to form a specific
capability, e.g. base transportation function, AFFOR or Air Operations Center (AOC) staff, etc.
The primary purpose of these FMs is to provide the planning community the ability to package
capability via UTCs. The benefit of using these FMs is the ability to capture what is needed for a
specific tasking that is made up of more than one UTC. Instead of creating a large UTC, many
smaller functional area UTCs can be developed and packaged in this type of FM.
   6.4.1. Tailoring at execution is allowed similar to UTC tailoring in order to ensure the
   correct amount and types of UTCs are utilized. FM tailoring can be by whole UTC or by
   partial UTC.
   6.4.2. With the advent of smaller, modular-scalable UTCs, Functional/Cross-Functional
   Area FMs are a tool to minimize "parent-child" and "cross functional" UTCs. FAMs at all
   levels must scrutinize large UTCs with cross-functional capability (AFSC level) to determine
   if they meet the cross-functional criteria (see paragraph 5.12.5.4).
   6.4.3. MAJCOM, component headquarters, or Air Staff FAMs who desire to formalize a
   functional/ cross-functional area FM should contact AF/A5XW. If it is determined that a FM
   is more beneficial than a new UTC, the FM with associated UTCs will be included in
   08FML. In addition to the associated UTCs, FAMs should develop and provide a mission
   description for the FM.
6.5. AETF Support Force Modules. The AETF Force Modules provide the capability to
initially stand up a deployment location. Support Force Modules accomplish a dual role. These
FMs augment the AETF FMs and identify the additional capability needed to support a continual
rotational presence.
 166                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   6.5.1. Augmentation, or extended, force modules. While the AETF FMs are designed to
   operate under a fixed set of assumptions, the augmentation force modules provide the
   additional capability to meet a more demanding requirement with extended capabilities (for
   example: enhanced security, disaster response, RED HORSE, NEO, etc.)
   6.5.2. Rotation Force Modules. These force modules are a sub-set of the AETF FMs with
   tailored out, pre-identified functional equipment and personnel that do not need to be
   replaced if the deployed location is supporting rotational operations (e.g. BEAR assets, Fire
   Trucks, Cable Installation Teams). The rotational force modules may also include
   “substitute” UTCs for those capabilities in the baseline AETF force modules.
6.6. OPLAN-Specific Force Modules. In addition, OPLAN Dependant FMs, which are
developed and managed by supported commanders, Service components, or the AEFC, are
designed to respond to a specific planning task such as flexible deterrent options (FDOs) or
OPLAN FM Packages (FMPs). These FMs are groupings of force data used to manage TPFDD
development and movement execution (See paragraphs 8.9.6 and 9.9.2). Sample OPLAN
dependent FMs include, but are not limited to:
   6.6.1. Functional grouping (e.g., all medical, all air defense).
   6.6.2. Geographical grouping (e.g., ULNs with SPOD of Wilmington).
   6.6.3. Date grouping (e.g., forces with LAD less than 10).
   6.6.4. Grouping ULNs for Movement Requirement Submission and Validation.
6.7. Operational Capabilities Packages (OCPs). OCPs are a grouping of FMs/UTCs designed
for COMAFFORs to present a comprehensive pre-packaged Air Force capability to CCDRs.
   6.7.1. OCPs are a method of packaging command and control, operational mission, and ECS
   forces for presentation to a CCDR through the COMAFFOR. The OCPs provide pre-
   packaged capability playbooks to optimize planning.
   6.7.2. OCPs may consist of tailored elements from the AETF FMs (for example, Open the
   Airbase) as outlined above, and other FMs/UTCs.
   6.7.3. Examples of OCPs may include, but are not limited to, Defense Support of Civil
   Authorities (DSCA), Humanitarian Relief Operations (HUMRO), Non-Combatant
   Evacuation Operations (NEO) and support to International Law Enforcement.
   6.7.4. Each OCP is built on capabilities required to accomplish specific mission objectives
   and is designed to be initially self-sustaining.

                                    UTC POSTURING

Section 7A—Purpose

7.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the background, guidance and
procedures for the posturing of Air Force capabilities, known as unit type codes (UTCs).

Section 7B—Background

7.2. Presentation of Forces. As discussed in AFPD 10-4, the U.S. Air Force presents its forces
via an Air & Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF). The basic building block used in force
planning and the deployment of AETFs is the UTC. A UTC depicts a force capability with
personnel and/or equipment requirements. The assignment of a UTC categorizes each type
organization into a class or kind of unit having common distinguishing characteristics.
7.3. DELETED
7.4. AEF Capability Library. The AEF Capability Library contains the Air Force’s total
combat/combat support/combat service support capability in terms of UTCs. The library
consists of all the forces postured in the five primary and two ARC Tempo Bands plus, the
Enabler force. AEF Capability data is maintained in the UTC Availability (UTA) application of
DCAPES. Within UTA, there are multiple cycles (based on fiscal years); each cycle will contain
all UTCs within the AEF Capability Library whether the specific AEF vulnerability period is
during that fiscal year or not.
   7.4.1. DELETED.
   7.4.2. DELETED.

Section 7C—Guidance and Procedures

7.5. UTC Posturing Concept Overview. All Air Force personnel contribute to the AEF and
are inherently deployable or employ in-place. Those organizations identified as a Combat,
Combat Support (CS), or Combat Service Support (CSS) organization in the JCS Unit Descriptor
Code (UDC) field in the PAS file (see Attachment 8) will posture UTCs; institutional
organizations are identified with a UDC of “Other” and will not posture UTCs. Deviations to
this policy represent a deviation to the AEF Construct and therefore require AF/A3/5 approval
(see paragraph 10.2.1.).
   7.5.1. Posturing UTCs is based on funded military authorizations on an organization’s unit
   manpower document (UMD). All authorizations in warfighting organizations must be
   accounted for when posturing UTCs in UTA. Force providers should package manpower
   authorizations into standard deployable UTCs to the maximum extent possible. With unit
   chain-of-command involvement and MAJCOM OFAMO and/or AEF Cell oversight,
   MAJCOM FAMs posture UTCs based on the prioritization and sequencing guidance defined
   by each HAF FAM. Note 1: Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) authorizations
   attached to AC units will not be postured in UTCs, regardless of the attached organization’s
   UDC. IMAs will be managed by their AEFI code, which corresponds to their vulnerability
 170                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   window (see Chapter 14). Note 2: Civilian positions will not be postured in UTCs unless
   standard UTCs specifically include civilian authorizations (e.g. Historian, AFETS, etc).
   7.5.2. DELETED.
7.6. Overview of Different Types of UTCs. All funded military authorizations from
warfighting organizations will be used as the basis for UTCs postured in UTC Availability. For
all unfunded requirements, the MAJCOMs and ARC must ensure these requirements are
processed through the corporate process or PPBE for programming prior to being postured.
Authorizations will be postured in standard or Associate UTCs.
   7.6.1. Standard deployable UTCs represent a package of capability with a specific MISCAP,
   as defined in the MEFPAK, and are designed to reduce the amount of detailed planning and
   coordination needed during combatant commander Crisis Action TPFDD development.
   Standard deployable UTCs provide the most detail to Air Force planners and will be used to
   the greatest extent possible. Deployable UTCs may be used in TPFDDs to define an in-place
   capability. Details for posturing standard deployable UTCs are in paragraph 7.9
   7.6.2. Funded authorizations that cannot be described with or do not fit into an existing
   standard UTC will be postured into an "Associate" UTC (A-UTC). A-UTCs do not contain
   MISCAPs or standard manpower/logistics detail and are not available for use by a combatant
   commander or its component to describe deployment requirements in an executable TPFDD.
   A-UTCs facilitate AEF association for all personnel and provide alternate capability to meet
   requirements. Details for posturing A-UTCs are in paragraph 7.10
7.7. Overview of UTC Posturing. Posturing a UTC consists of entering a UTC for a specific
unit (UIC) into UTC Availability. Multiple occurrences of the same UTC for a unit will have
separate Record Numbers (RecNums) and separate Availability Line Numbers (ALNs). The
UTC-UIC-RecNum combination or ALN is referred to as the UTC Availability record or UTC
record. When posturing a UTC Availability record, MAJCOM FAMs must determine the
record’s Posturing Code (P-Code) (see paragraph 7.14), align the record to a specific AEF
library, and ensure supporting UTCs, if applicable, are similarly postured. When determining
what types of UTCs to posture, MAJCOM FAMs should use the functional area prioritization
and sequencing instruction and the following definitions:
7.7. (AFGSC)Overview of UTC Posturing. HQ AFGSC FAMs will coordinate changes to
posturing and coding with their units prior to submitting posturing change requests to HQ
AFGSC/A3CW to update UTC availability data.
   7.7.1. Non-deployable . Reserved for those UTCs (identified with a DEPID of 9 in
   MEFPAK) used to register a unit in GSORTS. Nondeployable UTCs will not be used to
   posture capability in UTC Availability and cannot be used in TPFDDs.
   7.7.2. Deployable . A capability that could fulfill the manpower and equipment
   requirements of a MEFPAK-registered UTC. Deployable does not necessarily indicate that
   the particular UTC for a specific unit is intended to deploy. All Air Force forces are
   inherently deployable.
   7.7.3. Available to Deploy. Indicates that a specific UTC for a specific unit would normally
   be eligible for deployment given a certain set of deployment conditions and assuming full
   readiness. Current posturing strategy identifies two deployment conditions -normal rotational
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             171


   conditions and maximum surge (surge level 3). The availability to deploy during
   intermediate levels of surge (i.e. minimum surge (surge level 1) and limited surge (surge
   level 2)) cannot be directly determined from the P-code. Since deployment availability, as
   defined in the context of this AFI is based on the assumption of100% of authorizations filled,
   the actual availability of a UTC can’t be inferred by the P-code.
   7.7.4. Ready to Deploy. Indicates that a UTC record is sufficiently manned, trained, and
   equipped to meet the MISCAP of the UTC. Whether a UTC record is ready or not ready to
   deploy should not be taken into consideration when posturing UTCs. UTCs that are ‘Ready
   to Deploy’ may not necessarily be considered to be ‘Available to Deploy.’ For example, a
   UTC record coded ‘DX’ may still be coded Green in ART.
   7.7.5. In-place Requirement . A requirement that is needed at home station to conduct day-
   to-day operations while the base has forces deployed under one of the two deployment
   conditions stated above in "Available to Deploy."
   7.7.6. Employed at Homestation. A capability that is intended to perform its CCDR in-
   place/in-theater mission from home station. This mission is considered that capability that is
   providing direct support to a combatant commander.
   7.7.7. Deployable Within Assigned Theater Only. A specific wartime capability required
   by a combatant commander that must forward deploy within their assigned theater to meet an
   OPLAN timeline. UTC may require in-place backfill if deployed for other than its OPLAN
   mission.
   7.7.8. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/CC or CV makes the final determination on minimum in-
   place requirements and maximum simultaneously deployable capability. Significant changes
   to coding require wing commander or equivalent concurrence. Unit commanders are
   responsible for obtaining and documenting wing commander concurrence.
7.8. Nondeployable UTCs. In the past, capability that cannot be postured into a deployable
UTC was postured in a non-deployable UTC. Although non-deployable UTCs (DEPID 9) still
exist, capability that cannot be postured into a deployable UTC will be postured in A-UTCs. If
an Associate UTC does not exist for a functional area/career field, the FAM/CFM should
develop an A-UTC per Chapter 5 and submit to AF/A5XW for approval.
7.9. Posturing Standard Deployable UTCs.
   7.9.1. Force providers will posture the maximum number of manpower authorizations from
   warfighting organizations into standard deployable UTCs. The specific UTCs to posture will
   be based on the HAF FAM prioritization and sequencing guidance that can be found on AEF
   Online. This guidance provides the functional area concepts of operation and the UTC
   structure that supports it. The HAF FAM provides guidance on which UTCs should be
   postured by the MAJCOMs and made available for planning purposes based on component
   headquarters’ requirements and the AETF force modules. UTCs used by component
   headquarters to state requirements in TPFDDs should match the UTCs that providing
   commands have postured. The MAJCOM FAM, based upon HAF FAM guidance,
   determines which organizations will posture the required UTCs and the quantity. The
   prioritization and sequencing refers to the guidance MAJCOM FAMs provide to units when
   they attempt to maximize the number of UTCs postured based on the units’ funded
   manpower authorizations. MAJCOMs should contact their HAF FAM if they have any
 172                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   questions on the FAM guidance. These instructions will be reviewed and updated by the
   HAF FAMs as part of the normal AEF planning cycle, approximately 9 months prior to the
   next AEF schedule, as described in Chapter 2. General posturing rule sets are in paragraph
   7.17 Units that do not represent a warfighting capability will not posture UTCs; individuals
   from these organizations are still deployable but will be sourced via MilPDS (See Chapter
   14).
7.9.1.1. Updates and UTC additions/deletions will be based on input from MAJCOM or
component headquarters FAMs and the AEFC. MAJCOM FAMs, through their plans office or
AEF Cell, will request applicable UTC records be "unlocked" by the AEFC for update via
hqaf.aef.planning newsgroup. AEFC will unlock records within 72 hours (only the Libraries
from past AEF rotations and Libraries currently being sourced by the AEF Center will be
locked).

       7.9.1.2. Functional Area Prioritization and Sequencing (P&S) Guidance. HAF FAMs
       will develop functional P&S guidance on how their functional area should posture and
       utilize UTCs (Note: Guidance for small, centrally-managed and specialized functional
       areas may include sourcing guidance but must not contradict this instruction). P&S
       guidance should supplement MAJCOM Mission Directives, Designed Operational
       Capability (DOC) statements and Functional Director guidance. HAF FAMs will
       coordinate with component FAMs, MAJCOM FAMs, and functional schedulers in
       developing this guidance and provide to OFAMO-P for review. Information on the
       content, format, and instructions for Functional Area P&S Guidance will be promulgated
       in conjunction with the annual AF/A3/5 AEF Schedule Planning, Preparation, and
       Posturing Guidance Memorandum. Functional Area P&S Guidance will be approved by
       functional director.
       7.9.1.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC FAMs will develop supplemental guidance in
       accordance with AFI 10-401, paragraph 7.9.1.3, to address AFGSC unique situations, as
       applicable, or when there is no Air Staff guidance.
          7.9.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC FAMs will coordinate the MAJCOM
          supplement with their Air Staff FAM and HQ AFGSC/A3CW. MAJCOM
          supplements will be approved no lower than the HQ AFGSC A-Staff/Functional
          Directorate 3-Digit-level. HQ AFGSC FAMs will provide an electronic copy of
          approved supplements to HQ AFGSC/A3CW. HQ AFGSC FAMs will provide
          supplemental guidance to field counterparts identifying modifications to
          unit/organization levels of service, performance standards, or reporting requirements
          which can be implemented during each installation's deployment availability periods.
          This guidance is intended to be used to mitigate unit/organization deployment
          impacts during rotational deployment periods.
       7.9.1.3. AF FAM Guidance will include, but not be limited to, the following: the tempo
       band each of the functional area’s UTCs should be aligned in as well as mitigation
       strategies to align capability in that tempo band, alignment strategy for UTCs within the
       tempo band, approved/pending posturing waivers for the upcoming AEF Schedule, and
       any other functional area-unique rules, processes, and/or procedures (includes but not

     Dissimilarities between MAJCOMs will be adjudicated by Air Staff DCS.
  7.9.2. Use all funded military manpower authorizations, to include commander billets,
  without regard to home station requirements when posturing UTCs. When posturing UTC
  records, the AFSC/skill level/grade of the UMD should match the AFSC/skill level/grade
  requirements listed in the UTC MANFOR with the following exceptions:
     7.9.2.1. Exception #1: Standard and Authorized Substitutions.
        7.9.2.1.1. MAJCOMs may posture UTCs using AFSC skill-level substitutions (two
        up / one down) or grade substitutions (one up / one down) when UMD-to-UTC
        mismatches exist and substitutions are not prohibited by the MISCAP or applicable
        FAM guidance.
        7.9.2.1.2. MAJCOMs may posture UTCs using Air Force Specialty (AFS)
        substitutions if specifically allowed in the MISCAP. The UTC MISCAP is the sole
        source for substitution other than skill and grade substitutions discussed in paragraph
        7.9.2.1.1. (Note: Substitution rules outlined in functional AFIs must be included or
        cross-referenced in UTC MISCAPs).

          7.9.2.1.3. MAJCOMs may modify the UTA manpower detail in accordance with the
          substitution rules stated above. Regardless if line level detail was modified or not,
          units will assess UTCs in ART in accordance with AFI 10-244, paragraph 3.5.
       7.9.2.2. DELETED.
       7.9.2.3. Exception #3: For UTCs that represent a weapon system or are in direct support
       of a weapon system (i.e. aviation UTCs, maintenance UTCs, AOC UTCs, etc), units
       tasked with the UTC should posture the UTC even if they do not have the corresponding
       authorizations to fill the UTC (this Exception will not apply to ANG, which will only
       posture UTCs when the corresponding authorizations exist in the UIC). MAJCOMs must
       notify AF/A5X of this deviation. Note: The unit must assess in ART the ability to meet
       the full MISCAP, not just the postured portion.
       7.9.2.4. Other UMD-to-UTC MANFOR mismatches may only be postured with
       AF/A5XW concurrence.

   7.9.4. Alignment of standard deployable UTCs to the AEF blocks or Enabler force will
   follow the rule sets outlined in paragraph 7.12
   7.9.5. Standard deployable UTCs will be given appropriate posturing coding as described in
   paragraphs 7.13 and 7.14 below.
       7.9.6. When posturing UTC records into UTC Availability, FAMs must ensure funded
       Air Force manning positions are aligned to no more than one UTC record. Exceptions to
       this policy must be approved by Headquarters Air Force, War and Mobilization Division
       (AF/A5XW). The only waivers that will typically be granted are for UTCs supporting
       unique missions that are mutually exclusive from standard contingency operations (e.g.,
       STRATCOM support, CONUS air defense). Note: MAJ- COMs will not be authorized to
       double-posture UMD positions to fill TCN Escort UTCs (9AEM*).
   7.9.7. The UTCs a unit has postured in UTC Availability will be reflected in the unit’s DOC
   Statement as required by AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS).
   However, FAMs must not delay posturing UTCs in UTC Availability pending the update of
   the unit’s DOC statement.
7.10. Posturing "Associate" UTCs (A-UTCs).
   7.10.1. Manpower authorizations in warfighting organizations that were not used when
   posturing standard UTCs will be used as the basis for posturing A-UTCs. A-UTCs have a
   DEPID Code of "6" and typically end in “Z.” Since A-UTCs do not have standard line level
   detail (LLD), the number of authorizations and the LLD must be manually entered in UTA.
   When posturing A-UTC records, the authorized AFSC/skill level/grade of the UMD
   positions will be used to provide the LLD.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              175


  7.10.2. A-UTCs will be postured in the UTC Availability and aligned to the AEF libraries in
  accordance with paragraph 7.12 below. Since A-UTCs have no standard manpower detail,
  line level detail must be manually annotated in UTC Availability. A-UTCs will be given
  appropriate posturing coding as described in paragraph 7.16 below.
  7.10.3. As with all UTCs, personnel assigned to authorizations linked to A-UTCs can be
  exchanged with authorizations linked to standard deployable UTCs to meet deployment
  requirements as long as the individual’s AEF alignment is not changed.
  7.10.4. An A-UTC’s 5-character alphanumeric UTC designator will be constructed using the
  functional groupings appropriate to the AFSC from Table 5.1 of this instruction. For
  example, a Supply authorization assigned to a Civil Engineering unit, if not postured in a
  standard deployable UTC, must be postured in a JFZZZ UTC vice a 4FZZZ UTC. The UTC
  designator will begin with the characters defined in Table 5.1, and any undefined characters
  will be filled with the letter “Z.” The “Z” in the last character will identify the UTC as an A-
  UTC. Examples include 3FZZZ for fighter pilots, 9ALZZ for life support specialists, and
  XFFCZ for chaplains.
  7.10.5. Positions postured in A-UTC at the base level provide a pool of capability for
  alternate backfill for, or as an additional source of deployable and available UTCs. A-UTCs
  postured at the base level will be aligned to the same AEF libraries as the unit’s standard
  deployable UTCs. Associate UTC records, which have the same UTC, UIC, AEF library, and
  P-Code, should be combined into one record. The AFSCs of an A-UTC must be functionally
  aligned; therefore units may need to posture multiple A-UTCs. The AEFC may request a
  position in an A-UTC before breaking a standard deploy- able UTC to fill an individual
  augmentation requirement.
  7.10.6. For warfighting units above base level (e.g. AOCs, AFFOR Staff, etc), the A-UTC
  represents AEF-aligned capability or positions not in a standard UTC but typically used to
  fill IA requirements for combatant commander or AFFOR staffs. Above-base-level A-UTCs
  will be aligned across the applicable Tempo Band(s) to evenly distribute deployable
  capability. The UTC designator is based on the functional grouping that best describes the
  duty AFSC or functional capability of the positions. MAJCOM FAMs will posture A-UTCs
  for each unique UIC; however, aggregation of capability at a higher level, such as the two-
  letter level, is allowed if the same deployment manager manages all positions. Since these
  staffs are cross-functional, each UIC may have several different A-UTCs postured per
  rotation. These UTCs will be postured with level-4 detail to describe the capability of the
  positions within the A-UTC.

7.12. UTC AEF Alignment Process. All UTC records, to include A-UTCs, will be aligned to a
specific AEF block/pair and coded appropriately (see Table 7.5). Aligning forces to the AEF
blocks/Pairs or the Enabler Force enables teaming and systematic scheduling.
   7.12.1. Those Active Component forces that do not fall into one of the Enabler categories
   make up the core of the AEF construct and will be aligned in one of the five primary Tempo
   Bands.
       7.12.1.1. Approximately 12 months prior to the start of the 24-month AEF Schedule,
       HAF FAMs, through functional directors, will recommend to applicable HAF DCS
       which UTCs fall into each Tempo Band (Note: Maintaining capability area in current
       Tempo Band may be delegated to HAF functional director (3-digit)).          FAMs will
       recommend alignment of all UTCs within a particular capability area (but not necessarily
       the entire functional area) in the same Tempo Band. When considering which Tempo
       Band, FAMs need to determine the ratio of rotationally available UTCs to the worldwide
       employment requirement. The rotationally available capability will be the total DW-
       coded UTCs less a non-availability factor (e.g., historically “red” in ART, unable to
       deploy, etc). HAF FAMs must coordinate with AFPC/DPW, AF/A1PR, AF/A5XW,
       AF/A3O-AOB, and MAJCOM FAMs in determining these factors and must account for
       forces assigned/committed to meeting CCDR requirements (Note: Functional areas
       should not factor in Institutional Force in determining applicable tempo band). If the
       HAF FAM recommends the capability area should be aligned in Band “D” or “E,” ANG
       and AFRC must also be included in coordination. Movement of a capability area from
       one band to a more restrictive band requires AF/A3/5 approval.
          7.12.1.1.1. In determining which Tempo Band to align in, the HAF FAM will use the
          formulas in Tables 7.2 and 7.3:
          7.12.1.1.2. DELETED.
   7.12.2. UTCs for aviation packages (3-series UTCs) will be aligned to the appropriate AEF
   block/pair as determined by the CAF SIPT and AMC/A3O. The CPS produced by HQ
   ACC/A3O provides the unit alignment by AEF for the CAF. HQ AMC/A3O develops the
   MAF Schedule, which provides the MAF alignment.
   7.12.3. UTCs for direct aviation support (primarily maintenance and munitions UTCs but
   may also include Weather, Intel, etc) will be aligned in the same AEF block/pair as the
   aviation package they are supporting. Only those UTCs that are specifically identified in the
   aviation UTC’s MISCAP will be considered direct aviation support.
   7.12.4. All other UTCs for ECS forces will be aligned in accordance with HAF FAM
   direction using the guidelines in paragraphs 7.12.4.1 through 7.12.4.5
       7.12.4.1. Tempo Band “A”. Band “A” is reserved for those functional areas that cannot
       support six-month rotational deployments. Approval authority to align forces in Band
       “A” is AF/A3/5.

     7.12.4.2. Tempo Band “B” (Baseline AEF). Band “B” is the baseline AEF; functional
     areas should strive to align capability areas in Band “B” to the greatest extent possible
     while still ensuring sufficient capability to meet global CCDR requirements. HAF FAMs
     should ensure capability is equitably distributed across all blocks within the band.

         7.12.4.3.1. DELETED
     7.12.4.4. Tempo Bands “C,” “D” and “E. ” When UTCs are initially aligned to a
     tempo band other than the baseline AEF, it is the HAF FAM’s responsibility to ensure
     that UTCs are equitably distributed across the band. This may be accomplished through
     inclusion in functional area P&S guidance, functional area workshops, and/or,
     communication with applicable MAJCOM FAMs.
         7.12.4.4.1. In order to effectively and efficiently manage forces postured in a 1:1
         deploy-to-dwell (Band “E”), functional areas may develop internal management
         methods to allow overlapping of capability within the Blocks E1 and E2 to ensure
         CCDR and home station requirements are satisfactorily covered.
     7.12.4.5. Tempo Bands “M” and “N. ” As AC capability areas, augmented by ARC
     volunteerism, are realigned in Band “D” or “E,” AFRC/CV and/or NGB/CF will approve
     the Two-Year ARC Utilization Plan to align corresponding ARC capability areas into
     Band “M” or “N” respectively. In accordance with SecDef and SECAF Mobilization
     Business Rules, a mobilization period will include pre-deployment preparations,
     deployment and post-deployment administrative time; therefore, 6 months time in theater
     usually requires a 9-month mobilization period. The nine blocks in Band “M” enable
     ARC forces to maintain a 1:5 mobilization-to-dwell ratio (i.e. 9 months of mobilization
     and 45 months of dwell). When the postured AC and volunteer ARC capabilities are
     inadequate to sustain a 1:2 deploy-to-dwell ratio (Band “D”), the ARC 2-year utilization
     plan (Band “M,” “N,” or Enabler) will be executed. HAF (or applicable AF FP FAM)
     and ARC FAMs will coordinate equivalent distribution of ARC UTCs throughout each of
     the respective M/N blocks in order to sustain the force indefinitely under mobilization.
     When the AC tempo, augmented by volunteerism, is able to sustain a 1:2 ratio, ARC
     forces will be realigned back to the baseline AEF.
  7.12.5. UTC Realignment . When realigning UTCs from one band to another, FAMs
  should minimize the movement from AEF vulnerability period to another to the maximum
  extent possible and movement of two execution periods should be avoided. A guide for
  realigning UTCs between bands is at Table 7.4
  7.12.6. DELETED.
  7.12.7. UTC Realignment within Tempo Band. Once a UTC’s alignment is determined,
  any changes to the alignment require a waiver. The approval level for realigning a UTC is
  HAF DCS except as outlined below. Note: This applies to realigning a UTC from one block
  to another; moving individuals from one block to another requires MAJCOM/CV approval.
178                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      7.12.7.1. Exception: HAF DCS, or equivalent, may direct an AEF realignment between
      or during the AEF Schedule by redistributing UTCs within the Tempo Band in order to
      better balance capabilities across the AEF. Note: realignment of the capability area into
      another Tempo Band requires AF/A3/5 approval. When executing these HAF-directed
      realignments, every effort should be made to move as few UTCs as necessary. No waiver
      is required for these realignments.
  7.12.8. Enabler Forces. Certain forces that provide a unique capability or support a specific
  operation may be aligned in one of the Enabler categories. Due to the different OPTEMPO
  management standards for these forces, they may not rotate on the normal Tempo Band
  rotational schedule. Placement of UTCs into the Enabler force should be kept to a minimum
  because these forces are subject to deploy as often as required. Note: ARC forces will
  typically remain in Band “A.”
      7.12.8.1. Enabler forces are those forces that fall into one of the following categories.
      Note: Capability areas that fall under one of the Enabler categories may be aligned in the
      Tempo Bands; however all UTCs of a specific type must be in either the Tempo Bands or
      the Enabler unless assigned to a specific Enabler unit.
         7.12.8.1.1. (DELETED) .
         7.12.8.1.2. Air Mobility Operations (E-GRL) . E-GRL (formerly known as
         Global Reach Laydown) is restricted to airlift and tanker assets and associated
         support, Contingency Response Groups, AMC En route forces, and Aeromedical
         Evacuation forces. Only those UTCs that directly support the Global Mobility
         CONOPS mission will be aligned to this Enabler category. Air Refueling forces and
         intra-theater airlift forces (currently consisting of C-130 units) support Air Mobility
         Operations and AEF operations. HQ AMC/A3O will schedule these Enabler assets
         against AEF requirements and USTRANSCOM/AMC-directed Global Mobility
         Missions. ARC forces are aligned in appropriate tempo band. The UTCs in this
         category will constitute most of the Open the Base AETF force module. The lead
         agency for this Enabler category is AMC/A3X.
         7.12.8.1.3. Special Operations and Rescue (E-SOR). E-SOR is restricted to those
         forces that perform Special Operations and Personnel Recovery. This includes
         special operations/special tactics forces, as well as resources assigned outside of Air
         Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). Note: It does not automatically
         include those ECS forces assigned to AFSOC, unless their UTC provides unique
         capabilities for supported SOF and/or is funded by US Special Operations Command
         (USSOCOM). This category also includes forces within the Personnel Recovery triad
         (CSAR and Guardian Angel). Other special activity missions (e.g. 820 SFG) may be
         considered on a case-by-case basis. The lead agency for this Enabler category is
         AF/A3O-AS.
         7.12.8.1.4. (DELETED) .
         7.12.8.1.5. Theater battle management (E-TBM) . E-TBM is restricted to those
         command and control UTCs that due to their unique and/or limited nature (e.g.,
         AFFOR, CRC, AMD, etc) cannot be aligned to the Tempo Bands. The lead agency
         for this Enabler category is AF/A3O-AYO.

        7.12.8.1.6. Republic of Korea (E-ROK). E-ROK includes those in-place UTCs for
        units on the Korean Peninsula. The lead agent for this Enabler category is
        PACAF/A3.
        7.12.8.1.7. Army Support (E-ARY). E-ARY is restricted to those UTCs which are
        habitually associated with supporting specific Army (or other sister Service) units
        such as combat weather teams or TACP/ASOC UTCs. These UTCs almost
        exclusively support the Army. The co-lead agencies for this Enabler category are
        AF/A3O-W and AF/A3O-AYO.
        7.12.8.1.8. Essential Installation Support (E-EIS) . E-EIS is restricted to those
        UTCs that are required to establish and operate an airbase. There are two groupings
        of UTCs in this category: (1) Air Force vehicle- and equipment-only UTCs that do
        not directly support or deploy with specific units, and (2) UTCs from specialized
        units required for base establishment such as RED HORSE, BEAR assets and forces,
        engineering and installation (E&I) teams, combat communications, etc. The lead
        agency for this Enabler category is AF/A4/7.

        7.12.8.1.10. (DELETED) .
        7.12.8.1.11. Global Strike Support (E-GSA). E-GSA is restricted to those UTCs
        that support the Global Strike mission to include forces identified in DoD Nuclear
        Weapons Employment Guidance (NUWEP), Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan-Nuclear
        (JSCP_N) Supplement, and the Requirements and Planning Document (RPD). For
        some units in this category, this will be a secondary mission (units may be dual-
        postured).    The co-lead agencies for this Enabler category are ACC/A3O and
        AFSPC/A3O.
        7.12.8.1.12. (DELETED) .
        7.12.8.1.13. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Support (E-ISR). E-
        ISR is restricted to those weapon systems and direct support UTCs that perform the
        ISR mission. The lead agency for this Enabler category is AF/A2D.
        7.12.8.1.14. Combat Air Forces (E-CAF). E-CAF is restricted to those weapon
        systems within the CAF community that cannot operate within one of the existing
        Tempo Bands. Direct support UTCs (e.g. aviation maintenance, munitions, etc) will
        also be aligned in this category if the corresponding aviation UTCs are included.
        ARC forces are aligned in the appropriate tempo band. The lead agency for this
        Enabler category is ACC/A3O.
        7.12.8.1.15. Additional Enabler categories may be created through coordination with
        AF/A5XW.
     7.12.8.2. Enabler assets are intended for specific operations and are not normally sourced
     by AFPC/DPW. MAJCOMs may release certain Enabler assets for DPW sourcing.
     These will be stipulated in the applicable Enabler guidance (see paragraph 7.12.8.3) or
     through one-time concurrence with the MAJCOM/A3.
     7.12.8.3. Lead agency for each Enabler category will develop and staff posturing,
     coding, and utilization guidance for their applicable Enabler category. AF/A3/5 will

        approve this Enabler guidance. Lead responsible agency may be a MAJCOM or a HAF
        directorate. Enabler guidance will include:
            7.12.8.3.1. Expand on the criteria listed in paragraph 7.12.8.1 on what UTCs may
            be postured in the applicable Enabler. Include justification criteria, if any, required by
            the lead agency.
            7.12.8.3.2. Outline the posturing coding for how UTC records in the Enabler should
            be coded.
            7.12.8.3.3. Describe the trigger points on when and how UTCs will be used.
            7.12.8.3.4. Describe who will be responsible for scheduling capabilities within the
            Enabler. If a portion of the Enabler may be used to fulfill rotational requirements,
            describe the applicable thresholds.

Note 1: This Table is based on an Execution Period where all Tempo Bands are starting with Block 1 (e.g. Month 0-6 in
Figure 2.2. If realignment occurs at another Execution Period, a similar distribution will be used only with different
blocks. For example, if realigning from Band “C” to Band “D” at Execution Period months 12 – 18 (Figure 2.2), C3 will
realign to D3; C4 will realign to D3 and D1; C1 will realign to D1 and D2; and C2 will realign to D2. AF/A5XW will
develop a Band Realignment Matrix as part of each AEF Schedule implementation timeline.

Note 2: ARC will develop a matrix to identify a predictable plan for reposturing ARC UTCS between Tempo Bands “A”
“M” and “N” to ensure a unified strategy for all ARC FAMs to utilize in reposturing.

E-CAF                  Enabler Combat Air Forces

Note 1: Corresponding MilPDS AEFI codes are included in Table 14.1



    7.12.9. The above codes will be used in the AEF library column of UTC Availability to
    indicate to which AEF each UTC record is aligned.
    7.12.10. Once the UTC is aligned to an AEF, it is available for potential sourcing to meet
    requirements across the range of military operations depending on the posturing code.
    7.12.11. The above codes will be used in the AEFBN column of UTA to indicate the
    alignment of each UTC record with each AEF block/pair or Enabler category.
        7.12.11.1. AEFBN codes for CSAF-approved deviations will be created and maintained
        by AF/A5XW.
7.13. Posturing Codes (P-Code). Prior to P-coding units’ UTCs, every level of leadership
(DCS, Air Staff, MAJCOM/CV, Wing/CC and Unit/Squadron/CC) must, through the respective
FAM, expressly articulate their permissions, mitigating factors and risks that are expected in
order to make the maximum amount of capability available to the Combatant Commands.
Resource dependent mitigations (e.g. contract dollars, IMAs) must be planned for and ready for
immediate implementation during normal rotational operations and at each declared level of
surge (i.e., minimum, limited, and maximum). The wing/ base commander is expected to place
this guidance in the base support plan and ensure their subordinate commanders are aware of the
permissions, mitigating factors, and risks, and use them when validating the proposed P-codes
and of the respective MAJCOM FAMs
    7.13.1. Posturing codes indicate the availability of UTCs a unit has postured. The codes are
    located in the P-Code column of the UTA. The specific procedures and guidelines for
    determining a UTC record’s "P-Code" are outlined in paragraphs 7.14. through 7.16.
        7.13.1.1. Although P-Codes are recorded for each postured UTC, they are not tied to that
        UTC (Exception: DP/AP coding may be associated with specific UTCs if the individuals
        associated within the UTC are specifically identified to support the assigned/committed
        mission and are not interchangeable with other individuals within the unit; DPW
        schedulers must coordinate with the MAJCOM FAM to determine if the max deployable
        DW capability is applicable in this case). Instead, they are used to determine the
        minimum number of UTCs required for assigned/committed missions, the minimum
        number of UTCs required for home station support, and the maximum number of UTCs
        of that type within a specific unit that can be deployed simultaneously. For example, a
        unit might have a UTC coded as “DX” in Block C1 and the same UTC coded “DW” in
        Block C3; at execution, the UTC can be tasked with MAJCOM coordination during C1
        since the unit has that capability at home station. Maximum simultaneously deployable
        capability of the unit is then determined by subtracting the sum of DX and DP from the
        assigned/manned data during execution. For planning, the sum of DW counters can be
        used to determine the maximum simultaneously deployable capability. Note: When
        maximum simultaneous capability is considered during planning, MAJCOMs and units
        are expected to either fulfill taskings or submit a reclama during execution.
 186                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       7.13.1.2. The P-code is determined when the functional area is in the baseline AEF.
       When a functional area realigns to a different tempo band, the P-code will not be
       redetermined.
   7.13.2. The first character of the P-Code (D for “deployable” or A for “associate”) shows the
   deployable capability as a “Standard Deployable” D-UTC or an “Associate” A-UTC.
   7.13.3. The second character of the P-Code is used in determining the maximum
   simultaneously tasked UTC records that can be utilized under surge conditions.
       7.13.3.1. For standard deployable UTCs, the second character is either “P”, "W" or "X"
       (see paragraphs 7.15.1, 7.15.2. and 7.15.3). C-MAJCOM/A3s will coordinate the
       distribution of DP-, DW-, and DX-coded UTCs with their respective CCMD/J3. The
       total number of “P” and “W” coded UTCs postured by a unit, across all its aligned
       libraries, represents the unit’s most stringent tasking capability (assigned/committed
       mission plus maximum surge). When sourcing contingency plan requirements,
       AFPC/DPW will only utilize DW UTCs.
       7.13.3.2. For Associate UTCs, the second character is either “P”, “W” or “X.” A “P” as
       the second character represents the authorizations included in the A-UTC that are
       required to Employ at Homestation with a Wartime Mission. A “W” as the second
       character represents that the authorizations included in the A-UTC would be available for
       tasking during all conditions. However, these positions must be tasked via a standard
       deployable UTC. Note: UTCs coded as AX* may be deployed as long as a like AW*-
       coded UTC record remains at home station. AP coded UTCs have a home station
       wartime mission.

   7.13.6. Posturing codes will not be used to justify manpower programming actions, such as
   program element code (PEC) changes, nor will it be used as justification to prevent pending
   or potential Competitive Sourcing and Privatization (CS&P) actions.
7.14. Procedures for Determining P-Codes for Standard Deployable UTCs. The P-Code
matrix described above results in six different Posturing Codes --- three standard and three
associate. In order to correctly determine P-Codes for standard UTCs, MAJCOMs must follow
the process outlined below. Ad hoc coding of UTCs could result in a misstatement of a unit’s
maximum simultaneously deployable capability, minimum assigned/committed requirements,
and/or minimum Service requirements.
7.14. (AFGSC)Procedures for Determining P-Codes for Standard Deployable UTCs. Unit
Commanders after factoring in career field P&S guidance will determine the availability of the
resources under their command. The maximum number of resources will be coded as available
to deploy (DW). Installation Commanders will develop in-house deployment mitigation plans
enabling them to maximize the resources available to deploy in support of day-to-day rotational
and contingency deployment operations. HQ AFGSC/A3C, as the OFAMO, will monitor
AFGSC UTC availability coding actions on behalf of the AFGSC Commander.
   7.14.1. MAJCOM FAMs, in coordination with unit commanders and based on functional
   area P&S guidance, will determine initial P-codes for all UTC records within their functional

  area using the process outlined in paragraph 7.14.2. and subparagraphs and Figure 7.1 (Note:
  HAF FAMs who centrally manage their functional area coordinate P-coding with MAJCOMs
  and incorporate guidance in the P&S guidance). Commanders will validate the coding for
  their units. The MAJCOM/CV will adjudicate disparities between wings within the
  command. MAJCOMs must re-evaluate P-coding prior to each AEF Schedule.
  7.14.2. P-Coding Process.
     7.14.2.1. Step 1 - Determine what UTCs and the number of UTCs that need to be
     postured      based      on       the     Air     Staff FAM    guidance   (see
     https://aefcenter.acc.af.mil/aep/team.asp) provided on the AEF Online web site.
     Posture as many standard deployable UTCs as possible. Any residual deployable
     authorizations will be postured into associate UTCs.
     7.14.2.2. Step 2 - Determine minimum requirements necessary to meet the unit’s
     assigned/committed mission. This refers to the capability that is (1) intended to be
     employed at home station or within assigned theater to meet CCDR requirements (i.e.
     assigned mission) or (2) forces required to support external organizations/agencies (e.g.
     CIA, NRO, NASA, NATO, etc) requirements (i.e. committed mission). First, determine
     what positions in the A-UTC are required for the assigned/committed mission and code
     these as “AP”. Second, determine which additional standard deployable UTCs are
     required for the assigned/committed mission; these will be coded as “DP.”
     7.14.2.3. Step 3 - Determine Minimum Critical Home Station Requirements during
     Maximum Surge Operation (Wartime). This refers to capability, in terms of UTCs, that
     must be withheld during a maximum simultaneous deployment of capability. Unit
     commanders, in coordination with HAF and MAJCOM FAMs, will determine, in terms
     of UTCs, the wartime home station requirements that are over and above positions in the
     associate UTCs and civilian positions. Backfill workarounds (contingency contracts,
     civilian over-hire authority, individual mobilization augmentees, etc.) should be used
     when available to minimize required withholds. During this level of conflict, it is
     assumed that all deployable warfighting capability is committed and only sustainment
     and training directly supporting the conflict is provided. At the end of the contingency or
     operation, significant reconstitution and retraining of forces will be required. All UTC
     Availability records that are home station required are coded DX and all those not
     required are coded DW.
     7.14.2.3. (AFGSC) Unit Commanders, assisted by the HQ AFGSC FAMs, will
     determine the minimum critical home station requirements. Deployable military
     resources will be the last resources applied to the minimum home station mission;
     civilian and contractor resources will be applied first. This ensures the unit can provide
     the maximum deployable capability while still meeting the minimum critical home
     station requirements.

          7.14.2.5.2. Rotational operations assumes that the "at home" sustainment, training,
          and support requirements do not fully go away, even during the unit’s AEF
          deployment. Even though MAJCOMs and commanders are expected to investigate
          and implement mitigation strategies and provide permissions to units to defer or
          reduce performance standards to allow maximum deployment participation during the
          unit’s AEF deployment, the reality is that home station requirements do not fully go
          away. To assist in determining home station requirements, commanders must review
          the home station impact mitigation plans and FAM prioritization and sequencing
          instructions      found       on      the      AEF        Online      web        site
          (https://aefcenter.acc.af.mil/aep/team.asp). Note: The minimum wartime
          (maximum surge) home station requirement and the minimum rotational sustainable
          home station requirement must be determined independently of each other.

   7.14.5. To ensure an appropriate balance of available forces, the VCSAF will adjudicate

   7.14.6. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC FAMs will ensure unit commanders are aware of Air
   Force-wide and MAJCOM functional prioritization and sequencing instructions to assist
   them in identifying functional "break-the-base" thresholds and applying approved mitigation
   strategies.
   7.14.7. (Added-AFGSC) Unit commanders validate P-Codes during monthly review of
   both ART assessments and UTA extracts. If standard UTCs (those found in ART) are
   determined to be inappropriately coded, the unit ART monitor will contact HQ AFGSC FAM
   and provide proposed coding and rationale for change. HQ AFGSC/A3CW will work with
   the appropriate FAM and Global Force Management (GFM) FAM to determine support for
   requested change. If change request is considered significant, either HQ AFGSC/A3CW or
   the AFGSC FAM may request that the proposed change be coordinated/approved by the
   wing commander or equivalent.
7.15. Definitions for P-Coding Standard Deployable UTCs. The various P-codes indicate the
number of UTCs that are required for assigned/committed missions, critical home station
requirements, and the number of UTCs available to be simultaneously tasked for deployment.

   7.15.1. DP. The minimum number of UTCs required to accomplish the assigned/committed
   missions (to include those that may deploy to meet assigned/committed mission).
   Assigned/committed missions include CCDR missions as well as those of external
   organizations/agencies that the unit must accomplish; failure to accomplish these
   assigned/committed missions is not within the authority of the unit, but would require
   approval/coordination with the impacted agency.        For assigned/committed CCDR
   requirements, the sum of the DP/AP required UTCs should be registered in JCRM by the
   supported CCDR.

   7.15.2. DW. For planning purposes, the aggregate of DW UTC records represents the
   maximum simultaneous deployment capability of the unit. For execution, the maximum
   simultaneously deployable capability of the unit is determined by subtracting both the
   capability required for the in-place AF missions (DX) and the assigned/committed missions
   (DP) from the assigned capability (Note: MAJCOMs must ensure there is no duplication of
   DP- and DX-coding to reflect the same capability). If there are insufficient DW UTCs to
   support OPLAN tasking in support of current Strategic Planning Guidance, HAF FAMs
   should address this in force sufficiency studies. When maximum simultaneous capability is

   station operations. These missions are not associated with the assigned/committed mission;
   failure to accomplish these missions would not impact the assigned/committed mission
   requirements of the unit (Note: MAJCOMs must ensure there is no duplication of DP and
   DX capabilities for an in-place mission). If AEF deployment requirements exceed the unit's
   maximum deployable capability, then UTCs required for the in-place home station
   requirements can be deployed as part of a “reach deeper” mitigation decision and require
   MAJCOM coordination (see paragraph 2.6. and Table 2.1). Under any circumstance, the use
   of DX UTCs requires coordination with the MAJCOM FAM who will confirm availability
   with the providing commander.

7.16. Definitions for P-Coding Associate UTCs.
   7.16.1. Posturing codes for A-UTCs provide the AEFC and the unit commander with a
   reference on how many "residual" positions a unit has once all standard deployable UTCs
   have been postured. Unlike posturing codes for standard deployable UTCs, posturing codes
   for A-UTCs show the com mander’s intent on how many positions and for what level of
   conflict he/she can make available for tasking. Air Staff FAMs, working with the MAJCOM
   FAMs, must ensure the minimum numbers of authorizations are postured in A-UTCs.
   Standard deployable UTCs must be postured to the maximum extent possible. The
   authorizations postured in A-UTCs must be placed in standard UTCs prior to being tasked to
   deploy in a TPFDD. EXCEPTION: When no standard UTC exists (e.g. many IA taskings),
   requirements should be tasked in TPFDD using a nonstandard - Z99 UTC.
       7.16.1.1. AP. A-UTCs coded AP identify the number of assigned/committed mission
       requirements not identified as DP. The sum of DP and AP identifies the overall
       assigned/committed mission requirements for the unit. These positions may be used to
       deploy as alternates, but only with the appropriate approval/coordination. .
       7.16.1.2. DELETED.
       7.16.1.3. AW. A-UTCs coded AW identify the number of maximum simultaneously
       deployable capability not identified as DW. The sum of DW and AW UTCs identifies
       the overall maximum simultaneously deployable capability for the unit for planning
       purposes.

      7.16.1.5. DELETED.
      7.16.1.6. AX. A-UTCs coded AX identify the number of AF mission requirements not
      identified as DX. However, some individuals filling these in-place requirements can be
      swapped with or be an alternate for positions in other associate or standard UTCs. The
      sum of DX and AX UTCs identifies the overall AF mission requirements for the unit.
   7.16.2. (DELETED) .
7.17. Rule Sets and Posturing Checklist
   7.17.1. General Posturing Rule Sets. For a UTC to be postured by MAJCOMs, the following
   criteria must be met:
      7.17.1.1. UTCs cannot be postured in UTC Availability until they have been registered,
      approved, and placed in MEFPAK.
      7.17.1.2. Small oneand two-person standard deployable UTCs should be avoided unless
      the UTC represents the logical team or package size to support combatant commander
      TPFDD requirements (i.e., chaplains, historians, comptrollers, public affairs, aircraft
      battle damage repair, etc.).
      7.17.1.3. Deployable UTCs postured in UTC Availability must contain all funded
      manpower authorizations as specified in the MANFOR or is an authorized substitution as
      listed in the MISCAP. In other words, a tailored UTC will not be postured unless a
      waiver from AF/A5XW has been approved.
          7.17.1.3.1. Overages (available personnel are greater than authorized) should not be
          postured but must still be assigned an AEFI consistent with their unit’s UTC
          posturing. They are eligible for tasking within their assigned AEFI using the same
          procedures and availability as like postured personnel in the same unit (Note: Does
          not apply to ARC). MAJCOMs must consider overages in developing force-to-
          source assessments.
          7.17.1.3.2. If authorizations are unfilled, this must be reflected in the AEF UTC
          Reporting Tool (ART) (see AFI 10-244).
      7.17.1.4. Deployable UTCs in UTC Availability must be authorized the full allowance
      standard of equipment as specified in the Logistics Force Packaging (LOGFOR)
      subsystem. If authorized equipment is not on hand, this must be reflected in ART.
          7.17.1.4.1. EXCEPTIONS: There are two exceptions to this requirement -- if the unit
          is posturing MANFOR-only, or if the UTC record is "fragged" across multiple units.
             7.17.1.4.1.1. Units Providing MANFOR Only. Units may posture the entire
             manpower only portion of a UTC if the complete equipment requirement is not
             available. The UTC record will be coded using the standard coding procedures;
             however, UTC Availability must be annotated to reflect that the UTC record is
             providing manpower only and that the entire equipment detail has been tailored
             out. MANFOR Only UTC records allow the Air Force to posture additional
             manpower authorizations in standard deployable UTCs; these UTCs may be
             executed when the equipment portion is provided by another UTC, available in
192                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


             place, or not required. Prior to posturing a tailored UTC, the MAJCOM FAM
             must seek a waiver from AF/A5XW (see Chapter 10). FAMs may choose to
             develop personnel only UTCs when equipment is not authorized or funded.
             7.17.1.4.1.2. Fragging UTC Records. The second exception is if a UTC record
             is"fragged." See paragraph 7.17.1.5 for details on fragging UTC records.
         7.17.1.4.2. In such cases as described above, the unit must still be able to provide the
         full compliment of manpower authorizations as described in paragraph 7.17.1.3
      7.17.1.5. UTCs will only be filled with authorizations and equipment from the same unit
      (i.e., not fragged). Exceptions to this policy require a waiver (see Chapter 10). Fragging
      could occur where one unit provides the manpower and another provides the equipment
      or if one unit provides manning augmentation to another unit. Typically, fragging UTC
      records will only be allowed in cases where the two units are formally linked in DOC
      statements or other functional area documents.
      7.17.1.6. No authorization will be counted against more than one UTC record unless a
      waiver is granted by AF/A5XW (see Chapter 10). An example of an approved dual-
      posturing waiver is for EWO tankers. Additionally, each UTC record will be placed into
      only one AEF library per cycle.
      7.17.1.7. If a unit can no longer support a postured UTC (e.g., a change in authorized
      position or equipment), the unit must coordinate with the respective MAJCOM war
      planner and MAJCOM FAM. The MAJCOM war planner will accomplish the following
      tasks when deleting a UTC Availability record:
         7.17.1.7.1. (DELETED) .
         7.17.1.7.2. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM war planner to notify any
         component headquarters of records that have been deleted from UTC Availability that
         are sourced in any OPLAN/CONPLAN. The component headquarters will shortfall
         these TPFDD records and these shortfalls will be re-sourced at the next sourcing
         opportunity.
         7.17.1.7.3. If the UTC record is in the AEF pair currently being sourced, the
         MAJCOM must coordinate with the AEFC.
  7.17.2. Coding and Alignment Rule Sets
      7.17.2.1. Each UTC Availability record will have a corresponding P-Code in the
      Posturing Code column. Paragraphs 7.15 and 7.16 outline the procedures for
      determining the appropriate code for standard deployable and associate UTCs
      respectively.
      7.17.2.2. UTC Availability records will be aligned and coded by the owning MAJCOM
      to one of the 10 AEF libraries. Only UTCs that meet the guidance in paragraph 7.12.8
      will be placed in the Enabler library.
      7.17.2.3. Standard, deployable UTCs (DEPIDs 1, 2, 3, E, and P) must have a P-Code
      beginning with "D" and must have a corresponding AEF library.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         193


     7.17.2.4. Associate UTCs (DEPID 6) must have a P-Code beginning with "A", must
     have a corresponding AEF library, specify the number of authorization in the AUTH
     column of UTC Availability and provide AFSC detail.
     7.17.2.5. The AUTH data element must be greater than zero (0) unless it is an equipment
     only UTC (DEPID of "E"). Note: The AUTH data element is populated automatically for
     standard deployable UTCs from the MEFPAK. For Associate UTCs, the AUTH data
     element is automatically updated when mandatory level 4 detail is manually provided.
     7.17.2.6. DELETED.
     7.17.2.7. DELETED.
     7.17.2.8. For A-UTCs, there should be only one UTC record for each UTC/UIC/AEF
     library/ P-Code combination.
  7.17.3. Miscellaneous Rule Sets
     7.17.3.1. Personnel in deployable UTCs must be trained in accordance with AFI 10-403
     (immunizations, small arms training, etc.) and be equipped or have access to equipment
     to maintain the UTC capability.
     7.17.3.2. ART must be updated to reflect status of personnel and equipment for each
     standard deployable UTC in accordance with AFI 10-244.
     7.17.3.3. When "assigned" personnel is less than "authorized," priority should be given
     to filling UTCs required to maintain maximum combat capability as described by the unit
     DOC statement and reported in SORTS. For most units this will put priority on filling
     deployable UTCs; however for units with an employed home station/in-place primary
     wartime mission, priority will be placed on in-place requirements. As a reminder, a UTC
     record coded DX* can fill a DW* requirement at execution as long as the total number of
     UTCs of that particular type does not exceed the total number of DW* UTCs of that type
     postured across all AEF libraries.
  7.17.4. Posturing Checklist.
     7.17.4.1. For warfighting organizations, was every funded military manpower
     authorization postured? It is critical that FAMs do not posture unfunded manpower
     requirements. FAMs must ensure only funded requirements are identified to be postured.
     7.17.4.2. Can any more standard deployable UTCs be postured from residual positions
     (associate UTCs)?
     7.17.4.3. Was posturing based on Air Staff FAM priority and sequencing guidance?
     7.17.4.4. DELETED
     7.17.4.5. If aligned in the Enabler library, do UTCs meet the criteria for one of the
     Enabler categories?
     7.17.4.6. Do UTC records have the appropriate P-Code and AEF library code as
     described in Coding Rule sets above?
     7.17.4.7. (DELETED) .
     7.17.4.8. Are A-UTCs postured at the UIC level and in functionally designed UTCs?
 194                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       7.17.4.9. Are A-UTCs aligned per designated rotation for base-level and below and
       across the AEF libraries for above base level?
       7.17.4.10. Was line-level detail added for all A-UTC records?
       7.17.4.11. Was line level detail exploded for all standard UTC records?
7.18. Sourcing UTCs in TPFDDs. The correct posturing and coding of UTCs in UTC
Availability facilitates sourcing of TPFDD requirements. This includes TPFDDs that support
contingency plans, crisis action plans, and TPFDDs for rotational operations. Details for
sourcing TPFDD requirements across the range of military operations are in Chapter 8 and
Chapter 9.
7.19. Multiple UTC Groups (MUGs), Mission Platform Packages (MPPs) and AETF Force
Modules (FMs). In order to facilitate UTC requirements determination, MUGs, MPPs and FMs
have been developed. MUGs are listings of UTCs that correspond to a specific PAA and MDS.
MPPs are listings of UTCs that support the MUGs and correspond to MDS categories (Fighters,
Bombers, Airlift, Tankers, ISR, Rescue, etc). In addition to linking UTCs, MUGs, MPPs and
FMs may or may not link specific units (UICs).
   7.19.1. MUGs are primarily used in contingency planning. Currently, the only MUGs
   utilized are aviation MUGs. These MUGs include the aviation and direct combat support
   UTCs for a specific unit (e.g. maintenance, munitions, spares, etc.). The aviation UTCs are
   derived from the UTCs listed in the WMP-3 Part 1; the support UTCs are those that are
   specifically listed in the aviation UTCs mission capability (MISCAP) statement. Aviation
   MUGs, if sourced, should be sourced from the same location. MPPs are also aviation FMs,
   but are not directly associated with a particular PAA/MDS, but are associated with MDS
   categories and would not normally be sourced as a FM.
   7.19.2. AETF FMs are more generic UTC combinations that provide an overarching
   mission. There are multiple AETF FMs: open the airbase, command and control, establish
   the airbase, operate the airbase, and robust the airbase. The UTCs that comprise these FMs
   will be equitably aligned across the AEF libraries to facilitate crisis action planning while
   maintaining the AEF. AETF FMs are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
   7.19.3. Functional Area and Cross-Functional Area Force Modules. Although not currently
   formalized, Functional/Cross-Functional Area FMs also facilitate UTC requirements
   determination during TPFDD development. These FMs contain modular-scalable UTCs that
   are commonly combined at time of execution to form a specific capability, e.g. base
   transportation function, AFFOR staff, etc. Functional/Cross-Functional Area FMs are also
   discussed in detail in Chapter 6.

   TIME-PHASED FORCE AND DEPLOYMENT DATA (TPFDD) MANAGEMENT

Section 8A—Purpose

8.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the background information, guidance
and procedures for the development, maintenance, and utilization of the Time-Phased Force
Deployment Data (TPFDD) in an Air and Space Expeditionary Force presentation manner. This
chapter addresses cradle-to-grave TPFDD management to include contingency planning, crisis
action planning, and rotational operations. Step-by-step instructions on DCAPES functionality to
support TPFFD management is available in the DCAPES AFJET user’s guide located in the
DCAPES launch menu. Detailed instructions for TPFDD management of rotational and
sustainment operations, are located in Chapter 9.
   8.1.1. Policy and guidance applies to all Air Force planners, FAMs, and individuals
   supporting the operational planning and execution process under the authority of the Chief of
   Staff, United States Air Force. This includes Air Force Service staffs to Combatant
   Commands.
   8.1.2. The directions in this chapter and overall instruction must be followed. If conflicts
   arise between the contents of this chapter and the contents of joint publications, the specific
   information in the joint publication will take precedence for the activities of joint forces
   unless the CJCS has provided more current and specific guidance to the contrary. Also, if the
   conflict in question impedes the Air Force’s ability to meet mission requirements, issue
   should be staffed to AF/A3/5 for arbitration with Joint Staff. The authoritative sources of
   information required by JOPES are contained in the documents listed in paragraphs 1.8.1
   through 1.8.5

Section 8B—Background

8.2. TPFDD Overview. A TPFDD is the electronic data portion of a plan that exists in
JOPES/DCAPES. It contains detailed requirements, capabilities, and movement data that support
Air Force, Joint, and Combined Plans. A TPFDD contains critical information to include the
time phasing of forces by C-dates to specific destinations (called routing data). Additionally,
through the use of UTCs, this information includes personnel and equipment details.
   8.2.1. Data Ownership. The Supported Commands and designated functional managers
   own the data in the TPFDDs that support their JSCP taskings, operations, and exercises.
   They have overall control of TPFDD development, distribution, security level, maintenance,
   and overall quality.
   8.2.2. The Supported Combatant Commands depend on their Service Component
   Commands, Supporting Commands, AF/A5XW, and the AEF Center (AEFC) to provide and
   maintain accurate data in the TPFDD.
   8.2.3. Service Component Commands, Supporting Commands, AF/A5XW, and the AEFC
   are data stewards for most of the data elements within the ULNs; therefore, they must ensure
 196                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   Air Force unique guidance that supports the Air Force process of presenting forces are
   included in AOR-specific instructions, e.g. TPFDD Letters of Instruction (LOIs).
   8.2.4. TPFDD management encompasses requirements determination, to include timing;
   sourcing, verification and validation of forces; and continued maintenance of the TPFDD.
   This initiates the joint deployment process.
   8.2.5. The TPFDD enables timely operational capability assessments to facilitate joint force
   projection planning/execution in support of national objectives and operational missions.
   8.2.6. For contingency and crisis action planning, planners at the supported component
   headquarters develop the Air Force requirements, by UTC, in the TPFDD to express the total
   expeditionary force needed to meet the specified mission objectives. These unique
   requirements are referred to as a Unit Line Number (ULN).
8.3. Types of TPFDDs. Joint guidance states that planning that supports JOPES is capabilities-
based. This implies that military planners only employ the forces and resources specified for
regional or global planning in the Global Force Management Guidance apportionment tables,
CJCS orders, Service capabilities documents (e.g. U.S. Air Force WMP-3 Part 1), allied and
coalition agreements, or approved operation plans/operation orders. Using these forces and
resources, the Supporting Command, Supported Command, and AEFC will select the specific
forces that they intend to employ to satisfy the assigned mission. This capabilities-based
planning in JOPES results in specific types of TPFDDs. The two major types of TPFDDs are
requirements-driven TPFDDs and capabilities-driven TPFDDs.
   8.3.1. Requirements-driven TPFDDs. In general, requirements TPFDDs are normally
   associated with written OPLANs/CONPLANs/OPORDs. These types of TPFDDs contain the
   Air Force presentation of forces in support of a specific requirements driven plan. Air Force
   planners support the requirements TPFDDs by building, sourcing, verifying, and validating
   ULNs to the component headquarters and the supporting or supported combatant command.
   Examples of requirements TPFDDs include but are not limited to:
       8.3.1.1. Contingency planning TPFDDs as required by the JSCP or other defense
       planning document.
       8.3.1.2. Crisis Action Planning TPFDDs (includes but is not limited to
       imminent/ongoing combat operation, Humanitarian Relief Operations (HUMRO),
       Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO), and rotational operations.
       8.3.1.3. Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW) (includes but is not limited to
       Olympics Support, POTUS Support Operations, Natural Disasters, and Wildfire/Forest
       Fire Support).
   8.3.2. Capabilities-driven TPFDDs. Capabilities TPFDDs can be utilized to assess our
   methods for organizing, training, equipping, and sustaining our air and space forces to meet
   the defense strategy requirements
   8.3.3. In general, capabilities TPFDDs are normally those that depict an Air Force capability
   not directly associated with a specific requirement. A capabilities TPFDD is used to illustrate
   a capability that represents the Air Force commitment to rapidly respond with air and space
   forces to fulfill war fighting and operational requirements.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              197


   8.3.4. Unlike requirements TPFDDs, capabilities TPFDDs are normally Service owned. Air
   Force planners at all levels support capabilities TPFDDs by building and sourcing ULNs to
   ensure we can support a potential operational requirement or assess overall operational and
   population driven Air Force capabilities. Examples of Capabilities TPFDDs include:
       8.3.4.1. AETF FM "force module" and Operational Capability Packages (OCP) libraries
       8.3.4.2. Base Level Assessment (BLA) to include Air Force specific exercises
       8.3.4.3. TPFDDs used to support war games and/or studies in support of strategic
       analyses
8.4. TPFDD Data Elements. A critical part of TPFDD management is the accuracy and
timeliness associated with the data elements. All Air Force planners are responsible to ensure the
use of accurate, real world UTC and unit data. This is necessary to achieve and maintain
effective operational force capabilities. There are a myriad of TPFDD elements, but can be
functionally categorized as follows:
   8.4.1. Force description data . Provides force description information as well as the
   ULN/FRN, the UTC, unit level code (ULC), and force modules. The Air Force utilizes a sub-
   category known as unit data.
   8.4.2. Unit specific data . Identifies an actual unit (i.e. UIC) and describes a type or
   notional unit designated to support the force requirement. JOPES/DCAPES utilizes the
   GSORTS and Air Force PAS reference file database to automatically populate UIC related
   data fields. This data includes unit name, origin, MAJCOM code (in the Service reserved
   code data field), and component code.
   8.4.3. Force movement characteristics . This data includes both unit cargo and personnel
   data such as authorized strength (PAX/PERS/AUTH), and detailed cargo data (cargo short
   tons).
   8.4.4. Routing and time phasing data . This includes origin, POE, POD, Destination,
   Intermediate Location (ILOC) GEO Codes, transportation mode and source and applicable
   commencement or C dates (RLD, ALD, EAD, LAD, RDD, and CRD).
   8.4.5. Service unique force requirement data . Known as Service force definition data in
   joint publications, this provides additional information identified by the individual Services
   to meet force requirements. This includes Service Reserved Code (SRC) and Critical
   Employment Indicator (CEI) that are primarily used by the Manpower/Personnel
   communities. Additionally, FAMs at the supported component headquarters and force
   provider level use Service unique force requirement data when there is a need to tailor or
   specify individual personnel Line Level Detail (LLD) such as Attached Personnel
   Accounting Symbol (APAS) Codes, Air and Space Expeditionary Force Indicator (AEFI),
   and Command Remarks (CRM).
       8.4.5.1. The Service Reserved Code (SRC) is a five-character data field in the TPFDD
       used by the Air Force to primarily identify our supporting MAJCOM/MAJCOM
       equivalent and component. The first two characters are the MAJCOM Code (see Table
       8.1), which depicts the actual force provider; the third character is the component code
       (see Table 8.2); the fourth and fifth characters are undefined. Note: For ARC units, the
       SRC defaults to the Gaining MAJCOM.

       8.4.5.2. Attached Personnel Accounting Symbol (APAS) Codes. Identifies the
       established or provisional unit that an individual is gained to during employment.
       8.4.5.3. Air and Space Expeditionary Force Indicator (AEFI). Identifies the actual
       AEF deployment window that an individual deployed in.
       8.4.5.4. Command Remarks (CRM). Identifies unique baseline data and/or special
       requirements for billets at the LLD. (See Table 9.1).

   information. Use of these fields will be detailed in specific TPFDD Letters of Instruction
   (LOIs).
8.4.9. Data element instructions JOPESREP contains the technical definition of the data
elements in a TPFDD. It provides the valid data entry values for each data element. The "ULN
Data Management Table" expands the information in JOPESREP to support
deployment/redeployment, force rotations, and exercises. Although not a classified publication, it
is controlled under the provisions set forth by the joint library and is considered FOUO. The
Joint Electronic Library website (http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/)can also be accessed through
the SIPRNET: http://www.js.smil.mil/masterfile.sjsimd/jel/Index.htm

Section 8C—Guidance

8.5. TPFDD Development Concept of Operation (CONOPs). TPFDD management and
standardized terminology is vital to TPFDD development and enables effective and efficient
support for the planning, execution, and assessment of the Air Force’s force presentation. It is
necessary that Air Force planners and FAMs at all levels are not only provided the necessary
information, but have the ability to interpret, translate and execute accordingly to meet mission
requirements.
   8.5.1. This section serves two primary functions. First, it provides methods and procedures
   that focus on TPFDD development. Second, it provides the Air Force planning staffs at all
   levels with direction, guidance, and timing criteria for planning and successful execution of
   an operation.
   8.5.2. TPFDD development has two major elements -- TPFDD initialization and TPFDD
   force planning.
8.6. TPFDD Initialization and Generation. Generation of a TPFDD is a process that includes
the creation of a Plan Identification Designator (PID), assigning a Supported MAJCOM for the
PID, and setting access permissions.
   8.6.1. This first step in the TPFDD development process is assigning a PID. A PID is a five-
   character designator that links the TPFDD to a specific operation or capability. The Joint
   Staff allocates a series of PIDs to each Combatant Command, Service, and DOD agency.
   Supported commands may further allocate PIDs to their subordinate and/or supporting
   commands. Refer to JOPES Vol I for additional information and specific joint guidance.
   8.6.2. The Primary Series FM (functional manager) is the steward and caretaker of specific
   series of Operations Plans (OPLANs) PIDs at Unified Commands, Services, and DOD
   agencies as specified in JOPES Vol I.
   8.6.3. The Primary Series FM and sub FMs will assist in the System Management of the
   system by resolving user data access issues, including user account and OPLAN
   management.
   8.6.4. The Air Force’s allocated series of PIDs is 08xxx. AF/A5XW, as process owner for
   operational planning, is the Air Force functional manager for the 08-series PIDs and further
   allocates the management of 08 series PIDs to Air Force MAJCOMs and components.
   AF/A5XW maintains these PID allocations on the A5XW CoP.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            201

                Rqmt

    8.6.5. The Supported MAJCOM Code. AF/A5XW must be notified when a new PID is
    generated and TPFDD development is initiated. This is necessary to ensure Air Staff
    knowledge of Air Force presence in a given TPFDD and supports updating the WMP 2,
    Plans Listing and Summary. In DCAPES, the default supported MAJCOM code (MAC) for
    the PID is 0N, Headquarters United States Air Force. This prompts MAJCOMs and Air
    Force component headquarters to request the DCAPES FM at AF/A5XW to change the
    MAC code from 0N to the respective supported MAJCOM Code. Without requesting
    AF/A5XW to change the MAC code, the supported MAJCOM cannot effectively manage the
    TPFDD and all force providers cannot source requirements.
8.7. Permissions and Accessibility. Action above applies to restricted and non-restricted
(networked) TPFDDs/PIDs. Refer to JOPES Vol I for additional information and specific joint
guidance regarding restricted and non-restricted PIDs.
    8.7.1. TPFDD accessibility is detailed in Chapter 4.
    8.7.2. User Account Management is detailed in Chapter 4.
    8.7.3. Roles and Permissions in DCAPES User Account Maintenance (UAM) and JOPES
    Permissions Software (JPERMS) that support TPFDD management are detailed in Chapter
    4.
8.8. The Force Planning Process. The force planning process (known as step 1 of the Plan
Development Phase of contingency planning) is the product of mission analysis and intelligence
assessment with its foundation in the supported commander's concept of operations. Force
planning consists of force requirements determination, force list development and refinement (or
sourcing), and shortfall management. Shortfall management is addressed in Chapter 10.
 202                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   8.8.1. Effective force planning by the component headquarters requires extensive
   coordination and data exchange among HQ Air Force, MAJCOMs, AEFC, ANG, and other
   applicable Air Force sourcing agencies before the TPFDD is submitted to, and approved by,
   the unified command. In addition, functional planners at the component headquarters level
   must ensure adequate coordination is achieved in situations where the requirements of one
   function impact on the requirements of another. It is imperative ARC coordination occurs at
   all phases of the Force Planning Process. This will aid in the effective and efficient utilization
   of ARC forces.
   8.8.2. When developing a TPFDD, force planners must comply with the apportioned forces
   and availability times contained in the WMP-3 Part 1 and will comply with the combatant
   commands’ TPFDD Letter of Instruction (LOI). Component headquarters must ensure Air
   Force-specific requirements are addressed either in the Combatant Command’s LOI,
   component’s corresponding LOI, or component’s supplement to the LOI. Paragraph 8.16
   contains the minimum information that must be addressed.
   8.8.3. Additionally, the TPFDD LOI gives guidance to force providers and supporting
   commands on how to support and manage their part of the TPFDD.
8.9. Force Requirements Determination. This is the building of requirements, identified as
ULNs, in the TPFDD, to include consolidation of ULNs into force modules. When directed by
the supported commander, the component headquarters planner reviews and validates the combat
forces apportioned for planning and determines the applicable combat support and combat
service support forces to accompany combat forces. Component headquarters planners and
FAMs are ultimately responsible for determining force requirements but must coordinate these
requirements with Air Staff, force provider, and AEFC counterparts. When determining these
force requirements, component headquarters planners/FAMs need to ensure the standard Air
Force ULN construct is followed.
   8.9.1. ULN allocation for the Air Force. Supported commanders are authorized to allocate
   blocks of ULNs to their Service components and supporting commands to include Service
   force providers. For 08-series Air Force TPFDDs, the allocation will come from AF/A5XW.
       8.9.1.1. Joint guidance states that forces will be entered by Service components and
       providing organizations using allocated ULNs and force modules (FMs). This achieves
       maximum simplicity and flexibility during operational planning and execution.
       8.9.1.2. To avoid duplication of ULN allocations between multiple force providers, the
       unified commands allocate ULNs and reserve the first character for specific force
       providers.
   8.9.2. Standard Air Force ULN Construct. Air Force ULNs are comprised of a five-
   character force requirement number (FRN) and a two-character fragmentation code. The
   same ULN must not appear more than once in a TPFDD and each FRN will only identify a
   single UTC capability.
       8.9.2.1. Planners and FAMs build initial requirements by creating an FRN. This ensures
       that positions 6 and 7 are earmarked to support the JOPESREP Fragmentation Logic
       within DCAPES/ JOPES in support of the AEF presentation policy and the Air Force
       organizational structure.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             203


     8.9.2.2. This standard process supports sourcing of requirements to multiple units and
     locations in order to meet the capability and tasking. This process is called "fragging" and
     the ensuing ULNs are called "frags".
     8.9.2.3. This includes sourcing in line level detail (LLD) as prescribed in this document.
     8.9.2.4. The use of standard procedures that support five character FRNs and subsequent
     fragmentation (fragging) is vital to accurately identify data elements, define codes and
     allowable values, enhance processing of reported data by automated methods and:
        8.9.2.4.1. Improves the accuracy of planning data.
        8.9.2.4.2. Facilitates the development, review, coordination, and approval of courses
        of action(COAs), operation plans (OPLANs), and Operation Orders (OPORDs).
        8.9.2.4.3. Assists in the identification of plan requirement shortfalls.
     8.9.2.5. The first position of the ULN is assigned to Service components by each
     combatant commander to designate the Service or supporting command, (e.g. Air Force
     or USTRANSCOM).
        8.9.2.5.1. Although not required during the contingency planning TPFDD process,
        once the plan is executed and a force rotation is approved, Air Force planners must
        ensure the AEF ULN construct applies unless it contradicts CCDR guidance.
     8.9.2.6. Standard ULN methodology is critical to ensure data integrity and accuracy
     throughout the life cycle of the requirement.
     8.9.2.7. Free-Format, Seven Character ULNs. When the ULN is entered as a free-
     format two to seven (2-7) character code, it may consist of any combination of alphabetic
     (except I and O) or numeric characters (no special characters).
        8.9.2.7.1. Component headquarters must ensure that CCDRs utilize 5 character
        ULNs in building Air Force TPFDD records. Air Force sourcing methodology
        requires the 6th and 7th characters available for fragmentation. Air Force uses
        fragmentation logic to enable split routing (e.g., time phasing, multiple
        Origins/POEs/PODs/Destinations, split shipments)
        8.9.2.7.2. Seven digit ULNs have a tendency to cause procedural problems when
        managing the TPFDD. This occurs when ULN characters are excessively utilized to
        reflect data that is already defined in other fields of the JOPESREP TPFDD data
        elements.
        8.9.2.7.3. Intentionally building seven character ULNs that will need to be
        renumbered and fragged causes procedural problems and system degradation.
            8.9.2.7.3.1. Most current operations reflected in a TPFDD are fragmented to
            support different time phasing and routing. The use of a seven character ULN that
            will be fragmented will cause unnecessary system usage and may protract the
            validation process since renumbering to an FRN for fragmentation logic is
            required.
            8.9.2.7.3.2. Poor system performance and lack of application responsiveness is
            encountered which can result in system degradation and synchronization
204                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


             problems when meeting combatant commander requirements.
  8.9.3. For contingency planning, component headquarters planners will only use major
  combat forces that are apportioned to them in GFM and WMP-3, Part 1. For AEF rotation
  planning, component headquarters planners will use the major combat forces identified in the
  WMP-3, Part 4. All combat support forces available for both contingency and crisis action
  planning, are identified in UTC Availability.
      8.9.3.1. Contingency Planning. Once AF/A5XW forwards WMP-3 Part 1 to the
      component headquarters and MAJCOMs for review, in conjunction with the JSCP
      development process, the following options are available to identify changes to either the
      WMP-3 Part 1 or the CJCS force apportionment:
         8.9.3.1.1. The component headquarters will make requests for additional forces,
         through the Combatant Command, to the Joint Staff who in turn provides requests to
         the Services (AF/ A5XW).
         8.9.3.1.2. The component headquarters can make unit/MDS requests and will
         normally provide destination and RDD recommended changes to the WMP-3 Part 1
         directly to AF/A5XW.
         8.9.3.1.3. MAJCOMs can make unit/MDS requests and will normally provide UTC,
         UIC, PMAI, DOCID, Avl Date, and Special Capability recommended changes to the
         WMP-3 Part 1 directly to AF/A5XW.
      8.9.3.2. Crisis Action Planning. Once SecDef approves the capabilities annex,
      supported component headquarters planners will review and the following should occur:
         8.9.3.2.1. The component headquarters will make requests for additional forces, if
         necessary, through the Global Force Management Board (GFMB); for Individual
         Augmentees, use the Prioritization and Sourcing Review Board (PSRB) in
         accordance with CJCSI 1301.01C.
         8.9.3.2.2. DELETED.
      8.9.3.3. Using JOPES procedures and processes, component headquarters will develop
      OPLAN TPFDDs based on combatant command-provided planning guidance and
      planned employment concept. The planning guidance contained in the WMP-1, Basic
      Plan, should guide support force planning.
      8.9.3.4. The component headquarters will select, time-phase, and determine employment
      and beddown location of combat forces, by UTCs, as reflected in the CJCS force
      apportionment and WMP-3 Part 1 (contingency planning) or AEF libraries (crisis action
      planning). Combat forces will not exceed the WMP-3 Part 1 identified units for each
      combatant command in any given OPLAN or CONPLAN scenario, unless those forces
      are identified as requirements but not sourced. If there are discrepancies between the
      CJCS force apportionment and WMP-3 Part 1, with regard to number of units/elements
      or particular PMAI, the WMP-3 Part 1 will take precedence.
  8.9.4. Component headquarters planners will use the "Generate the Mission" AETF force
  module(s) as the starting point for combat forces requirements determination (see Chapter
  6).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          205


  8.9.5. Air Force planners supplement the combat forces by providing Expeditionary Combat
  Support (ECS). This is also known as Base Operating Support (BOS). The type/quantity of
  ECS support can be driven by base population (e.g. services, finance, personnel); aircraft
  number/type at the employment location (e.g. fuels, safety); or type of location (e.g. civil
  engineering, communications).
     8.9.5.1. The component headquarters FAM will develop the initial ECS force
     requirements based on the AETF force modules and modify the requirements based on
     several assumptions and supporting documents/information such as beddown
     requirements, WRM, site survey and Base Support & Expeditionary (BaS&E) Planning
     Tool data, and theater limitations (e.g., population ceiling).
     8.9.5.2. Component headquarters planners should distribute the force requirements to
     their functional managers to ensure accuracy and to modify requirements as necessary.
     Component headquarters FAMs have the responsibility of ensuring the requirements for
     their functional area are properly identified in the TPFDD.
     8.9.5.3. Component headquarters planners will only put UTCs in the TPFDD that are
     registered in MEFPAK. Component headquarters FAMs should coordinate with force
     provider and Air Staff counterparts to ensure that force providers either already have
     these UTCs postured in UTC Availability or intend to posture these UTCs in UTC
     Availability.
  8.9.6. Force Modules (FMs). Once the force requirements are determined, component
  headquarters planners will establish force modules to assist in the management of the
  TPFDD. FMs are the standard methodology to accomplish taskings (sourcing,
  verification/validation from MAJCOM to supporting Command to Supported Command to
  Transportation) and are planning and execution management tools used within
  DCAPES/JOPES to link major combat units with supporting units and to identify Air Force
  capability presented to the combatant commanders. Force module packages expedite quick
  TPFDD development, especially in a crisis situation.
     8.9.6.1. Force modules are functional groupings of force data used for planning and to
     manage TPFDD development and movement execution. Sample FMs include:
         8.9.6.1.1. Functional grouping (e.g., all medical, all air defense).
         8.9.6.1.2. Geographic grouping (e.g., ULNs with "Seaport of Debarkation" (SPOD)
         of Wilmington).
         8.9.6.1.3. Date grouping (e.g., forces with LAD less than 10).
         8.9.6.1.4. Grouping ULNs for Movement Requirement Submission and Validation.
         8.9.6.1.5. Capability grouping (e.g. open the base, operate the base, generate the
         mission).
         8.9.6.1.6. Note: Depending on the FM construct used, a single ULN may be
         included in multiple FMs.
     8.9.6.2. Force module Assignment in support of verification and
     validation. Supported Commands are assigned the first letter of FM identification code
     (FMID) as shown in joint publications. The FMID first character allocation mirrors the
 206                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       allocation of ULN characters. Supported Commands allocate a range of FM numbers to
       their Service Components to group allocated forces. Supported Commands also allocate
       FM assignments to Supporting Commands. The AEFC follows the FM assignments
       allocated to the supported component headquarters when establishing FMIDs. Supported
       Commands may establish any number of FMs, provided the FMIDs are within their
       authorized FM allocation.
   8.9.7. Force Tracking Number (FTN). An FTN is an eleven character alphanumeric
   reference number assigned by a supported CCDR which represents a single force or
   capability requirement. The FTN is used to uniquely identify, organize, and manage force or
   capability requirements requested in the GFM force allocation process and to support
   execution of JFP responsibilities. Associating the FTN with a force or capability requirement
   in record message traffic (including NEWSGROUPS); JOPES applications; and deployment,
   force tracking, scheduling, and mobilization systems; creates another means to link all
   information and data for the same FTN in multiple databases. To facilitate tracking of
   CCDR requirements from planning through deployment, each ULN will contain the complete
   FTN (Note: Until the mandatory FTN field is included in DCAPES, users will annotate the
   FTN in the baseline field). The FTN will be the first text entered in the baseline field ended
   by a colon with no spaces. Specific FTN structure is outlined in CJCSM 3150.16C and
   supported CCDR TPFDD LOIs.
   8.9.8. Electronic Joint Manpower and Personnel System (EJMAPS). EJMAPS provides a
   numeric reference number assigned from the Joint Manning Document (JMD) which
   represents the specific capability requirement. The EJMAPS reference number is used to
   uniquely identify, organize, and manage force or capability requirements requested in the
   GFM force allocation process and to support execution of JFP responsibilities. Associating
   the EJMAPS number with a force or capability requirement in record message traffic
   (including NEWSGROUPS); JOPES applications; and deployment, force tracking,
   scheduling, and mobilization systems creates another means to link all information and data
   in multiple databases. To facilitate tracking of CCDR requirements from planning through
   deployment, each EJMAPS number will be the first text entered in the baseline field ended
   by a colon with no spaces. (Note: Until the mandatory field is included in DCAPES, users
   will annotate the EJMAPS in the baseline field).

Section 8D—Guidance

8.10. TPFDD Sourcing Overview. CJCSM 3122.01A refers to the sourcing process as starting
with assigning a UIC (a six-digit code that uniquely identifies a unit) to a TPFDD UTC
requirement through JOPES/DCAPES and concluding with verification (verification of sourcing
solutions is covered in paragraph 8.14.9). Sourcing is the comprehensive and collaborative
process of assigning actual units to force requirements. DCAPES uses the UIC to access the
GSORTS and the Air Force-specific Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) files to extract the
unit number, unit name, and current location.
   8.10.1. The Air Force Planning and Execution Community (AFPEC) has the ability to take
   an initial requirement, or "Baseline FRN" and source the requirement to multiple units and
   locations in order to meet the capability and tasking. This process is called "fragging" and the
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               207


   ensuing ULNs are called "frags". Although necessary at times, fragging should be kept to a
   minimum, if possible.
   8.10.2. Typically, fragging includes "drilling down" to the line-level detail (LLD) to source
   and continue resourcing single individuals by "TASKED PAS". This is accomplished
   without losing sight of personnel or equipment in the TPFDD because of DCAPES’ LLD and
   LOGMOD level-6 capabilities.
   8.10.3. This intricate sourcing process is accomplished in three distinct echelons: The first
   and second echelon can occur concurrently or in sequence and the third echelon completes
   the personnel-sourcing loop.
   8.10.4. Contingency sourcing is a new method of sourcing and is being accomplished as an
   element of Contingency Planning. It is the use of currently available forces to match
   requirements in a contingency plan force flow, for a specified date/time frame.
8.11. TPFDD Sourcing Methodologies and Direction. DCAPES provides the Air Force with
the capability to source TPFDD records in three different echelons. The following section
provides information as to what qualifies as sourcing in these three different echelons.
   8.11.1. In the first echelon (level 2 detail), the entire baseline FRN is sourced from the UIC.
   This mirrors sourcing via JOPES and is referred to as "sourcing" at level 2.
   8.11.2. In the second echelon (line level detail or level 4 detail), sourcing is accomplished by
   linking the Air Force Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) file data to the AFSC-level detail
   pulled from MEFPAK. Sourcing via the PAS provides Air Force unique personnel data.
       8.11.2.1. Sourcing from the PAS must be used when multiple bases and/or organizations
       are tasked to support the Baseline FRN. Data at the line-level detail is used as the
       Deployment Requirements Manning Document (DRMD).
       8.11.2.2. Sourcing at this echelon uses the same Fragmentation Logic as JOPES but
       provides a higher degree of visibility for Air Force planners that manage the TPFDD
       personnel details in DCAPES. Fragging in JOPES is only accomplished at the level 2
       details.
   8.11.3. The third echelon, known as the force deployment stage, takes place in DCAPES at
   the Wing/ Unit when the designated wing representative (usually PRF) populates LLD with
   the members’ SSAN. Prior to sourcing at this echelon, the FRN/ULN is already sourced
   either at the first or second echelon.
       8.11.3.1. This process is the hook that links the Deployment Manning Requirements
       (DMR) space to the personnel (face) and generates the complete DRMD. An interim
       process in which MANPER-B and LOGMOD-B feed DCAPES a "pax detail file" is
       mandated and currently being utilized.
8.12. TPFDD Sourcing Methodology Overview. TPFDD sourcing conducted by Air Force
planners will be achieved by two related but distinct methodologies utilizing the above three
echelons as applicable:
   8.12.1. Method 1. The first method supports TPFDD sourcing of Combatant Command
   requirements developed during Contingency Planning in the Plan Development Phase as
208                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


  detailed in JOPES, Volume I and includes contingency sourcing of Combatant Command
  TPFDDs.
  8.12.2. Method 2. The second method supports TPFDD sourcing based on Combatant
  Command requirements primarily reliant on crisis action planning that may or may not be in
  a contingency plan. This is a dynamic process and the TPFDD changes as the plan is in
  execution as detailed in the JOPES volume III.
      8.12.2.1. Method 2 sourcing is used for JCS-approved operations, JCS exercises held in
      excess of30 days, and AF/A3/5 approved rotational operations supported with the AEF
      operational policy.
      8.12.2.2. The process for supporting Sec Def or combatant commander approved
      rotational operations is detailed in Chapter 9.
  8.12.3. Teaming. One of the key factors in sourcing TPFDDs is teaming. Teaming enables
  individuals who train together as a unit to deploy together. Teaming in support of rotational
  operations focuses at the squadron-level and shifts to wing-level/home station as the AF
  crosses the continuum through contingency operations to OPLAN execution. The AETF
  force modules facilitate the transition of teaming through the entire ROMO. The teaming
  concept is designed to provide combatant commanders a trained and integrated team, ready
  to do its job with minimal AOR training, as soon as it reaches its deployed location. There
  are various levels that must be considered when task organizing units and sourcing UTCs for
  TPFDDs.
      8.12.3.1. In accordance with AFPD 10-4, the leadership elements of a deploying AEF
      will be sourced using lead wing/ home station personnel to the maximum extent possible.
      See 6.1 and 6.3.10.4
      8.12.3.2. At the most basic level, teaming ensures that all individuals who make up a
      particular UTC come from the same origin or unit, i.e. these UTCs are not fragged across
      multiple origins.
      8.12.3.3. At the deployed unit (squadron) level, teaming means that the majority of
      UTCs within a functional area come from the minimum number of origins. This guidance
      applies mostly to the base level and below but will be used when practical for teams from
      the NAF level and above.
      8.12.3.4. At the deployed unit (wing) level, the objective is to ensure that the majority of
      UTCs are sourced from the lead wing deployed to that location with the remainder of
      ECS UTCs coming from as few bases as practical to maximize teaming. Priority of ECS
      sourcing will be to the lead wing, followed by other wings within the lead wing’s
      MAJCOM. Functional specific scheduling may be necessary based on where the
      majority of the capability resides; in these instances the functional area will coordinate on
      the CPS prior to the MAJCOM-level coordination.
      8.12.3.5. During rotational sourcing, AFPC/DPW will develop the ECS CPS (see
      paragraph 9.24.) using the ECS SIPT-approved business rules to meet the teaming
      objective.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           209


      8.12.3.6. During crisis sourcing (OPLAN, HUMRO, etc), the objective is to ensure that
      the majority of UTCs are sourced from the appropriate lead wing/home station with the
      remainder of ECS UTCs coming from as few bases as practical.
8.13. Contingency Planning Processes, Requirements, and Sourcing. (Method 1).
   8.13.1. Contingency Plan Sourcing Overview
      8.13.1.1. For contingency planning, the JSCP identifies the PID associated with a
      specific operation. The TPFDD will correlate to this PID and the written plan. Variations
      of the master TPFDD (e.g. Air Force-only requirements) will be in separate TPFDDs
      known as a Service slice (refer to paragraph 8.19).
         8.13.1.1.1. Method 1 sourcing will normally be accomplished in the Air Force
         component headquarters’ TPFDD slice. These TPFDDs are maintained under
         separate PIDs on GCCS.
      8.13.1.2. Access to the TPFDD in DCAPES/JOPES is equivalent to accessing the written
      portion of the OPLAN and the Time-Phased Force and Deployment List (TPFDL). The
      TPFDL is located in appendix 1 to annex A of the OPLAN and contains extracts of
      specific data from the TPFDD file. The TPFDL is also considered a printed version of the
      TPFDD.
         8.13.1.2.1. Component headquarters planners will use the apportioned forces
         identified in the WMP-3, Part 1 when building OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDDs.
         Therefore, the requirements determination and sourcing of aviation combat forces are
         accomplished concurrently. When conducting “contingency sourcing”, “replacement”
         units will be identified for those units deployed in support of other contingencies.
         Other forces available for planning are listed in GFM annexes and Service documents
         (UTC Availability). For contingency sourcing, ACC will determine the replacement
         units for those units in a Combatant Commands’ TPFDD that are not available due to
         current deployments or ART reporting.
         8.13.1.2.2. Once the aviation combat forces and in-theater assets are sourced and all
         requirements are developed, the component headquarters planner will notify
         AF/A5XW and force providers (info), by email, that the TPFDD is ready for ECS
         sourcing.
         8.13.1.2.3. AF/A5XW will determine whether a sourcing conference will be required
         or whether AF/A5XW will source the component headquarters’ TPFDD.
         8.13.1.2.4. If between the Forces, Logistics, Transportation or Maintenance
         conferences, component headquarters have additional UTC requirements, then the
         process is repeated and the component headquarters planner will notify AF/A5XW
         and force providers, by email, that the TPFDD has additional ECS to be sourced.
      8.13.1.3. No contingency planning TPFDDs will be sourced without prior coordination
      and approval of AF/A5XW. This includes contingency sourcing of a Combatant
      Commands’ TPFDD.
      8.13.1.4. All Air Force TPFDDs will be sourced according to AF/A5XW instructions.
      AF/A5XW will initiate sourcing conferences when deemed appropriate, and/or if
      necessary.
210                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      8.13.1.5. Prior to sourcing TPFDDs, AF/A5XW will review the TPFDD for the correct
      apportioned forces and corresponding maintenance/munitions UTCs in accordance with
      the WMP-3, Part 1 and ‘generate the mission’ AETF force modules.
      8.13.1.6. If a sourcing conference is not held, then AF/A5XW will download the TPFDD
      and run the automated sourcing routines that can provide POEs for each sourced record.
      If TPFDDs are built in CFAST, then AF/A5XW will run the automated sourcing routine
      that is provided in CFAST.
  8.13.2. Contingency Plan Sourcing Process. Sourcing applied using this process is
  normally for planning purposes. Once component headquarters planners have completed
  their force requirements determination, they will source requirements from in-theater assets
  as required. After this step, they provide the TPFDD to AF/A5XW who will complete the
  sourcing process using the following step-by-step approach. This same approach will be used
  whether TPFDD is built in JOPES or in CFAST and will also be used during a TPFDD
  sourcing conference if deemed necessary.
      8.13.2.1. Step 1 - Source Active Duty Aviation Origins. Each destination is sourced
      using only the active duty aviation units’ origins that are to be deployed at each
      corresponding destination. This is accomplished for all destinations. In addition, as ULNs
      are sourced from the aviation origins, the aviation origins are identified as the POE.
      8.13.2.2. Step 2 - Source ARC Aviation Origins. Each destination is sourced using only
      the Air National Guard and Reserve aviation units’ origins that are to be deployed at each
      corresponding destination. This is accomplished for all destinations. In addition, as ULNs
      are sourced from the aviation units’ origins, the aviation origins are identified as the POE.
         8.13.2.2.1. The process in steps 1 and 2 is identified as "Teaming". Teaming is the
         process of sourcing, at any given destination, as many UTCs as feasible from the
         same origin as the combat aviation units. Departure from the combat aviation unit’s
         home station, allows USTRANSCOM, in most cases, to transport the supporting UTC
         requirements directly into the final destination by avoiding use of a separate POE and
         potentially separate POD; therefore, those units do not require interor intra-theater
         transportation.
      8.13.2.3. Step 3. Close Proximity to Aviation Origins. Sourcing is accomplished at
      origins as close to aviation units’ origins as possible. This is accomplished for all
      destinations. POEs for ULNs sourced in this manner reflect the nearest aviation units’
      origin.
         8.13.2.3.1. In step 3, supporting units (UTCs) that are within close proximity of
         aviation origins can avoid the normal delays associated with transit through the
         origin-APOE-APOD-destination chain. Units that travel from the combat unit's origin
         directly to destination are able to reduce planned travel time anywhere from 2 to 8
         days.
      8.13.2.4. Step 4. Maximum Teaming (maximum number of UTCs from any origin). The
      next step is to source, at each destination, as many unsourced ULNs as possible from one
      location. This sourcing of large ‘chunks’ of UTCs has been called ‘auto-sourcing’ in the
      past; however, the current sourcing program does not differentiate between ‘teaming’ and
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             211


     ‘auto sourcing’. POEs for ULNs sourced in this manner reflect the closest POE,
     identified in the combatant commanders’ LOI.
     8.13.2.5. Step 5. Residual Requirements. The last step is to source anything that is
     available, always referencing what origins have already been used in the sourcing process
     for each destination. POEs for these UTCs reflect the closest POE as possible or may be
     left blank. The goal is to always attempt to minimize the number of origins that are
     sourced at any given destination.
  8.13.3. Contingency Sourcing of Contingency Plans. To ensure contingency OPLAN
  TPFDDs have the most available forces (aviation and ECS) identified, the Joint Staff has
  initiated contingency sourcing. Contingency Sourcing is the process of determining what
  forces in an OPLAN TPFDD are currently deployed outside of that OPLAN’s AOR and
  backfilling those forces with available aviation and ECS forces.
     8.13.3.1. Contingency Sourcing is the first step toward adaptive planning. A tenet of
     adaptive planning is to bridge the gap between contingency and crisis action planning.
     8.13.3.2. Contingency Sourcing will be executed as a collaborative effort between the
     component headquarters, AEFC, ACC/A3X and AF/A5XW.
  8.13.4. Responsibilities of the Component Headquarters in Contingency Planning.
     8.13.4.1. Once AF/A5XW forwards WMP-3 Part 1 to component headquarters,
     MAJCOMs and ANG for review, in conjunction with the JSCP/GFM apportionment
     development process, component headquarters will accomplish the following:
         8.13.4.1.1. Review the WMP-3, Part 1 for accuracy and make requests for unit
         changes directly to AF/A5XW. Component headquarters will normally provide
         recommended changes to destinations and RDDs as necessary. Procedures for GFM
         Guidance apportionment changes are identified in paragraph 8.9.3.1
         8.13.4.1.2. Reviews will be accomplished using the "Command Updates to WMP-3,
         Part 1" function within the WMP system.
         8.13.4.1.3. Identify the need for provisional organizations at each destination. A
         provisional unit will be created when a specific organization is required and no
         organization exists to attach personnel. Provisional units will be organized the same
         as regular units. Establish provisional organizations at the organization level required
         to meet mission requirements (i.e., wing, group, squadron) in accordance with AFI
         38-101.
         8.13.4.1.4. Build their TPFDDs’ combat forces utilizing the WMP-3, Part 1
         apportioned forces.
         8.13.4.1.5. Build ECS requirements utilizing the AETF force modules, MUGs, and
         the functional managers to determine the mix of UTCs required at each destination.
     8.13.4.2. Supported component headquarters will source requirements from their in-
     theater assets to the maximum extent possible prior to sending the TPFDD to AF/A5XW
     for sourcing. In-theater assets, to include equipment-only UTCs, must be postured in the
     UTC Availability. Component headquarters are not authorized to source any assets
     owned by the other force providers.
212                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      8.13.4.3. Component headquarters will formally notify (via email, GCCS newsgroup,
      message) AF/A5XW, and send a courtesy copy to the sourcing agencies, of the specific
      PID that is ready to be sourced. This notifies all planners what specific PID is in the
      process of being sourced by AF/ A5XW or to be sourced at the sourcing conference.
      8.13.4.4. In order for AF/A5XW to insert POEs in the sourcing process, component
      headquarters will provide AF/A5XW with the approved POEs from the Combatant
      Commands’ LOI.
      8.13.4.5. The component headquarters will provide the requirements TPFDD to
      AF/A5XW for sourcing in sufficient time for AF/A5XW to conduct sourcing using their
      automated programs and return the TPFDD back to component headquarters to provide to
      USTRANSCOM by the required date.
      8.13.4.6. The component headquarters will take the sourcing data file, provided by
      AF/A5XW, and enter the sourcing into the contingency plan TPFDD if accomplished in
      JOPES. If sourcing is accomplished in CFAST, no transfer of data is necessary.
      8.13.4.7. Once all sourcing has been inserted into the TPFDD, the component
      headquarters will formally notify AF/A5XW and the sourcing agencies. This is required
      in order that the sourcing agencies can begin to validate AF/A5XW sourcing and update
      their databases.
      8.13.4.8. The component headquarters will coordinate completion of routing data, C-
      dates, and any additional time phasing based on combatant commander requirements in
      the theater/AOR.
      8.13.4.9. For Contingency Sourcing of TPFDDs, ACC/A3O staff will provide to the
      component headquarters the “replacement aviation units” for those units that are
      unavailable due to deployments. The component headquarters will replace the deployed
      units with the “replacement aviation units” and their corresponding maintenance and
      munitions UTCs.
  8.13.5. Responsibilities of the Force Providers in contingency planning.
      8.13.5.1. Once AF/A5XW forwards WMP-3, Part 1 to component headquarters,
      MAJCOMs and ANG for review, in conjunction with the JSCP development process,
      force providers will accomplish the following:
         8.13.5.1.1. Review the WMP-3 Part 1 for accuracy and make requests for unit
         changes directly to AF/A5XW. MAJCOMs will normally provide recommended
         changes to UTCs, UIC, PMAI, DOCIDs, availability dates, special capabilities, etc as
         necessary.
      8.13.5.2. Ensure that the UTC Availability is up-to-date, accurate and only includes
      those UTCs, to include equipment-only UTCs, which have been approved through the
      UTC management process in DCAPES and are identified in the MEFPAK.
      8.13.5.3. Ensure that the specific UTC-UIC combinations in the TPFDD have a
      corresponding UTC-UIC combination in UTC Availability.
      8.13.5.4. Review the OPLAN TPFDD sourcing once sourcing has been completed and
      component headquarters informs force providers that the TPFDD is ready for review and
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            213


     verification. Force providers will ensure tracking of their UTCs that have already been
     sourced and those still available for future sourcing. They must ensure deconfliction of
     those UTCs within the TPFDD and between OPLAN TPFDDs that require deconfliction.
     8.13.5.5. Participate in the sourcing collaboration and if needed, the sourcing conference.
     8.13.5.6. Participate in the joint Force Flow (TPFDD) conference.
     8.13.5.7. As part of contingency sourcing and as the Air Force component of JFCOM,
     ACC/A3X staff will identify the forces that are currently in the TPFDD that are not
     available for contingency sourcing and provide the “replacement aviation units” to the
     corresponding component headquarters.
  8.13.6. Responsibilities of AF/A5XW.
     8.13.6.1. AF/A5XW will forward an email, with an attached copy of the WMP-3 Part 1,
     to component headquarters and force providers, with a courtesy copy to AEFC, during
     the JSCP development process. This email will request a review of the WMP-3, Part 1 to
     be conducted through the Command Updates to the WMP-3, Part 1 function in the WMP
     System.
     8.13.6.2. AF/A5XW will ensure that the WMP-3 Part 1 is current and updated with
     component headquarters and Force Provider recommended changes once validated.
     8.13.6.3. AF/A5XW will review TPFDDs to ensure component headquarters have used
     the correct apportioned forces identified in the WMP-3 Part 1 and the corresponding
     maintenance/ munitions UTCs in accordance with the AETF ‘generate the mission’ FMs.
     8.13.6.4. When notified by component headquarters, AF/A5XW will either download the
     TPFDD and run the sourcing routines to include the identification of POEs or execute
     sourcing directly in CFAST or schedule a TPFDD sourcing conference prior to the joint
     force flow conference.
     8.13.6.5. Once AF/A5XW has completed sourcing, they will notify the corresponding
     component headquarters with a courtesy copy to the sourcing agencies and the AEFC. If
     sourcing is conducted in JOPES, provide the data file; if sourcing is conducted in
     CFAST, notify component headquarters of completion. This notifies all planners that
     sourcing has been completed and provides the component headquarters with the sourcing
     data.
     8.13.6.6. AF/A5XW will sponsor an Air Force sourcing conference if deemed necessary
     and will notify all sourcing agencies of details.
     8.13.6.7. AF/A5XW will participate in the joint force flow conferences when deemed
     necessary.
     8.13.6.8. For Contingency Sourcing, AF/A5XW will review all Aviation, Maintenance
     and Munitions UTCs to ensure UTCs are in compliance with right-sizing and that the
     corresponding MX and MMS UTCs are linked to their aviation counterparts.
  8.13.7. Responsibilities of the AEFC for Contingency Sourcing.
     8.13.7.1. Once supported component headquarters has updated the TPFDD with the
     “replacement aviation” and corresponding maintenance and munitions UTCs, AEFC will
 214                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       verify with AF/ A5XW that all aviation, maintenance and munitions UTC with a list of
       forces that will be unavailable for sourcing based on the date identified by the Joint Staff.
       These forces will be identified by UTC/ UIC combinations. Unavailable forces would
       include those forces that are currently deployed under normal rotational operations or that
       may be “red” in ART.
   8.13.8. TPFDD refinement.
       8.13.8.1. The plan development phases are collectively referred to as TPFDD
       refinement. The normal TPFDD refinement process consists of sequentially refining
       forces, logistics (non-unit-related personnel and sustainment), and transportation data to
       develop a TPFDD file that supports a feasible and adequate overlapping of several
       refinement phases.
       8.13.8.2. For global planning, refinement conferences are conducted by the Joint Staff in
       conjunction with US Transportation Command. TPFDD refinement is conducted in
       coordination with supported and supporting commanders, Services, the Joint Staff, and
       other supporting agencies. Commander, US Transportation Command, will normally host
       refinement conferences at the request of the Joint Staff or the supported commander.
8.14. Crisis Action Planning: Sourcing and Verification (Method 2). This will include
information in support of TPFDD sourcing during initial crisis development, as well as emergent
requirements during current operations. Details for TPFDD management during rotational
operations are detailed in Chapter 9.
   8.14.1. For a crisis, the supporting TPFDD could be executed via three methods as follows:
       8.14.1.1. Execution of a Contingency Plan TPFDD. Although unlikely, the POTUS
       and SecDef can decide to execute the contingency planned operation. If this option
       occurs, the CJCS issues an Execute Order to the supported and supporting combatant
       commanders, Services, and sourcing agencies to execute a contingency plan TPFDD.
       8.14.1.2. A TPFDD already residing in GCCS via the JOPES/DCAPES database may be
       modified to meet current CJCS warning order and supported commander requirements.
          8.14.1.2.1. The non-unit data (CINs and PINs) created during the contingency
          planning process are available only for contingency planning and are not used for
          execution. In other words once a TPFDD is executed, the CINs and PINs that were
          previously built are no longer available for execution. The Air Force defers the use of
          CINs and PINs to ULNs at execution. Force modules (FMs) from established
          OPLANs are also utilized.
       8.14.1.3. The third method is a TPFDD built based on the Crisis Action Planning process
       and plan information written based on the applicable Course of Action (COA).
   8.14.2. Entering Plan Information. As Crisis Action TPFDDs are developed and loaded
   into JOPES, the supported combatant commander must enter specific plan information into
   each TPFDD. Appendix B of JOPES Vol II lists all data elements that the supported
   combatant commander should enter or update when involved in a contingency and TPFDD in
   execution.
   8.14.3. Supported Command newsgroup for a specified operation will be established and
   Service specific newsgroups identified. The Service newsgroups are used for supporting
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         215


  UTC management; sourcing actions; verification and validation actions; force rotation
  management; and DCAPES functional, technical, and planning support/management.
  8.14.4. Once a combatant commander receives a duly authorized CJCS order (e.g. alert,
  warning, deployment, execute), the supported commander has 72 hours to provide a sourced
  and validated, level-4 detail TPFDD for at least the first 7 days of the operation.
  8.14.5. Collaborative sourcing during crisis action and execution. Component
  headquarters will source requirements from their in-theater assets to the maximum extent
  possible before initiating an RFF/RFC to their CCDR. AEFC will work closely with the
  component headquarters and force providers to efficiently source and ensure timely
  verification by the Force Provider of UTC that may be available as postured in the UTC
  Availability in DCAPES and reported as ready in the AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART).
  8.14.6. Sourcing during the Crisis Action Planning Process. Once component
  headquarters planners have completed their force requirements determination and inputted
  the requirements in the TPFDD for that COA, the following step-by-step approach will be
  used.
     8.14.6.1. Step 1 – Force Provider Determination. The component headquarters will first
     source requirements from Air Force forces assigned to its CCDR, identified for crisis
     response (e.g. unique capability enablers), if applicable. Component headquarters should
     not source assigned forces tasked in the current FY GFMAP if the tasking will interfere
     with the subsequent SECDEF-ordered tasking. All emergent CCDR requirements that
     cannot be met with assigned forces should generate an RFF/RFC in accordance with Joint
     guidance (CJCSM 3122.01A as stipulated in GFMIG). If the CCDR cannot wait for an
     RFF to be processed or otherwise considers use of his assigned forces essential, the
     CCDR must notify the Joint Staff who will address the issue and work mitigation, which
     might include revised sourcing and a GFMAP modification.
         8.14.6.1.1. Once an RFF/RFC has been submitted and validated by the Joint Staff,
         the RFF/RFC will be vetted through the JFP process (see paragraph 1.10.4.). AF FPs
         will develop Service sourcing recommendation to their respective JFP.
         8.14.6.1.2. AF FP AEF/GFM Cells collect inputs from their respective HAF and/or
         MAJCOM FAMs and AFPC/DPW to develop a recommended sourcing solution. If a
         standard Air Force capability within existing resources can meet the requirement,
         then AF FPs recommend a standard sourcing solution. If a standard Air Force
         capability cannot meet the requirement, AF FPs, in conjunction with applicable HAF
         FAMs, evaluate the RFF/RFC for possible non-standard sourcing solutions. If AF
         FPs cannot provide a standard AF capability sourcing solution within existing
         resources, they will coordinate with the HAF FAM to determine if the AF can
         commit resources. HAF FAM will obtain appropriate approval/notification in
         accordance with paragraph 2.6. and Table 2.1. and inform AF FP FAM of approval.
         The Air Force internally refers to non-standard force sourcing solutions as Joint
         Expeditionary Taskings (JET) (reference section 1.10.4.2.). Standard and non-
         standard sourcing solutions or nonconcurs to sourcing requirements are forwarded to
         the JFP per GFM guidance. Nonconcurs will be based on SecDef or Service redlines
         and “significant” Joint binning risk assessments.
216                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


             8.14.6.1.2.1. JFP sourcing solutions are forwarded to Joint Staff for SecDef
             approval. The SecDef-approved order is a modification to the Global Force
             Management Allocation Plan (GFMAP). The Joint Staff forwards SecDef
             approved GFMAP to supporting CCDRs and Services. Supporting CCDRs will
             produce a DEPORD tasking component forces; ACC, on behalf of SECAF in
             accordance with AFPD 10-4, will produce an AF DEPORD for unassigned forces
             that includes the following information: (1) List of unit type codes (UTCs) or Air
             Force specialty codes (AFSCs) and the total number of personnel; (2) Minimum
             rank and/or grade for positions when required; (3) If requested estimated tour
             length (ETL) is greater than 179 days, include a job description (if available); (4)
             Tour length: routine rotations or CSAF-approved extended ETL (EETL); (5)
             Predeployment training requirement; (6) Type and duration of training and
             specific location; (7) Any specialized equipment required; (8) AOR duty location
             / destination; (9) Command relationship; (10) Any agreed upon change in LAD
             from the RFF/RFC LAD; (11) Required security clearance and/or special
             experience identifier (SEI); (12) Tasking type, and (13) Notification that surge
             sourcing (if applicable) is authorized. AF FPs will forward their respective
             DEPORD to AF/A3O-AO, AFPC/CC, affected MAJCOMs and supported
             Commander of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).
             8.14.6.1.2.2. DELETED.
         8.14.6.1.3. Component headquarters planners and AEFC will ensure applicable Air
         Staff, component headquarters, MAJCOM, and ARC FAMs are fully engaged and
         heavily involved with these processes to establish proper integration and
         harmonization at all functional levels, to include actual responsibilities to perform
         tasks and ensure proper actions.
             8.14.6.1.3.1. Coordination of planning activities between FAMs, planners and
             AEFC personnel will be accomplished to alleviate administrative and operational
             burdens that impede the verification and validation process and mitigate risk of
             erroneous and late requirements.
             8.14.6.1.3.2. MAJCOMs (i.e., FAMs and/or war planners) will ensure Installation
             Deployment Readiness Cells (IDRCs) are informed of wing AEF sourcing by use
             of DCAPES Air Force Verification Capability (AFVC). For ANG wings, the unit
             level LGRR will be responsible for the wing AEF sourcing and verification.
      8.14.6.2. Step 2 - AEFC sources forces (see paragraph 8.14.8).
      8.14.6.3. Step 3 - Force providers verify to the component headquarters the readiness of
      sourced forces (see paragraph 8.14.9) to include the ability to meet the TPFDD
      timelines.
         8.14.6.3.1. This includes supporting FAM/planner determination of capability and
         requirement and use of AFVC to notify units through the IDO.
         8.14.6.3.2. Once base-level verification is complete in accordance with AFI 10-403,
         the IDO (on behalf of the installation/wing commander) will use DCAPES AFVC to
         verify back to respective MAJCOM the acknowledgement of task(s).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             217


     8.14.6.4. Step 4 - Supported component headquarters verifies to combatant commander
     who in turn validates the requirement (see paragraph 8.14.10).
     8.14.6.5. When the requirement qualifies for force rotational management with AEFC
     involvement, Chapter 9 will be applied.
  8.14.7. Air Force planners and FAMs must ensure timelines established to support the
  sourcing process, to include verification and validation, are followed. Timelines will be
  established in accordance with TPFDD LOI guidance from the combatant commander.
     8.14.7.1. Timelines from an end-to-end process will be tracked and documented to
     include:
         8.14.7.1.1. Timelines from when a requirement is created and posted in a TPFDD to
         when the AEFC sources and FAM/planner verifies (using DCAPES/AFVC) to a unit
         via the IDRC.
         8.14.7.1.2. Timelines from when a requirement is acknowledged by a unit via the
         IDRC and subsequently verified back to the MAJCOM utilizing DCAPES/AFVC.
         8.14.7.1.3. Timelines from when the MAJCOM verifies to the supported Service
         component (as applicable). Note: After the AEFC has completed sourcing and
         distributed the initial verification FM, the force provider can apply verification to
         new/additional sourcing applied to their organization without it being placed in a
         verification FM.
     8.14.7.2. All requirements (not just aggregate requirements) will be tracked by the AEFC
     and compared to the number of completed sourcing and verifications. This will be
     accomplished using established time standards, as the standard method to measure the
     effectiveness of the sourcing process. Crisis and contingency timelines will be established
     by TPFDD LOI prior to execution.
     8.14.7.3. All reclamas and UIC changes from the unit/wing up to HQ Air Force level
     will be tracked in accordance with Chapter 10.
  8.14.8. AEF Sourcing Process. Once requirements and their force provider sourcing
  solution have been approved for inclusion in the GFMAP, AFPC/DPW will source
  requirements and place ULNs into a DCAPES force module to provide
  MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs visibility of upcoming requirements.
     8.14.8.1. The Tasking Type included in the Air Force DEPORD (see Table 8.3) indicates
     if the requirement is a unit-type requirement or individual requirement and is the basis for
     determining the primary pool from which to source the requirement. The supported
     component is responsible for identifying the tasking type code and updating the TPFDD
     with the identified code. Unit-type requirements should primarily be sourced from
     warfighting force (i.e. combat/combat support/combat service support) organizations and
     individual requirements should primarily be sourced from Institutional Force
     organizations. Warfighting force is generally sourced via UTCs (see below and Chapter
     9 for UTC sourcing process); Institutional Force is sourced using Military Personnel Data
     System (MilPDS) sourcing procedures (see Chapter 14). Although every effort will be
     made to task within the appropriate resource pool, there may be situations that require
     tasking to an alternate pool.
218                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      8.14.8.2. AFPC/DPW determines proposed sourcing solutions to meet crisis action
      requirements in accordance with ECS sourcing business rules. If suitable, AFPC/DPW
      advises AF FP of the recommended sourcing solution for inclusion in the GFMAP
      Mod. If these forces are insufficient, AFPC/DPW will notify AF FP of the need for
      forced-to-source decisions (see below). This process applies to requirements ordered in
      an established Prepare to Deploy Order (PTDO), in accordance with JOPES Vol 1."
         8.14.8.2.1. DELETED.
         8.14.8.2.2. In circumstances where there are insufficient forces in the appropriate
         AEF block/pair to meet SecDef-approved GFM Allocation Plan (GFMAP)
         requirements, and applicable approval levels indicated in Table 2.1 were not met (e.g.
         excessive number of unit reclamas), the following process will be followed:
             8.14.8.2.2.1. AFPC/CC, through applicable AF FP, will notify AF/A3/5 of the
             need for sourcing mitigation. AF/A3/5, in conjunction with the applicable HAF
             DCS will request MAJCOMs provide a risk assessment if “forced-to-source”
             and/or mitigation strategy for sourcing forces not normally available. For
             component MAJCOMs, this risk will include impact on owning CCMD.
             8.14.8.2.2.2. MAJCOMs will develop internal procedures to provide risk
             assessments within 2 calendar days. In addition, MAJCOM AEF Cells will
             provide the HAF FAM with a revised list of forces that can be provided within
             acceptable risk to the MAJCOM and those forces that will constitute significant to
             high risk.
             8.14.8.2.2.3. HAF FAMs will assimilate MAJCOM risk assessments on behalf of
             HAF DCS. HAF DCS, in accordance with Table 2.1, will recommend the
             mitigation strategy based on applicable MAJCOM risk assessments. AF/A3/5
             will then notify AF FP/A3, AFPC/CC, and applicable MAJCOMs of the
             mitigation strategy/sourcing solution (Note: HAF may not issue a “blanket
             approval” for subsequent use of DP/DX UTCs). In instances where the HAF
             mitigation provides more sourcing solutions than requirements, AFPC will
             prioritize using sourcing business rules.      If the sourcing solution involves
             changing the Force Provider for the listed requirement or increasing the tasking
             level for the Force Provider, the AF FP will coordinate a change to the GFMAP.
             If a ready and available resource cannot be identified, HAF DCS will recommend
             a Service reclama as outlined in Chapter 10.
             8.14.8.2.2.4. AFPC/CC will provide AF/A3/5, AF/A1, and applicable HAF DCS
             a deviation report of all requirements requiring nonstandard sourcing.
         8.14.8.2.3. Available Enablers . Enabler assets are intended for specific operations
         and are not normally sourced by AFPC/DPW. MAJCOMs may release certain
         Enabler assets for DPW sourcing. These will be stipulated in the applicable Enabler
         guidance (see paragraph 7.12.8.3) or through one-time concurrence from the
         MAJCOM/A3.
      8.14.8.3. Sourcing ARC Forces during Crisis Action. The AEFC will identify ARC
      forces by UTC as necessary to meet combatant commander requirements beyond those
      the Active Duty can support. Sourcing procedures utilized for rotational and/or surge
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             219


     operations will be utilized for both AD and the ARC for deployment during crisis action.
     The ARC headquarters, through the gaining MAJCOM, will verify availability and
     identify the ARC UTCs/UICs for mobilization, utilizing mobilization authority as
     needed. In accordance with AFI 10-402 and any other AF-approved ARC activation
     procedures, gaining MAJCOMs will request mobilization authority through the AFCAT
     (AFOG) so that portions of their gained ARC forces can be activated. If mobilization
     authority is approved, the gaining MAJCOM will direct activation of forces through the
     appropriate ARC headquarters and load UTC/UIC in the established TPFDD.
  8.14.9. Verification. Verification is the process whereby MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs/Service
  Components accomplish JOPES requirements to finalize the sourcing process. During the
  verification process, every responsible agency ensures the sourced UTC/UIC has the required
  complements to meet the requirement; the applicable forces are available and ready; forces
  have been alerted for deployment; and the cargo is tailored to level-4 detail, if applicable.
  Verification completes the sourcing process. Air Force planners and FAMs at all levels must
  ensure that the TPFDD accurately reflects and is consistent with actual resources that units
  will deploy. In other words verification confirms the sourced data from the first and second
  echelon reflect actual data provided by the base or unit in the force deployment level. Failure
  to accomplish this verification could result in misstating planned airlift requirements and
  possibly delaying the execution of a combatant commander’s plan.
     8.14.9.1. When verifying ULNs, FAMs utilize AFVC in DCAPES to support
     information on deployment activity and data reflected in the TPFDD.
         8.14.9.1.1. The purpose for providing an AFVC is to allow designated users to reflect
         verification of sourced requirements by performing edits; setting, changing, or
         overriding the ULN Project Code (PC); and generating reports. AFVC provides the
         ability to perform these actions on a single ULN, a selected group of ULNs, force
         modules (FMs), or an entire Operation Plan (OPLAN) basis.
         8.14.9.1.2. AFVC will be used to reflect force provider verification actions at the
         MAJCOM level (or equivalent) and below. FAMs and planners at those levels will
         use AFVC to perform specified levels of verification to ensure the record contains
         accurate movement data (PAX and Cargo) and does not contain fatal errors. When
         the force provider pulls the requirements, it keys on the Project Code (PC) "flag" to
         find those records ready for supporting component verification. After the records are
         pulled, the PC changes to reflect the new status. As editing is completed on the
         requirement, this information is updated in DCAPES to display the actions which
         affected that ULN. Note: For rotational requirements/taskings there may be
         instances where required data fields may not be populated (e.g. APOE due to
         aggregation actions). In this case, force providers will verify and ensure all other
         required fields are free of fatal errors.
         8.14.9.1.3. Each MAJCOM/MAJCOM-equivalent (see Table 8.1.) will initiate
         verification for assigned units except as follows:
             8.14.9.1.3.1. Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) will initiate verification
             for units assigned to AFDW (MAJCOM Code “4W”) as well as Headquarters
             USAF (MAJCOM Code “13”) after the applicable HAF FAM obtains unit
             approval.
 220                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


              8.14.9.1.3.2. AFPC will initiate verification for all organizations considered
              “outside” the Air Force (see Table A8.3) and will provide documentation of
              approval from OSD/A&M to the servicing Installation Deployment Readiness
              Center (IDRC).
              8.14.9.1.3.3. SAF/PA, on behalf of AF Public Affairs Agency (AFPAA), will
              initiate verification for all PA taskings.
       8.14.9.2. Force providers and bases will utilize AFVC to initiate the verification process
       (see Table 8.4, MAJCOM/Base-level Codes, and Table 8.5, Verification Timeline).
       Note: For ARC forces requiring mobilization, ARC headquarters will enter the directed
       TPFDD LOI Project Code which represents “Request for Mobilization” as part of the
       verification process.

required verification timeline unless failure to do so would result in failure to meet
deployment requirement.

          8.14.9.2.1. Force providers (planners, FAMs, or AEF Cells) will enter an “N” in the
          PC field of AFVC. Note: Force providers may designate specific offices authorized
          to update this field. This notifies the base, through the Installation Deployment
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            221


        Officer (IDO), of sourcing. The IDO, or designated representative, will acknowledge
        receipt of the sourcing through AFVC and determine if the base can fill.
        8.14.9.2.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3CW has obtained a waiver to bypass this
        requirement and streamline the process.
        8.14.9.2.2. If the base can fill the requirement, the IDO, or designated representative,
        will verify the sourcing to the MAJCOM using AFVC by annotating “BX” if the base
        can fulfill the tasking as is or BXP/BXC/BXA if the base can fulfill the tasking with
        changes to personnel, cargo, or both.
        8.14.9.2.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3CW has obtained a waiver to bypass this
        requirement and streamline the process.
        8.14.9.2.3. If the sourced base cannot support the deployment requirement with an
        alternate resource, the base IDO/equivalent will enter “NXX” in the PC field and
        submit a base-level reclama (see Section 10C).
        8.14.9.2.3. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3CW has obtained a waiver to bypass this
        requirement and streamline the process.
        8.14.9.2.4. Once the IDO verifies requirements by utilizing AFVC, force provider
        planners/FAMs/AEF Cells will verify, through the supporting commander, to the
        supported component headquarters by placing an "S" in the project code field in
        DCAPES.
        8.14.9.2.5. If the force provider does not concur with the base’s “NXX” code they
        will reset the PC from “NXX” to “B.”
     8.14.9.3. Force provider will verify record within timelines depicted in Table 8.5. or
     submit a MAJCOM reclama (see Section 10C).

        8.14.9.3.2. (DELETE) .
     8.14.9.4. Once verified by the force provider, supported component headquarters will
     complete the verification process by putting an “SC” in the project code field in
     DCAPES. This indicates that the requirement is ready for supported commander
     validation.

       8.14.9.7. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC verification process:
          8.14.9.7.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW receives AFPC/DPW sourcing
          nominations through DCAPES.
          8.14.9.7.2. (Added-AFGSC) HQ         AFGSC/A3CW         reviews    nomination     for
          completeness and accuracy.
          8.14.9.7.3. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW forwards deployment nomination
          to the appropriate FAM through SIPRNET email. HQ AFGSC/A3CW will identify
          new taskings, changes to existing taskings, or deleted taskings daily and notify FAMs
          immediately upon receipt of any new or changed tasking.
          8.14.9.7.4. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC FAM will review and verify the sourced
          requirement can be filled by the tasked unit. Once the FAM reviews the requirement
          they will notify A3CW by SIPR message to complete verification and initiate base-
          level names in system process when applicable. HQ AFGSC/A3CW enters an “S” in
          the record's Tasking Notification Code signifying that the nominated
          unit/organization can meet the tasking.
          8.14.9.7.5. (Added-AFGSC) If a unit cannot meet a requirement, the FAM will
          explore alternative sourcing and provide HQ AFGSC/A3CW with either UIC change
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              223


          or coordinate a reclama with the UDM and IDO via Reclama Processing Tool (RPT)
          within one workday (see Chapter 10).
          8.14.9.7.6. (Added-AFGSC) If the deployment will result in a sitting squadron
          commander or above being deployed to a non-commander billet, then the FAM must
          request, through HQ AFGSC/A3CW, approval of deployment from the AFGSC/CV.
          The request must be coordinated with the respective unit and information provided on
          the unit’s position with regard to the nominated deployment.
          8.14.9.7.7. (Added-AFGSC) Beginning-to-end timeline for MAJCOM verification
          cannot exceed five calendar days. Should AFGSC FAM not respond with
          coordination or information as to why verification is exceeding five calendar days,
          HQ AFGSC/A3CW will verify based on unit/organization P-Codes and ART.
   8.14.10. Validation. The validation process immediately begins once the force provider has
   verified the sourcing. This involves close coordination between supported and supporting
   commands and Service components.
       8.14.10.1. The supported command’s TPFDD letter of instruction (LOI) should set forth
       guidance regarding procedures and direction for TPFDD validation at the supporting and
       supported command level.
          8.14.10.1.1. Supported component headquarters verifies force requirements to their
          supported command.
          8.14.10.1.2. Supporting agencies will follow the JOPES validation process outlined
          in JOPES Volume III.
       8.14.10.2. The TPFDD LOI contains specific direction for supporting commands on
       validation procedures.
       8.14.10.3. During execution, movement data within a TPFDD must be validated in order
       to schedule strategic transportation. "Validate" in this context is defined in joint
       publications as: "Execution procedure used by combatant command components,
       supporting combatant commanders, and providing organizations to confirm to the
       supported commander that all the information records in a TPFDD are not only error-
       free, but also accurately reflect the current status, attributes (lower level personnel and
       cargo data), and availability of units and requirements".
8.15. Force Reporting. The actual units sourced in a plan must be registered in GSORTS. All
Air Force units should be registered in SORTS and those with postured UTCs will report the
readiness status of their UTCs in accordance with AFI 10-244. Units will measure and report
Category Levels (C-Levels) in SORTS in accordance with AFI 10-201.
   8.15.1. For non-SORTS reporting units, a situation report (SITREP) and ART will be used
   to monitor their deployability readiness and status. Actual units may be designated during
   either Phase III or V of CAP, if not previously designated during contingency planning.
   SORTS is designed to be able to provide the data specified in CJCSM 3150.01A as a result
   of its interface with JOPES. Thus, all force requirement numbers in the OPLAN TPFDD are
   matched to actual units or parent commands reported in SORTS.
   8.15.2. SORTS reporting provides C-Levels, which reflect the resources and training for the
   full capability of a given unit. Therefore, availability of specific resources may not be
 224                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   sufficiently reflected if a unit is tasked for one or more smaller UTC packages. The
   availability and readiness of a specific UTC within the unit is reported in ART.
   8.15.3. Provisional units that must be constituted or reconstituted specifically to meet the
   requirements of an operation are registered by the gaining MAJCOM and reported in SORTS
   as soon as they are activated. Mobilized units constituted or reconstituted specifically to meet
   the requirements of an operation are reported in SORTS as soon as they are activated.
8.16. TPFDD Letter of Instruction. As stated in paragraph 8.8.2, component headquarters
planners must ensure that certain Service-specific information is included in a TPFFD LOI. The
LOI addresses Service unique methods and procedures that will enhance TPFDD management.
Additionally, the LOI will be written to prevent the use of generic guidance that can be deemed
as open for interpretation.
   8.16.1. The LOI identifies certain Air Force processes and standard procedures to be used in
   developing and executing the TPFDD in support of specific operations.
   8.16.2. The LOI is directive and applies to supported Service components, and force
   providing organizations/agencies throughout the Air Force Planning and Execution
   Community during both deployment and redeployment operations.
   8.16.3. Detailed instructions for requesting unlocking of transportation-validated ULNs for
   re-sourcing.
   8.16.4. The component headquarters must ensure the following information, as a minimum,
   is included in a TPFDD LOI:
       8.16.4.1. All transportation routing data to include GEOLOCs, Mode/Source and priority
       of air and sea movement for Air Force units.
       8.16.4.2. Allocation of transportation assets, specifically, common user assets (known as
       strategic lift) are highly fluid and intensely dynamic at the execution of a TPFDD.
       Component headquarters is responsible for detailing rules sets that explain GEOLOCs,
       Mode/Source and priority of air and sea movement (to include C Dates). Movement of
       forces is subject to change until scheduled for movement by USTRANSCOM.
       8.16.4.3. Allocation of air and sealift capability between Service components and
       resupply/rotation/sustainment needs.
       8.16.4.4. Standard time windows for re-supply and information relevant to sustainment
       planning in the TPFDD.
       8.16.4.5. TPFDD maintenance instructions and Security Classification Guidance.
       8.16.4.6. Applicable C Dates to include specific combatant commander’s RDD and
       reference start time of the TPFDD.
       8.16.4.7. Ensure compliance with JOPESREP force requirement and routing data to
       include time phasing according to procedures in JOPESREP.
       8.16.4.8. TPFDD points of contact. Detailed requirements and reporting
       methods/standards for POCs from component headquarters functional areas (i.e. FAMS,
       Manpower/Personnel: A1, Operations: A3, Logistics: A4, etc); MAJCOMs (i.e. FAMs,
       CAT POCs,); wing-level 24-hour POC, etc.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            225


       8.16.4.9. Specific ULN construct and allocation for AEF combat forces and
       accompanying ECS/ BOS to include format for FRN construction and if applicable,
       specified FRAG logic.
       8.16.4.10. USTRANSCOM and Combatant Command standard POEs and PODs for
       forces, as well as methods and process for deviations (e.g.. component headquarters
       selection of POEs in lieu of providing organization’s selection).
       8.16.4.11. The supporting PIDs (e.g. Service slices) must be included in the Supported
       Command’s TPFDD LOI.
8.17. Transportation Feasibility of TPFDDs
   8.17.1. Early Injection of Transportation Expertise. To assist in initial planning,
   USTRANSCOM will deploy flyaway teams to help combatant commanders in the early
   stages of Crisis Action Planning. Collaborating with the planners from the beginning will
   overcome many problems and streamline the process.
   8.17.2. Timely Submission of Movement Requirements. Component headquarters will need
   to determine with the supporting and supported command the best method to ensure timely
   validation of a requirement to USTRANSCOM to include all available modes of
   transportation.
   8.17.3. Mode/Source Analysis and Recomme ndation. The most effective measure for
   USTRANSCOM to determine transportation solutions is early identification of requirements,
   supported command RDD, and early collaboration with transportation/mobility planners.
   8.17.4. Flexible Validation. Flexible validation of requirements primarily deals with changes
   to Mode/Source that drive changes to C-dates and POE/POD. Knowing the requirement early
   on, the RDD, and being involved in the initial stages of the planning process will facilitate
   the validation process as well as reduce the amount of changes in Mode/Source.
8.18. TPFDD Maintenance. This section provides instructions for maintaining the TPFDD
data of contingency OPLANs. It primarily addresses Plan Identifications (PIDs), force modules
(FMs), Unit Line Numbers (ULNs), Unit Type Codes (UTCs) and data elements that make up
the requirements. The Supported Command will publish operation or exercise-specific data
management instruction in a Supplemental TPFDD LOI that details maintenance requirements
for a given TPFDD.
   8.18.1. TPFDD maintenance is essential and mandatory in accordance with this instruction
   and joint publications. The supported component headquarters is responsible for ensuring
   detailed instructions to include security classification guidance are provided to HAF FAMs
   and planners for effective and efficient maintenance of any variation of a TPFDD (i.e.
   contingency and execution TPFDDs).
   8.18.2. FAMS and planners must ensure that accurate and valid UTCs are used when
   maintaining a TPFDD. Accurate Air Force data is essential for managing the updates and
   changes to unit level data in support of a TPFDD. This will include UTC posturing and
   availability in accordance with Chapter 7 of this instruction.
   8.18.3. TPFDD maintenance will be accomplished under the following circumstances:
 226                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       8.18.3.1. The supported Combatant Command determines that TPFDD maintenance is
       required (this includes USTRANSCOM maintenance requirement).
       8.18.3.2. The component headquarters feels it is necessary.
       8.18.3.3. If directed by AF/A5XW.
       8.18.3.4. A year has passed since the last review/TPFDD update.
8.19. Contingency Plan TPFDD Maintenance. For Contingency Plan TPFDDs, the Air Force
portion will be maintained under a separate JOPES PID on the component headquarters’ GCCS
host database and updated as required. Updates can be as dynamic as daily and as deliberate as
annually. This is known as the "Air Force slice" referring to a TPFDD owned by the combatant
commander containing only Air Force requirements.
   8.19.1. All Services have a "Service slice" that is maintained and managed by the respective
   component. The component headquarters will ensure appropriate level of access and
   permissions are granted to MAJCOMs and force providers to facilitate specified
   maintenance.
   8.19.2. These slices will provide current and updated capabilities (UTCs), correctly postured
   and available to support an executable Contingency Plan TPFDD.
   8.19.3. Not only is this Air Force slice used at execution, it can be used by MAJCOMs and
   component headquarters for unit training requirements, exercises and evaluations.
   8.19.4. (Added-AFGSC) When contacted by TPFDD owner to review and provide updated
   capabilities data, AFGSC/A3B will coordinate with applicable FAMs for review, update, and
   approval of their plan contribution. Once A3B compiles all comments they will provide one
   consolidated AFGSC response for updates to the TPFDD.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            227

                           FORCE ROTATION MANAGEMENT

Section 9A—Purpose

9.1. Purpose. To articulate the methodology, policies, rules, and procedures the Air Force uses
to meet and sustain combatant commander mission needs while maintaining the AEF battle
rhythm. This chapter also identifies the organizations and considerations involved in planning
and preparing deployable combat capabilities and is applicable to scheduled and tasked to deploy
forces.

Section 9B—Background

9.2. Force Presence. The U.S. Air Force supports Joint Force Commander (JFC) requirements
through a combination of assigned, attached (rotational), and mobility forces that may be
forward deployed, transient, or operating from home station. The USAF presents required
capabilities to the Joint Force Commander (JFC) as an AETF. The AETF can be task organized
as a NEAF, AEW, AEG or AES, depending on mission requirements. The central management,
scheduling, and use of these forces in support of all combatant commander requirements is
vetted and arbitrated via the Global Force Management Board (GFMB) and SecDef and outlined
in the GFM Implementation Guidance (GFMIG).
9.3. Air Force Sourcing and Tasking Priority. The Air Force uses the following priorities
when responding to and supporting deployment taskings whether one time fills or rotational.
These priorities also apply when submitting reclamas for shortfalls.
   9.3.1. Meeting validated combatant commander requirements and deployed commanders
   involved in real-world contingencies in support of an authorized Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
   Staff (CJCS) order; following Force Allocation Decision Model (FADM) and Guidance for
   Employment of the Force (GEF) prioritization guidelines.
   9.3.2. Meeting requirements of combatant commands and deployed commanders involved in
   JCS exercises.
   9.3.3. Supporting Air Force level exercises.
   9.3.4. Supporting MAJCOM exercises and inspections.
   9.3.5. Meeting Numbered Air Force (NAF) level exercises.
   9.3.6. Meeting and supporting wing and group-level exercises and events.
   9.3.7. Assisting other commands with manning assistance.

Section 9C—Guidance

9.4. Force Rotation Planning. Force rotational plans support the GFM requirement of an
immediate executable schedule. The AEF construct, with its five tempo bands, is the Air Force
methodology of meeting existing and emerging worldwide CCDR requirements as depicted in
the SecDef-approved GFMAP. CJCS orders to the supported commander, supporting
 228                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


commanders, and Services initiate such operations. These orders define plan details and
requirements to accomplish the mission and authority to deploy forces. In accordance with
CJCSM 3122.02C, such orders will specify weapons systems and a description of the ECS
capability needed to sustain the operation. Additional orders may need to be issued when an
operation becomes a rotational mission and the Air Force, as a Service, or all force providing
combatant commanders are not identified to support. The supported component headquarters, in
coordination with AFPC/DPW, is responsible for preparing the force rotation plan and ensuring
the plan is time-phased to meet the AEF battle rhythm. The component headquarters will
coordinate with AFPC/DPW to identify UTC capabilities from the AETF force modules and
UTC Availability necessary to sustain the crisis operation and transition from crisis to rotational
operations. A CJCS DEPORD, and ensuing AFEXORD, will be used to task and deploy USAF
forces for each AEF rotation. The supported component headquarters will not source a
requirement identified in the force rotation TPFDD.
   9.4.1. Defining Rotational Requirements. Deployed commanders and component
   headquarters constantly evaluate their ability to execute their missions based on the forces in
   theater. When there is a change to the deployed unit’s mission, equipment or weapons
   system, operating location, or a reduction in forces, the deployed commander will evaluate
   the impact and notify the component headquarters of needed changes via either an
   authorization change request (ACR) or a request for forces/request for capability (RFF/RFC).
   See paragraph 9.4.2. and Figure 9.1 for the ACR process. Component headquarters must
   reflect changes in mission requirements as part of their annual rotational requirements
   submission; components must communicate and receive feedback with tactical commanders
   in validating current requirements. Components must also coordinate with applicable HAF
   FAM and/or lead MAJCOM/agency to consider changes in force composition and
   availability.
       9.4.1.1. The first priority of the component headquarters FAM is to use standard UTCs
       postured in the UTC Availability to expedite timely sourcing and minimize tailoring
       actions. If the desired UTC is not postured in the UTC Availability, consider a suitable
       standard UTC in the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK). Standard
       UTCs may be reasonably tailored, if necessary. As a last resort, use a non-standard UTC
       (i.e., "Z99"). Note: A "ZZZ" non-standard UTC is not deployable and cannot be used. If
       the requirement is projected to become rotational, the AEFC scheduler should refer the
       requirement to the Air Staff FAM to determine if a new UTC should be developed.
       9.4.1.2. New rotational requirements will be scheduled per 9.9.6 For IA requirements,
       reference 9.4.3.3
   9.4.2. Authorization Change Request (ACR). The ACR is used to explain changes or a
   deletion to the deployed commander’s mission needs in support of an executed deployment
   order (DEPORD). The ACR will cite all original and new UTC and TPFDD level-4 detail.
   All changes will include a Command Remark Code (CRC) to indicate whether the estimated
   tour length (ETL) may be split to facilitate the support of Air Reserve Component (ARC)
   forces, see Table 9.1 If prohibited, the deployed commander will include justification
   explaining why the ETL cannot be split.
       9.4.2.1. The deployed unit commander will submit the request to the applicable
       component headquarters A1 for validation. Supported component will ensure the request
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              229


        meets the following criteria: (1) is a modification to an existing GFMAP-approved
        requirement, (2) is in support of an Air Force component requirement (i.e., not a JET
        requirement), and (3) is fewer than the lesser of 10 persons or 10 percent of a functional
        area of an existing FTN already authorized by SecDef. If the AFFOR/A1 does not
        validate the ACR, the request is sent back to the requestor to resubmit as an RFF/RFC.
        9.4.2.2. The supported component will forward all validated ACRs to applicable AF FP
        for action. AF FP will coordinate request with applicable MAJCOM and/or HAF FAMs.
        If AF FP disapproves request, they will notify supported component A1 to initiate request
        via RFF process. If request is approved, the supported component headquarters will
        update the TPFDD using the appropriate ULN construct and forward a copy of the ACR
        to AFPC/DPW for update of the master rotational TPFDD (Note: ACRs changing ETLs
        to greater than 179 days will be in accordance with paragraph 9.11.1.).
        9.4.2.3. If the ACR is enduring, the supported component will include as a requirement
        in the subsequent FY GFM requirements submission.
           9.4.2.3.1. If changes are made to a requirement after the force provider verified the
           tasking, the verification code must be removed. This will allow the MAJCOM the
           opportunity to examine the changes and ensure the originally sourced unit can meet
           the new requirements or can fill tasking with another unit within the timeframe. If
           applicable, AFPC/DPW should inform component headquarters that change in
           requirement may result in a delay in filling the new requirement.

  9.4.3. Individual Augmentation (IA) Requirements. Individual Augmentation is a joint term
  and process described by CJCSI 1301.01C. Individual Augmentation represents unfunded
  temporary duty positions (military or civilian) requested to augment a supported combatant
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            231


   commander's or governmental agency’s staff operations during contingencies. Similar to
   requests for forces (RFFs) in support of contingencies, IA requirements are inherently
   temporary in nature and are not to be used to solve permanent manning or capability
   shortages. They are not to be used to source joint training or exercise requirements. [Note:
   For the remainder of this paragraph and subparagraphs, the term "Supported Command" is
   intended to mean a supported combatant commander, the supported component headquarters,
   or a governmental agency approved by the Joint Staff to receive IA support from the
   Services]. Supported Commands must first evaluate their ability to fulfill contingency staff
   requirements using organic/ assigned manpower; only then should they request IA support to
   cover any identified mission gaps. Once the supported commander develops, validates and
   forwards an IA Joint Manning Document (JMD) to the Joint Staff, the Joint Staff initiates the
   prioritization and sourcing process described in CJCSI 1301.01C, and the Air Force sources
   IA requirements it commits to or is directed to. Figure 9.2 depicts Individual Augmentee
   sourcing procedures in accordance with CJCSI 1301.01C and internal Air Force procedures.

Figure 9.1. Authorization Change Request (ACR) Process.




      9.4.3.1. IA Requirements Development and Service Allocation. Individual
      Augmentation requirements for a particular joint operation and organization are
      developed by the supported commander, associated with the appropriate TPFDD, and
      assigned to Services for fill as a Joint Action tasking in accordance with CJCSI
      1301.01C. Supported commanders will make every attempt to synchronize the RDD/DRI
      with the AEF pivot date and also maximize the notification time afforded deploying
      members. The Joint Staff relays validated joint IA requirements for Air Force fill (via a
      JMD formatted per CJCSI 1301.01C) to the Air Force Joint Action Coordinating Office
232                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      (JACO) in AF/A5XJ as a Joint Action. Upon accepting the Joint Action tasking, the
      JACO relays the AF’s slice of the IA JMD and the associated Joint Action instructions to
      the HAF Crisis Action Team Manpower & Personnel Readiness Center (AFCAT-MPRC)
      for further processing. If the AFCAT-MPRC is not activated, AF/A1PR assumes all
      MPRC duties in these paragraphs.
      9.4.3.2. Air Force Review of IA Requirements. Upon receipt of the Joint Action from
      the JACO, the MPRC performs an initial JMD “scrub” to ensure format/content
      compliance with CJCSI 1301.01C. The MPRC then relays the JMD to the AEFC and
      affected HAF FAMs for detailed review and analysis. The AEFC, with HAF FAM and
      MPRC assistance, works with the Joint Staff and supported commander to resolve any
      requirements discrepancies or ambiguities, makes a preliminary determination regarding
      the Air Force’s ability to source and sustain the requirements if rotations are authorized,
      and forwards its analysis back to the MPRC. With this information, the MPRC, working
      with JACO, develops and coordinates a formal Air Force position and response to the
      Joint Staff, typically in the form of an Air Force Planner’s Memo (AFPM), Air Force
      OpsDep Memo (AFODM), or CSAF Memo (CSAFM), as determined by the JACO.
      Upon compiling Service positions regarding their ability to source and sustain the
      requirements, the Joint Staff may choose to convene a Prioritization and Sourcing
      Review Board (PSRB) to address Service or supported commander issues/concerns,
      broker IA sourcing solutions, and/or elevate unresolved sourcing issues within the
      OPSDEP and JCS Tank structure (see CJCSI1301.01C). The Air Force Planner
      (AF/A5XJ) is the formal Air Force representative in all PSRBs and will be assisted by the
      MPRC, the AEFC and HAF FAM representatives as appropriate. Once PSRB issues are
      resolved, the Joint Staff secures formal tasking of the Services to fill their allocated IA
      requirements.
      9.4.3.3. IA Rotational Tour Lengths. IA rotational tours lengths will be in accordance
      with AEF rotation policy and IA Business Rules. Longer tour lengths may be approved
      by CSAF or as delegated. SecDef-approved tour lengths are posted in the Global Force
      Management Allocation Plan, Annex D. tour lengths are posted in the Global Force
      Management Allocation Plan, Annex D.
         9.4.3.3.1. The supported commander may request longer/non-standard IA tour
         lengths to meet position continuity or other requirements. The request must include
         the positions and justification. The requesting command submits the request to the
         Joint Staff who tasks Air Force to respond via AF/A5XJ (JACO) office. The JACO
         assigns an Air Staff OPR and OCRs to evaluate the request and develop an Air Force
         position. The OPR documents the Air Force position in an Air Force Policy Memo
         (AFPM) and Joint Action Brief Sheet (JABS). The AFPM and JABS are routed
         through A3O and A3/5 for CSAF decision. Note: This paragraph only addresses non-
         standard tour length requirements based on supported commander requests; not
         internal Air Force decisions to extend ETLs, e.g., to meet surge requirements or
         manage operationally stressed AFSCs.
         9.4.3.3.2. Out of cycle requests. When the initial required delivery date (RDD)
         cannot be met, or the ETL does not meet warfighter requirements, AFPC/DPW,
         component headquarters, and supporting MAJCOM (if known) will coordinate
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           233


         resolution. Tour length options for IA requirements follow the same prioritization as
         UTC requirements outlined in section 9.9.6.

             Subsequent rotations will continue to be sourced out-of-cycle from AEF block
             pivot date.
     9.4.3.4. IA Sourcing Procedures. Once the supported commander, Joint Staff and the
     Service(s) agree to the sourcing commitments, the supported component headquarters
     ensures the requirements are entered in the appropriate TPFDD for sourcing and
     identifies the tasking type as IA. The requirement(s) will use standard UTCs to the
     maximum extent possible. The use of non-standard "Z99" UTCs is only authorized when
     standard tailored UTCs cannot match the requirement(s). AFPC/DPW will source these
     requirements using the MilPDS sourcing method outlined in Chapter 14.
         9.4.3.4.1. DELETED.
     9.4.3.5. Eliminating Longstanding or Recurring IA Requirements. Given the nature
     of Individual Augmentation, IA requirements, once validated and sourced, can become
     longstanding or "perpetual" if no mechanism exists to review them on a recurring basis
     and remove them once they are no longer required. CJCSI 1301.01C requires the
     "supported commander" to review and revalidate IA requirements every 12 months;
     however, it is also incumbent upon the Air Force to establish trigger points that drive an
     internal review of IA requirements on a recurring basis, in which longstanding
     requirements are either eliminated or converted to permanent positions. It is the
     responsibility of the HAF IA cell (AF/A1PRO), in coordination with HAF FAMs,
     component headquarters, AF/A1MR and the AEFC, to develop and manage this process.
     9.4.3.6. IA Requests Not IAW CJCSI 1301.01C. To ensure global visibility and
     centralized management of all joint IA requirements, any requests for IA support that are
     not sent by a supported commander via the Joint Staff to the Services in accordance with
     CJCSI 1301.01C should not be supported by the AF. Air Force offices aware of such
     requests should redirect the requestor to the Joint Staff/J1 for further processing.
  9.4.4. Non-Rotational Requirements/Temporary Line Numbers. Non-Rotational
  Requirements/ Temporary line numbers are normally the result of nonrecurring mission or
  workload increases that can be resolved with additional manpower or equipment for short
  durations. The deployed commander will evaluate the mission impact and send a request to
  the component headquarters with the needed workload, through the deployed Manpower
  function. The request must contain all TPFDD level-4, line-level detail to include purpose of
 234                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   TDY. Component headquarters will approve or disapprove all change requests, enter the
   requirement into the TPFDD using appropriate ULN construct, and forward the request to the
   AEFC as quickly as possible to allow for timely sourcing. Note: Non-mission or by name
   TLNs will be filled by the component headquarters directorate of personnel.
   9.4.5. Permanent Party Billets. When permanent party billets replace rotational
   requirements, the component headquarters deletes the rotational requirement with the
   effective date to coincide with the arrival of the permanent party member. All such actions
   will be closely coordinated with the AEFC to ensure deployments are properly terminated.
   Permanent party billets include those rotational requirements that are outsourced and
   supported by a contractor force. Once outsourced these requirements must be removed from
   the rotational PID.
   9.4.6. Intercommand Manning Assistance. U.S. Air Force MAJCOMs will occasionally
   face temporary, operations staff or unit manning requirements, CONUS or OCONUS, that
   are not associated with a combatant commander's TPFDD or PID and for which the
   MAJCOM does not posses the internal (intracommand) personnel resources to satisfy them.
   Validation of these requirements is a shared responsibility between the requesting
   (supported) MAJCOM and affected HAF FAMs. If the requirement is approved, it is filled in
   accordance with AF/A1 policy.
9.5. AEF Pivot Date. The AEF pivot date is the date each AEF deployment begins. The AEF
pivot date is normally the 15th day of the first month of the AEF deployment eligibility window.
The transportation movement window is 15-days on either side of the AEF pivot date (i.e., AEF
1 & 2 pivot date is 15 May. Transportation movement window begins 1 May and ends 30 May.)
The AEFC commander establishes the AEF pivot date for use by all agencies responsible for the
planning and scheduling of AEF resources (ECS and aviation). The AEFC commander may
change the pivot date when necessary.
   9.5.1. Rotation of Airmen (ROA) Template. The AEFC will work to phase all deploying
   ECS forces into the deployed location within the 30-day movement window to the maximum
   extent possible. Note: If initial requirement is delivered outside of the AEF movement
   window, it will be phased into the window during subsequent AEF rotations. Key and
   essential personnel, such as commanders and vice/deputy commanders would move into a
   deployed location during the first 8 days of the movement window. Remaining personnel will
   have their RDDs adjusted or realigned to rotate approximately one third of the force in 7-day
   intervals over 21 days. This ROA Template is designed to deliver forces in stable and
   predictable pattern to support the warfighter. It will also provide deploying commanders
   insight into what capabilities are scheduled into their units during the critical AEF transition
   through the unit change of command. Aviation and direct support aviation support UTCs,
   Individual Augmentees, and permanent party are currently excluded from the ROA
   Template, but will be taken into consideration.

9.6. AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks Timeline. To ensure the Air Force is ready for each AEF
rotation, AFPC/DPW will distribute an AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks message outlining critical
tasks to be accomplished by responsible OPRs approximately 9 months prior to the AEF
vulnerability start date. All component headquarters and MAJCOMs are required to adhere to the
milestones in this message to ensure the development/modification of the ECS CPS (see
paragraph 9.24) and orderly presentation of capability to the combatant commanders. The
timeline may be compressed for crisis action TPFDDs and during periods of deviation from the
normal AEF battle rhythm. Each AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks message with corresponding
timeline will be posted on the AEF Operations NIPR and SIPR web site.
9.6. (AFGSC)AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks Timeline. AFGSC/A3CW will distribute the
AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks Timeline for each rotation to AFGSC FAMs and IDRCs for
situational awareness. Once all reviews are completed AFGSC A3CW will analyze and obtain
HQ AFGSC 2-Ltr review and provide a consolidated ECS CPS response to AFPC/DPW IAW
timelines established.
   9.6.1. Force Rotational TPFDDs. Component headquarters that require AEF scheduled
   forces are required to synchronize the building of requirements with the AEF battle rhythm.
   Use of the appropriate AEF ULN is mandatory when transitioning to force rotation support.
236                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      9.6.1.1. The AEFC builds the rotational requirements into the appropriate PIDs, and
      provides them to the supported component headquarters for approval, prior to each AEF
      rotation consistent with the AEFC timeline. Additional capability or changes to existing
      requirements can be generated by an ACR, a new or modified DEPORD, or a vetted
      PSRB action, in paragraph 9.9.6 (for IAs, see paragraph 9.4.3.1). Deletions will be
      submitted immediately upon determination that the capability is no longer required.
  9.6.2. Master Rotational TPFDDs. AFPC/DPW will maintain a master rotational TPFDD
  for each theater employing AEF scheduled forces. Once an operation’s initial response has
  transitioned to rotational and met guidelines for sourcing with AEF scheduled forces,
  AFPC/DPW will capture requirements in the master rotational TPFDD and perform daily
  analysis to maintain them.
      9.6.2.1. Establishing Rotational Operations. A component headquarters must identify
      requirements that necessitate sustained rotation support to the AEFC, AFCAT (AFOG)
      and AF/A3/5. The AEFC will incorporate new requirements into the master rotational
      TPFDD.
      9.6.2.2. Rotational Criteria. All requirements must meet the following rotational
      criteria:
         9.6.2.2.1. Established supported combatant commander rotational requirement.
         9.6.2.2.2. Requirement expected to exist for greater than one calendar year.
         9.6.2.2.3. Must have a executable TPFDD networked.

      9.6.2.4. Inclusion in AEF Schedule
         9.6.2.4.1. The component headquarters provides a message with reporting and
         funding instructions, estimated tour lengths, and classification guidance, as a
         minimum.
         9.6.2.4.2. The component headquarters translates requirements into standard UTCs to
         the maximum extent possible and ensures the TPFDD(s) are made
         available/networked for access by the AEFC and Air Force force providers.
  9.6.3. Non-standard UTC Requests. Supported component is responsible for translating
  CCDR requirements by identifying the functional area most capable of providing requested
  capability. The supported component FAM must coordinate with the applicable AF FP
  and/or HAF FAM in determining the UTCs/AFSCs that best fulfill the desired requirement.
  If the CCDR’s requested capability is so broad in scope that multiple or any functional area
  can fill the requirement, the component may use non-standard UTC 9AZ99 with reporting
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               237


   identifier 99A0 (officers) or 9U100 (enlisted) to identify the requirement (see paragraph
   9.9.1.8. (warfighting units) and 14.6.2.3.3. (institutional force) for guidance on sourcing “any
   AFSC” requirements). When describing “any AFSC” requirements, supported component
   FAMs, in coordination with HAF and/or AF FP FAMs, should use line remarks to better
   define the requirement
      9.6.3.1. If the requirement is projected to become rotational, the AEFC scheduler(s), in
      coordination with the component headquarters FAM(s), should refer the requirement to
      the Air Staff FAM to determine if a new UTC should be developed.
      9.6.3.2. The Air Staff FAM will work unresolved non-standard UTC issues within their
      functional area chain of command.
      9.6.3.3. AF/A5XW, as Air Staff Office of FAM Oversight (OFAMO), will adjudicate
      any unresolved cross-functional non-standard UTC issues, if required.

and each AEF rotation. AEF Cycle tasks are outlined in paragraph 2.4.3 AEF rotation tasks and
timelines are outlined below. Air Force planners and commanders, as well as AF, MAJCOM,
and component headquarters FAMs must ensure their actions are completed in accordance with
published timelines.

   9.7.6. AEF Association Review. Unit commanders must remain aware of which AEF their
   UTCs are expected to deploy by periodically analyzing the UTC Availability. A subsequent
   review of personnel AEF association, as denoted by AEF Indicator (AEFI) in MilPDS,
   should also be conducted to ensure sufficient numbers and types of personnel are associated
   to the same AEF(s) as the postured UTCs. See paragraph 14.4.1 on rule sets for changing an
   individual’s AEFI.
   9.7.6. (AFGSC) Unit commanders will review AEFIs association of assigned personnel at
   the same time the Posturing Code (P-Code) review is conducted. (NLT 180 days prior to the
   start of each AEF rotation, see AFI 10-401 paragraph 9.7.7) AEFIs should also be reviewed
   upon gaining personnel to the unit, and/or upon HAF-directed change to AEF banding for the
   applicable career to ensure the individuals AEF association to assigned UTCs or the X Band,
   as applicable, is correct. Missing or incorrect AEFIs will be corrected and submitted by the
   unit to the IPR office for update in MilPDS. After 15 days upon signing into the base, if the
   AEFI is still missing, the member is considered eligible for any AEF deployment tasking
   until their AEFI is loaded into MILPDS. If a member receives an AEF tasking due to a
   missing AEFI, the tasking is considered valid due to information available at the time of
   sourcing.
   9.7.7. Posturing Code (P-Code) Review. UTC posturing codes should be reviewed by the
   unit and FAMs and adjustments made NLT 180 days prior to the start of each AEF rotation.
   The appropriate coding of UTCs should be done in accordance with Chapter 7, taking into
   consideration the AEF deployment period(s) the unit is expected to deploy. Changes to UTC
   P-codes will not be made to justify manpower programming actions (such as PEC changes)
   nor will it be used as justification to cancel pending or potential Competitive Sourcing &
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             239


  Privatization (CS&P) actions. However, approved CS&P may be used to justify the
  adjustment of UTC posturing codes throughout the gradual phase out of the unit’s manpower
  authorizations.
  9.7.7. (AFGSC) AFGSC FAMs review UTC posturing codes for their functional area prior
  to the start of the AEF Schedule and coordinates with the affected units. AFGSC FAMs
  provide UTC changes to HQ AFGSC/A3CW to update UTA NLT 9 months prior to the start
  of each AEF Vulnerability Period.
  9.7.8. Rotational Requirements Review. Supported component headquarters will
  continually review the rotational requirements throughout their area of responsibility with the
  goal of meeting the combatant commander’s needs with the fewest forces possible. This
  evaluation will take place throughout the AEF cycle. However, component headquarters will
  officially revalidate requirements as part of the GFMAP PLANORD process. In validating
  requirements, components ensure ECS and aviation requirements are stated using standard
  UTCs; where possible, restrictive line remarks are reduced or eliminated; and all
  requirements have a Command Remark (CRM) code in the line-level detail..
  9.7.9. MAJCOM Forward Operating Location (FOL) Alignment Template. The
  purpose of the MAJCOM FOL Alignment Template is to synchronize the sourcing of ECS
  UTCs across all functional areas thereby facilitating the Air Force’s teaming objectives. The
  FOL Alignment template is developed by AFPC/DPW and approved by the ECS SIPT
  approximately 10 months prior to the start of each FY AEF Schedule. MAJCOMs
  recommending changes to the FOL Alignment Template must remain aware of the AF's
  teaming objective. Working within GFM timeline, HAF and/or MAJCOM FAMs, in
  coordination with AFPC functional scheduler, may modify the initial sourcing solution and
  deviate from the FOL Alignment Template on approval from their Functional Director. No
  waiver is required for a functional area to modify the FOL alignment; approval is delegated
  to Functional Directors. Modifications must be provided prior to ECS CPS approval (see
  paragraph 9.24 plus subparagraphs).
  9.7.10. Scheduling AEF Airlift Missions for Rotating Passengers. AMC Tanker Airlift
  Control Center (TACC) purchases and publishes passenger bookable contingency missions
  for rotating ECS passengers. The use of these designated missions ensures solid in-transit
  visibility of personnel on Unit Line Numbers moving in and out of the theater in support of
  rotational taskings. It also ensures optimum use of Air Force dollars by ensuring the
  maximum numbers of seats are filled by deploying forces. Component headquarters provide
  TACC validated data for mission purchase NLT 75-days prior to the start of each AEF
  movement window. TACC uses this information to update the Global Air Transportation
  Execution System (GATES) with bookable AEF missions NLT 45-days prior to the start of
  each AEF movement window. The Installation Deployment Readiness Cell (IDRC) will
  provide a TPFDD extract of mode/source to the Installation Transportation Management
  Flight (TMF). The TPFDD extract will prevent TMFs from double booking mode/source AK
  (i.e. via strategic AMC/AMC-contracted aircraft) passengers on mode/source AC (i.e. via
  Supporting Commander channel aircraft) missions. Mode/source AK passengers are booked
  by TACC from the designated APOE. If necessary, IDOs will direct the TMF to arrange
  commercial airline travel to the APOE only. If the Mode/Source is AC, the TMF will book
  passengers on missions loaded in the Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES)
  to meet their DRI at the end destination. This entails getting the individuals to the theater
 240                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   APOD by the LAD in order to meet the RDD/DRI at the end destination. TMFs should use
   F94* missions loaded in GATES if they’re provided by TACC/XOP prior to booking on the
   typical Patriot Express (PE) missions. The F94* missions are purchased specifically to
   augment the AEF deployment for AC passengers. TMF personnel need to book AC
   passengers when they receive the tasking from the IDO, this can be up to 60-days out, in
   order to ensure each person deploy ing gets a seat on aircraft. The TMF must have the 5 or 7
   digit ULN and final destination from the PRF before making any reservation in GATES.
9.8. Sourcing Considerations and Guidelines. For warfighting organizations, it is imperative
that owning MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, accurately posture their UTCs, align them in the
correct AEF block/pair, accurately P-Code them, and accurately assess their readiness using the
AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART) (see Chapter 7). AFPC/DPW makes sourcing decisions using
this communicated UTC status. Inaccuracies ultimately delay the timely notification of
deployment taskings to a unit and its personnel. Unless specifically stipulated otherwise (e.g. in
FAM guidance), all force rotational and temporary requirements are sourced and/or un-sourced
by AFPC/DPW using UTCs aligned to the applicable AEF blocks/pairs in UTC Availability.
   9.8.1. Force providers may provide alternative sourcing to the unit originally sourced by
   AEF Operations using the Reclama Processing Tool (RPT) to initiate UIC changes (see
   paragraph 10.21.1.1.). The replacement UIC should be from the same eligibility period, and
   when possible, follow AEF Operations teaming construct as outlined in paragraph 8.12. AEF
   Operations will change the UIC in the TPFDD.
   9.8.2. When the on-call AEF library does not reflect the stated requirement, the AEFC will
   recommend a suitable substitute UTC or combination of UTCs that meet the capability
   requested by the component headquarters. Substituted UTC capability must be coordinated
   with the component headquarters by the AEFC before sourcing. The component headquarters
   must approve the use of any substitute UTC before placement in the TPFDD. Component
   headquarters approved substitutions must be reflected in the JOPES/DCAPES record to
   document authorized changes and to ensure that the tasked unit provides the requested
   capability. AEFC will also source temporary TRANSCOM pop-up requirements according to
   the AEF schedule from residual AEF forces. The following considerations and guidelines are
   used during the sourcing process.
9.9. UTC Sourcing Process. AFPC/DPW coordinates Air Force sourcing of all forces to ensure
the Air Force is able to immediately determine its level of committed forces, its residual
capability available to meet the next national security objective, and when it is about to exhaust a
particular capability. The following paragraphs outline the UTC sourcing process; sourcing
individuals using MilPDS is outlined in Chapter 14.
   9.9.1. ECS Sourcing. The basis of ECS sourcing is the ECS CPS (see paragraph 9.24).
   Once requirements are approved via GFMAP process, AFPC/DPW will migrate ECS CPS
   data from the planning PID to the execution PID no later than 210 days prior to the start of
   the first FY AEF rotation and notify force providers via newsgroup to initiate verification
   actions (see paragraph 8.14.9.). All UTCs in the on-call AEF blocks are considered for
   sourcing utilizing the ECS SIPT-approved ECS CPS business rules. AFPC/DPW sources for
   crisis operation requirements immediately upon receipt of the requirement and authorization
   by the approval authority to use AEF-scheduled forces to support the operation. Once
   approved in a GFMAP mod, AFPC/DPW will notify MAJCOMs via newsgroup to initiate
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         241


  verification actions. Note: MAJCOMs are not required to wait until AFPC/DPW publishes
  newsgroup notice to verify ULN; however, timeline for verification will begin effective the
  date associated with newsgroup notification.

         9.9.1.1.6. DELETED.
     9.9.1.2. Senior Officer Sourcing Procedures. For the purpose of sourcing, a senior
     officer is defined as a colonel or general officer. The AEFC sources senior officer
     requirements for rotational operations, JCS/joint exercise requirements, and crisis
     operation requirements as follows. The exception is Air and Space Operations Center/Air
     Force forces (AOC/AFFOR) and medical officer requirements.
         9.9.1.2.1. General Officer Scheduling. The AEFC identifies general officer
         requirements directly to the Air Force Colonel's management Office (AF/A1O)
         General Officer’s Group. AF/A1O will provide a name and Unit Identification Code
         (UIC) to the AEFC for sourcing. The AEFC coordinates with the owning MAJCOM
         A1O staff to obtain MAJCOM CC or CV (2-digit at the Air Staff) concurrence and
         with the component headquarters directorate of personnel for COMAFFOR/Deputy
         COMAFFOR approval.
         9.9.1.2.2. Colonel Scheduling. In a 20 June 2002 memorandum to MAJCOM CCs,
         CSAF designated the MAJCOM senior leader management office (A1O) as the
         functional manager for all deployment requirements for colonels assigned to their
         MAJCOM with the following exceptions.
            9.9.1.2.2.1. For the ANG, the AEFC works with the NGB/A3X. For
            Headquarters Air Force (HAF) personnel, AF/A3OTA, the 11th Wing, and HAF
            functional area managers are the coordinating agencies.
            9.9.1.2.2.2. For very small career fields, the AEFC will work directly with force
            providing functional area manager to source billets.
            9.9.1.2.2.3. Once functional area managers make nominations, the AEFC must
            still coordinate with the appropriate A1O for the MAJCOM CC or CV (3-digit or
            higher at the Air Staff) as well as COMAFFOR/ Deputy COMAFFOR approval
            prior to entering sourcing into DCAPES.
            9.9.1.2.2.4. For PA officers, the AEFC works with SAF/PAR for nominations.
            9.9.1.2.2.5. For FM officers, the AEFC works with ACC/FM for nominations.
            Note: SAF/ FM has delegated the responsibility to ACC/FM to work with the
            MAJCOMs to identify a nominee(s) to forward for SAF/FM selection and
            approval.
242                                              AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


         9.9.1.2.2.6. For communication-information (comm-info) officers, the AEFC will
         coordinate with ACC/A6O to develop a specific comm-info sourcing matrix to be
         incorporated into the AEFC overall sourcing matrix. Note: ACC/A6 is given
         coordinating authority by HAF comm-info functional area managers to address
         comm-info concerns with the matrix.
      9.9.1.2.3. Medical Officer Scheduling. Per AFI 10-403, clinical O-6 medical
      officers may be tasked to fill non-colonel requirements. However, MAJCOM CC or
      CV approval is required prior to sourcing. The respective, MAJCOM A1O office will
      obtain MAJCOM CC or CV approval and forward to the AEFC.
      9.9.1.2.4. AOC/AFFOR Scheduling.
         9.9.1.2.4.1. HQ ACC/A3C sends all AOC senior officer requirements to the
         affected MAJCOM A1O staffs (i.e., ACC, PACAF, or USAFE). Note: All
         geographic component headquarters currently fill AFCENT AOC requirements on
         a rotating basis. The affected MAJCOM/A1O staff will be the staff that’s
         component headquarters is scheduled to support the current AEF pair as
         determined by HQ ACC/A3YC. HQ ACC/A1O will coordinate with the CONUS-
         based geographic component headquarters and PACAF/USAFE will coordinate
         with their respective component headquarters for sourcing.
         9.9.1.2.4.2. (DELETED) .
         9.9.1.2.4.3. The AEFC forwards AFFOR requirements to the affected
         MAJCOM/A1O staffs (i.e., ACC, PACAF, or USAFE). Note: AFFOR ARC LNO
         requirements are filled by the AFRC and ANG on a rotating basis; AFFOR
         Command Staff Surgeon requirement(s) is sourced by the AEFC Medical
         Functional Scheduler; and AFFOR Command Staff PA Director requirement(s)
         are immediately coordinated and sourced by the AEFC and SAF/PAR. HQ
         ACC/A1O will coordinate with the CONUS-based geographic component
         headquarters and PACAF/USAFE will coordinate with their respective
         component headquarters for sourcing.
         9.9.1.2.4.4. (DELETED) .
      9.9.1.2.5. All senior officer sourcing decisions must be approved by the respective
      MAJCOM CC or CV (3-digit or higher for Air Staff sourced requirements) before
      sourcing can be entered into DCAPES for levy to the affected unit.
         9.9.1.2.5.1. For AFRC senior officers (unit personnel only), the nomination must
         be approved by the wing commander, NAF commander, AFRC/IG (clearance),
         and AFRC/ CV. For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), the nomination
         must be approved by the individual’s supervisor, the individual’s Program
         Manager, the IMA Readiness Management Group (RMG), AFRC/IG, and
         AFRC/CV.
         9.9.1.2.5.2. For ANG senior officers, the unit commander and Adjutant General
         must approve the nomination.
         9.9.1.2.5.3. For HAF personnel, the appropriate Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS)
         (i.e., A3/5, A1, A4/7, SG, etc.) or designated 3-digit representative (i.e. A5X, etc.)
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                        243


           must approve the nomination.
           9.9.1.2.5.4. For DRU and FOA senior officers, AF/A3OT or appropriate Air Staff
           functional area manager will coordinate approvals through AFSLMO.
           9.9.1.2.5.5. Per AFPD 10-4, all senior officers filling component wing/group
           commander requirements must be approved by the gaining COMAFFOR. For
           component IA requirements, the senior officers must be approved by the gaining
           COMAFFOR or Deputy COMAFFOR. This process applies to all component
           theaters (AFCENT, AFNORTH, PACAF, USAFE, and AFSOUTH).
           9.9.1.2.5.6. For combatant commander IA requirements (JTF HQ, Coalition
           Provisional Authority, etc.) on an approved Joint Manning Document (JMD),
           once MAJCOM CC or CV approval is received, the AEFC can enter sourcing into
           DCAPES. Note: The appropriate component A1O office should be informed of
           all senior officers projected into their theater of responsibility.
        9.9.1.2.6. AEF Rotational Requirements Sourcing Matrix. Commander
        requirements identified by a "C" AFSC prefix are sourced from postured UTCs
        aligned in accordance with the ECS Target Base Alignment Template. Non-
        commander requirements are sourced using the AEF Rotational Requirements
        Sourcing Matrix.
           9.9.1.2.6.1. The AEFC will use colonels from the wings in the AEF pair to fill
           key leadership positions. Command authority for lead wing operations is activated
           in deployed locations only. For Expeditionary Operations Group (EOG)/CC
           positions, the AEFC will identify the MAJCOM and wing for tasking and update
           the matrix accordingly. For Expeditionary Mission Support Group (EMSG)/CC
           and Expeditionary Maintenance Group (EMXG)/CC positions, the AEFC will
           forward the appropriate ECS Target Base Alignment Template to the MAJCOM
           A1Os to identify the on-call period for each wing.
           9.9.1.2.6.2. The MAJCOM A1Os will review the draft matrix, vet it through their
           MAJCOM directorates, and forward any concerns to the AEFC.
           9.9.1.2.6.3. The AEFC will address all concerns and send the matrix back to the
           MAJCOM DPO/A1Os so they can forward to their respective MAJCOM CC or
           CV (3-digit for Air Staff scheduling) for approval.
           9.9.1.2.6.4. Upon MAJCOM CC or CV (3-digit at Air Staff) approval, the AEFC
           will use the approved matrix for sourcing throughout the AEF cycle.
           9.9.1.2.6.5. For added or deleted positions, the AEFC will evaluate what
           AFSC/function is requested and look at the matrix to determine which MAJCOM
           is currently filling (if any), determine which MAJCOMs are programmed for
           future rotations based on the ECS SIPT Target Base Alignment Template or the
           CAF/MAF schedule and assign tasking(s) as appropriate.
        9.9.1.2.7. Expeditionary Commander Sourcing.
           9.9.1.2.7.1. Expeditionary Wing and Group Commanders. All expeditionary
           wing and group commanders deploying for less than 365 days will be selected
           from current "sitting" or graduated wing/group commanders. A current “sitting”
244                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


             commander will not be selected to fill a non-commander requirement.
             Commanders deploying for 365 days will be selected in accordance with HAF
             DPO selection process.
             9.9.1.2.7.2. Expeditionary Squadron Commanders. Expeditionary squadron
             commanders deploying for 365 days will be bid/selected via the Squadron
             Commander Candidate Selection process. Expeditionary squadron commanders
             deploying for less than 365 days should be selected from sitting commanders,
             then graduated commanders. MAJCOM vice commanders (or equivalent) may
             select a qualified officer from the current Squadron Commander Candidate
             Selection process, if there are no other qualified and available sitting or graduated
             commanders.
             9.9.1.2.7.3. Non-commander requirements from the supported command or
             AFFOR staff with a line remark specifying the need for an officer with command
             experience will be filled first by graduated commanders. Sitting squadron
             commanders will not deploy to fill non-commander positions unless there is no
             other qualified, available, and ready-to-deploy officer in the on-call period.
             Should no alternative exist, a sitting squadron commander may deploy with
             respective HAF DCS and applicable MAJCOM/CV approval. Additionally,
             AFPC/DPW will source non-commander positions from Institutional Force assets
             prior to sourcing a sitting commander to fill a non-commander billet.
      9.9.1.3. Aviation and Direct Aviation Support UTC Sourcing. The AEFC will apply
      sourcing to aviation UTCs as depicted in the CPO, and those UTCs whose MISCAP
      indicates they are in direct support of a particular (MDS), during the requirement build
      process. This is normally done approximately 160 days prior to the AEF deployment
      period. Sourcing will be in accordance with the published CPO and MAF schedule and
      any applicable DEPORDs. Aviation and direct aviation support UTC MAJCOM FAMs,
      or applicable MAJCOM OPR, will receive suspense 144 days from the AEF pivot date to
      review and coordinate with the supported AOR then provide tailoring actions back to the
      AEFC, 75 days from the AEF pivot date. Once the tailoring actions are updated in the
      TPFDD, requirements will be placed in the applicable verification force module (FM)
      and suspensed.
      9.9.1.3. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will manage aviation bomber tailoring
      requirements for AFGSC assets and the process to verify them. The applicable aviation
      and direct aviation bomber support HQ AFGSC/A4 FAMs will assist in tailoring the
      cargo and personnel requirements as needed. After aviation, cargo and personnel
      requirements are determined and properly tailored; HQ AFGSC/A3CW will enter the “S”
      in the record's Tasking Notification Code signifying that the nominated unit/organization
      can meet the tasking.
      9.9.1.4. Sourcing Associate UTCs. Requirements for skills or capabilities not resident in
      the on-call AEF pair as a standard UTC may be filled using the forces in an associate (A-
      coded) UTC. When such resources are identified, the AEFC will coordinate with the
      MAJCOM to determine the readiness of the desired resources in the A-UTC. If ready, the
      AEFC will source the forces in deployable UTCs.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            245


     9.9.1.5. Personnel Early Return/Release and Replacement Sourcing. Deployed
     commanders have the authority to curtail a deployment and return entire UTCs or
     individual members to home station. When the mission of a UTC or individual member is
     complete, they should be returned home regardless of the tour length specified in the
     CED order. When personnel are returned because of mission completion, replacements
     are not authorized and will not be provided. To be replaced personnel must be filling a
     valid DRMD/JMD requirement.
        9.9.1.5.1. Deployed commanders may require the replacement of an entire UTC or
        individual members of a UTC prior to the completion of their tour. Reasons for return
        must be associated with problems beyond the member’s control (medical, emergency
        leave, etc.), substandard duty performance, or the member may not be qualified for
        duty (as defined by the UTC MISCAP or TPFDD’s level-4 detail). If there are 30 or
        more days left on the tour and a replacement is required, the providing unit will
        deploy another qualified member or team. If there are less than 30 day left on the tour
        a replacement will be provided from the next AEF rotation. In cases where the
        requirement does not line up with the standard AEF rotation cycle the AEFC
        scheduler will use the above concept as a guide, but will make the final determination
        as how the replacement will be sourced based on the specific situation.
        9.9.1.5.2. When the home unit is unable to provide a replacement, the unit will
        submit a reclama or UIC change via RPT immediately.
        9.9.1.5.3. When deployed commanders voluntarily release members for reasons other
        than problems beyond the member’s control (medical, emergency leave, etc.),
        substandard duty performance, or the member is not qualified for duty (as defined by
        the UTC MISCAP or the TPFDD’s level-4 detail) covered in paragraph 9.9.1.5.1
        above), the home station is not required to deploy a replacement.
        9.9.1.5.4. In all early return cases, the DRI/RDD of the subsequent rotation will not
        be adjusted. Replacements will only serve the remainder of the replaced member's
        tour length and will be replaced as scheduled by the next rotation.
        9.9.1.5.5. For all early returns, the servicing PERSCO teams must send an early
        release/return message to the component headquarters directorate of personnel with
        an informational copy to the home station PRF, home station unit commander,
        MAJCOM readiness branch, and the AEFC CAT advising of the member’s status and
        request a replacement if authorized. If the component headquarters directorate of
        personnel decides to forward deploy the UTC/individual vice return to home station
        the “new” requirement must be a valid Air Force DRMD/JMD requirement. The tour
        length for the forward deployed UTC/individual will remain the same. The PERSCO
        and home station IDRC/PRF will process and manage such actions as specified in
        AOR reporting instructions and AFI 10-215, Personnel Support for Contingency
        Operations, keeping the component headquarters, AEFC CAT, and supporting
        MAJCOM informed.
        9.9.1.5.6. In cases of sensitive issues such as casualties (KIAs and some VSIs),
        deployed commanders should work with component headquarters staff, PERSCO
        teams and the AEFC for backfills from other AEF postured units unless the positions
        for backfill require specific skill sets only available from the originally tasked unit.
246                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      9.9.1.6. Sourcing Enabler Assets. Enabler forces are intended to support specific
      operations and are primarily sourced by the respective MAJCOM. To provide total
      visibility of worldwide requirements, MAJCOMs need to inform AFPC of assets tasked
      directly by MAJCOM to meet CCDR requirements. MAJCOMs may release certain
      Enabler assets for DPW sourcing. These will be stipulated in the applicable Enabler
      guidance (see paragraph 7.12.8.3) or through one-time concurrence with the
      MAJCOM/A3.
      9.9.1.7. Sourcing Augmentee UTC Requirements. The applicable HAF Program
      Manager (e.g. AF/A7C for TCN Escort), in coordination with their respective MAJCOM
      FAMs, develops an augmentee UTC allocation plan in accordance with ECS CPS
      business rules. This plan is provided to AFPC/DPW for incorporation into the ECS CPS.
      This allocation plan outlines the distribution of requirements to applicable MAJCOMs
      who, in turn, allocate the requirements to their wings. Wing commanders, through
      applicable squadron commanders, are responsible for selecting qualified individuals to
      meet these augmentee requirements (Note: These allocation plans will only comprise of
      Active Component capability areas postured in Bands “A”, “B” or “C”). At execution, if
      the planning pool provides insufficient forces to meet augmentee requirements, approval
      authority to source individuals from capability areas in Bands “D” or “E” is the
      applicable HAF functional director. Additionally, MAJCOMs may release Enabler assets
      for AFPC/DPW sourcing of augmentee requirements.
      9.9.1.8. Sourcing Non-Standard UTC Requirements with “any AFSC” Requirements.
      Non-Standard UTC requirements sourced by UTC sourcing methodology will be
      allocated and scheduled to the generic MAJCOM TPAS based on warfighting unit
      numbers (Note: Sourcing of requirements filled by MilPDS sourcing methodology is
      outlined in paragraph 14.6.2.3.3). At execution, AFPC/DPW sources UTCs from
      remaining UTCs in AEF vulnerability period after sourcing standard UTCs. Additionally,
      MAJCOMs may release certain Enabler assets for AFPC/DPW sourcing of non-standard
      UTC requirements.
  9.9.2. Identification of TPFDD Requirements for Sourcing. To assist with the
  identification of TPFDD requirements for AEF sourcing, the AEFC establishes force
  modules (FMs) for new and rotational requirements, to include requirements added after the
  cutoff date identified in the AEFC’s AEF rotation “Sourcing Plans and Tasks” message. FMs
  allow the supported component headquarters to quickly identify and communicate valid
  requirements for Air Force sourcing. The component headquarters will place requirements
  reviewed and accepted in a designated FM during planning for each AEF pair’s rotation.
  Force providing organizations delegated authority to write to the supported commanders
  TPFDD must adhere to these guidelines
      9.9.2.1. Following initial identification of rotational requirements, any additions, changes
      or deletions during the current rotation window will require newsgroup notification via
      the hq.source newsgroup and the applicable supported TPFDD’s operational newsgroup.
      The newsgroup should explain what has been done and why or on what authority the
      modifications were made, i.e., an approved ACR. On receipt of newsgroup and
      referenced authority for the change, the AEFC will update the “added after the cutoff
      FM.”
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            247


     9.9.2.2. The component headquarters must ensure requirements added after the FM
     cutoff have an EAD plus 55 on strategic (AK) movements and an EAD plus 35 for
     channel (AC) movements. An EAD less than 35 days should be of an urgent nature and
     identified as short notice by the component headquarters. This allows the AEFC to take
     necessary actions to ensure short notice requirements are sourced with appropriate
     priority.
     9.9.2.3. Failure to provide a newsgroup to confirm updates could result in sourcing not
     being applied and requirements will not be captured in the sourcing FM by the AEFC.
     Component headquarters authorizing other components to build requirements (AFSOC,
     AMC, etc,) in their TPFDDs must provide a letter of authority to the AEFC and update
     prior to each AEF cycle or change.
  9.9.3. MAJCOM TPFDD Verification. To complete the sourcing process, AFPC/DPW
  places sourcing that requires verification in a designated FM, in accordance with the AEF
  rotation “Sourcing Plans and Tasks” message. An accompanying newsgroup will be posted
  for notification and to establish the verification suspense. Verification will be completed in
  accordance with timelines depicted in Table 8.5. Note: After the AFPC/DPW sourcing and
  verification FM has been suspensed, verifying agencies do not have to wait for release of the
  subsequent verification FMs to apply verification.
     9.9.3.1. DELETED.
         9.9.3.1.2. Reclama procedures will be processed in accordance with Chapter 10.
         Newly sourced requirements will be placed in a verification FM and force providers
         must verify within timelines depicted in Table 8.5.
     9.9.3.2. JET requirements defined in a CJCS DEPORD/EXORD may be inserted into a
     TPFDD at any time during the Force Rotation TPFDD Development Process Timeline.
     The Air Force may be tasked to support JETs that require Airmen to attend
     predeployment training to obtain sister Service skills as described in line remarks (e.g.
     Army combat skills training). Because training may be required en route to the deployed
     location, all JOPES dates (availability to load date (ALD), earliest arrival date (EAD),
     latest arrival date (LAD), required delivery date (RDD)) and locations must be carefully
     reviewed by MAJCOM AEF Cells, Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) offices, and
     IDOs/UDMs. AFPC/DPW will include first movement in the AEFIS report to reflect
     predeployment training as reflected in PDTT. These requirements may have a short
     timeline from CJCS DEPORD/EXORD approval to LAD/RDD. Short timelines make it
     imperative that sourcing, MAJCOM verification, and names filled by the IPR are
     accomplished within the prescribed time to ensure deploying Airmen meet the required
     training dates. Requirements within 45 days of first movement (i.e. the earliest of
     predeployment training as identified in PDTT or RLD/ALD identified in DCAPES) will
     be treated as short notice requirements and will have names in the system in accordance
     with AFI 36-3802 timeline. AFPC/DPW will monitor MAJCOM verification and name
     fill information. In situations where these actions are not accomplished in a timely
     manner, thereby possibly jeopardizing meeting first movement, AFPC/DPW will notify
     the MAJCOM AEF Cells (or designated organization) for resolution.
  9.9.4. ARC Participation. During each AEF vulnerability period, the deploying AEFs will
  have force elements provided by AFRC and ANG units. These units fill the applicable
248                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


  rotation by teaming (when feasible) units and personnel and rainbowing equipment. Specific
  methodology for meeting this objective is managed by the AFRC and ANG. ARC force
  volunteerism is maximized by providing rotation and tour duration flexibility. Component
  headquarters should consider the appropriate rotation policy and tour length with the goal of
  maximizing ARC volunteerism.
  9.9.5. Cancellation of AFRC and ANG Sourcing. The AEFC will immediately notify the
  appropriate ARC headquarters when an ARC sourced requirement is deleted or changed. At
  ARC discretion, the AEFC will attempt to secure an available equivalent active duty tasking
  during the same time frame. If one is identified, the AEFC will coordinate with all concerned
  parties to cancel the active duty unit tasking and redirect the tasking to the appropriate ARC
  unit. If an active duty UTC tasking cannot be obtained, the ARC can request component
  headquarters approval to deploy their volunteers on a case-by-case basis.
  9.9.6. Timelines for Sourcing/Executing Manpower Changes. When starting a new rotational
  requirement, or implementing changes to existing requirements, the component headquarters
  will make every attempt to synchronize the initial RDD/DRI with the start of the next AEF
  deployment period. When the initial LAD/ RDD cannot be met, or the ETL does not meet the
  warfighter requirements, LADs/RDDs will be adjusted in accordance with the Joint Staff
  GFM Sourcing Business Rules. AFPC/DPW, component headquarters, and supporting
  MAJCOM (if known) will coordinate resolution. AFPC will submit a LAD/RDD shift
  message to the AF FP for submission to the supported CCDR. If the supported CCDR
  agrees, then the AF FP will forward the information to the Joint Staff. The Joint Staff will
  release an order modification announcing the change. Tour length options, in order
  (appropriate waivers/permissions required):

         9.9.6.1.3. DELETED.
      9.9.6.2. 179-day ETLs.
         9.9.6.2.1. AFPC, in coordination with the supported and supporting commands, will
         schedule the first rotation in order to align with the AEF pivot dates. This may
         require an earlier or later reporting date than originally requested by the supported
         command.
         9.9.6.2.2. AFPC will source requirement to meet established RDD. RDD will be
         adjusted during subsequent rotations to align with the AEF pivot dates.
      9.9.6.3. Out of Cycle Indeterminate TDY (ITDY) Requests. Initial or new ITDY
      requirements will be approved and forwarded to AFPC for fills NLT 200 days prior to
      first movement. Any requests for an ITDY fill inside of 200 days will initially be filled
      by a 179 day followed by an ITDY fill.
  9.9.7. Equipment Requirements and Sourcing. The force provider will identify sourcing
  solutions to AFPC/DPW for equipment-only UTCs not directly tied to a unit (e.g., vehicles)
  postured in the AEF Tempo Bands or Enabler force. UTCs that contain both MANFOR and
  LOGFOR detail will be sourced by AFPC/DPW using the same procedures and priorities as
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         249


  personnel-only UTCs. Due to the sensitivity of AFSOC's SOF mission and AMC's global
  MAF support, these mission requirements will continue to be sourced by the respective
  MAJCOMs. HQ AMC will source unique theater requirements for mobility support. The
  ECS SIPT is the focal point for coordinating all issues and concerns relative to equipment
  sourcing.
     9.9.7.1. Generic equipment only UTCs will be placed in the Enabler library in
     accordance with guidance in Chapter 7. The unit must accurately assess the readiness of
     the UTC using ART. For sourcing purposes, all equipment only UTCs placed in the UTC
     Availability are available for deployment.
     9.9.7.2. DELETED.
     9.9.7.3. At the direction of the parent MAJCOM, units/wings will electronically pass
     their equipment (DCAPES cargo level detail) information to their MAJCOM FAM.
     Units/Wings must indicate if the equipment detail is from a UTC that contains both
     equipment and personnel or an equipment only UTCs.
     9.9.7.4. The following procedures apply for replacement of in-place (equipment
     transferred to the AOR) and deployed (home station marked deployed) equipment:
         9.9.7.4.1. The forward location supply authority will coordinate with the supported
         component headquarters FAM on the requirement. The component headquarters
         FAM approves the requirement and determines if an asset can be sourced within
         theater.
         9.9.7.4.2. If the item is not supported in theater the component headquarters FAM
         will coordinate with component headquarters planners to include the requirement in
         the appropriate TPFDD for the AEFC to source.
         9.9.7.4.3. The MAJCOM FAM, or other agency designated by the MAJCOM, of the
         unit nominated to fill the requirement verifies that the correct unit is sourced and
         notifies the unit of the TPFDD requirement.
         9.9.7.4.4. All equipment movement will be coordinated through the supporting
         MAJCOM Command Equipment Management Office to affect the necessary
         equipment record changes prior to actual property movement.
         9.9.7.4.5. All equipment movement will be coordinated through the supporting
         MAJCOM supply function to affect the necessary equipment record changes prior to
         actual movement. Standard supply operating procedures will be followed.
     9.9.7.5. For replacement or rotation of deployed equipment, the supporting command
     providing the UTC or equipment is responsible for replacement or rotation of the UTC or
     equipment.
         9.9.7.5.1. The supported Combat Air Forces Logistics Support Center (CAF/LSC)
         and MAJCOM equipment office will send a message to the supporting command
         CAF/LSC identifying UTC or equipment to be replaced, with information copy to the
         Air Staff equipment office.
 250                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


           9.9.7.5.2. If unable to source the requirement, the supporting command CAF/LSC
           will notify the supported component headquarters via reclama message, with
           information copy to the Air Staff equipment office.
           9.9.7.5.3. If the requirement is shortfalled, the HAF FAM may direct cross-command
           sourcing.
           9.9.7.5.4. The organization deploying the equipment will forward the information
           required for the parent MAJCOM to build the TPFDD line level detail in DCAPES.
       9.9.7.6. Use of War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM supports the range of military
       operations within our National Military Strategy. Accordingly, use of WRM is restricted
       to ensure sufficient capability is available to support theater start or swing stock
       requirements. Use must be approved only after considering the impact on ability to meet
       emerging requirements and the ability and timeliness of reconstituting the WRM assets.
       WRM assets should not be used solely to support ongoing rotational operations. Prior to
       using WRM, requesting organizations will make every effort to satisfy the requirement
       using alternative means of support. If still required, the requesting organization must
       follow procedures for indirect mission support outlined in AFI 25-101.
9.10. Line Remark Program. Line remarks is an Air Force owned program that allows the
component headquarters to further define capability requests. They do not allow the combatant
command to request capabilities that the Air Force does not train to. Air Force standard line
remarks are used in conjunction with the UTC to further identify unique requirements. The use
of line remarks, in some cases, may invalidate the UTC; therefore the component headquarters
should use line remarks judiciously to avoid this situation. Line remarks that require early arrival
or end of tour overlap will be counted to determine total time spent in the AOR without
adjustment to the ETL. The AEFC, with support of component headquarters, will conduct a
review of force rotational requirements with line remarks prior to the start of each AEF cycle. To
the maximum extent possible, component headquarters will eliminate line remarks and rely on
standard UTC MISCAPs to state a requirement.
   9.10.1. The AEFC manages the creation and publication of standard line remarks and is the
   final approval authority for additions, changes, and deletions. The AEFC makes the line
   remark available on the classified and unclassified AEF Online web site.
   9.10.2. Prior to submitting a request for additions or changes, the component headquarters
   will ensure that no current line remark satisfies the requestor’s needs. Coordinate requested
   line remark addition/ change with the appropriate component headquarters FAM and then
   forward to the AEFC.
   9.10.3. The AEFC verifies that no current line remark satisfies the requester’s needs and
   verifies the accuracy of the requested clear text. Approved requests are announced by
   message. Disapproved requests are returned to the requester with rationale.
   9.10.4. If a ULN’s Line Remark is changed after the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU has verified
   the tasking, and makes filling the tasking more restrictive, then the verification code must be
   removed. This will allow the MAJCOM the opportunity to examine the changes and ensure
   that it can meet the new requirements with the originally sourced unit, or can fill tasking with
   another unit within the timeframe outlined in paragraph 9.8
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               251


9.11. Estimated Tour Length (ETL). Rotational requirements are generally the result of a
crisis operation the combatant commander has authorized the Service to support with rotating
forces. Unless otherwise specified in the SecDef DEPORD, USAF forces will deploy on CED
orders with an ETL up to 179 days (plus additional days to account for overlap if required in line
remarks) to allow the Air Force to effectively respond, build up forces and plan for follow-on
forces in an orderly manner (shorter rotations within a standard ETL may be authorized by
component headquarters in order to facilitate ARC participation). If ETLs greater than 179-days
are directed via the GFMAP / JFP Annex Schedule, then USAF forces will follow Joint
direction. Enabler forces provide specialized capabilities that may require non-standard ETLs.
Acceptable ETLs will be coordinated between the CCDR and applicable force provider.
   9.11.1. Extended ETLs During Initial Requirement Submission. Combatant commander
   rotational requirements, as depicted in the SecDef-approved GFMAP, with tour lengths
   greater than 179 days which do not allow the option of shorter duration tour lengths will be
   filled as requested. Standard force solution tour lengths greater than 179 days are a deviation
   to AEF operational policy and the component headquarters must gain CSAF approval to state
   a requirement with an ETL greater than 179 days. These requests will be limited to “Key and
   Critical” positions. CSAF approved “Key and Critical” criteria for position requests beyond
   179 days that allows Air Force leadership to manage in a way that capabilities are deployed
   to the greatest effect. The “Key and Critical” construct will (1) inform senior leaders on tour
   lengths beyond 179 days and provide a platform for adjudicating, (2) assess risk of
   supporting positions for future budgets and service costs and manpower offsets for vacant
   positions, and (3) require annual review for requested positions beyond 179 day deployment
   durations.
       9.11.1.1. Requests to extend and/or generate positions beyond 179-day tour lengths must
       meet one or more of the following CSAF force generation “Key and Critical” criteria for
       approval:
           9.11.1.1.1. Commanders (wing-, group-, and squadron-level) and key Senior Enlisted
           leadership (wing- and group-level command/executives/superintendents).
           9.11.1.1.2. Positions requiring extensive Host Nation/Local populace interaction.
           Airmen who maintain direct and continuous daily contact with national and/or local
           populace organizations in order to support, be located on, operate in, or transit
           through its territory based on government invitation and/or national agreements.
           9.11.1.1.3. Positions requiring critical continuity to Coalition/Joint operations.
           Airmen maintaining direct, regular, timely, and collaborative working relationships
           between civilian and/or military coalition/joint forces.
       9.11.1.2. EETL requests will be submitted as follows:
           9.11.1.2.1. Forward all request(s) to AF Operations Group (AFOG) no less than 180
           days prior to RDD. Supported component headquarters request must include, but not
           limited to, signed approval memo from component headquarters commander/deputy
           commander, position description/RFF position description/FTN, and identify/state
           which criteria meets the request with clear and concise justification for that criteria.
           9.11.1.2.2. AFOG will forward request to AF/A5XW who will coordinate SSS
           package across the HAF Staff. It is important that the HAF FAM is involved in this
 252                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


          process to allow them the opportunity to force manage and coordinate on their
          specific functional area skill sets that may have a high risk factor based on its level of
          demand/stress in meeting global CCDR requirements. AF/A5XW will ensure all
          applicable organizations (AF/A1PR, AF/A3O-AO, AFPC/DPW, applicable AF FP,
          and respective MAJCOM FAM) have provided their inputs to ensure request meets
          the CSAF "Key and Critical" criteria. Requests without proper justification will be
          returned to the supported component command for further clarification.
          9.11.1.2.3. AF/A5XW will continue HAF coordination which will consist of
          AF/A5X, AF/A3O, AF/A1P, AF/RE, NGB/CF, and respective HAF FAM 3-digit and
          their respective HAF DCS prior to submitting to CSAF for approval/disapproval.
          AF/A5XW will forward CSAF approved/disapproved package to AFOG, AF FP, the
          submitting component, and AFPC/DPW.
          9.11.1.2.4. If approved, AF FP will include in next AF DEPORD and include
          applicable component headquarters. Once applicable component headquarters has
          AF DEPORD with approved positions then AFPC will source. For ITDY
          requirements, AFPC must be notified NLT 120 days prior to RDD. Note: AFPC will
          NOT source any position unless the request has been approved by the CSAF.

9.13. Tasking Notification Process. AFPC/DPW provides oversight of the tasking notification
process for all TPFDDs sourced using AEF scheduled assets. It is responsible for controlling
visibility for these TPFDDs and will provide automated support using DCAPES to base-level
IDRC, manpower and personnel readiness offices, PERSCO teams, and central sites.
AFPC/DPW provides visibility after coordination with and receiving the approval of the
supported component headquarters.
   9.13.1. Assigning names to requirements in MANPER-B is critical to the entire deployment
   process. Deploying members must be identified and updated in system in accordance with
   AFI 10-215 to ensure name visibility of members projected to deploy, to facilitate any
   advance training requirements, and schedule an appropriate airlift mission to meet the
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             253


   supported commander’s DRI/RDD. The AEFC will provide a bi-weekly nameless ULN
   report to the MAJCOMs for further processing with the MAJCOM FAMs and appropriate
   wing staffs. Additionally, at least 45 – 60 days following an AEF rotation, the AEFC will
   publish metrics data depicting the percentage of names received in a specific window for the
   MAJCOM AEF Debriefs. Applicable window range covers 45+ days prior to the RDD, 31-
   44 days prior to the RDD, 0-30 days prior to the RDD or names received after the RDD has
   passed as of the report date.
   9.13.1. (AFGSC) The IDO will pull tasking records from DCAPES at least twice each duty
   day and ensure tasked units are notified. If requested by the IDO, the IPR, wing manpower
   office, or logistics plans function will prepare a levy export file of taskings from DCAPES
   for import into LOGMOD. IDRCs will conduct TPFDD line-by-line reviews daily to ensure
   all ULN transactions that alter any JOPES characteristics from a previous day’s TPFDD are
   reconciled. Additionally, IDRCs will compare the daily TPFDD pull with data in Deployed
   Personnel Taskings (DPT) to verify all taskings reflected on the TPFDD are also present in
   DPT. If taskings on the daily TPFDD pull are not present in DPT after 3 duty days (1 duty
   day for short notice), the IDRCs must contact the AFGSC AEF Cell for resolution. The IPR
   office will enter the SSAN of individuals identified by the unit commander to fill the tasking
   requirement in DCAPES NLT 5 duty days of verification and flip record from “P” to “C”.
   For short notice taskings (within 30 days for RDD), the SSAN must be entered in DCAPES
   and record flipped from “P” to “C” within 24 hours of completing MAJCOM verification.
   **Note: Tasking is not completed until the record is flipped from “P” to “C” by the IPR
   office.
       9.13.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) When a USSTRATCOM–assigned asset (personnel or
       equipment) is identified to be tasked for a deployment, a Risk Assessment will be
       completed by the tasked unit in coordination with MAJCOM FAM to assess the risk to
       the unit’s ability to perform its USSTRATCOM mission with the asset deployed. The
       MAJCOM FAM forwards completed Risk Assessment template and sourcing solution to
       AFGSCA3CD.AEFVerification@barksdale.af.smil.mil
9.14. Employment. The AEF employment objective is to meet a supported combatant
commander’s needs through the COMAFFOR with relevant UTC capabilities-based AETF
packages (AEWs and AEGs) in accordance with validated theater mission requirements, as
identified by the TPFDD. Planning must focus on sustained execution in the area of operations
for the AEF execution period by integrating AEW, AEG, and AES command, operations, and
support elements into an integrated, cohesive force.
   9.14.1. Posture Concepts. AEF on-call forces will maintain the capability to rapidly
   transition from normal day-to-day operations to crisis response operations. Unit posture will
   increase      consistent    with    the      issuance       and     receipt     of     CJCS
   Warning/Planning/Alert/Deployment Order, Prepare to Deploy Order, and/or Execution
   Order.
       9.14.1.1. On-Call Status (AD only). Untasked UTCs will assume on-call status for the
       duration of the AEF block/pair vulnerability period. This posture enables these UTCs to
       rapidly transition from normal day-to-day operations to crisis response operations.
       MAJCOMs and AFPC/DPW will describe on-call force actions in CONOPS and
 254                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       supporting plans, as appropriate. HD/LS assets will be managed through the HD/LS
       Force/Capability Management Process.
       9.14.1.1. (AFGSC) Individuals assigned to an AEF but not tasked to deploy are
       considered on-call resources during their AEF Vulnerability Period. These individuals
       serve as the on-call capability throughout the assigned AEF period or until tasked to
       deploy in support of an AEF tasking.
       9.14.1.2. Alert Status. Normally initiated by a CJCS Warning Order (or Prepare to
       Deploy Order and Alert Order with Secretary of Defense (SecDef) direction), this posture
       prepares forces for rapid deployment upon receipt of an execute order. However, a
       warning order does not authorize movement of forces unless specifically stated. Typical
       units specifically authorized to move under a warning order include air mobility assets.
       As an example, Contingency Response Groups (CRGs) and other air mobility support
       units may deploy to forward locations to establish enroute support and reception
       capabilities at the aerial port of debarkation (APOD). Tankers and essential beddown
       support units may deploy to forward locations in preparation for air bridge support.
       9.14.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) On-call personnel may take leave and perform temporary
       duty during their AEF Vulnerability Period at the discretion of the unit commander.
       Approval of leave and/or TDY is contingent upon the individual’s ability to be present
       for duty, complete all pre-deployment requirements and deploy within 72 hours (or
       sooner as required by the UTC MISCAP) using normal recall procedures. Commanders
       should not approve leave to remote areas (e.g., beyond normal communications) and long
       duration TDYs where the individual cannot be contacted for extended periods of time or
       far from home station making timely return unlikely.
9.15. Response Timing. Theater combatant commander mission requirements dictate response-
timing constraints. In general, CONOPS should allow for a stair-step of response timing to
reduce alert requirements. Service components must prepare to deploy forces, particularly ECS
forces, during the initial phases of contingencies. Personnel should deploy only after receipt of
valid contingency, exercise, and deployment (CED) orders and validation by the installation
deployment officer (IDO) that the unit line number (ULN) has been validated in the TPFDD by
the supported commander.
9.16. Shortfall and Reclama Procedures. Air Force active duty, AFRC, ANG, MAJCOMs,
wings, groups, and units will make every effort to meet all taskings. Generally, relief should only
be sought when a wing or tasked unit does not possess sufficient or qualified personnel to
support a tasking or the tasking is impossible to meet or will shut down critical elements of the
home station mission, as determined by the wing commander or equivalent. Filling shortfalls in
one UTC may mean moving a person from another UTC as long as the individual(s) are within
the same AEF vulnerability period. Units will immediately update ART to reflect the status of
the UTC(s). Wing IDOs will submit base-level reclamas to their MAJCOM only after exhausting
all other options; MAJCOMs must attempt to make UIC Changes from forces within their
MAJCOM prior to submitting a MAJCOM-level reclama (Note: Not required for IA taskings
sourced via MilPDS). See Paragraph 10.21 for details on the shortfall and reclama process.
   9.16.1. Organizations will submit reclamas in accordance with the procedures outlined in
   Chapter 10, Section 10C.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            255


9.17. Retention Beyond Normal Tour Completion Date. Tour length or rotation guidance
will be directed in the SecDef approved DEPORD. Retaining an Airman beyond the normal tour
length (ETL plus additional time depicted via line remarks) will follow OSD-provided business
rules.
   9.17.1. The deployed commander, in accordance with applicable supported AFFOR
   procedures, may request to retain the member(s) beyond the normal tour completion date.
   Supported AFFOR staff will initially coordinate with applicable AF FP who will, in turn,
   coordinate with parent MAJCOM and HAF Functional Director, with info being provided to
   AFPC/DPW (Note: For ARC members, approval from the member volunteer, member's
   assigned unit commander, and the AD MAJCOM MPA provider is required for requirement
   extension beyond the originally agreed upon tour length). Retaining an Airman for other
   than operational purposes (e.g. legal, medical, administrative) will be in accordance with
   applicable directives.
   9.17.2. Mobilized ARC members will not be retained beyond their tour expiration date
   unless an approved AF/A1/A3/5/CAT retention policy is in effect. Affected members must
   be returned to their home station on schedule to ensure sufficient time to take accrued leave
   and complete all demobilization actions prior to their approved demobilization date. ARC
   members shall not be retained on active duty beyond their demobilization date unless an
   approved SAF/MR waiver exists. Guidance on demobilization date extensions is frequently
   updated and announced through SAF/MR memoranda and AF/ A1 electronic messages.
   9.17.3. ARC members performing voluntary active duty tours in accordance with 10 USC
   12301(d), may not be extended beyond the expiration of their orders without the member’s
   consent and a written request (e.g., email) from the deployed commander to the member’s
   home station unit commander. If the ARC home station commander approves the extension,
   the PERSCO team will request an ETL adjustment through the component headquarters
   directorate of personnel and the AEFC. Upon component headquarters approval and
   adjustment of the ETL by the AEFC, the member’s home unit will request additional man-
   days and O&M funding through established command channels, with an information copy to
   the appropriate ARC headquarters. Home station units must procure man-days and O&M
   funding prior to expiration of the original order and publish the appropriate amended orders.
   Note: Unavoidable transportation delays are not considered tour extensions; only home
   station notification and the necessary additional man-days to cover the delay are required.
   9.17.4. Personnel filling non-rotational requirements cannot be retained without approval
   from the member's home station commander and the component headquarters directorate of
   personnel. The deployed unit commander, through PERSCO, initiates a request to the home
   station commander in writing (e.g., email).
   9.17.5. When members are retained, the DRI/RDD of the subsequent rotation will not be
   adjusted. The incumbent’s ETL will not be adjusted if retained for less than 25 days.
   9.17.6. In accordance with AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, amendments are not required
   for extensions of a TDY of 30 days or less except for extensions past 30 September of a
   given fiscal year into a new fiscal year. Amendments to extend the number of days of TDY
   past 30 September of a given fiscal year into a new fiscal year must be processed prior to
   entering the extension period.

   9.18.3. DELETED
9.19. Volunteer Guidance. The following section describes how Air Force personnel (military
and civilian, Active and ARC) can volunteer for AEF ECS crisis taskings.
   9.19.1. General. The intent under the AEF operational policy is to deploy units and
   personnel as they train (as a cohesive fighting team) and to maintain a low tempo
   (OPSTEMPO and PERSTEMPO) for much of the Air Force. To accomplish this, units,
   UTCs and the Airmen identified to fill the UTCs are matched to combatant commander
   requirements based on a published schedule. There may be times when Airmen will want to
   volunteer to continue in a tasking or deploy more than once in an AEF cycle. However,
   commanders must vigilantly adhere to the AEF scheduling process and discourage Airmen
   from deploying outside their associated AEF deployment period. In cases where the
   commander deems it beneficial for mission accomplishment, Airmen may be allowed to
   voluntarily deploy outside their associated AEF deployment period as long as they
   understand they are still eligible to deploy during their AEF deployment period.
   Commanders at all levels will vigorously manage the tempo events of assigned Airmen to
   avoid exceeding tempo management thresholds that place airmen in high deployment status.
   The AEF battle rhythm attempts to manage the Air Force tempo impact, which is a challenge
   greater than that of individuals, single UTCs, or individual units.
   9.19.2. Volunteer Procedures. During the normal AEF battle rhythm, units receive crisis
   taskings at least 120 days prior to the RDD/DRI. This length of time allows units to match
   volunteers to UTC taskings. Volunteers can ascertain what UTC positions they are qualified
   to support by contacting their Unit Deployment Manager (UDM) or the IDO. Volunteers
   should first attempt to fill UTC positions within their own unit. If none are available, they
   may apply to support UTCs allocated to other units within their wing or on their installation.
   Once volunteers have identified UTC positions they are qualified to support (to include line
   remarks and SEIs), they must submit their volunteer request in writing through their chain of
   command, to include the wing commander or equivalent. All applications should be
   completed at least 90 days prior to the RDD/DRI. If the UTC tasking is allocated to another
   unit within the wing or on the installation, volunteers must first gain their commander’s
   approval before routing the application to the tasked unit for consideration. Approval by the
   tasked commander is required for the volunteer to fill the selected position. If for any reason
   the volunteer is unable or unwilling to fill the requirement after approval, the originally
   tasked commander is required to fill the tasking as the tasking was levied based on pre-
   identified sourcing conditions.
   9.19.2. (AFGSC) If someone volunteers to fill a requirement inside their assigned AEF
   period, they must complete the volunteer statement (due to the fact they were not obligated to
   a tasking). They must first obtain approval of their Unit Commander and coordination from
   their MAJCOM FAM before obtaining approval from their installation/center/complex/wing
   commander (Volunteers from HQ AFGSC staff will need their 2-Ltr approval. Upon
   approval, they must provide the volunteer availability notice to the AFGSC FAM.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              257


  Commanders must consider this important point: if the volunteer becomes unable to deploy
  for any reason after being selected for the deployment, the unit will be required to replace the
  individual or submit a reclama if no replacement can be found.
  9.19.3. Implementation Guidance. Commanders must carefully consider each request.
  Before accepting a volunteer’s application, the tasked commander must be certain the
  member is fully qualified, has time to train and integrate with UTC members, and can fully
  support the UTC’s mission capability statement. UTC reclamas cannot be submitted based on
  a member’s approved volunteer application to support another UTC tasking.
     9.19.3.1. Ideally, a volunteer should not fill a UTC committed to an AEF different from
     the volunteer’s associated AEF. Volunteers will remain associated in MilPDS to their
     original AEF on-call period and cannot disrupt a unit or wing’s ability to support UTC
     taskings. (Note: Reserve components will determine component-specific AEFI policy).
     Commanders must be able to fill all UTC positions for each AEF regardless of the status
     of volunteers within their unit or wing.
     9.19.3.1. (AFGSC) If someone volunteers to fill a requirement outside their assigned
     AEF period, they must complete the volunteer statement and first obtain approval of their
     Unit Command followed by their MAJCOM FAM before obtaining approval of their
     installation/complex/wing commander (Volunteers from HQ AFGSC staff will need their
     2-Ltr approval.) Provide the volunteer availability notice to the AFGSC FAM.
     Commanders must consider two important points: (1) the volunteer is still subject to
     deployment in their assigned AEF vulnerability period and (2) if the volunteer is unable
     to deploy for any reason after being selected for the deployment, the unit must replace the
     individual. If no replacement can be found, the unit must initiate a reclama action.
     Members who receive a DAV 81 as a result of a volunteer deployment cannot use this as
     justification for a reclama during their normal AEF window.
     9.19.3.2. In order to reference the most current PERSTEMPO policy along with AF
     identified thresholds and approval levels vi sit the Air Force TEMPO website
     (https://www.tempo.hq.af.mil), or call AF/A3OR 703-695-0301, DSN 225-0301.
     9.19.3.3. Volunteers are not permitted to split tours unless expressly approved by the
     COMAFFOR. All volunteers must be able to serve the entire stated tour length.
     9.19.3.4. Before approving any application, overseas commanders are reminded to
     evaluate the impact of the volunteer’s request and whether it may result in a prorating of
     the applicant’s tour and/or adjustment of the volunteer’s overseas duty selection date or
     short tour return date in accordance with AFI 36-2110, Assignments.
     9.19.3.5. Commanders must determine if the volunteer has deployed to the same location
     during the past 12 months. If so, and the combined tour lengths exceed 179 days in a
     consecutive 12 month period, the unit, via the MPF, must gain a Secretary of the Air
     Force waiver as specified in AFI 36-2110.
     9.19.3.6. Deploying in multiple deployment periods does not automatically authorize a
     member to receive short-tour credit. Short-tour credit is defined in AFI 36-2110.
 258                                                  AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       9.19.3.7. Unit commanders must coordinate with MAJCOM FAM to ensure an Airmen
       volunteering does not adversely affect the MAJCOM’s ability to fulfill subsequent
       taskings.
   9.19.4. Augmentee Positions (e. g. Third Country National (TCN) Escort or Postal
   Augmentee). Airmen may volunteer to fill augmentee requirements. US military personnel,
   usually in the grade of E-5 and below, are eligible. Active Component personnel aligned (as
   indicated by their AEFI) against capability areas postured in Bands “D,” “E” or the Enabler
   force are excluded from the planning pool for augmentee taskings (see paragraph 9.9.1.7 for
   Augmentee UTC allocation).
   9.19.4. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/CCC is AFGSC’s TCN focal point.
9.20. Voluntary Extension (Deployed Forces).
   9.20.1. Personnel who wish to extend their current deployment must first obtain their home
   unit and deployed commander concurrence and provide concurrence documentation to the
   PERSCO team. IMAs must receive Program Manager approval before volunteering to extend
   in the AOR.
       9.20.1.1. Extensions must be for the entire length of the next rotation in order to maintain
       sourcing integrity under the AEF battle rhythm. ARC personnel who volunteer to remain
       in a deployment may volunteer for a shorter period if shorter duration ETLs are not
       prohibited by CCDR line remarks/CRMs; however the request may be disapproved in
       favor of filling the entire tour with a single individual.
       9.20.1.2. Extensions should be requested no later than 60 days prior to end of member's
       normal TDY return date to allow time for proper processing
   9.20.2. Processing Guidance.
       9.20.2.1. The PERSCO team reviews and obtains local approval based on existing policy
       (e.g., Wing/Group commander) and forwards approved requests to the component
       headquarters directorate of personnel for further review and coordination.
       9.20.2.2. The component headquarters directorate of personnel reviews and forwards
       approved extension requests to the AEFC Operations Center for further coordination and
       final approval.
       9.20.2.3. The AEFC Functional Scheduler reviews and determines if the request can be
       supported. If the next rotation is sourced the Scheduler will coordinate with the
       MAJCOM FAM to ensure no hardship will be incurred for the tasked unit/individual.
       Non-concurrence by the MAJCOM FAM and/or the AEFC will result in disapproval.
       9.20.2.4. If the extension is approved, the AEFC adjusts the current ETL and delete the
       next rotation. PERSCO, component headquarters directorate of personnel,
       owning/gaining MAJCOM Readiness Staffs, and the AEFC will be included in approval
       notification email.
9.21. Split Tours. Airmen tasked to fill either ECS or aviation requirements are expected to fill
the entire stated tour unless a non-standard or midtour rotation is approved in advance (e.g. in
line remarks) by the gaining COMAFFOR (Note: Airmen assigned to the ARC are considered
to be pre-approved and do not require specific COMAFFOR approval).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               259


   9.21.1. Forward deployed Airmen may have their tour length shortened due to unforeseen
   circumstances (e.g., medical profile change, emergency leave, etc.) In such cases, another
   Airman may be tasked to complete the tour. The "rotation for cause" functionality in
   DCAPES was designed to support mission continuance with a one for one (individual
   personnel) substitution of an Airman from the supporting unit for administrative actions (e.g.,
   medical profile change, emergency leave, etc.); other uses of this functionality causes the loss
   of visibility of the combatant commander’s requirement and significantly impacts the Air
   Force’s verification process.
   9.21.2. Where the CCDR/AFFOR has established a requirement allowing tour durations of
   less than normal Service rotation policy to afford the opportunity for greater ARC
   participation and the ARC cannot fill the entire tour length, an active duty Airman may be
   utilized to fill the remainder of the requirement.
9.22. AEF Debrief Concept. The AEF debrief concept is developed to ensure supported
combatant commanders are provided the best Airmen the Air Force has to offer. An AEF Debrief
will be held by the MAJCOM Vice Commanders after each AEF vulnerability period to establish
norms and provide crosstalk for AEF planning and execution. AFPC/DPW will develop standard
AEF metrics for inclusion in the AEF debriefs. Substantive changes to how metrics are 'graded"
will be coordinated through the AEFSG. MAJCOMs may adjust the debrief presentation to meet
the specific requirements of their command. An AEF Debrief for each AEF vulnerability period
will be conducted approximately 45-60 days after each AEF pivot date to review common
metrics and to determine how well each rotational AEF was executed. MAJCOM/CV may
waive the AEF Debrief requirement and/or debrief content when cross-talk between
MAJCOM/CV and Wing commander(s) is accomplished via other means and AEF Debrief
information is covered. Lessons identified during each AEF Debrief or commander cross-talk
will be entered into the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) for preservation,
promulgation, and issue resolution.
9.22. (AFGSC)AEF Debrief Concept. The AFGSC AEF Debrief is conducted every 6 months
following each AEF deployment rotation period and is chaired by AFGSC/CV with HQ
AFGSC/A1/A3/A4 and Installation Commanders as participants. HQ AFGSC/A3C is the
Command OPR and has overall responsibility for scheduling, preparing and conducting the AEF
Debrief. HQ AFGSC/A1MW/A4R as Command OCRs are responsible for their assigned AEF
areas and assisting HQ AFGSC/A3C in preparing the brief.
9.23. Executive Review Process. This process provides a hierarchical approach to adjudicating
and resolving force management, generation and allocation issues. The CSAF is responsible for
the management of Air Force forces for the purpose of generating and providing
capability/forces in support of combatant commander requirements. Issue resolution should
occur at the lowest possible level of authority.
9.23. (AFGSC)Executive Review Process. HQ AFGSC/A3C is the HQ AFGSC representative
to the AEF SIPTs.
   9.23.1. The CAF SIPT, ECS SIPT and MAF Scheduling function is responsible for
   developing their respective portion of an AEF schedule/plan that supports SecDef GFM as
   well as APEX processes and timelines. The chair of each scheduling entity (ACC/A3O for
   CAF, AFPC/CC for ECS, and AMC/A3O for MAF) will attempt to adjudicate and resolve
   internal scheduling issues.
 260                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   9.23.2. The AEF Steering Group (AEFSG) will resolve force management or generation
   issues which cannot be resolved by the respective scheduling entities. The AEFSG will
   resolve management of constrained resources, scheduling conflicts and policy discrepancies.
   9.23.3. The VCSAF AEF Forum will attempt to resolve force management and generation
   issues which cannot be resolved by the AEFSG. The CSAF is the final adjudicator of force
   management or generation issues, which require a change in the Air Force’s force
   management and generation methodology. The AF/A1 will advise the CSAF on matters of
   personnel rotation management, end strength accounting, rotation pivot dates, personnel
   rotation planning and deploy-to-dwell ratios, line remarks, tasking notifications, AEF Debrief
   issues and the executive review process.
   9.23.4. COMACC is the final decision authority for force management/providing issues
   related to recommending Air Force sourcing solutions to USJFCOM and the submission of
   Service reclamas for all conventional forces (whether assigned or unassigned). The ACC
   Operations Center or AEF Cell will coordinate and advise COMACC on all issues impacting
   the AEF schedule/plan, recommended sourcing solutions, military risk assessments, Service
   reclamas and execution of the GFMAP annexes. The Commanders of AMC and AFSOC
   will adjudicate mobility and SOF allocation issues with the advice of their respective
   operation center/AEF Cell.
9.24. ECS Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS). The ECS CPS is the primary tool to
depict planned unit taskings over the next 24 months. The ECS CPS is the basis of USAF equity
of the conventional JFP input into the GFMAP. ECS CPS data for the planning year (i.e. prior to
SecDef approval of the baseline GFMAP) will be located in ECS CPS planning PIDs. Once
SecDef approves the baseline GFMAP, AFPC/DPW will migrate ECS CPS data for the
scheduling year to execution PIDs. Prior to migrating data to the execution PIDs, AFPC/DPW
will develop a modification to the ECS CPS to account for emergent requirements and/or
changes in UTC availability. Details on the ECS CPS will be incorporated in a separate 10-
series AFI.
   9.24.1. ECS CPS Development. ACC, as the AF FP for conventional forces, is responsible
   for overseeing the development of the ECS CPS and ensuring GFM milestones are met for
   inclusion in GFMAP. AFPC/DPW, in collaboration with all MAJCOMs and HAF FAMs, is
   the executive agent for developing, maintaining, and modifying the ECS CPS. For ECS
   forces considered MAF or SOF (e.g. aerial port), AFPC/DPW will coordinate with applicable
   AF FP. The ECS CPS will be developed in accordance with the ECS CPS Business Rules
   maintained separately and approved by ECS SIPT.
       9.24.1.1. For some functional areas, it might not be practical to develop a sourcing plan
       in accordance with the ECS CPS Business rules (e.g. small, centrally-managed and/or
       specialized functional areas). These functional areas will maintain authority to develop
       sourcing solutions; however, they must provide their sourcing plan to AFPC/DPW in
       accordance with established timeline and coordinate their plans with the C-MAJCOMs.
       These functional areas should include overarching sourcing plan in their functional area
       P&S guidance.
       9.24.1.2. Functional areas requiring changes to the ECS CPS across multiple MAJCOMs
       will submit modified sourcing solution from HAF functional director, through AF/A5X,
       to AFPC/CC (ECS SIPT Chair).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             261


  9.24.2. ECS CPS Coordination. The CPS is developed in collaboration with all MAJCOMs.
  After initial development, AFPC/DPW, through ACC, will notify MAJCOMs via their ECS
  SIPT members that the ECS CPS is ready for review noting deviations, if any, to ECS CPS
  sourcing business rules.
  9.24.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will analyze ECS CPS and provide FAMs with their
  equity to review for supportability. HQ AFGSC/A3CW will compile all FAM/2-Ltr
  Directorate inputs to ECS CPS and respond within timelines established.
     9.24.2.1. Component MAJCOMs will info and de-conflict the draft ECS CPS with their
     parent CCDRs so that the ECS CPS can go forward as the Air Force recommended
     sourcing solution to the conventional JFP (JS/J31). The CPS will include the nomination
     of assigned forces (see the GFMIG for further explanation of assigned forces); therefore
     it is imperative that Component MAJCOM A3s ensure that applicable CCDR staff
     agencies are informed and have an opportunity to provide inputs/comments throughout
     the ECS CPS development and coordination process.
  9.24.3. During their review, MAJCOMs will notify applicable AF FP and AFPC of any
  scheduled tasking in the ECS CPS that they cannot fill with readily available forces;
  MAJCOM review will be endorsed by MAJCOM/CV, or designated representative.
  AFPC/DPW will re-source the requirement and notify redirected MAJCOM and AF FP to
  review. If all MAJCOMs state inability to fulfill requirements, AF FP will notify AF/A3/5 of
  need for forced-to-source mitigation (see paragraph 2.6.1).
  9.24.4. Once the ECS CPS review is complete, AFPC/DPW will present to ECS SIPT for
  approval; acceptance by SIPT members indicates MAJCOM acceptance on behalf of their
  MAJCOM/CV. AF FP will use the ECS CPS as the official Air Force recommended ECS
  sourcing solution to the conventional JFP for input into the base GFMAP. AF FP will notify
  the designated JFP of any solutions identified by C-MAJCOMs that the nominated
  supporting CCDR is expected to non-concur with. The designated JFP will coordinate
  sourcing recommendations in accordance with Joint business rules.
  9.24.5. Once SecDef approves the baseline GFMAP, AFPC/DPW will conduct a cross-walk
  of the ECS CPS planning PID with what was ordered in the GFMAP. Once the ECS CPS
  cross-walk/modification is complete, AFPC/DPW will modify the ECS CPS to account for
  emergent requirements and/or changes in UTC availability and migrate ECS CPS data from
  the planning PID to the execution PID no later than 210 days prior to the start of the first FY
  AEF rotation. Once requirements are transferred to execution PIDs, proper coordination is
  required to change SecDef-approved GFMAP sourcing (i.e. change in force provider) before
  modifying the sourcing in execution PIDs. After the baseline ECS CPS is developed, one
  scheduled modification will be conducted to account for changes in requirements and/or
  capabilities.
  9.24.6. One of the basic tenets of AEF is that all individuals/UTCs within a vulnerability
  period must be ready to deploy to the maximum extent possible. Therefore, regardless of
  ECS CPS planned taskings, all units must prepare UTCs for deployment without regard to
  what is scheduled in the ECS CPS. The ECS CPS, however, provides a degree of
  predictability for units and Airmen as well as provides unit commanders expectation of
  taskings they should be prepared to meet. Therefore, MAJCOMs will develop procedures to
  ensure affected units are notified of and acknowledge taskings they are scheduled to fulfill.

  9.24.6. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will provide AFGSC FAMs with the ECS CPS.
  FAMs have the responsibility to notify units and acknowledge taskings they are scheduled to
  fulfill at execution.

                                          Chapter 10

              DEVIATIONS, WAIVERS, AND RECLAMA PROCEDURES

Section 10A—Purpose

10.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to outline the processes, responsibilities, and
approval mechanisms for obtaining waivers to the policies and procedures addressed in this
instruction and AFPD 10-4. For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
   10.1.1. Deviation - a temporary adjustment to published guidance.
   10.1.2. Change - a permanent adjustment to published guidance.
   10.1.3. Waiver - the process of requesting approval for a deviation or change from the
   appropriate approval authority.

Section 10B—Deviations and Waivers

10.2. AEF Operational Policy and Construct. The CSAF determines the Air Force’s
operational policy for meeting and sustaining combatant commander rotational requirements.
The Air Force’s established operational rotation policy requires Airmen to deploy for a baseline
of 179 days. Combatant commander requirements may allow for shorter rotations; e.g. to enable
ARC volunteerism (Note: This rotation policy does not necessarily apply to the Enabler forces;
however the Enabler lead agency must develop a plan to ensure Service and OSD directed
redlines are not violated). Deviations to the operational rotation policy require CSAF approval.
   10.2.1. To enable the AEF operational policy, the CSAF charters AF/A3/5 to organize all
   USAF forces via the AEF construct. The AEF construct places all Air Force capability from
   warfighting organizations into one of the AEF Tempo Bands or the Enabler force. Forces
   aligned in the Tempo Bands are eligible to deploy once during the applicable band’s battle
   rhythm (20, 30, 24, 18, or 12 months for Bands A through E respectively) for a period of 4
   (Band “A”) or 6 (Bands “B through “E”) months. This battle rhythm does not apply to the
   Enabler forces. The Institutional Force will not be postured via UTCs; however, individuals
   assigned to institutional organizations will be given an AEF Indicator (AEFI) which
   corresponds to a specific vulnerability period. Deviations to this construct (e.g. posturing
   Institutional Force in UTCs, posturing associate vice standard UTCs, etc) must be approved
   by AF/A3/5 and will be spelled out in AF/A3/5’s AEF Schedule Planning, Preparation, and
   Posturing Guidance Memo. In all cases, approved deviations must be renewed with each 24-
   month AEF Schedule.
   10.2.2. All waiver requests must be submitted through AF/A5X and AFPC/CC for review
   and submission to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 is responsible for management and execution of the
   AEF schedule.
   10.2.3. (DELETED) .
   10.2.4. (DELETED) .
10.3. Employment of AEF Construct. The AEF is the USAF’s construct for meeting global
CCDR requirements. Employing forces via the AEF construct to meet non-CCDR requirements
 264                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


(e.g. Service-unique requirements, MAJCOM manning assist, etc.) reduces the ability to meet
the global CCDR contingency requirement. Utilizing the AEF construct to meet non-CCDR
requirements may be approved by AF/A3/5 on a case-by-case basis.
   10.3.1. The supported organization requesting use of AEF forces will submit deviation
   request through their owning MAJCOM. MAJCOMs will coordinate with AF/A1 and
   sponsoring HAF DCS (if applicable) prior to seeking A3/5 approval.
   10.3.2. AFPC/DPW will build ULNs in a 08-series PID and source requirements in
   accordance with paragraph 9.3. utilizing only SECAF-retained and/or supported MAJCOM-
   owned forces (e.g. USAFE forces supporting a Service mission in USAFE) (Note: The use
   of 08-series PIDs is for accounting purposes only; USTRANSCOM will not assign lift
   against Service PIDs).

10.5. CAF SIPT Consolidated Planning Order (CPO). This section covers changes to the
CPO in the development of the CPO. Requests to change or deviate from the published CPO are
processed in accordance with paragraph 10.3 Scheduling actions that place an installation’s
resources in more than two AEF rotations must be approved by the VCSAF. Changes or
deviations that impact the forces assigned to combatant commanders prior to the approval of the
comprehensive AEF rotational schedule by the SecDef must be approved by the CSAF.
Approval is effective throughout a single AEF cycle; afterwards a new request must be
submitted.
   10.5.1. Request for changes or deviations to the CPO may be initiated by the supporting
   command, supported command, CAF SIPT member, or Air Staff FAM. The request must
   include rationale with substantiating data.
   10.5.2. After coordination with the CAF SIPT, requests are submitted to the AEFC/CC.
   10.5.3. The AEFC/CC will forward the request to COMACC for endorsement and
   forwarding to AF/ A3/5. AF/A3/5 will, in turn, submit the request to CSAF for approval.
10.6. MAF Schedule. Mobility aviation units support every AEF block/pair providing a portion
of unit capability during each eligibility period. HQ AMC/A3O uses the MAF Schedule Process
to internally develop a detailed schedule for MAF aviation forces, which is approved by
AMC/CC with concurrence of the participating MAJCOMs, in order to support USTRANSCOM
and warfighter requirements. Changes or deviations that impact MAF forces must be coordinated
with applicable MAJCOM and approved by HQ AMC/A3O before approval of the schedule by
AMC/CC, and by the HQ AMC/A3 after approval of the schedule. Changes to the MAF section
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               265


of the SecDef-approved comprehensive AEF rotational schedule must be approved by the
SecDef.
   10.6.1. Request for changes or deviations to the MAF schedule may be initiated by the
   supporting command, supported command, HQ AMC/A3O or Air Staff FAM.
   10.6.2. AMC assigned ECS forces not directly in support of the MAF aviation mission are
   scheduled in accordance with the ECS SIPT Target Base Alignment Template. Any requests
   to change or deviate from the approved ECS Target Base Alignment are processed in
   accordance with paragraph 10.7
10.7. Two-Hit Policy and ECS Target Base Alignment Waiver (Band “A” only). Bases will
be aligned in no more than two AEF pairs per 20-month battle rhythm. Waiver authority to the
two-hit policy is the applicable HAF DCS. A request to deviate from the two-hit policy must
include the anticipated duration of the deviation. In all cases, deviations from the two-hit policy
will be renewed for each AEF Schedule. Note: The two-hit policy is not applicable to ARC units.
   10.7.1. (DELETED) .
   10.7.2. Functional areas will only request a two-hit waiver if anticipated requirements cannot
   be met within the two-hit construct and aligning UTCs across all five pairs will enable a
   functional area to stay in Band “A.”
   10.7.3. The deviation/change request may be initiated by any functional representative
   responsible for AEF posturing or scheduling, i.e., SIPT member, AEFC scheduler,
   MAJCOM FAM, or Air Staff FAM. The Air Staff FAM is responsible for developing the
   waiver request package based on the initiator’s request. For 3-series UTCs, AF/A3O will act
   as the Air Staff FAM.
   10.7.4. AEF alignment deviations or changes will only be processed at the beginning of
   every AEF cycle. Out-of-cycle deviation or change requests can only be requested in cases of
   force structure changes (e.g. CS&P actions, changes in unit missions, etc).
   10.7.5. The deviation/change request package will include the following information, as
   required, as part of the justification.
       10.7.5.1. Degree of deviation: Is deviation for entire functional area or selected skill set
       within the functional area.
       10.7.5.2. Manning Data: Provide authorized, assigned, and average Air Force manning
       level.
       10.7.5.3. Posturing Data: Provide the number of authorizations for each P-code.
       10.7.5.4. Functional Area Abnormalities/Challenges: This could include high percentage
       of lower skill-level individuals, limited number of bases that provide required capability,
       etc.
       10.7.5.5. Historical deployment data: This will include information that supports the fact
       that the career field is sufficiently stressed, such as routine use of EETLs, recurring
       shortfalls, high PERSTEMPO rate, heavy dependence of ARC support, etc.
       10.7.5.6. Anticipated number of requirements for sustainable operations. This will also
       include the number of requirements to meet the AETF FM construct. Note: Even if each
 266                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       AEF pair has sufficient forces to meet anticipated requirements, a deviation may be
       requested if the functional area is significantly "out-of-balance."
       10.7.5.7. Home station impact mitigation strategies. Number/type of personnel required
       to remain at home station to conduct operations, decreased services, deferred actions, etc.
       10.7.5.8. Proposed re-alignment. This could entail adjusting the alignment for a base(s)
       from one AEF pair to another or across multiple AEF pairs.
       10.7.5.9. Anticipated duration of the requested deviation. In all cases, deviations will
       only be effective for one AEF cycle and must be renewed for each cycle.
       10.7.5.10. Any other pertinent information necessary to justify the deviation/change.
   10.7.6. The Air Staff FAM will forward the package to AF/A5XW for review and validation
   prior to formal coordination of the package. AF/A5XW will ensure the request meets the
   criteria for a waiver. The Air Staff FAM will send the validated package to their respective
   functional directorate (three-digit) for recommendation. AF/A5XW will consolidate all
   directorate-endorsed packages and forward to the AEFC for review.
   10.7.7. HAF FAM will coordinate with AF/A5XW prior to submitting to applicable HAF
   DCS for approval.

   10.8.4. (DELETED) .
   10.8.5. (DELETED) .
10.9. Extended Estimated Tour Lengths (EETLs)
   10.9.1. The baseline AEF deployment period (ETL) is 179 days. The Air Force recognizes
   there may be circumstances when EETLs are warranted. However, such tour lengths deviate
   from the AEF operational policy and must be approved by the CSAF. The procedures in
   Chapter 9 will be followed when requesting EETLs. EETL requests must include the
   anticipated amount of time the EETL will be required. In all cases, requests for EETLs will
   be evaluated prior to each AEF cycle.
10.10. AEF Pivot Date. The AEF pivot date is designed to establish the battle rhythm for AEF
scheduled forces. Requests to begin a rotation on a date other than within 15 days of the
established pivot date must be approved by the AEFC/CC.
   10.10.1. The waiver request is submitted by the chairman of the respective SIPT (CAF,
   MAF, or ECS) 180 days prior to the start of each AEF cycle.
   10.10.2. Approved pivot date deviations are effective for the duration of the AEF cycle and
   must be resubmitted each cycle.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               267


10.11. TPFDD Line-level Detail/DRMD Waivers. Prior to submitting a reclama, the tasked
commander will request the deployed group commander waive the requirement that precludes
the unit from filling the tasking (e.g., line remarks, special experience identifier (SEI), grade,
skill level, etc.) or expand substitution rules that will still meet the UTC’s MISCAP.
   10.11.1. The IPR will route the waiver request via message, e-mail, fax, etc., to the deployed
   PERSCO team, in accordance with AFI 36-3802. The written waiver submission will
   include, at a minimum: PID, ULN, line number, UTC, line remarks(s), RDD, ILOC training
   event with inclusive dates, AFSC and specific justification as to why the tasked asset cannot
   fill the specific requirement or DRMD line remark.
   10.11.2. If the deployed group commander approves the waiver request, the unit will be
   notified through the IPR/IDRC and proceed to ready asset for deployment. The tasked
   commander will certify on the tasking letter to the IPR/IDRC that their member is qualified
   and trained to meet the requirement as approved/modified by the deployed group
   commander.
   10.11.3. If the deployed group commander disapproves the waiver request, the IDO will
   continue with or begin the reclama process via RPT as per Section 10C.
   10.11.4. If the TPFDD Line-level Detail/DRMD waiver has not been received within 5 duty
   days of submission (3 days for requirements within 30 days of first movement), the tasked
   unit/wing/MAJCOM is authorized to complete the RPT process by forwarding the RPT
   template to the wing commander/equivalent for a final decision. Such reclamas will include
   information regarding the unanswered waiver request in one of the 3 justification fields.
10.12. Non-Standard or Mid-Tour AEF Rotations (Active Component and Mobilized ARC
only). The Air Force’s standard tour length for AEF rotations is 179 days. Active component
forces tasked to fill either ECS or aviation requirements are expected to fulfill the entire stated
tour length unless a non-standard or mid-tour rotation is approved in advance by the gaining
COMAFFOR. Non-standard rotations will be used to respond to unforeseen crisis development
only. CCDR requirements may necessitate that certain Enabler forces rotate on non-standard
ETLs, and these enabler forces are therefore exempt from the waiver requirements of this
paragraph. ARC rotations in accordance with COMAFFOR personnel rotation policy are also
exempt from the waiver requirements of this paragraph. Procedures for waiver follow:
   10.12.1. MAJCOM/CV will submit requests for ECS or aviation forces to AFPC/CC.
   10.12.2. The request must include specific rationale to substantiate a non-standard or mid-
   tour rotation to include identification of replacement forces.
   10.12.3. Replacement forces must be from the same unit and aligned to the same AEF pair.
   The tasked unit cannot reclama any portion of the rotation they cannot fill as a result of a
   COMAFFOR approved mid-tour swap-out.
   10.12.4. The request must be submitted to the AEFC/CC 120 days prior to the scheduled
   AEF pivot date to allow sufficient time to process and notify the MAJCOM/CV of the
   COMAFFOR decision.
   10.12.5. AFPC/CC will forward the request, through AF/A1, to AF/A3/5 for submission to
   the gaining COMAFFOR for approval.
   10.12.6. The request may be disapproved and returned to the MAJCOM/CV by AF/A3/5.

   10.12.7. Requests for non-standard or mid-tour rotations must include the anticipated
   duration of the swap-out period. In all cases, non-standard or mid-tour rotation deviations
   must be renewed each AEF cycle.
   10.12.8. If non-standard or mid-tour AEF Rotations are approved and supported by the
   AEFC, a new requirement (ULN) will be built in the TPFDD reflecting the rotation.
   10.12.9. The "rotation for cause" functionality. The "rotation for cause" functionality in
   DCAPES was designed to support mission continuance with a one for one (individual
   personnel) substitution of an airman from the supporting unit for administrative actions (e.g.,
   medical profile change).
       10.12.9.1. The Air Force approved the use of the functionality to support ARC volunteer
       teaming/ splitting the 4-month commitment and CSAF approved non-standard AEF
       rotations.
   10.12.10. This functionality will not be utilized in an unauthorized manner to rotate Airmen
   outside of standard AEF rotations. Unauthorized use causes the loss of visibility of the
   combatant commander’s requirement and significantly impacts the Air Force’s verification
   process.
   10.12.11. Unauthorized use also results in the following negative results:
       10.12.11.1. Lack of force provider visibility required for verification.
       10.12.11.2. Delays in the AEF verification process.
       10.12.11.3. Arbitrary loss of personnel accountability.
       10.12.11.4. Arbitrary/unauthorized movement and deployment of forces into and out of
       an AOR.
       10.12.11.5. Inaccurate accounting of airlift and commercial transportation utilization.
   10.12.12. The AEFC is responsible for ensuring AEF rotations are accomplished in
   accordance with air force policy and guidance.
       10.12.12.1. The AEFC will identify to AF/A5XW those organizations that are utilizing
       the functionality in an unauthorized manner.
       10.12.12.2. AF/A5XW will disable access to DCAPES and permissions based on
       identified users.
10.13. AETF Combat Wing Structure. The AETF force module concept is based on the Air
Force’s combat wing structure. Air Force component headquarters will work with the
AETF/NAF and AEFC to structure their forward operating locations into expeditionary units
using the AETF force module template. AF/A3/5 is the approval authority for a deviation or
change to the AETF Combat Wing Structure.
   10.13.1. DELETED
   10.13.2. Approved changes from the AETF combat wing structure are for the duration of the
   activation. In all cases, changes to the AETF combat wing structure will be renewed upon
   reactivation.

10.15. Posturing Tailored UTCs.
   10.15.1. Under limited circumstances, tailored UTCs may be postured in UTC Availability.
   Posturing tailored UTCs in UTC Availability will only be allowed with AF/A5XW
   concurrence and waiver. The Tailored UTC Posturing waiver will only be effective through
   the end of the applicable AEF Cycle.
      10.15.1.1. Typically, the only tailored UTC that will be allowed is where a unit is
      providing the entire manpower portion of the UTC and the entire equipment portion is
      tailored out (reference paragraph 7.17.1.4).
      10.15.1.2. If the force provider plans on posturing the manpower portion of a UTC only,
      a formal waiver is not required. However, the MAJCOM FAM must notify AF/A5XW
      and the Air Staff FAM of their intent to posture a tailored UTC in lieu of an Associate
      UTC.
10.16. Posturing Fragged UTCs.
   10.16.1. Posturing fragmented (fragged) UTCs in UTC Availability will only be allowed
   with AF/ A5XW concurrence and waiver. The "Approval of a Fragged UTC Posturing"
   waiver will only be effective through the end of the applicable AEF Cycle, after which a new
   waiver will have to be submitted.
   10.16.2. MAJCOM FAMs and/or plans offices request the required waiver. The following
   information is required to process the waiver.
      10.16.2.1. The "primary" unit. The primary unit is the unit that will provide the
      preponderance of the capability. If one unit is providing all of the manpower and another
      unit is providing all of the equipment, the manpower-providing unit will be considered
      the primary.
      10.16.2.2. The augmenting unit(s).
      10.16.2.3. Why the primary unit cannot fulfill the entire UTC.
      10.16.2.4. The line level detail for each unit.
      10.16.2.5. The planning document (e.g., DOC Statement, Functional Manager Letter,
      etc.) that operationally links the primary and augmenting units.
      10.16.2.6. If augmenting units are from another MAJCOM, that MAJCOM’s
      concurrence is required.
   10.16.3. All UTC records that make up the whole UTC must have the same UTC, posturing
   code and AEF Library alignment. Also, the sum of the authorizations must constitute an
   entire UTC.
   10.16.4. AF/A5XW, in coordination with applicable Air Staff FAM(s), will review and
   approve request. AF/A5XW will enter the fragged records into the UTC Availability
 270                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   database and inform the MAJCOM FAM, the Air Staff FAM, and, if applicable, augmenting
   MAJCOM FAMs, of the fragged identifier in UTC Availability.

10.19. Dual Posturing Authorizations. Under limited circumstances, dual-posturing of
authorizations in UTC Availability will be authorized with AF/A5XW concurrence and waiver.
The Dual-posturing waiver will only be effective through the end of the applicable AEF Cycle.
   10.19.1. Typically, the only dual-posturing waivers that will be authorized are where forces
   have a unique secondary mission and the UTCs postured for the primary mission cannot be
   utilized to support the secondary mission (e.g. conventional and OPLAN 8044 tasked
   aviation assets).
   10.19.2. The MAJCOM OFAMO, in coordination with applicable Air Staff FAM(s), will
   submit request to AF/A5XW. Justification should include:
       10.19.2.1. Why the primary UTCs cannot be used to fulfill secondary mission.
       10.19.2.2. Proposed measures, to include readiness reporting, to ensure that both UTCs
       could not be tasked simultaneously.
       10.19.2.3. Proposed posturing strategy to readily “flag” records in UTC Availability that
       UTCs are secondary UTCs.

Section 10C—Shortfall, Reclama and UIC Change Process.

10.21. The Shortfall/Reclama/UIC. Change decision process will be initiated as soon as a unit
or applicable MAJCOM is aware that a shortfall condition exists that will prevent deployment of
all or part of the required capability to meet a tasking. Reclamas will only be submitted under
the most extenuating circumstances and when all other actions/options to preclude submitting a
reclama are exhausted. All reclamas initiated at wing level will be approved by the wing
commander, or equivalent; UIC Changes at wing level will be submitted by IDO on behalf of
wing commander. For reclamas and UIC changes initiated at the MAJCOM-level (i.e. prior to
being verified at unit), approval level will be associated with the appropriate Condition type or as
determined by the MAJCOM/CV. (Note: for direct MAJCOM- or HAF-level taskings, the
MAJCOM/HAF will use the same process as the wing/unit, with applicable Director (or first
general officer) endorsement in the wing commander approval/disapproval block of the Reclama
Processing Tool (RPT) for reclamas or division chief for UIC Changes). Units will ensure UTC
Availability (UTA) and ART are accurate at all times in order to minimize shortfall issues. Unit
commanders will ensure reclamas are submitted via RPT as soon as possible to allow
MAJCOMs sufficient time to re-source requirement within timelines depicted in Table 10.2.
The RPT User Manual is available on both RPT websites (NIPR/SIPR).
   10.21.1. Reclama: the process to “request to duly constituted authority to reconsider its
   decision or its proposed action” (JP 1-02).
       10.21.1.1. UIC Change: Although not considered a reclama, wing commanders,
       MAJCOM (or equivalent) FAMs, and HAF FAMs (when HAF/FOA provides centralized
       management of functional area) may request that AEF Operations change the unit
       originally sourced to support a deployment requirement using the Reclama Processing
       Tool (RPT) (see paragraph 10.21.7 for UIC change procedures). Note: AFRC and ANG
       will develop procedures to manage UIC changes internally to enable volunteerism.
   10.21.2. Shortfall: The lack of forces, equipment, personnel, material, or capability
   reflected as the difference between the resources identified as a plan requirement [or Service
   asset] and those apportioned to a combatant commander [or assigned to the Service] for
   planning that would adversely affect the command‘s ability to accomplish its mission. The
   two conditions the Air Force considers a shortfall are (1) the capability is not available at the
   unit (formerly Condition 1-4) or (2) the wing or tasked unit has the capability and sufficient
   personnel to meet requirements as defined by P-coding but deployment of personnel and/or
   equipment would cause a severe mission impact on the wing/unit (formerly Condition 5).
       10.21.2.1. “Capability Not Available. ” Unit does not have personnel assigned and
       trained and/or does not have equipment on-hand and serviceable. For ARC, this will also
       include no volunteers if the tasking was predicated on the assumption of volunteerism;
272                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      however, wing will utilize every possible resource to meet mission requirements agreed
      on at GFM prior to submitting a reclama. If unit has personnel in another AEF
      vulnerability period or within minimum dwell, the unit may submit a reclama as
      “Capability Not Available.” “Capability Not Available” would also be used if the
      requested capability exceeds the unit's requirements for CCDR assigned/committed
      mission (DP/AP) or critical home station requirements (DX/AX), and the MAJCOM has
      not authorized “reach deeper” sourcing.

      10.21.2.2. DELETE.
      10.21.2.3. DELETE.
      10.21.2.4. DELETE.
      10.21.2.5. “Severe Mission Impact. ” Units will submit a reclama via RPT when they
      have the capability as defined by P-coding but deploying the personnel will cause a
      severe mission impact on the wing/unit. A “Severe Mission Impact” reclama will be
      used when there is manning in excess of minimum required for mission accomplishment
      as defined by P-coding (unless waived by appropriate authority (see Table 2.1.)).
      10.21.2.5. (AFGSC) The following procedures apply for all “Severe Mission Impact”
      reclamas submitted by AFGSC units. Each request will include justification to support
      the recommendation to approve or disapprove the reclama and explain why the individual
      and/or unit cannot support the tasking. Clearly state the impact (i.e. loss of funding,
      project over-runs, personnel/unit impacts, etc.) to the unit/home station mission if the
      member deployed. Include the following information as applicable to the tasked unit: 1)
      Number and types of UTCs assigned if applicable; 2) Unit and base military manning (#
      authorized / # assigned for the tasked AFSC, civilian manning and any unique
      circumstances (e.g., individual tasked is assigned to a one-deep position as a GSU); 3)
      Number of personnel (military and civilian) currently deployed and tasked to deploy; and
      4) the projected return date of those currently deployed. AFGSC Units will not submit
      a SMI reclama via RPT until AFGSC/A3CW has reviewed template for validity.
         10.21.2.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) The        owning      Wing     Commander      will
         approve/disapprove all "Severe Mission Impact" reclamas except for HQ AFGSC
         initiated reclamas. The decision will be entered in the “Wing CC/Equivalent
         Recommendation/Remarks” field in the Reclama Processing Tool (RPT). The RPT
         entry will include the name, rank, organization/office symbol, and date of the
         decision.
         10.21.2.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) If the "Severe Mission Impact" is an Institutional
         Force (IF) tasking then the following additional information must be added to the
         Wing CC remarks section in RPT. Taskee‘s Rank Full Name, Taskee‘s SSN,
         Taskee‘s PAS Code, IF Taskee‘s UDC-X Code [X1-X5] in MilPDS, IF requirement‘s
         Tasking Type (from DCAPES), Deferment Stop Date (NGT RDD+6 months, as
         applicable for operational reasons), Taskee‘s MAJCOM unit CC level POC contact
         info and POC Rank/Name/Org/DSN/Email address. If the Severe Mission Impact
         reclama is approved the supervisor is responsible for ensuring the DAV 64
         (Operational Deferment) is applied to the member sourced for the reclama.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          273


        10.21.2.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) The reclama justification must demonstrate “mission
        failure” to the tasked unit if the individual deployed. Key Nuclear Billet (KNB)
        assignments codes on a position is not sole justification for SMI for AFGSC
        units.
        10.21.2.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) "Severe Mission Impact" reclamas that are
        “approved” by the Wing Commander are forwarded to the HQ AFGSC/A3CW and
        HQ AFGSC Functional Directorate to obtain AFGSC/CV final decision.
        10.21.2.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC FAM or MAJCOM will not submit a SMI
        reclama via RPT until AFGSC/A3CW has reviewed template for validity. AFGSC
        FAM or MAJCOM reclamas do not need to be staffed through the IDO or wing
        commander. The AFGSC FAM will fill in the unit commander and IDO fields in
        RPT. The FAM will enter their Director’s approval/disapproval in the Wing
        Commander remarks section. For MAJCOM "Severe Mission Impact" reclamas,
        AFGSC FAM will prepare a staff summary sheet for all reclamas sent to the
        AFGSC/CV for signature.
        10.21.2.5.6. (Added-AFGSC) The MAJCOM Functional Area Manager (FAM)
        must coordinate with HQ AFGSC/A3CW prior to submitting a SMI into RPT with
        the FAM recommendation, supporting documentation and any additional information
        required to ascertain a complete and accurate picture of the situation and mission
        impact. The FAM must obtain HQ AFGSC/A3CW coordination prior to the HQ
        AFGSC 2-Letter Director signing the staff summary to ensure compliance with
        reclama procedures in this instruction. The HQ AFGSC 2-Letter Director evaluates
        the reclama‘ s merits and provides a recommendation to HQ AFGSC/CV.
        10.21.2.5.7. (Added-AFGSC) After the HQ AFGSC 2-Letter Director signs the
        staff summary sheet; the FAM forwards the reclama package to HQ AFGSC/A3CW
        for final coordination to HQ AFGSC/CV for final decision. Immediately after the
        final decision is made by HQ AFGSC/CV, HQ AFGSC/A3CW will make the final
        entry in RPT.
  10.21.3. Wing/Unit Level Reclama & UIC Change Process.
  10.21.3. (AFGSC) Wing/Unit Level Reclama & UIC Change Process “Capability Not
  Available”. For AFGSC, the Vice Commander may also approve/disapprove reclamas if the
  commander is unavailable.
     10.21.3.1. DELETE.
        10.21.3.1.1. Wing commanders will advise parent MAJCOM of activities specified
        by wing or base-level agencies that might restrict or delay AEF operations from either
        home or deployed locations. Recommend alternative plans as required.
        10.21.3.1.1. (AFGSC) Reclama & UIC Change Process when the unit initiates the
        reclama in RPT in the “Unit Commander” block. Minimum data required for entry is
        justification, POC, DSN, and office symbol. AFGSC FAM will act as the IDO
        approver. AFGSC/3-Ltr will approve the Wing CC block and AFGSC/2-Ltr will be
        the MAJCOM approver. The IDO, Wing CC, and MAJCOM blocks in RPT must
        have POC, DSN, and Approve/Disapprove decision.
  274                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


           10.21.3.1.2. Wing commanders will ensure assigned units are aware of current and
           pending taskings identified in execution PIDs and are able to meet all deployment
           taskings. Forward all reclama requests to MAJCOM via RPT.
           10.21.3.1.2. (AFGSC) Units will submit a reclama, when required, in the Reclama
           Processing Tool (RPT) located at the AEF On-Line Secure website and include
           information on any waiver requests submitted by the Installation Personnel Readiness
           (IPR) office. Contact AFGSC A3CW for the current reclama template. Manually
           document the reclama and obtain required signatures for approval/disapproval prior to
           initiating in RPT. Minimum information required in each block is the POC who
           approved the reclama, DSN of POC, and justification of reclama. Units must send an
           information copy of the reclama via RPT e-mail to the applicable AFGSC FAM.
           Tenants and GSUs must notify the host IDO via RPT e-mail to complete required
           DCAPES actions and follow-up with a phone call to ensure receipt.
        10.21.3.2. Unit commander determines if a UTC shortfall exists. If a TPFDD line-level
        detail/DRMD waiver (see paragraph 10.11) cannot be obtained, the unit commander will
        fill out the base-level reclama template via RPT.

                                10.21.3.2.2. For Total Force Integration (TFI) associations, the host unit will
                                coordinate with the associate unit to determine if they can fulfill any of the tasking. If
                                so, the host unit will submit a UIC Change via RPT identifying which positions the
                                associate unit will fill. The UIC Change will be coordinated with both host and
                                associate parent commands and tasking will be through associate unit’s
                                component/MAJCOM. Similarly, if associate unit cannot fulfill a tasking, they will
                                coordinate with host for possible UIC Change.
                                10.21.3.2.3. Request will include confirmation that all unused (fragmented or
                                tailored) portions of postured UTCs and Associate UTCs, as well as overage positions
                                in the current AEF vulnerability window, were reviewed as possible fills and that
                                ART is current/correct for all UTCs per AFPD 10-4. Request will also include
                                manning statistics by UTC for personnel reclamas or equipment UTC status for
                                equipment reclamas. The request will also include complete justification for release
                                (e.g., personnel assigned but not available (include why not available); assigned
                                personnel do not meet requirement qualifications; personnel unavailable because they
                                are assigned to another UTC in another AEF vulnerability period; etc) and mission
                                degradation statement, if applicable.
                             10.21.3.3. The IDO (or equivalent) can fill the requirement with an alternate in the
                             following sequence: associate UTCs in the on-call AEF blocks/pair, unused (fragmented
                             or tailored) portions of standard UTCs in the on-call AEF blocks/pair, or standard UTCs
                             in the on-call AEF blocks/pair that are not already tasked to deploy. If an alternate exists,
                             the IDO will submit a UIC change request to AEF Operations via RPT with an
                             informational copy to the wing commander (or equivalent) and appropriate squadron and
276                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      group commanders (see paragraph 10.21.7 for UIC change procedures). If no alternate
      exists continue to process the shortfall. Note: If ARC associate UTCs are identified the
      tasked IDO will submit a UIC change action as outlined paragraph 10.21.7 to have UIC
      changed to reflect the ARC unit’s UIC filling the tasking. Host IDO and ARC Wing
      Deployment Office (WDO) coordination will occur prior to reclama to minimize
      transition delays and ensure smooth transition. AFRC units will process UIC changes
      and reclamas through their NAFs to AFRC AEF Cell which will forward to AFPC/DPW
      if unable to resolve within the command.
      10.21.3.3. (AFGSC) Individuals considered Institutional Force will not be considered to
      fill an operational UTC tasking requirement unless approved by their Director and/or A3.
         10.21.3.3.1. IDO may convene the Shortfall Validation Team for any reclama
         condition. The team is established by the IDO and consists of members who can
         recommend/identify mitigating steps and/or alternative solutions to the wing
         commander (i.e., Manpower Office, Military Personnel Flight, Plans and Integration
         Office; AFSC Manager, or Logistics Readiness Squadron for equipment). The IDO
         will convene only those members necessary for valid input.
         10.21.3.3.2. IDO endorses the base-level reclama template via RPT to the wing
         commander for base-level approval/disapproval. Include a summary of the Shortfall
         Validation Team‘s recommendation for “Severe Mission Impact” reclamas. A copy is
         provided to the tasked unit.
         10.21.3.3.3. If the DRMD waiver process was initiated and waiver request response
         has not been reviewed within 2-duty days of waiver request submission, the IDO will
         contact the PRF. The IDO will recommend the PRF contact the deployed PERSCO
         team for an answer. If waiver is denied by the deployed group commander, the IDO
         will continue on with the reclama process. The reclama request will include status of
         the DRMD waiver request.
         10.21.3.3.4. IDO forwards Reclama Template package via the Reclama Processing
         Tool to the wing commander by the 5th duty day with recommended alternate or
         mitigation strategies, if applicable. IDO will also send informational copies to
         appropriate squadron and group commanders.
      10.21.3.4. The wing commander will review the Reclama Template within the Reclama
      Processing Tool and determine whether to concur with the reclama or the
      recommendation of the Shortfall Validation Team.
         10.21.3.4.1. If the wing commander nonconcurs with the reclama, The IDO will
         inform the unit of the wing commander’s decision and any necessary actions
         recommended to fill the tasking.
         10.21.3.4.2. If the wing commander concurs with the reclama the IDO will forward
         the base-level reclama template to the MAJCOM AEF Cell for processing via RPT,
         with informational copies to the wing and group commanders (or their equivalents).

  10.21.4. MAJCOM Level Reclama Process.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           277


     10.21.4.1. For UTC taskings directly to the MAJCOM, HAF, or DRU staff, the
     organization will use the same reclama process as the wing/unit, with Director/first
     general officer endorsement in the wing commander approval/disapproval block of RPT
     (Note: reclamas for Institutional Force requirements are sourced using MilPDS sourcing
     and will be re-sourced in accordance with paragraph 14.6.2.).
     10.21.4.1. (AFGSC) MAJCOM-level “Capability Not Available” reclama process starts
     when the tasked organization directorate approves a reclama action. The FAM servicing
     the tasked organization will initiate the reclama in RPT by entering the justification,
     POC, DSN, and office symbol of the approving official in the “Unit Commander” block.
     AFGSC FAM will act as the IDO approver. The AFGSC 3-Ltr Division Chief or Deputy
     approves the Wing CC block and the AFGSC 2-Ltr Director or Deputy is the MAJCOM
     approver. AFGSC FAMs are responsible for coordinating “Severe Mission Impact”
     reclama staff packages and entering the FAM recommendation in RPT in accordance
     with this supplement. All MILPDS sourced reclamas will be staffed by the “named
     AFSC” FAM when the MAJCOM portion of RPT is required.
     10.21.4.2. The MAJCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR) will monitor the AEF
     Cell organizational e-mail box for base-level reclamas and inform the applicable
     MAJCOM FAM(s) of any reclama actions required. The tasked MAJCOM still “owns”
     the tasking until the MAJCOM has submitted a MAJCOM-level reclama to the applicable
     AF FP. The MAJCOM must either submit a UIC Change or submit a MAJCOM-level
     reclama within the timeline depicted in Table 10.2.
     10.21.4.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will monitor RPT daily and immediately
     notify the applicable AFGSC FAM upon receipt of an “approved” reclama from the
     Installation Commander.
        10.21.4.2.1. MAJCOM FAMs must first evaluate whether another unit within the
        MAJCOM can fulfill the tasking to include Enablers and/or assigned/committed
        (DP/AP and DX/AX) thresholds. If the MAJCOM cannot find another unit within the
        MAJCOM to fulfill the tasking, then the MAJCOM will submit a reclama. If a
        replacement unit is determined, MAJCOM AEF Cell (or designated representative)
        will submit a UIC Change to AFPC/DPW via RPT. AFPC/DPW will modify the
        DCAPES execution PID with the new unit. For individuals sourced via MilPDS
        sourcing (i.e. Institutional Force), MAJCOMs are not required to evaluate whether
        another individual in the MAJCOM can fill the tasking.
        10.21.4.2.2. If the MAJCOM does not have a sourcing solution within the
        MAJCOM, they will submit a MAJCOM-level reclama to AFPC/DPW in RPT. For
        “Capability Not Available” reclamas, the MAJCOM/A3 is the approval level; for
        “Severe Mission Impact” reclamas, the MAJCOM/CV is the approval level.
        10.21.4.2.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3 delegated “Capability Not Available”
        approval authority to the AFGSC FAM Directorate responsible for reclama’d asset.
            10.21.4.2.2.1. For Institutional Force, “Capability Not Available” will be used if
            selected individual cannot meet tasked requirements (e.g. restrictive line remarks)
            or individual has a DAV code that precludes the individual selected from
            deploying to the tasked location; any other reclama is considered “Severe Mission
278                                              AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


            Impact.”
            10.21.4.2.2.2. MAJCOM/CV approval of a “Severe Mission Impact” reclama for
            personnel who are sourced via MilPDS data (e.g. Institutional Forces, 365-day
            TDYs) will contain a non-availability start and stop date in RPT not to exceed a
            6-month period from RDD of the applicable reclama tasking. Justification must
            be provided in the RPT Justification (free text) field (see paragraph 10.21.2.5
            above). If no start/stop date is provided, the member will be given a 6-month
            deferment period with a stop date equal to 6 months after the RDD of the
            applicable tasking. For any “Severe Mission Impact” reclama for 365-day TDY,
            AFPC/DPA will update the MilPDS Assignment Availability Code (AAC) “39”
            with the applicable Date of Availability (DOA). The AAC "39" will "freeze" the
            Airman in place for the duration of the deferment period. For all ”Severe Mission
            Impact” reclamas for requirements sourced to Institutional Force, the servicing
            IPR will update deployment availability (DAV) code “64” with the applicable
            DOA.. The DAV Code “64” will “freeze” the Airman in place for the duration of
            the deferment period. These procedures should allow sufficient time for units to
            prepare for the Airman’s potential deployment once the AAC or DAV expires.
            The initiating unit commander may request early removal of the deferment at any
            time by submitting a written request to owning MAJCOM for removal of AAC
            "39" or DAV Code "64.” MAJCOM/CV, or designated representative, will
            determine and authorize removal of these codes.

            10.21.4.2.2.3. If the requirement is greater than 75 calendar days from first
            movement, the MAJCOM-level reclama is forwarded to AFPC/DPW for re-
            sourcing (see paragraph 10.21.5.5). If the requirement is within 75 days, the
            reclama is forwarded through AFPC/DPW to the AF FP for a collaborative
            MAJCOM risk assessment (see paragraph 10.21.5.6.).
            10.21.4.2.2.3. (AFGSC) A summary of “Severe Mission Impact” reclamas are
            briefed to AFGSC/CV during the AEF Debrief.
      10.21.4.3. AFPC/DPW will provide a report to MAJCOM/CVs on all reclamas via the
      MAJCOM/CV debrief.
      10.21.4.4. DELETED.
      10.21.4.5. MAJCOM will ensure a reply, via the Reclama Template, with CV decision to
      AEFC or IDO by the 5th duty day of IDO reclama posting. The AEFC will notify
      MAJCOMs of non-compliance with timeline, by functional area, via an accountability
      metric titled "MAJCOM Timeline Compliance".
      10.21.4.5. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will notify AFPC and IDO of AFGSC/CV
      decision by making the final entry in RPT within the established timeline.
      10.21.4.6. If MAJCOM disapproves the base-level reclama, wing commander is
      informed and the tasked unit will fill requirement.

  10.21.5. AEF Operations Reclama Process: This process is used once a unit/organization
  reclama (or UIC change) is received by AEF Operations.
     10.21.5.1. Entire ULN/UTC Reclama/UIC Change : When the reclama or UIC
     Change is for an entire UTC, AEF Operations, in coordination with the affected force
     provider, will remove the original unit tasking and verification data (PROJ Code) by
     clearing base level tasking code and Social Security Number SSN (if applicable) in
     DCAPES Line Level Detail (LLD) and remove ULN from the applicable verification
     Force Module in DCAPES. This will reset the appropriate trigger fields in DCAPES to
     ensure a clean record is flowed to the new tasked MAJCOM.
     10.21.5.2. Personnel (Line number) Reclama/UIC Change : When the reclama or
     UIC Change is only for a specific line number within the ULN/UTC, AEF Operations
     will remove the original unit tasking and verification data (PROJ code), update the PAS
     information in DCAPES. This will allow new MAJCOM authentication/pre-verification,
     verification and flow to the base updating the tasking information. This ensures visibility
     of actions taken at all levels.
     10.21.5.3. Equipment Reclama/UIC Change : When the reclama or UIC Change
     request is submitted for just the equipment portion of the ULN/UTC the AEF Operations
     Functional Area Scheduler will review the residual capability in the on-call AEF libraries
     to see if a whole UTC is available. When a whole UTC is not available, AEF Operations
     will frag the UTC (i.e., personnel on one frag with original sourcing and verification
     retained and equipment on another frag.) AEF Operations will apply a new UIC in
     DCAPES to the equipment frag.
     10.21.5.4. In some cases a previously accepted tasking may require a Reclama or UIC
     Change (e.g. medical emergency) to be submitted and the ULN is already locked by
     TRANSCOM (SSF code in JOPES/DCAPES). The AEF Operations Reclama Manager
     will post a newsgroup to the applicable component headquarters requesting the ULN be
     unlocked for re-sourcing. Once the ULN is unlocked AEF Operations will follow re-
     sourcing procedures.
     10.21.5.5. Re-Sourcing Process. If the first movement date is greater than 75 calendar
     days from when AFPC receives the reclama from the MAJCOM, the following will be
     used. If the first movement date is 75 days or less, AFPC/DPW will notify the applicable
     AF FP of the need for an expedited collaborative sourcing solution (see paragraph
     10.21.5.6.).
        10.21.5.5.1. After the MAJCOM/CV (for Severe Mission Impact reclamas),
        MAJCOM/A3 (for “Capability Not Available” reclamas), or wing commander (for IA
        taskings to operational units (see Table 10.2., Note 2)) approves and submits a
        reclama to AFPC/DPW, AFPC/DPW, on behalf of the applicable AF FP will re-
        source requirements in accordance with the ECS sourcing business rules (see
        paragraph 9.9) within timelines depicted in Table 10.2. In order to provide a viable
        sourcing solution, AFPC/DPW, after approval from appropriate HAF DCS, may
        develop a sourcing solution using a mitigation plan that utilizes a combination of (1)
        full or unused portions of fragged or tailored UTCs from the available Enabler
        libraries, (2) UTCs from the next AEF block/pair, (3) mobilized ARC forces, and/or
280                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


         (4) AFSCs from the Institutional Force, in the current AEF vulnerability period, that
         could be aggregated into a UTC (see paragraph 8.14.8.2.2 for details).
             10.21.5.5.1.1. Once a requirement has been re-sourced, redirected MAJCOM will
             verify in accordance with paragraph 8.14.9. and subparagraphs (Note: For UIC
             Changes, MAJCOM will choose whether they want AFPC to verify the new
             sourcing or not via the Yes/No choice field in RPT).
             10.21.5.5.1.2. If the redirected sourcing will result in a change to the GFMAP,
             applicable AF FP will coordinate with designated JFP to affect a GFMAP Mod or
             administrative change in accordance with established GFM process.

      movement date is 75 days or less from when AFPC/DPW receives a MAJCOM reclama
      via RPT.
         10.21.5.6.1. AFPC/DPW will evaluate whether or not the capability exists in another
         MAJCOM(s). If so, they will notify the applicable AF FP and provide a list of
         potential sourcing solutions within the timeframe depicted in Table 10.2.
         10.21.5.6.2. Applicable AF FP vice commander will direct owning MAJCOM/CVs
         of potential sourcing solution to provide forced-to-source assessments within the
         timeline depicted in Table 10.2.
         10.21.5.6.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3CW will send the appropriate FAM the AF
         FP’s Collaborative Resourcing request with identified ULN’s for assessing. The
         FAM will assess all ULNs in the spreadsheet and provide AFGSC/A3CW their
         assessment and recommended sourcing solution within the suspense date provided.
         AFGSC/A3CW will forward assessment and recommendation to AF FP within the
         suspense timeline. Risk assessments will be categorized as either “Low” – No or
         minimal impact to mission; “Moderate” – Likely to accomplish all missions with
         some difficulty; “Significant” – Substantial impact to mission but may be able to fill
         with significant work around; or “High” – Unable to accomplish all missions; will
         require extraordinary measures to accomplish some missions. AFGSC FAM must
         obtain their director/deputy director approval of any “significant” or “high” risk
         assessments. HQ AFGSC/CV has delegated this authority. ECS SIPT member

        (AFGSC/A3CW) submits the risk assessment and potential sourcing solutions to the
        applicable AF FP.
        10.21.5.6.3. If MAJCOM(s) provides “Low” or “Medium” forced-to-source
        assessment, AF FP will notify applicable MAJCOM and AFPC/DPW of identified
        sourcing solution and coordinate with designated JFP to change the GFMAP, if
        required. Redirected MAJCOM will verify in accordance with paragraph 8.14.9. plus
        subparagraphs.
        10.21.5.6.4. The AF FP will notify AF/A3/5 if all MAJCOMs have provided a
        “Significant” or “High” forced-to-source assessment and recommend a Service
        reclama or forced-to-source solution in accordance with paragraph 8.14.8.2.2. and

  10.21.7. UIC Change Process. After verification, the IDO submits UIC changes on behalf of
  the wing commander (or equivalent). A unit replacement must be from the same wing and
  aligned in the same AEF vulnerability period as the originally tasked unit. If the UIC
  Change is between two units in a TFI association, the host IDO should include this
  information in RPT to expedite AFPC’s processing of the change request. If the deployment
  tasking has not been verified and the MAJCOM has an alternate sourcing recommendation,
  then the AEF Cell submits UIC changes that must be from the same MAJCOM and AEF
  vulnerability period. Personnel moves between AEF blocks/pairs to fill taskings must be
  approved by the MAJCOM/CV or equivalent (not applicable to ARC).
  10.21.7. (AFGSC) AFGSC FAMs may submit a UIC change in RPT prior to verification of
  a tasking requirement ULN. AFGSC FAMs may also recommend a UIC change following a
  wing “approved” reclama by entering the necessary information in the “MAJCOM FAM
  Recommendation” field in RPT.
      10.21.7.1. Although DCAPES permissions provide the ability to change a UIC at wing
      level, installations will only use that capability during wing exercises. IDOs will submit
      a change request via RPT only after completing formal coordination between affected
      unit commanders. The IDO must place coordination remarks in the justification block
      when submitting the request.
         10.21.7.1.1. There are situations (e.g. TCN Escort) when a wing or MAJCOM is not
         required to complete UIC changes in RPT. Contact the Reclama Manager at AEF
         Operations for these exceptions.
      10.21.7.2. The AEF Operations Functional Area Scheduler, upon receipt of a valid
      change request will change the UIC in DCAPES, relieving the originally tasked unit of
      the requirement and reset the appropriate trigger fields in DCAPES to ensure a clean
      record is flowed (i.e., clearing base level tasking code and SSN in DCAPES LLD). Until
      relieved, the originally tasked unit will continue to take all measures to fulfill the
      requirement. The AEF Operations Functional Area Scheduler will re-source the
      requirement within 2 days to allow sufficient notification for the newly sourced unit.
  10.21.8. UIC Change for Individuals Sourced via MilPDS Method. The tasked force
  provider may provide an alternate sourcing solution by making a UIC/name change within
  established timeframes via RPT (see paragraph 9.8.1. and Table 10.2.). The individual
  initially selected by AFPC/DPW remains eligible for future requirements unless personal
  data changes affect eligibility or the commander submits an operational deferment request
  (see AFI 36-2110, attachment 24). Note: For organizations “outside” the Air Force,
  servicing IDRCs will not change the UIC/name without prior approval from AFPC.
  10.21.8. (AFGSC) If the individual initially selected by AFPC/DPW is unavailable to
  deploy, the tasked unit will initiate a reclama. The installation may replace the individual

  tasked with a volunteer and complete a UIC/name change. This does not relieve the original
  individual from another tasking in the future unless UIC change was due to a DAV. This
  paragraph does not apply to Institutional Forces.

                             ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Section 11A—Purpose

11.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines roles and responsibilities of all agencies involved in the
planning and execution of deployment operations. Unless stated otherwise, either within this or
any other instruction, responsibilities of designated individuals may be delegated to a lateral or
subordinate organization.

Section 11B—Background

11.2. Background. The increasing global demand for Air Force capabilities precludes the Air
Force from effectively meeting all combatant commander needs with combat coded units
apportioned for planning purposes. The U.S. Air Force has transformed the way it meets current
and emerging national security objectives by centrally managing all Air Force forces in order to
meet a combatant commander’s needs with both theatre assigned forces and forces assigned to
other combatant commanders. The global management of all Air Force forces requires
coordination and cooperation between the Department of Air Force, the Joint Staff, and
combatant commanders to ensure the effective deployment of Air Force capabilities. The roles,
responsibilities, and expectations of the various parties are outlined in this chapter.

Section 11C—Direction

11.3. Secretary of Defense (SecDef). The SecDef is the principal defense policy adviser to the
President and is responsible for the formulation of general defense policy and policy related to
all matters of direct concern of the Department of Defense and for the execution of approved
policy. Under the direction of the President, the Secretary exercises authority, direction, and
control over the Department of Defense.
   11.3.1. The SecDef is in the operational chain of the Unified Commands and therefore
   assigns, approves, and directs missions of the unified combatant commanders (UCC) in
   support of national security objectives. The SecDef also approves combatant commander
   requests for forces/requests for capabilities (RFF/RFC) needed to accomplish assigned
   missions. In accordance with Global Force Management (GFM) policy, the SecDef is
   responsible for the Global Force Management Schedule (GFMS), which directs forces
   available to combatant commanders. Each Service is responsible for developing an annex to
   the GFMS indicating their plan for supporting the global requirements of all combatant
   commanders. The Air Force comprehensive AEF rotational schedule conveys the U.S. Air
   Force’s plan for supporting both the build up of forces in support of the range of military
   operations (ROMO) and rotational operations designed to sustain the combatant
   commander’s mission over a period of time. This schedule is included in the WMP 3, Part 4.
   11.3.2. Once the GFMS is approved by the SecDef, it is authoritative and directive to all
   military departments and commands involved in the planning and deployment of forces.
   Changes to the annex affecting the scheduling of forces assigned to a combatant commander
   must be coordinated through the CJCS to SecDef. The SecDef approves and directs the U.S.

exercises, inspections, PME, etc.,) with the AEF battle rhythm to ensure forces are ready during
their scheduled AEF deployment period. MAJCOM must ensure subordinate units understand
their primary objective during their scheduled deployment period is to make the maximum
capability available. MAJCOM commanders and FAMs will clearly identify to subordinate
agencies and organizations those operational or support activities that may be suspended,
delayed, closed, consolidated, or outsourced during their fore- casted deployment windows.
MAJCOM FAMs must maintain close coordination with their Air Staff FAM and the AEFC to
ensure the application of UTCs to the AEF construct is consistent with the actions of similar
FAMs in other commands. They are also responsible for executing and supplementing Air Staff
FAM posturing and coding guidance. See Chapter 12 for specific MAJCOM FAM

activities must be suppressed or suspended during this period. Wing and base-level organizations
will synchronize planned activities (e.g., training, exercises, inspections, PME, non-deployment
related TDYs, leaves, etc.,) with the AEF battle rhythm to ensure forces are ready during their
scheduled AEF deployment period. Deploy whole UTC teams with the expectation that home
station will be significantly impacted during AEF deployments. Develop and implement
concepts of operation (CONOPs) and supporting plans to allow functional areas to make the
maximum capability available during their deployment period (i.e., use IMAs, execute services
 306                                                     AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


contracts, defer work orders, use civilian over hires, close, consolidate, or defer activities, etc., to
mitigate impact of "giving until it hurts.")
    11.18.1. Wing Commander. Provides guidance to groups and squadrons as to operational
    imperatives and identifies functions that may reduce operations during AEF deployments.
    Responsible for training within the wing. Certifies wing’s combat capability through ART.
    Advises MAJCOMs of activities specified by wing or base-level agencies that might restrict
    or delay AEF operations from either home or deployed locations. Recommends alternative
    plans as required. Ensure every reasonable attempt is made to meet taskings with ready and
    trained forces. Based on recommendations of MAJCOM FAMs, validates P-coding of
    assigned UTCs.

        able to meet all deployment taskings as identified in execution PIDs. Forwards reclamas
        or UIC changes to MAJCOM when unit is unable to meet tasking.
        11.18.1.2. When designated as a pilot unit by the MEFPAK Responsible Agency OPR,
        responsible for developing and maintaining standard manpower and logistics detail for
        each UTC it has been assigned. Detailed pilot unit responsibilities are outlined in
        Chapter 5.
    11.18.2. Squadron Commander. Ensures assigned personnel meet mission training
    requirements and plan for deployment in accordance with AFI 10-403 and this directive.
    Responsible for identifying personnel to UTCs and ensuring the status of those UTCs are
    accurately reflected in ART. Responsible for rotational cycle equity at the unit level. Advises
    wing commander of resource changes that may impact unit capabilities. Ensure all personnel
    are given an appropriate AEFI in MilPDS (Note: Reserve components will determine
    component-specific AEFI policy). Unit commanders will implement and ensure compliance
    with the following guidance.
        11.18.2.1. Commanders will give all unit members a specific AEFI code in MilPDS
        within 15 days of being assigned to the unit. For units with postured UTCs, the AEFIs
        must correspond to the AEF block/pair alignment in UTA.
        11.18.2.2. Once associated with an AEF, individuals will remain in the same AEF for the
        duration of their assignment to the unit except as outlined in paragraph 14.4.1. Waiver
        authority for this requirement is the MAJCOM vice commander (MAJCOM/CV) or
        equivalent. (Exception: Individuals may be moved from the Enabler force to one of the
        Tempo Band AEF blocks without MAJCOM/CV waiver). Establish procedures to ensure
        all unit personnel are associated with an AEF in MilPDS. The AEF association for
        individuals who voluntarily deploy outside their associated AEF is not changed in
        MilPDS.
        11.18.2.3. Commanders will not select individuals outside their associated AEF
        deployment period to fill UTC taskings without first gaining a MAJCOM/CV waiver.
        Approved waivers must be maintained on file in the unit. (Not applicable to ARC
        members)
        11.18.2.4. If unable to fill AEF requirements, AEF reclama rule sets apply. See Chapter
        10. Note: Reclamas will only occur under the most extenuating circumstances and
        require MAJCOM/ CV approval. Reclamas are minimized when UTC Availability and
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          307


     ART are properly maintained. Units will ensure UTC Availability and ART are accurate
     and up to date.
     11.18.2.5. Unit commanders must continue to update MilPDS to capture newly gained
     and departing personnel. AEF temporary duty (TDY) history should be considered when
     assigning new personnel to an AEF. Commanders should attempt to assign gained
     personnel to the latest AEF deployment period in the current AEF cycle. Each
     individual’s TDY history can be found in the Tempo Management and Tracking System
     (TMTS) on the AFPC web page.
     11.18.2.6. Where a member has recently deployed, the gaining commander will not
     assign the individual to a position that would require the individual to deploy violating
     CSAF deploy-to-dwell redlines (EXCEPTION: Does not apply to capability areas
     aligned in Tempo Band “E”). MAJCOM/CV or equivalent must approve deployment of
     newly allocated individuals (PCA/PCS actions) with less than the 1:2 rotational
     requirements. Commanders must continually track individual tempo rates and gain
     appropriate approval to deploy prior to exceeding SECAF established tempo thresholds.
     11.18.2.7. Commanders should make every reasonable effort to de-conflict Professional
     Military Education (PME) and AEF deployment periods. A scheduled AEF deployment
     is not justification for an operational deferment from officer PME. As Air Force resident
     PME is restructured to allow multiple start times throughout the year, more flexibility
     will be available to de-conflict PME with scheduled AEF eligibility windows.
     11.18.2.8. The Air Force assignment process will be managed to coincide with the AEF
     rhythm to the maximum extent possible. Commanders will make every effort to schedule
     voluntary PCS/ PCA departure dates, terminal leave dates for retirement, and separation
     dates, to occur during the3-month period immediately following the unit’s deployment
     eligibility period. See AFPD 10-4, paragraph 6.2.1 and AFI 36-2110, Chapter 4
     (paragraph 4.6 and Table 4.2).
     11.18.2.9. Commanders will ensure the timely and accurate reporting of unit and UTC
     readiness status in SORTS and ART, respectively.
     11.18.2.10. For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) filling AEF taskings, the
     Program Manager verifies qualification to mobilization standards (Individual Medical
     Readiness (IMR), fully qualified in AFRC and current security clearance). IMAs must
     out-process through the local PRU in accordance with governing directives and
     regulations. If the AD unit commander approves the individual to deploy, the commander
     also accepts responsibility to train, ready and equip the member to deployment standards,
     regardless if the individual is mobilized or volunteers. The assigned unit, Personnel
     Readiness Facility, Supply Section, Chem training/issue, Firing Range, etc, where the
     IMA is assigned need to work with the equivalent organizations at the nearest AFB to the
     IMA's home of record to ensure deployment specific training, just-in-time training,
     individual equipment supply, and weapon's issue occur in a timely manner in the best
     interests of AF when it is not conducive to have IMA completely process through unit of
     assignment.

                      THE FUNCTIONAL AREA MANAGER (FAM)

Section 12A—Purpose

12.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines the general management, roles, responsibilities, and
training (formal, suggested and required) of Air Force Functional Area Managers (FAMs). More
detailed FAM responsibilities and actions relative to the specific processes described in this
instruction are found in other chapters in this document.

Section 12B—Background

12.2. Functional Area Managers. The FAM is the principal advisor to their respective
commander/functional director/DCS on the management and oversight of all personnel and
equipment within a specific functional area to support operational planning and execution.
Commanders, managers, and supervisors at all levels must ensure the right people are selected to
be FAMs based upon knowledge and experience. In order for FAMs to be efficient and effective
as well as enable them to respond to time-sensitive planning requirements, commanders,
managers, and supervisors must ensure that once selected, FAMs are provided the tools, time,
and training required to do their job.
   12.2.1. DELETED.
12.3. Relationship Between the FAM and Commanders. FAM responsibilities may include
developing and reviewing policy; developing, managing and maintaining UTCs; developing
criteria for and monitoring readiness reporting; and force posturing and analysis activities which
are crucial to the management and execution of our Air Force readiness programs. Commanders
at all levels (to include DCSs and functional directors) are ultimately responsible for the
decisions affecting the readiness, deployment, and employment of their functional area.
Commanders will work closely with their FAMs to appropriately address risk and make
decisions beneficial to the Air Force and Airmen. The FAM’s continual involvement in the
planning process is essential to accomplishing the Air Force’s mission. *12.3.1. DELETED
   12.3.1. FAM definition. The FAM is the individual accountable for the management and
   oversight of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support
   operational planning and execution. Responsibilities may include developing and reviewing
   policy; developing, managing and maintaining UTCs; developing criteria for and monitoring
   readiness reporting; force posturing, analysis, and execution activities which are crucial to
   the management and execution of our AF readiness programs.
   12.3.2. In some functional areas, the individual assigned as the FAM may also perform
   duties as the Career Field Manager (CFM).
       12.3.2.1. CFMs ensure development, implementation, and maintenance of Career Field
       Education and Training Plans (CFETP) for their assigned Air Force specialties. AFCFMs
       communicate directly with MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM), ARC, and AETC
       TPM to disseminate Air Force and career field policies and program requirements. For
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                               309


       more information on the role of the CFM, refer to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
       Program.
       12.3.2.2. The FAM and CFM must work closely together to ensure functional area
       manpower, training, and sustainment support functional area readiness requirements.
   12.3.3. FAMs and CFMs are vital components to effectively managing programs within their
   MAJCOM. However, it is essential MAJCOM programming, command and control,
   readiness, AEF scheduling, requirements, and planning functions assist the FAM in the
   accomplishment of their duties.
12.4. Where are FAMs? Within the planning and execution process, FAMs are found at
the HAF, MAJCOM/ANG, and component headquarters. Some DRUs and FOAs will also
have FAMs. Specific roles and responsibilities for HAF, MAJCOM, and component FAMs are
detailed in paragraphs 12.8. through 12.10, respectively.
   12.4.1. Headquarters Air Force: The HAF FAMs are responsible for all wartime planning
   policies and procedures that affect the entire functional area. They oversee all aspects of the
   planning process and must fully understand the responsibilities of both the supported and
   supporting command functional planners.
   12.4.2. Supporting MAJCOM and ANG FAMs: Supporting MAJCOM and ARC FAMs
   play a vital role in the operational planning and execution process. They (1) keep track of the
   availability of forces and equipment, (2) provide UTC availability to MAJCOM war planners
   and AFPC/DPW functional schedulers, (3) track readiness status and training levels, and (4)
   coordinate with other FAMs on all wartime and exercise matters that affect their functional
   area. FAMs, working through their MAJCOM directorates (or equivalent) and in
   coordination with subordinate wing and unit commanders, advise their commanders on
   which unit(s)/individual(s) or type and amount of equipment should be selected to fill
   TPFDD requirements.
   12.4.3. Component Headquarters: Supported component headquarters FAMs are an
   integral part of the contingency and crisis action planning processes, particularly in execution
   and sustainment operations. They are responsible for advising commanders on implementing
   Air Force policy to meet CCDR requirements. Supported component headquarters FAMs
   maintain contact with like FAMs at all levels to maintain continuity.
   12.4.4. Unit Level. At the unit level, the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) and the unit
   deployment managers (UDMs) are responsible for day-to-day management of unit functions.
   Many of their responsibilities are accomplished with the assistance of other unit agencies
   such as the logistics, manpower, personnel, or operations plans office. While these
   individuals perform duties IAW AFI 10-403 that are closely related to FAM duties and
   responsibilities, they are not technically considered FAMs.

Section 12C—Guidance

12.5. FAM Appointment. FAMs play a significant part in the Air Force operation planning
process and their continual involvement in the war planning process is essential to accomplishing
the Air Force’s wartime mission.
 310                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


12.5. (AFGSC)FAM Appointment. HQ AFGSC functional areas with deployable forces will
identify primary and alternate FAMs in writing to HQ AFSGC/A3CW. FAMs are appointed by
their division chief (3-letter) or deputy division chief.
   12.5.1. Managers and supervisors will ensure only the most highly knowledgeable and
   experienced people in the grade of E-7 and above are selected and assigned to be FAMs.
   With Office of FAM Oversight (OFAMO) prior concurrence, managers and supervisors may
   assign individuals in the grade of E-6.
   12.5.2. When unit manning allows, commanders, managers and supervisors will consider
   appointing a civilian to serve as either the primary or alternate FAM to preserve functional
   area continuity.
       12.5.2.1. Contractors will not be appointed primary FAM. In addition, MAJCOMs/HAF
       directors should not plan to use contractors as FAMs during absences of primary FAM.
   12.5.3. DELETED.
   12.5.4. The FAM’s integral role in Air Force operations requires that FAM duties and
   responsibilities take precedence over all other additional duties.
   12.5.5. Immediately upon assignment as a FAM or to the OFAMO, individuals must become
   a           member              of          the          FAM              CoP           at
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AF-LG-00-05. The FAM
   CoP hosts the FAM roster, access to FAM training links as well as tools and systems
   applicable to the duties of a FAM. The CoP provides a forum for FAM communication,
   updates, meeting notifications, policy and guidance changes, as well as access to the FAM
   database and FAM web-based training (WBT).
   12.5.6. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC FAMs must be capable of operating under all types of
   battle staff configurations from response cell up to fully manned battle staff. HQ
   AFGSC/A3C ensures FAM training in battle staff through periodic exercises.
   12.5.7. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A3 has the responsibility to provide a FAM (and
   alternate) for every AFGSC-assigned Mission Design Series (MDS) as well as Air and Space
   Operation Center (AOC) and Air Force Forces UTCs. AFGSC/A3 is responsible to assign
   the A-UTC rated FAM duties to an A3 rated officer (or formerly rated GS or Contract
   Manpower Equivalent [CME]).
12.6. Office of FAM Oversight (OFAMO). To facilitate the appointment, identification, and
training of FAMs, HAF directorates, MAJCOM/CV (or equivalent), components, and all other
agencies with FAMs will designate an OFAMO, in writing, to the AF/A3/5. These offices will
ensure appointed FAMs are capable of efficiently and effectively conducting their
responsibilities (Note: FOAs and DRUs which, due to their size and functional organization
have no assigned FAMs, may designate a commander’s representative (vice appointing an
OFAMO) to manage AEF-related activities).
   12.6.1. AF/A5XW is designated the Air Force Office of FAM Oversight and AF/A1PR is
   designated as the OFAMO-Personnel (OFAMO-P). In these roles they will intercede when
   needed to address problems between HAF FAMs and MAJCOM, component, FOA, DRUs,
   and all other agencies’ OPR.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         311


  12.6.2. Below the Air Staff, the OFAMO, along with office responsible for UTC
  management, i.e. MEFPAK Responsible Agency OPR, should be in the same directorate.
  Whenever there is MAJCOM staff disagreement on FAM responsibilities, the OFAMO will
  be the final arbitrator and decision authority (per MAJCOM/CV authority) as to which
  Directorate or Agency in the MAJCOM will be the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
  for any UTC or UTC series.
     12.6.2.1. The OFAMO will assist in scheduling FAM training requirements, determining
     additional training requirements, and tracking appointment status of all FAMs in the
     command or agency.
     12.6.2.2. Air Staff and MAJCOM/ARC directorates, component directorates, FOAs,
     DRUs, and all other agencies with FAMs, will designate in writing to their respective
     OFAMO, a primary and alternate FAM for each functional area. The appointment letter,
     signed by the commander or equivalent, must include name, rank, office symbol, phone
     number, email and functional area of responsibility. See Table 5.1 for functional areas.
     12.6.2.3. In some functional areas, it may be necessary to appoint more than one FAM to
     effectively manage a large or complex functional area. For example, in the JFXXX UTC
     series (Fuels and Supply) appointment of one FAM to manage Fuels and one FAM to
     manage Supply may be necessary.
     12.6.2.4. The OFAMO, working with their MAJCOM or equivalent OPRs, will ensure
     all FAMs have access to systems and tools required to perform their duties.
         12.6.2.4.1. This includes, but is not limited to GCCS and SIPRNET access, which
         will be loaded on each FAM’s desktop computer where feasible. GCCS access is
         required to access DCAPES.
     12.6.2.5. At a minimum, the OFAMO will hold quarterly FAM meetings to discuss FAM
     issues disseminate policy and guidance and/or conduct MAJCOM specific training.
     Issues that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM level will be forwarded to AF/A5XW for
     review and action as necessary. The OFAMO will act as the facilitator for cross-
     functional UTC matters (e.g., 9AAX HQ UTCs).
     12.6.2.6. The OFAMO will maintain a current roster of FAMs for their organization. The
     current roster will be based upon Directorate FAM Appointment Letters that will be
     maintained by the OFAMO. The FAM Directorate appointment letter will mandate
     FAMs to attend meetings and conferences scheduled by the OFAMO.
         12.6.2.6.1. The OFAMO will maintain a database of current FAMs to determine
         formal and informal training. For new FAMs, the OFAMO will provide an in-
         processing checklist. Specifics in the checklist will be determined by the OFAMO.
  12.6.3. The OFAMO initiates action with the respective Manpower function to ensure the
  UMD positions of assigned FAMs are coded to reflect the R-prefix.
  12.6.4. The OFAMO serves as the critical interface between FAMs and the other staff
  readiness support offices. Readiness support offices are defined as those traditional "X"
  functions (operations, logistics, manpower, and personnel) and readiness program OPRs such
  as readiness reporting (SORTS/ART), MEFPAK, or Reserve management. The OFAMO:
     12.6.4.1. Intercedes to address problems between FAMs and program OPRs.
 312                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       12.6.4.2. Develops command supplemental policies to ensure the smooth application of
       this instruction with command-unique requirements.
       12.6.4.3. Establishes and directs protocols for ensuring readiness support offices and
       FAMs achieve their responsibilities as efficiently as possible.
   12.6.5. The OFAMO, upon receipt of the AF/A3/5 Cycle Posturing Guidance message, will
   coordinate with MAJCOM FAMs to ensure force posturing activities are accomplished in
   accordance with established timelines. OFAMOs may provide MAJCOM-specific
   supplemental guidance for MAJCOM FAMs to follow.
12.7. General FAM Responsibilities. FAMs at each level are concerned with the same broad
planning areas; however, the specific activities accomplished at each level are unique. FAM
duties and responsibilities are listed below. Note: Organizations may assign limited FAM
responsibilities to other organizations (e.g., operations planning office). When this occurs, the
FAMs must remain fully engaged in all functional area matters and the assigned organization
must comply with this FAM guidance. For organizations above base level, each division or
division equivalent may decide to establish an AEF Cell to coordinate the below requirements
listed more effectively. Attend required training to perform daily responsibilities and duties
within 3 months of FAM appointment or as directed by the OFAMO.
12.7. (AFGSC)General FAM Responsibilities. HQ AFGSC/A3CW, as the HQ AFGSC
OFAMO, will assist the HQ AFGSC FAMs in the accomplishment of their responsibilities
especially in the areas of Joint and AF contingency and crisis action planning and execution
processes and procedures and actions involving use of Joint and AF Command and Control
Systems (JOPES and DCAPES).
   12.7.1. Provide Functional Area Guidance. FAMs, with approval of appropriate
   functional director, develop guidance, consistent with paragraph 7.9.1.2, with the primary
   purpose of maximizing their functional area’s operational readiness and responsiveness to
   mission requirements. When drafting functional guidance, FAMs should consider the needs
   of the supported commander, the availability of CCDR-assigned forces, the ability of a
   functional area to implement the guidance, the effect the guidance will have on the
   supporting command, and the degree to which the guidance will enhance the readiness and
   availability of personnel and equipment.
   12.7.2. Interpret, develop, and apply joint, Air Force, MAJCOM, or Air Force
   Component operational/exercise planning and execution policies.
       12.7.2.1. FAMs at all levels should have an understanding of Air Force doctrine and
       policies regarding Air Force force presentation and the planning policies, processes and
       systems used to support the joint planning process.
       12.7.2.2. FAMs at all levels will use DCAPES for all facets of Air Force war planning
       and execution.
   12.7.3. OPLAN/OPORD development.
       12.7.3.1. FAMs at all levels will stay fully engaged and involved with end to end
       TPFDD management processes to establish proper integration and harmonization at all
       functional levels, to include actual responsibilities to perform tasks and ensure proper
       actions.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            313


     12.7.3.2. FAMs at all levels will ensure they routinely check applicable newsgroups to
     stay engaged in actions relative to their functional community.
  12.7.4. Unit Type Code (UTC) development, management, and maintenance activities.
     12.7.4.1. FAMs at all levels will be familiar with and understand their roles and

     stay engaged in actions relative to their functional community.
  12.7.5. Force posturing activities.
     12.7.5.1. FAMs at all levels will be familiar with and understand guidance and
     procedures for the posturing of Air Force capabilities in UTCs. This process is outlined in
     Chapter 7.
  12.7.6. Develop criteria for readiness reporting and monitoring.
     12.7.6.1. FAMs at all levels will be familiar with and understand guidance and
     procedures for force readiness reporting and monitoring. This includes Status Of
     Resources and Training System (SORTS) criteria and reporting in accordance with AFI
     10-201 and AEF Reporting Tool (ART) criteria and reporting, in accordance with AFI
     10-244.
     12.7.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Prior to coordinating with AFPC/DPW Functional
     Scheduler on a tasking assigned, AFGSC FAMs will check and verify status of the
     UTC(s) in ART.
     12.7.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Problems identified in the ART database must be
     immediately reported to the AFGSC ART Manager (A3CW).
     12.7.6.4. (Added-AFGSC) Ensure personnel designated to support postured UTCs have
     AEFIs consistent with the postured UTCs.
  12.7.7. Perform execution activities.
     12.7.7.1. FAMs at all levels must ensure the TPFDD accurately reflects and is consistent
     with resources that actual units will deploy.
     12.7.7.2. FAMs at all levels, when acting as force providers, will use DCAPES and the
     Air Force Verification Capability (AFVC) tool to support sourcing and verification
     process for their responsible forces.
     12.7.7.3. FAMs at all levels, when acting as force providers, will ensure timelines
     established to support the sourcing, verification, and validation processes are met.
     12.7.7.4. FAMs at all levels will ensure they routinely check applicable newsgroups to
     stay engaged in execution actions relative to their functional community, specifically, the
     sourcing, verification, and validation of functional requirements.
     12.7.7.5. FAMs at all levels will often be the initial responders when the Crisis Action
     Team(CAT) is activated.
  12.7.8. Perform analysis activities.
 314                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       12.7.8.1. FAMs at all levels must be capable of reviewing detailed planning data;
       analyzing the information for trends; and directing appropriate corrective actions if
       necessary.
12.8. Air Staff FAM Responsibilities. The Air Staff FAM works on behalf of their Air Staff
Deputy Chief of Staff and directorate. The wartime readiness of a functional area begins at the
Air Staff FAM level. Air Staff FAM responsibilities are below.

       identify changes in strategy, planning concepts, and joint planning guidance that might
       affect their specific functional areas.
       12.8.1.4. Develop functional operational policy, guidance, and oversight via functional
       AFIs and the WMP volumes, in accordance with established Joint and Service doctrine.
       12.8.1.5. Ensure Air Force functional area instructions and directives contain adequate
       guidance to direct the wartime functions for the given functional area.
   12.8.2. OPLAN/OPORD development.
       12.8.2.1. Work with component headquarters FAMs to understand what is needed to
       meet combatant commander requirements in each theater.
       12.8.2.2. Ensure supported command FAMS properly apply functional planning
       guidance contained in WMP-1 and other functional guidance documents in developing
       OPLAN TPFDD functional requirements in preparation for sourcing.
       12.8.2.3. Review OPLAN TPFDDs for proper force mix during the force requirements
       determination stages to ensure functional UTCs are being properly used, tasking is
       consistent with UTC MISCAPs, and no unit is over tasked.
       12.8.2.4. Review all OPLAN TPFDDs for functional requirements. Ensure postured
       functional UTCs can meet requirements identified in the OPLAN. Where deficiencies
       exist, work with supported command FAMs to determine if UTC requirements can be
       met with another existing UTC, or if additional functional capability is required.
       12.8.2.5. Review all OPLAN TPFDDs after sourcing to ensure MAJCOM UTC
       requirements do not exceed the number made available by each MAJCOM.
       12.8.2.6. Ensure wartime missions are identified for their functional area.
   12.8.3. Perform Unit Type Code (UTC) development, management, and maintenance
   activities.
       12.8.3.1. Air Staff FAMs will complete MEFPAK responsibilities listed in Chapter 5.

     12.8.3.2. Ensure proper coordination with other FAMs on development of cross-
     functional UTCs prior to submitting UTC request to AF/A5XW.
     12.8.3.3. To ensure accurate and complete standard deployment data, FAMs will review,
     validate, and correct as necessary, standard UTC data within planning databases at least
     biennially.
  12.8.4. Perform force posturing activities.
     12.8.4.1. HAF FAMs provide oversight and advice to commanders/functional
     directors/DCSs for the availability of capability within their functional area to meet AEF
     commitments.
         12.8.4.1.1. The MAJCOM/FOA/ANG FAM’s UTC availability, and its
         documentation within WMP-3, Part 2 is a valid wartime tasking for worldwide
         contingency operations, regardless of whether a tasked unit’s UTCs are sourced in an
         OPLAN during the contingency planning cycle.
     12.8.4.2. Air Staff FAMs will identify functional contributions to support the range of
     military operations.
     12.8.4.3. Air Staff FAMs will update FAM priority and sequencing guidance in
     accordance with the instructions set forth in the AF/A3/5 AEF Schedule Planning,
     Preparation, and Posturing Guidance Memorandum to allow time for posturing by
     MAJCOM FAMs. OFAMO/OFAMO-P will provide a template for each AEF Schedule.
     As a minimum, FAMs must address the areas listed in the FAM posturing guidance
     template; FAMs may add more areas as required. This guidance will be approved by the
     Air Staff functional 3-digit or equivalent.
         12.8.4.3.1. DELETED.
         12.8.4.3.2. Guidance will include recommendations on home station impacts
         mitigation strategies to implement during AEF deployment periods. Air Staff FAMs
         will provide commanders at the MAJCOM and below level, suggestions on what is
         the minimum capability required at home station to sustain AEF rotational operations
         and what is the minimum capability required to directly support conflict/war
         operations from the home station during wartime surge operations. While the final
         determination is a commander responsibility, the Air Staff FAM input is critical to the
         commander's understanding of the functional area.
             12.8.4.3.2.1. Guidance should provide suggestions for contract support,
             expectations of acceptable levels of home station requirements, what standards of
             home station performance can be adjusted, i.e., extended work days, inspection
             relief, lowered readiness or customer service standards, etc.
     12.8.4.4. Air Staff FAMs will ensure functional-specific posturing guidance meets the
     AETF FM objective. See Chapter 6 for specific posturing goals for the AETF FMs.
     12.8.4.5. Air Staff FAMS will formally notify affected MAJCOMs when availability
     changes due to reorganizations, equipment changes, or other reasons. Ensure that new
     taskings are clearly identified to each MAJCOM.

      12.8.4.6. Air Staff FAMS will work with their CFMs to ensure functional area
      manpower, training, and sustainment support functional area readiness requirements.
         12.8.4.6.1. This includes advising commanders on deployment guidelines for those
         holding a-skill level of 3 (Apprentice).
  12.8.5. Readiness reporting and monitoring
      12.8.5.1. Will provide AFCAT (AFOG) and AEFC an overall assessment on whether a
      need for reconstitution exists.
      12.8.5.2. In coordination with AF/A3OR and the AEFC, establish ART reporting
      criteria.
  12.8.6. Perform execution activities.
      12.8.6.1. Air Staff FAMs, acting as force providers, will ensure the TPFDD accurately
      reflects and is consistent with resources that actual units will deploy.
      12.8.6.2. Air Staff FAMs acting as force providers will verify AEFC sourcing.
      12.8.6.3. Air Staff FAMs acting as force providers will use DCAPES and AFVC to
      support sourcing and verification process for their responsible forces.
      12.8.6.4. Air Staff FAMs, acting as force providers, will ensure timelines established to
      support the sourcing, verification and validation process are met.
      12.8.6.5. Air Staff FAMs will coordinate Service reclama actions for their functional
      area.
      12.8.6.6. Participate as member of the Air Force CAT during crisis operations. As
      functional expert and central point of contact for the functional area, the Air Staff FAM
      will maintain continual liaison with MAJCOM FAMs to ensure functional area TPFDD
      requirements are sourced and validated within established timelines.
      12.8.6.7. When emerging requirements cannot be sourced with available forces in the
      current AEF vulnerability window, AF FP, on recommendation from applicable AF FP
      FAM, will notify AF/A3/5 to seek forced-to-source decision. HAF FAM will assimilate
      applicable MAJCOM risk assessments and provide a forced-to-source decision
      recommendation to applicable DCS (see paragraph 2.6.1 and Table 2.1).
  12.8.7. Perform analysis activities.
      12.8.7.1. Air Staff FAMs will need to conduct many different forms of analysis to
      determine the wartime readiness of their functional area. Different analyses include but
      are not limited to the following.
         12.8.7.1.1. Air Staff FAMs, in coordination with MAJCOMs and AFPC/DPW, will
         analyze UTC posturing and ensure the capabilities represented by their UTCs are
         correctly balanced across the applicable AEF blocks/pairs.
         12.8.7.1.2. When capability cannot be balanced, the Air Staff FAM will coordinate
         requests for waivers as described in Chapter 10.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              317


           12.8.7.1.3. As required, Air Staff FAMs will participate in activities to address
           wartime size and composition of support forces and thus that function’s ability to
           complete its mission requirements.
           12.8.7.1.4. When evolving requirements exceed the functional capabilities within the
           Air Force, Air Staff FAMs will ensure appropriate programming actions are initiated
           to correct the situation. If programming actions are not taken, then changes in the
           functional area’s concept of operations may be required to compensate for functional
           shortfalls.
           12.8.7.1.5. Analyze final sourced OPLAN TPFDDs of all plans sourced during the
           planning cycle to determine functional UTC shortfalls and overages. Where
           significant shortfalls exist, advise applicable commanders/functional directors/DCSs
           of actions required to correct the situation in future planning cycles. Actions may
           include programming for additional functional assets, adding additional training for
           existing personnel, directing MAJCOMs to reconfigure units to different UTCs to
           balance the functional capabilities, or simply tasking MAJCOMs for additional UTCs
           from existing assets. Where overages exist, consider military to civilian conversion or
           outsourcing and privatization (CS&P), but only after thorough analysis and staffing.
12.9. MAJCOM (to include AFRC and ANG) FAM Responsibilities. Supporting MAJCOM
FAMs play a vital role in the plan execution process. MAJCOM FAMs are accountants of the
planning process and track availability of forces and equipment, provide UTC availability, track
readiness and training, respond to Air Staff guidance / taskings and verify taskings of functional
field units. Note: Organizations may assign limited FAM responsibilities to other organizations
(e.g., operations planning office). When this occurs, the FAMs must remain fully engaged in all
functional area matters and the assigned organization must comply with this FAM guidance.
   12.9.1. Interpret, develop, and apply joint, Air Force, MAJCOM, or Air Force Component
   operational/exercise planning and execution policies.
       12.9.1.1. Review, understand, and comply with joint and Service planning guidance.

       commands. Review and update or add, as necessary, MAJCOM unique information.
       12.9.1.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC FAMs are responsible for issuing command planning
       guidance to members of their functional areas concerning doctrine, employment,
       deployment, and unit configurations. All deployable personnel and their associated
       equipment fall under the oversight of the AFGSC FAM. The FAM operates as an
       integral part of the AFGSC deployment process. During contingency operations and
       exercises, the AFGSC FAMs will work with AFGSC/A3CW (AEF Cell) as the JOPES
       Support Element to coordinate all UTC taskings and all phases of the deployment process
       involving the use of functional resources.
       12.9.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) FAMs will establish and maintain a continuity binder and or
       electronic file for their functional area. The following documents should be included:

         Consolidated Planning Schedule (ECS CPS) extracts.
  12.9.2. OPLAN/OPORD development.
      12.9.2.1. Verify the war planner’s sourcing of OPLAN TPFDD during supporting
      command reviews for contingency and crisis action planning.
      12.9.2.2. Notify the supported component headquarters FAM and MAJCOM/FOA war
      plans OPR when units that are sourced to that command’s OPLAN TPFDD can no longer
      fill the tasking. Note: The MAJCOM/FOA war plans OPR will notify AF/A5XW.
  12.9.3. Perform Unit Type Code (UTC) development, management, and maintenance
  activities.
      12.9.3.1. MAJCOM FAMs will complete MEFPAK responsibilities listed in Chapter 5.
      12.9.3.2. Ensure proper coordination with Air Staff FAM other MAJCOM FAMs on
      development of cross-functional UTCs prior to submitting UTC request to AF/A5XW.
      12.9.3.3. To ensure accurate and complete standard deployment data, FAMs will review,
      validate, and correct as necessary, standard UTC data at least biennially (See Chapter 5).
  12.9.4. Perform force posturing activities.
      12.9.4.1. For organizations designated as combat/combat support/combat service
      support, posture all available manpower authorizations in accordance with Chapter 7.
      Conduct a comparison of the UTC availability and the unit manpower document
      authorized strength on at least an annual basis.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          319


     12.9.4.2. Monitor unit readiness and advise applicable DCS/director of units that are not
     manned, trained, and/or equipped to maintain the postured capability. Coordinate
     appropriate actions with applicable unit or agency to remedy manning, training, or
     equipment issues. Coordinate all changes to UTC posturing and coding with units.
     12.9.4.3. Be aware of wartime requirement changes (mobility and/or in-place) and
     changes driven by announced force structure changes; UTC/UMD mismatches, unit
     reorganizations, and functional reorganizations. Notify Air Staff FAMs of changes to
     availability due to reorganizations, conversions, deactivations, etc., and notify
     MAJCOM/FOA war planners who, in turn, will notify AF/A5XW.
     12.9.4.4. Verify UMD support for changes to manpower requirements/authorizations. If
     there is a UTC/UMD mismatch, work with command manpower representatives to
     further investigate possible causes/deficiencies or alternatives for correction.
     12.9.4.5. Coordinate with units when manpower conflicts/shortfalls occur. If unable to
     resolve discrepancies, contact MAJCOM manpower representative to request additional
     information and assistance. Attempt to determine projected get-well date for UMD
     support when shortfalls occur, and notify all affected units.
     12.9.4.6. Identify and provide military workload mitigation plans to maximize
     deployable capability within the functional area.
  12.9.5. Readiness reporting and monitoring
     12.9.5.1. MAJCOM FAMs will monitor the readiness status of all functional units on a
     continual basis. This includes Status Of Resources and Training System (SORTS)
     reporting and ART report-ing.
     12.9.5.2. Initiate, coordinate, and review SORTS designed operational capability (DOC)
     statements and ensure units report status in SORTS in accordance with AFI 10-201.
     Assist in resolving reporting issues and problems and respond to questions regarding
     content of unit reports.
         12.9.5.2.1. Ensure DOC statements are accurate and identify specific standards
         against which the units must be measured. Validate mission identification section. To
         validate refer to mission directives, UTC MISCAP statements and any additional
         major command or combatant commander’s requirements. Validate DOC response
         time.
            12.9.5.2.1.1. Submit a revised DOC statement immediately when a unit tasking is
            changed to either add or delete UTC(s) required to support the DOC. Any changes
            to DOC content, such as unit data, UTC information require a new/revised DOC
            Statement.
         12.9.5.2.2. Coordinate reporting guidance with command reporting organization.
     12.9.5.3. Analyze SORTS data for information on trends and deficiencies such as
     shortfalls in manpower, equipment, and training. For example, does the unit manpower
     document (UMD) fully support the UTCs reflected on the DOC statement, does the unit
     have all necessary equipment, and are the personnel adequately trained? FAMs will
     develop solutions to identified deficiencies and direct appropriate actions. Elevate
     limiting factors that require action or support from Air Staff FAMs as necessary
320                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      12.9.5.4. Monitor and review UTC readiness in ART database. Ensure all UTCs are
      reviewed and updated in ART by the unit commander according to the instructions and
      timelines established in AFI 10-244. Any assessments affecting the deployment status of
      the UTC must include reasonable get-well dates.
         12.9.5.4.1. Establish ART reporting procedures based on Air Staff FAM criteria and
         ensure units are properly trained in data reporting procedures.
         12.9.5.4.2. Ensure timeliness, accuracy, and validity of subordinate units’ data, to
         include sampling, reviewing, and assessing adequacy of the remarks and challenging
         inadequate remarks.
         12.9.5.4.3. Assist in correcting deficiencies and discrepancies and elevate limiting
         factors that require action or support from Air Staff FAMs, as necessary.
         12.9.5.4.4. Manage/report the status of UTCs postured and tracked from the FAMs
         own immediate staff/organization.
  12.9.6. Perform execution activities.
      12.9.6.1. At the initial indication of a crisis, review UTC Availability and compare
      Availability against current ART and unit SORTS report.
      12.9.6.2. Review the execution TPFDD and ensure it accurately reflects and is consistent
      with resources that actual units will deploy.
      12.9.6.3. Maintain dialogue with the AEFC functional schedulers to ensure taskings are
      correct and sourced to the appropriate units, based on postured UTCs, availability coding,
      and ART assessments.
      12.9.6.4. Determine functional area requirements for mobilization.
      12.9.6.5. Use DCAPES and AFVC to support sourcing and verification process for their
      responsible forces. Ensure timelines established to support the sourcing, verification, and
      validation processes are met.
      12.9.6.6. Ensure installation deployment officers (IDOs) are informed of wing AEFC
      sourcing.
      12.9.6.7. Resolve tasking problems that are identified by units during TPFDD execution,
      i.e., a unit's inability to fill a tasking. Actions may include changing the tasked unit or
      substituting a UTC in the same AEF eligibility period that can meet the mission
      capability and transportation requirements.
      12.9.6.8. Notify the AEFC when the MAJCOM is unable to source requirements from
      available UTCs. Coordinate MAJCOM reclama actions.
      12.9.6.9. When UTCs tasked are to be sourced from units with C-levels other than C-1,
      determine what resource actions would be required to fill the UTC tasking.
      12.9.6.10. MAJCOM FAMs will advise the Air Staff FAM and MAJCOM/FOA war
      plans OPR when significant changes in availability occur.
  12.9.7. Perform analysis activities
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                            321


     12.9.7.1. MAJCOM FAMs will need to conduct many different forms of analysis to
     determine the wartime readiness of their functional area. Different analyses include, but
     are not limited to the following.
        12.9.7.1.1. In coordination with Air Staff FAMs, analyze the ECS target base
        alignment and ensure units and the capabilities represented by their UTCs are
        correctly aligned.
        12.9.7.1.2. As required, participate in activities to address wartime size and
        composition of support forces and thus that function’s ability to complete its mission
        requirements.
        12.9.7.1.3. When evolving requirements exceed the functional capabilities of the
        command, work with Air Staff FAMs to ensure appropriate programming actions are
        initiated to correct the situation. If programming actions are not taken, then changes
        in the functional area’s concept of operations may be required to compensate for
        functional shortfalls.
        12.9.7.1.4. Analyze final sourced OPLAN TPFDDs of all plans sourced during the
        planning cycle to identify MAJCOM taskings and UTC shortfalls and overages.
        Where significant shortfalls exist, initiate actions with Air Staff FAM to correct the
        situation in future planning cycles. Where overages exist, consider military to civilian
        conversion or outsourcing and privatization (CS&P), but only after thorough analysis
        and staffing.
  12.9.8. (Added-AFGSC) Adaptive Crisis Planning.
     12.9.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) FAMs will be the focal point for all AEF rotational, joint,
     personnel and/or equipment sourcing requirements. The FAM is the MAJCOM approval
     authority for verifying sourcing of equipment and personnel to support all requirements.
     12.9.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) During adaptive or crisis planning, FAMs will receive a
     sourced requirement from AFPC/DPW; they will first review the UTC status in ART for
     the sourced UIC. If that unit is unable to fulfill the requirement based on a RED
     assessment, the FAM will contact the unit to ensure the assessment is correctly reflected
     in ART. If they are indeed unable to fill the requirement, the FAM will check the status
     on other UTCs in the command from bases in the same window of vulnerability on the
     AEF alignment template. If another base has that UTC in an available status, the FAM
     will submit UIC changes to HQ AFGSC/A3CW for entry into Reclama Processing Tool
     (RPT). AFPC/DPW Functional Scheduler will then change the UIC based on the
     MAJCOM FAMs recommendation. If the FAM determines that no other unit assigned to
     the required AEF is capable of providing the required UTC, the FAM will reclama the
     requirement back to the AFPC/DPW.
     12.9.8.3. (Added-AFGSC) In the event a Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) is
     tasked to provide personnel, equipment, or both to support rotational operations, the
     FAM will notify the GSU of the requirement and then contact the host wing Installation
     Deployment Officer (IDO) where the GSU tasking is located. The IDO is the single
     individual responsible for identification, coordination and execution of all deployment
     taskings and requirements for the base where the GSU is located.
 322                                               AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


       12.9.8.4. (Added-AFGSC) Notify AFPC/DPW functional schedulers during
       contingency execution when AFGSC is unable to source requirements from available
       UTCs.
       12.9.8.5. (Added-AFGSC) Each FAM will validate the accuracy of the information for
       each sourced UTC in the OPLAN TPFDD. The validated UTC requirements will be
       reflected in the Deployment Requirements Manning Document (DRMD) for the affected
       OPLAN. The TPFDD data simultaneously populates the DRMD.
12.10. Component Headquarters FAM Responsibilities.
   12.10.1. Interpret, develop, and apply joint, Air Force, or Air Force Component
   operational/exercise planning and execution policies.
       12.10.1.1. Review, understand, and comply with joint and Service planning guidance.
       Provide recommended changes to planning documents and guidance to the responsible
       Air Staff agency.
   12.10.2. OPLAN/OPORD development.
       12.10.2.1. Supported component headquarters FAMs’ major responsibility lies in
       OPLAN         and      functional    Annex      development.      When        reviewing
       OPLANs/CONPLANs/OPORDs, component headquarters FAMs must advise or
       recommend to the war planners specific needs to establish requirements (verbiage) in the
       plan to properly execute the combatant commander’s intent using Air Force capabilities.
       Many component headquarters FAMs have the additional responsibility for developing
       their functional area’s Annex supporting OPLANs/CONPLANs/OPORDs; if that is the
       case, the FAM is “acting” as a component planner. The supported component
       headquarters FAM will develop force support requirements in response to combatant
       commander requests for capability in accordance with Chapter 8 of this instruction.
       12.10.2.2. Develop the initial ECS force list based on the AETF force modules in
       accordance with Chapter 6 and Chapter 8. Component headquarters FAMs, in
       coordination with the component headquarters planners, will determine additional
       functional area requirements at each wartime beddown location in the component’s
       portion of the TPFDD. With AEF Cycle 6 implementation, all FOL rotational UMD
       requirements will be identified using the AETF force modules as the template.
       12.10.2.3. Coordinate with MAJCOM (in force provider role) planners to ensure the
       accuracy of force requirements and modify as necessary. This includes ensuring TPFDD
       requirements can actually be met by postured capability.
       12.10.2.4. Coordinate with the force provider and Air Staff counterparts to ensure
       maximum use of standard UTCs postured in the UTC availability and registered in
       MEFPAK.
       12.10.2.5. Ensure, in coordination with planners, that accurate and valid UTCs are used
       when maintaining an OPLAN TPFDD and will ensure supported OPLAN TPFDDs are
       maintained according to guidance in Chapter 8.
   12.10.3. Perform Unit Type Code (UTC) development, management, and maintenance
   activities.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              323


      12.10.3.1. When a supported commander or unified command submits a request for a
      capability not defined as a UTC to their Service component, the component headquarters
      should evaluate the need to establish a standard UTC and coordinate action with the
      appropriate MAJCOM FAM.
   12.10.4. Perform execution activities.
      12.10.4.1. Determine all rotational and surge operation TPFDD requirements in
      accordance with Chapter 8
      12.10.4.2. As necessary, man forward headquarters staffs during crisis operations.
      12.10.4.3. As necessary, support forward operating location (FOL) requirements for
      manning assistance, rotations, and equipment.
      12.10.4.4. Determine the appropriate organization to assign TPFDD requirements against
      to ensure accurate personnel accountability and proper organizational structure. If an
      approved organization (provisional or permanent) has not been established for each
      employment location, request one from the appropriate supported Air Component
      agency.
   12.10.5. Perform analysis activities.
      12.10.5.1. Component headquarters FAMs will need to conduct many different forms of
      analysis to determine the wartime requirements of their functional area. Different
      analyses include but are not limited to the following.
          12.10.5.1.1. Component headquarters FAMs, working with AEFC and MAJCOM
          FAMs, will continually assess their ability to meet current operations. This
          assessment must also consider the need to reconstitute any force that entered surge
          operations.
12.11. FAM Training.
   12.11.1. Air Force FAM training is key for FAMs and is critical to successful AEF
   execution. FAMs at all echelons must complete the Air Force FAM WBT within 3 months of
   assignment as a FAM. OFAMO-P is the OPR for development and oversight of all FAM
   training; the MAJCOM OFAMO is responsible for individual MAJCOM FAM training and
   must ensure that their MAJCOM FAMs have the proper level of training necessary to
   successfully accomplish their assigned duties. . The FAM WBT is located on the FAM CoP.
   12.11.1. (AFGSC) The FAM WBT course is the primary training method for newly
   assigned FAMs. No other training will be scheduled or provided until the FAM WBT course
   has been completed.
   12.11.2. FAM training provides an understanding of the duties, responsibilities, systems,
   tools, and processes associated with the position of FAM. In addition to this course, there are
   a few other courses that provide FAMs additional tools to complete their tasks for their
   functional areas.
      12.11.2.1. Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC) (Optional). Attendance
      at CWPC is highly recommended for all new FAMs. CWPC provides an overview of
      joint and Air Force planning processes and touches on all levels of planning from the

                             EXERCISE SOURCING PROCESS

Section 13A—Purpose

13.1. Purpose. To provide an outline of the sourcing process and interrelationships of force
providers (MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs), AEF Operations and all Combatant Commands for CJCS-,
Joint-, Air Force-, and MAJCOM-level exercises, experiments, and tests. The major systems
affecting the development of joint exercise plans are the Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning
and Execution Segment (DCAPES) and Joint Operations Planning and Execution System
(JOPES).

Section 13B—Background

13.2. Planning Processes. Planning is a continuous and highly structured process that allows
for an orderly transition from concept development to employment. A proper sourcing process
prevents incorrect force usage and ensures force visibility to all major players in the exercise
course of action. An effective sourcing process enables proactive, informed force management
decisions resulting in the timely and efficient allocation of forces/capabilities necessary to
execute assigned mission and it ensures the systematic deployment, employment, and
redeployment of assigned forces. For all exercises, experiments, and tests, planners are directed
to use DCAPES/JOPES.

Section 13C—Guidance

13.3. Roles and Responsibilities.
   13.3.1. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and the Joint Staff. The CJCS
   approves the Joint Training Master Schedule (JTMS) provided by the Joint Staff. The JTMS
   contains guidance to combatant commanders and the Service Chiefs for the accomplishment
   of CJCS and Joint Exercises. Resulting combatant commander EXPLANs, including
   TPFDDs, are forwarded to the CJCS.
   13.3.2. Commander, United States Joint Forces Command (CDRUSJFCOM) as the
   Primary Joint Force Provider (JFP). Based on recommendations from the GFMB,
   Services, and combatant commanders, CDRUSJFCOM is responsible for providing
   recommended sourcing solutions for conventional combat, combat support, and combat
   service support forces in support of the Joint Exercise Schedule. In coordination with the
   Services, provides trained and ready forces and capabilities for allocation by the SecDef via
   the Joint Staff Manager to support combatant command exercise requirements.
   13.3.3. Unified Combatant Commands (UCCs). Identify forces/requirements to support
   Joint Exercises. Provide commanders force flow guidance via an exercise TPFDD Letter of
   Instruction (LOI).
   13.3.4. Chief of Staff, United States Air Force (CSAF). CSAF is the "Global Force
   Provider" of Air Force air and space power capabilities for exercises. CSAF conveys

  instructions to all Air Staff, MAJCOM, ANG, and subordinate units to be prepared to support
  exercises during their AEF training period or AEF vulnerability period.
  13.3.5. Warfighting Integration (SAF/XC). Designated the Air Force Executive Agent
  (AFEA) for Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments (JEFX). Coordinates, synchronizes and
  integrates experimentation events in JEFXs.
  13.3.6. Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), Operations, Plans & Requirements (HQ
  AF/A3/5) . Oversees and issues policy, guidance, and procedures for mission directives on
  Air Force exercises. HQ AF/A3/5 provides oversight for AF sponsored exercises and AF
  participation in CJCS exercises. HQ AF/A3O is the office of primary responsibility for the
  Air Force Exercise Program (AFEP) and carries out the responsibilities in accordance with
  AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and After-Action Reporting Program.
  13.3.7. Headquarters Air Force Functional Area Managers (HAF FAMs) The HAF
  FAM acts as a central coordinator of the actions of their MAJCOM counterparts to ensure
  their applicable functional area UTCs are postured and aligned in UTC Availability in
  accordance with current Air Force policy and instructions.
  13.3.8. Commander, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC/CC) and Director, Air
  National Guard (NGB/CF). Establish policy and provide guidance for the participation of
  AFRC and ANG forces in exercises.
  13.3.9. Air Force Component Headquarters. Although Air Force forces are assigned to
  different combatant commanders, all Air Force units and associated capability are part of the
  AEF and are centrally managed to best meet the overall requirements of all combatant
  commands in support of exercises. Supported component headquarters:
      13.3.9.1. Establish and identify exercise resource requirements (financial, manpower,
      airframe, supply, equipment, etc.) from Air Force capabilities. Coordinate exercise
      planning activities and combatant commander requirements with AEF Operations and
      other USAF agencies as appropriate.
      13.3.9.2. Ensure all exercise forces working in a joint or coalition organization know
      their Air Force command structure via the exercise reporting instructions so the member
      is aware prior to departure.
      13.3.9.3. Establish exercise policy, guidance, and instructions to facilitate the efficient
      communication and employment of forces within the theater of operation.
      13.3.9.4. Source exercise requirements from organic, in-theater assets to the maximum
      extent possible and provide TPFDDs to AFPC OSC for situational awareness. Notify
      sourced wings/bases via AFVC. The component headquarters must shortfall all
      requirements not sourced from within their command. The shortfalls will include any
      active duty or ARC volunteers outside of their command, and all pre-sourced units and
      names of individuals in the line remark field only.
      13.3.9.5. Provide Jointand CSAF-level exercise shortfalls to AFPC OSC via
      TPFDD/DRMD in JOPES by Force Module (FM) no later than 120 days before Required
      Delivery Date (RDD). Shortfalls should only be submitted after exhausting all efforts to
      fill from assigned forces. This allows AEF Operations the opportunity to source all
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                           327


     shortfall requirements and the owning MAJCOMS to verify their respective
     requirements.
     13.3.9.6. Provide exercise specific reporting instructions, to include POCs, and provide
     position descriptions for any nonstandard UTCs. Note: Component planners will only
     put UTCs in the TPFDD that are registered in Manpower and Equipment Force Package
     (MEFPAK). Component FAMs should coordinate with force provider and Air Staff
     counterparts to ensure force providers either already have these UTCs postured in UTC
     Availability or intend to posture these UTCs in UTC Availability.

     shortfalls in addition to coordinating with component planners regarding exercise
     TPFDDs as necessary.
     13.3.10.2. Coordinates, integrates, and publishes the timelines, plans, and tasks required
     to support shortfalls for CJCSand CSAF-level exercises and experiments.
     13.3.10.3. Posts messages to newsgroup to announce the appropriate exercises
     newsgroup and MAJCOM verification information. The appropriate exercise newsgroup
     will be used to post all required actions after the initial announcement.
     13.3.10.4. Coordinates with supported component headquarters to ensure the shortfalled
     TPFDD is received. Upon receipt, AEF Operations will make shortfall requirements
     available to the Air Reserve Components (ARC) to solicit volunteers with a maximum
     30-day suspense. AEF Operations Functional Area Schedulers will negotiate a different
     suspense with ARC if required.
  13.3.11. Force Providers (Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating
  Agencies (FOAs), Direct Reporting Units (DRUs), and the Air National Guard
  (ANG)). Specific units to fulfill the exercise will be synchronized with the AEF battle
  rhythm to ensure forces are ready. Force providers must ensure subordinate units understand
  their primary objective during their scheduled deployment period is to make the maximum
  capability available for contingency and rotational operations. Force provider FAMs must
  maintain close coordination with their Air Staff FAM and AEF Operations to ensure
  visibility of exercise participation.
     13.3.11.1. Ensures timely verification of all exercise TPFDD taskings and, through
     established mechanisms, ensure tasked units are ready and prepared to deploy.

       13.3.12.3. Supporting Manpower Office (MO) (may be a wing organization that
       fulfills this function).
          13.3.12.3.1. The MO works with their IDO and deploying unit(s) and determines the
          requirements from the standard UTC database where possible. Once accomplished,
          the DRMD will be forwarded to JOPES/DCAPES exercise support NLT 120 days
          prior to RDD.
          13.3.12.3.2. Coordinates, as necessary, the exercise DRMD changes with the
          deployment project officer.
          13.3.12.3.3. Follow the DRMD timeline established in paragraph 13.6. of this
          instruction.
       13.3.12.4. Personnel Readiness Function (PRF). PRFs play a vital role in the success
       of force accountability. Accurate force accountability depends on PRFs efficiently
       updating and disseminating personnel data via DCAPES within the timelines specified in
       AFI 36-3802 (formerly AFI 10-215). The PRF:
          13.3.12.4.1. Processes the current exercise DRMD. Enters the individual’s name
          and other required personnel identification into DCAPES.
          13.3.12.4.2. Processes the LOGMOD Plan Update File (when populated with
          name/SSN information provided by the UDM) and updates any personnel changes as
          required into DCAPES to produce CED orders and associated personnel deployment
          actions.
          13.3.12.4.3. Notifies UDMs of exercise reporting instructions and clarifies any AF
          line remarks that may be listed against positions on the DRMD.
       13.3.12.5. Unit Exercise Project Officer.
          13.3.12.5.1. Works closely with the wing exercise project officer, the deploying
          units’ unit deployment manager(s), affected Commander’s Support Staff(s), LRS
          Contingency Programs and Plans section (Host Installation Deployment Officer), and
          Manpower/Personnel Readiness Unit to ensure deployment requirements are
          identified in time to meet the DRMD timeline established in paragraph 13.6 of this
          instruction.
          13.3.12.5.2. Once the names have been loaded into LOGMOD, the LOGMOD levy
          file is extracted by the IDO to the PRF for upload into DCAPES.
          13.3.12.5.3. Evaluates and processes reclamas and UIC change requests using RPT
          in accordance with Section 10C of this instruction.
13.4. AEF Sourcing and Tasking Priority. The Air Force prioritizes its sourcing requirements
when responding to and supporting CJCSand CSAF-sponsored experiment/exercise shortfalls.
When developing sourcing solutions, the Air Force attempts to minimize impact to other
combatant commander requirements. See paragraph 9.3 for priority.
13.5. AEF Sourcing and Tasking Process. AEF Operations will develop the sourcing rule sets
to support shortfalled CJCSand CSAF-sponsored experiment/exercise requirements.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             331


   13.5.1. Tasking for exercises/experiments with estimated tour length (ETLs) of 30 days or
   greater will normally come from the on-call AEF blocks/pair. Note: Units/personnel who
   deploy for 45 days or less are eligible to deploy again within their AEF vulnerability period.
   13.5.2. Tasking for exercises with ETLs of less than 30 days will be sourced from the UTCs
   in the AEF training window.
   13.5.3. Once ULNs are built and captured in the applicable exercise requirements force
   module, AEF Operations sources the requirement and populates the applicable verification
   FMs and establishes suspense via HQAF.SOURCE or HAF designated newsgroup. AEF
   Operations monitors DCAPES while the force providers initiate the verification process (see
   paragraph 8.14.9.) or, if unable to support the ULN, begin the reclama process (see Section
   10C--Shortfall and Reclama Process). Note: After requirements have been verified,
   reclamas will only occur under the most extenuating circumstances.
   13.5.4. AEF Operations centrally manages the Air Force Deployment Processing
   Discrepancy Reporting Program for exercises.
   13.5.5. AEF Operations oversees and manages the UTC and Individual Augmentee (IA)
   reclama process when taskings must be reassigned between MAJCOMs. AEF Operations is
   the central agency for adjudicating Air Force reclamas and forwarding to HQ USAF as
   required.
13.6. DRMD Development. Exercise DRMD Development will be in accordance with the
following timeline:
   13.6.1. Exercise planners will establish and validate exercise requirements NLT 180 days
   before RDD. Component-sponsored exercise requirements should either be manually
   updated in DCAPES by the supporting Manpower POC or provided to JOPES/DCAPES
   exercise support for processing. Joint exercise requirements should be provided to
   JOPES/DCAPES exercise support for processing. Provide all line remarks at the same time
   the DRMD flows. Planners will use Air Force standard line remarks for all exercises.
   Unique requirements not included in the standard remarks will be placed in the reporting
   instructions.
   13.6.2. Coordinate with supported FAMs to address detail required, to fully define
   requirements (AFSC, suitable substitutions, Line Remarks, job/position description, position
   POC and exercise POC). Planners, in coordination with supported and supporting manpower
   offices, will use standard UTCs where possible and tailor as necessary. All non-standard
   UTCs will be functional (i.e., 4FZ99, HFZ99, etc) and contain AFSC and grade
   requirements.
   13.6.3. NLT 150 days before RDD, JOPES/DCAPES exercise support will release
   requirements to FAMs for sourcing of requirements supported by the component or AD/ARC
   volunteers. JOPES/DCAPES exercise support will use the Standard Air Force Line Remarks
   for all exercises.
   13.6.4. NLT 120 days before RDD, ULNs sourced with non-assigned forces identified
   during planning are forwarded to AFPC OSC via Force Module to coordinate with owning
   commands to verify requirements. Supported components will not validate to the applicable
   CCDR without supporting component verification.
 332                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


   13.6.5. NLT 120 days before RDD, shortfalled requirements are submitted to AFPC OSC
   via Force Module for sourcing. This will be accomplished with accompanying justification
   from directorate level. Supported components will not validate to the applicable CCDR
   without supporting component verification.
   13.6.6. NLT 103 days prior to RDD, MAJCOMs will complete verification for all
   requirements. JOPES/DCAPES exercise support will levy verified requirements to
   Destination/Central Site as system capabilities dictate, and provide detailed reporting
   instructions to each PRF when published by the component headquarters.
   13.6.7. NLT 90 days prior to RDD, changes to the DRMD that require fill action, outside the
   previously tasked units/NAF.
   13.6.8. NLT 60 days prior to RDD, Service components will validate all sourced
   requirements to their combatant commander.
   13.6.9. NLT 30 days prior to RDD, JOPES/DCAPES exercise support will verify all tasked
   requirements filled and shortfall to the lead exercise planner. All new requirements with a
   RDD of 30 days or less will not be accepted by AFPC OSC unless certified critical to the
   exercise and approved by a general officer. This does not apply to deletions to the DRMD.
13.7. Reclama Procedures. Reclama and UIC change requests procedures as outlined in
Section 10C of this instruction will be used. If ULN/LNR is unavailable in RPT, follow

                               *AEF AND THE INDIVIDUAL

Section 14A—Purpose

14.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policy and procedures for the
management of individuals in support of the AEF. This encompasses individual AEF
association, force management with respect to individuals, and sourcing individuals to fulfill
individual augmentation (IA) requirements.

Section 14B—Background

14.2. Force Presence. All Air Force personnel contribute to the AEF. AFPC (or other
designated force manager) supports AEF operations by identifying the most ready and available
forces as part of UTCs or as individuals to meet the stated requirement. Airmen are eligible for
deployment during their scheduled AEF vulnerability period; however, increased requirements in
a particular theater or mission may require Airmen to deploy outside their vulnerability period to
meet the crisis.

Section 14C—Guidance

14.3. Associating Individuals. All Airmen are trained and equipped to provide the required
capabilities enabling the CCDR to accomplish the mission. Airmen also make up the staff of
Service organizations and therefore are required to accomplish the mission of the assigned
organization. Air Force organizations are categorized based on their broad mission of Combat
(C), Combat Support (CS), Combat Service Support (CSS), or “Other” via the JCS Unit
Descriptor Code (UDC) (see Attachment 8 for details). Airmen assigned to C, CS, and CSS
organizations are organized, trained and equipped to meet the mission capabilities stipulated in
postured UTCs and therefore are the Air Force’s primary warfighting forces. Airmen assigned to
“Other” organizations constitute the Institutional Force and are required to manage the programs
and operations of the Service and are not identified with UTCs; however, these Airmen are
eligible for deployment and will be used primarily to meet individual augmentation (IA)
requirements. All Airmen, regardless of assignment to C, CS, CSS, or Institutional Force will be
given an AEF Indicator (AEFI) in MilPDS in accordance with Table 14.1 (Note: Reserve
components will determine component-specific AEFI policy). Commanders or equivalent are
responsible for determining the appropriate AEFI code for all assigned personnel. MAJCOM
FAMs (or other delegated organization) will monitor AEFIs to ensure AFSCs are properly
distributed throughout the associated vulnerability periods. HAF FAMs will conduct quarterly
reviews and in conjunction with MAJCOM FAMs (or other delegated organization) and AFPC
Scheduler determine proper AEFI for erroneous or blank AEFIs. MAJCOM FAMs and unit
deployment managers (UDMs) will advise Unit commander of recommended AEFI to correct
erroneous or blank AEFI and suspense commanders for corrective action. Airmen with blank
AEFIs will be considered "available" in the current AEF vulnerability window.
334                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


  14.3.1. AEFIs for Individuals Assigned to Combat, Combat Support, or Combat Service
  Support Organizations. Individuals will be given an AEFI corresponding to the AEF block
  or Enabler category (see Table 14.1) in which their organization has UTCs postured.
  14.3.2. AEFI for Individuals Assigned to “Other” Air Force Organizations. Individuals
  assigned to organizations designated as “Other” will be given an AEFI; however, it will not
  be based on a UTC Tempo Band. AC personnel assigned to these organizations will receive
  an AEFI based on a 6-month AEF vulnerability period at a 1:4 deploy-to-dwell ratio (X1 to
  X5). At a 1:4 deploy-to-dwell ratio, there are five vulnerability periods and each
  vulnerability period will contain approximately 20% of the population assigned to “Other”
  Air Force organizations. Recognizing current CCDR requirements require some stressed
  capabilities to use individuals assigned to “Other” organizations at a greater frequency than a
  1:4 deploy-to-dwell ratio, temporary exceptions to the 1:4 ratio will be granted on a case-by-
  case basis by AF/A3/5 with AF/A1 and appropriate HAF DCS coordination (see paragraph
  10.2.1). Before applying for the deviation, consideration must be given to the fact many of
  these organizations are small and/or have a critical Air Force-level organize, train, or equip
  mission and a more rapid deploy-to-dwell ratio could impact force sustainability. In
  addition, it is the intent of this process for warfighting forces to be at or below 1:2 dwell
  before a deviation is considered and approved for “Other” forces.
      14.3.2.1. Key and critical personnel will be given an AEFI of X1 to X5; however, these
      individuals will be assigned a DAV Code of “64” (Operational Deferment) in accordance
      with AFI 10-403, Attachment 2.           Key and critical personnel for Institutional
      organizations will be approved at the HAF/MAJCOM/DRU directorate-level in
      accordance with HAF DCS/MAJCOM CV (or equivalent) policy. AF FOAs will follow
      the policy of their parent HAF DCS. Individuals with a DAV 64 will not be included in
      the normal rack-and-stack tasking methodology but may be tasked as part of a forced-to-
      source solution.
      14.3.2.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC personnel are defined as “key and critical” if they meet one
      of the following conditions.
         14.3.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) An AFGSC Director with no assigned Deputy.
         14.3.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) A one deep position with no one available to become
         qualified as an alternate. Simply not assigning an alternate does not mean one deep.
         14.3.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Loss of individual for more than 30 days will result in
         mission failure and there are no work arounds’ to mitigate loss.
         14.3.2.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) In reference to personnel assigned to a Key Nuclear
         Billet (KNB), not all KNBs require a DAV 64 code. Note: DAV 64 is a temporary
         code for an individual. DAV 64 cannot be assigned to a position. See AFI 10-403
         regarding DAV coding.
         14.3.2.1.5. (Added-AFGSC) If, the individual is sourced for deployment; the
         requirement would meet Severe Mission Impact reclama criteria. (Contact AFGSC
         AEF Cell for “SEVERE MISSION IMPACT” RECLAMA TEMPLATE.)
         14.3.2.1.6. (Added-AFGSC) DAV 64 letters must include the personnel primary
         position, manning of the staff, missions that will fail or negatively impacted if
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                          335


          personnel deploys, effective date of the DAV 64 and duration, signed by the wing
          commander and/or MAJCOM directorate.
      14.3.2.2. Organizations coded as “Other” that have an approved waiver to posture UTCs
      (see paragraphs 7.5. and 10.2.1.) will determine AEFIs according to the rule sets for
      Combat, Combat Support, or Combat Service Support Organizations (see paragraph
      14.3.1.).
      14.3.2.3. AFSOC “Other” funded by USSOCOM are tasked primarily by USSOCOM.
      They will be AEFI-coded for administrative purposes in accordance with paragraph
      14.3.2., but their actual vulnerability for deployment will be as required by USSOCOM
      or coordinated with AFSOC.
   14.3.3. AEFIs for Individuals Assigned to Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
   Components, Defense Agencies, DoD Field Activities, or Joint/Combined Organizations,
   regardless of JCS UDC (see Table A8.3) will be given an AEFI of XX to indicate they are
   not to be considered part of the Air Force’s readily available deployment pool. Their
   availability is determined by the owning organization, not the Air Force. The AEFI of XX
   will be automatically updated in the system by AFPC based on MAJCOM code.
      14.3.3.1. DELETED.
   14.3.4. AEFIs for Reserve Component.           Reserve components will determine and
   coordinate component-specific AEFI policy.
      14.3.4.1. Reserve Component - IMAs. IMAs assigned to operational Active
      Component units will have an AEFI commensurate with the unit's UDC and their
      functional area tempo band. IMAs assigned to Institutional Active Component
      organizations will be given an AEFI of X1 to X5. Management controls must be added
      to ensure the IMA is available when required by unit of assignment. IMA usage outside
      the unit of assignment must be approved by first general officer in both OPCON and
      ADCON chains. If the OPCON general officer is not at the wing level, approval
      authority is the first general officer at the gaining MAJCOM. Once an IMA is mobilized,
      their AEFI may need to change once demobilized in order to provide the IMA the
      required minimum mobilization-to-dwell.
   14.3.5. AEFIs for Students, Transients, Patients and Prisoners. Individuals in a
   transitory status of student, transient, patient or prisoner will be given an AEFI of XL to
   indicate they are not available for deployment. This AEFI code will be updated
   automatically in MilPDS by AFPC based upon AF/A1 guidance.
   14.3.6. AEFIs for Individuals in Transition (PCS or PCA). An individual’s AEFI is not
   changed until the individual is gained at the new organization or actual DOS. Gaining
   commanders are responsible for updating AEFIs for newly assigned personnel within 15 days
   of being assigned to the unit.

Note 1: Although all individuals in these categories receive an AEFI indicating a
specific AEF vulnerability period, 100% of them will not be available during this
period. Personal circumstances and mission-related activities will reduce the deployable
pool. Individuals who are not available due to personal circumstances must have a
corresponding deployment availability (DAV) or duty status code in MilPDS and
supporting documentation to validate member’s deployment availability date as required
by AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. Units are also required to conduct
UTC assessments per AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces
(applies to tempo band and Enablers only). Commanders or equivalents will use the
reclama process when a valid shortfall exists (i.e., insufficient capability to meet a
specific requirement). Reclamas must be limited to a documented lack of resources,
change in mission requirements, or where severe risk results from deployment of the
requested force
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             337


Note 2: Use of A1 – A0 or E3 - E4 requires AF/A5XW approval

Note 3: Only if applicable component determines that individuals will be given AEFIs
via MilPDS

Note 4: IMA AEFIs are managed by their AC unit of assignment and should identify
when said unit can best utilize the IMA's availability.

   14.3.7. AEFI Association Review. Prior to the start of each AEF Schedule, unit
   commanders will review AEFI codes of assigned Airmen to ensure they match UTC
   alignment. In the case of the Institutional Force, organization commanders (or equivalent)
   will review AEFI codes to ensure equal distribution across the five vulnerability periods to
   the maximum extent possible while meeting the needs of the organization.
   14.3.8. An Airman may voluntarily deploy outside his/her assigned AEF vulnerability period
   in accordance with the guidance outlined in paragraph 9.19. When doing so, the Airman’s
   AEFI will not change. The Airman remains vulnerable to deploy during his/her associated
   AEF block and, by the fact that they are volunteering, waive any incurred dwell from the
   associated deployment. Unit Commanders, in coordination with MAJCOM FAMs, must
   carefully consider impact to future deployments when allowing members to volunteer outside
   of their AEF vulnerability window (Note: Individuals who volunteer for a deployment
   outside their vulnerability window can be tasked to deploy for any requirement that they are
   qualified for within the vulnerability window).
14.4. Force Management of Individuals (Predeployment). Airmen will be associated to an
AEF vulnerability period in accordance with paragraph 14.3. This association will be
documented in MilPDS and the Airmen will be notified by unit commander of the association.
The AEF vulnerability period is the period of time the forces aligned in a specific AEF block are
susceptible to initial deployment and will mirror the vulnerability period (AEF block) to which
their unit’s UTCs are aligned. Only one AEF block from each Tempo Band will be vulnerable at
a time. Individuals will not be selected for taskings with an RDD outside of their AEF
vulnerability period except in cases of reach forward. However, Airmen may be tasked to attend
predeployment training prior to the start of their vulnerability window or deploy for an extended
period beyond the established vulnerability timeframe. Alternate AEF battle rhythms may
dictate an accelerated deployment schedule.
   14.4.1. Changing an Individual’s AEFI. Once associated, changing an individual’s AEFI
   will only be done under extenuating circumstances as follows. Individuals will be notified,
   in writing, by unit commander of AEFI change. If an Airman has recently deployed, the
   Airman should not be associated with an AEFI within the Tempo Band that would require
   the Airman to deploy at a rate greater than the tempo rate of the band. If wing commanders,
   or equivalent, approve a second deployment with less than the dwell for their capability
   Tempo Band, they will inform their respective MAJCOM/CV (or, in the case of
   FOAs/DRUs, the first general officer or civilian equivalent in the organization’s chain of
   command). Note: This applies to Airmen who have deployed; no waiver is required if
   Airmen did not deploy during their AEF vulnerability period.
338                                                AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


      14.4.1.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS). When PCSing, the gaining commander
      will, within the provisions of paragraph 14.3., associate the individual with an AEFI that
      allows the most time between AEF vulnerability periods from previous AEFI while
      deconflicting the projected AEF vulnerability window from the Airman's DEROS or
      Maximum Controlled Tour Expiration Date when applicable.
      14.4.1.2. Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). The Airman should be associated to
      the same Tempo Band as previously associated, if possible. If not possible, the rule sets
      for PCSing will be followed.
      14.4.1.3. HAF-directed Realignment (e.g. capability area rebalanced or rebanded). HAF
      functional director may direct UTC realignment either within (e.g. to better balance
      functional capabilities across a particular Tempo Band) or between Tempo Bands as part
      of the AEF Schedule band evaluation. When executing these realignments, every effort
      should be made to realign AEF vulnerability periods for as few Airmen as necessary.
      Furthermore, commanders should make every effort to deconflict realigned vulnerability
      periods with the Airman's projected DEROS or Maximum Controlled Tour Expiration
      Date, when applicable. No waiver is required to change the resulting association in
      MilPDS.
      14.4.1.4. Temporary Non-Deployable Status.         Airmen who become temporarily
      disqualified during their AEF vulnerability period may be utilized upon return to
      deployable status to meet unit deployment requirements. Immediately upon return to
      deployable status the disqualified Airman may be utilized to fill out-of-cycle
      requirements or short notice individual augmentation requests. Unit commanders, with
      wing commander approval, may also realign the Airman with an upcoming vulnerability
      period. Wings will report these changes to MAJCOM/CV in accordance with MAJCOM
      direction.
      14.4.1.5. Professional Development. Wing commanders, or equivalents, may approve a
      change in an individual's AEF association when the change is to facilitate career
      progression (e.g., individual is promoted and moved to a position commensurate with the
      new grade). To minimize re-sourcing actions, changes to AEFI should be made at least 6
      months prior to previous associated AEF block/pair, when feasible. Every effort will be
      made to assign the individual to a position that will provide the greatest amount of time
      between AEF vulnerability periods while deconflicting the realigned vulnerability
      periods with the Airman's projected DEROS or Maximum Controlled Tour Expiration
      Date when applicable. Wings will report these changes to MAJCOM/CV in accordance
      with MAJCOM direction.
      14.4.1.6. Voluntary re-association. In cases as depicted in paragraph 14.4.1.4., unit
      commanders may seek Airmen to voluntarily deploy outside the AEF vulnerability period
      to fill the tasking of the individual who is temporarily nondeployable. In such instances,
      the wing commander may approve a swap of individuals’ AEFIs. Furthermore, two
      individuals from the same unit with the same qualifications may voluntarily request a
      swap of AEFIs as long as the needs of the unit are still met. This type of swap must be
      approved by the wing commander. Only one approved request per individual per AEF
      Schedule should be allowed. Wings will report these changes to MAJCOM/CV in
      accordance with MAJCOM direction.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                             339


      14.4.1.7. UTC-to-AEFI Misalignment. For units with UTCs postured in tempo bands, it
      is imperative that individuals are appropriately associated with the postured UTCs. In
      cases where there is a misalignment between individuals’ AEFIs and postured UTCs, unit
      commanders will direct changing an Airmen’s AEFI. Wings will report these changes to
      MAJCOM/CV in accordance with MAJCOM direction.
      14.4.1.8. Any other instances requiring a change in an Airmen’s AEFI requires
      MAJCOM/CV approval. This includes involuntary deployment of Airmen outside their
      associated AEF deployment period (except in cases of AFPC/DPW sourced UTCs in
      approved surge mode).
   14.4.2. Associating Airmen with an Enabler. Airmen associated with an Enabler category
   are not restricted by the number of times they may deploy or the lengths of a deployment as
   long as SecDef deploy-to-dwell rule sets are adhered to; however their PERSTEMPO rate
   should be equitably managed amongst those providing like capability. Every effort should be
   made, by the organization responsible for managing the Enabler category, to provide the
   Airmen in the Enabler an on-call/deployment schedule and accompanying guidance.
      14.4.2.1. An Airman’s association may be changed from an Enabler category to a Tempo
      Band without a MAJCOM/CV waiver.
   14.4.3. AEF Vulnerability and On-call Status. The AEF vulnerability period provides
   Airmen a degree of predictability in each GFM cycle, but does not guarantee the Airmen the
   same predictability from one GFM cycle to the next (e.g. a capability may be postured at a
   1:4 tempo for one GFM cycle then shift to a 1:3 or 1:2 tempo for the next based on emerging
   requirements). During AEF operations, eligible Airmen will deploy or remain on-call for the
   duration of their associated vulnerability period (Note: ARC personnel are not considered to
   be in an “on-call” status and can only be utilized in a volunteer or mobilized status). Airmen
   may be tasked to deploy for a period beyond the established vulnerability timeframe.
   Airmen will be ready to immediately deploy during their AEF eligibility period as new
   CCDR requirements can be sourced any time during the AEF period. If deployed near the
   end of the AEF eligibility period, the Airman must be prepared to remain deployed through
   the end of the next AEF rotation.
   14.4.4. Personnel Force Management. The Air Force assignment process will be managed to
   coincide with the AEF battle rhythm to the maximum extent possible. Commanders will
   make every effort to schedule voluntary PCS/ PCA departure dates, terminal leave dates for
   retirement, and separation dates, to occur during the 3-month period immediately following
   the Airman’s deployment eligibility period or return from deployment. See AFI 36-2110,
   Chapter 4. The assignment process will formally track AEF deployments on individual
   personnel records and provide visibility of individuals to all commanders. When nominating
   Airmen for Professional Military Education or Developmental Education (PME/DE),
   commanders must make every reasonable effort to deconflict PME/DE with AEF
   vulnerability periods when determining the timing of school attendance. A scheduled AEF
   deployment is not justification for operational deferment from PME/DE. Airmen should not
   be relieved from deployed duty if alternate school start dates are available which would allow
   deployment.
14.5. Force Management of Individuals (Post-deployment). Force management of personnel
during the deployment and employment process are covered in AFI 10-403, Deployment
 340                                                    AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


Planning and Execution and AFI 36-3802, Personnel Readiness Operations. AEF deployment
force management policies are covered in paragraphs 9.17. through 9.21.
14.6. Sourcing Individuals to Fulfill CCDR Requirements. Note: This section does not
apply to sourcing individuals to fill indeterminate TDY (ITDY) taskings; ITDY guidance is in
AFI 36-2110. The following will be used as the sourcing process for those personnel assigned to
“Other” Organizations. It provides a systematic approach to source, following the appropriate
path based on tasking type. It will match the resource request with the most appropriate pool of
resources and provide a method to tap into additional pools should resources be unavailable.
    14.6.1. Tasking Type and Determining Sourcing Methodology and Appropriate Resource
    Pool. The sourcing methodology and pool from which requirements are drawn will be
    guided by the first character of the tasking type code assigned to each requirement in
    accordance with paragraph 8.14.8.1. and Table 8.3. If the tasking type is “K” (i.e. IA
    requirement), the primary sourcing pool is the Institutional Force and the MilPDS sourcing
    methodology will be followed; if the tasking type is other than “K” (i.e. “unit-like”
    requirement), the primary sourcing pool is the warfighting force and the UTC sourcing
    process (see paragraph 9.9.) will be followed. See Table 14.2.
          14.6.1.1. DELETED.
          14.6.1.2. Functional areas that must routinely deviate from this business rule will obtain
          a standing waiver from their respective DCS. This waiver will be made available to
          AFPC and MAJCOMs.
          14.6.1.3. Some Ad hoc sourcing solutions, to include those for which an ad hoc
          spreadsheet is provided via JCRM, may be better suited to the MilPDS sourcing
          methodology. If necessary, the AFPC functional scheduler will coordinate with the HAF
          FAM to determine the preferred sourcing methodology for these requirements. If ad hoc
          requirements are sourced via MilPDS sourcing, the sourcing pool may be from
          Institutional Force or warfighting force; however, if using warfighting force assets,
          coordination with applicable MAJCOM is required to ensure assigned/committed and AF
          missions, as defined by P-coding, or critical UTC composition are not broken. By-name
          requests, regardless of tasking type, will be sourced via MilPDS sourcing with
          AFPC/DPW entering tasked PAS and SSAN in DCAPES.

Note 1: Some ad hoc requirements may be better suited to MilPDS sourcing
methodology

Note 2: If MilPDS sourcing is used to identify and source Airmen from operational
units, wing commanders will be the approval authority of any ensuing reclama if
tasking the selected Airman will break a critical operational UTC.

   14.6.2. Selection of Individuals Using MilPDS Data. MilPDS data will be filtered to create
   a pool of personnel available and qualified to meet the combatant commander’s requirement
   in accordance with standard MilPDS business rules (see paragraph 14.6.2.3). For taskings
   that cannot be appropriately sourced using standard rule sets, HAF DCS will notify
   AFPC/CC of appropriate sourcing rule sets (e.g. use of alternate pool authorized for certain
   taskings). Schedulers must include applicable ARC qualifiers to ensure RC members are/are
   not considered for sourcing. Students, transients, patients and prisoners will not be tasked for
   deployment.
      14.6.2.1. Individuals assigned to OSD components, defense agencies, and DoD field
      activities (see Table A8.3) will not be tasked without prior written approval from the
      Office of the Secretary of Defense Director of Administration and Management
      (OSD/A&M). In accordance with DoDD 1315.07, it is OSD/A&M’s responsibility to
      “assign, reassign, and release members to and from OSD and DoD Field Activities.”
      Individuals assigned to CCDR staffs will be requested through the appropriate J1 staff.
      14.6.2.2. Due to the size, nature, and mission of Air Force units designated as “Other,”
      many will face mission degradation that does not allow full accessibility to those
      personnel within the AEF vulnerability period. The Air Staff will determine a Service
      planning factor for sourcing from institutional organizations prior to each GFM cycle.
      14.6.2.3. Standard MilPDS Sourcing Business Rules. Personnel availability and
      qualification will be based on the following factors: (1) An individual’s MilPDS AEFI;
      (2) DRMD stated AFSC, grade, and restrictive line remarks; and (3) existing
      nondeployable DAV codes (see AFI 10-403, Attachment 2). Individuals are expected to
      be available during their AEF vulnerability period or must have an appropriate DAV
      code, with appropriate expiration date, in MilPDS.
          14.6.2.3.1. To create a sufficient pool of available and qualified personnel,
          AFPC/DPW will initially follow the standard MilPDS sourcing business rules. If
          necessary, AFPC/DPW scheduler will coordinate with HAF and/or AF FP FAM to
          expand criteria including, but not limited to, AFSC and/or grade substitution or
          DRMD inclusive line remarks. If necessary, the AFFOR will be contacted to
          negotiate substitutions not already identified in the requirement. If sufficient
          resources do not exist in the applicable X-block, AFPC/CC will request sourcing
          mitigation in accordance with paragraph 8.14.8.2.2.1.
          14.6.2.3.2. Similarly, if a large pool of available and qualified personnel exists after
          initial filtering, AFPC/DPW may add additional filters (e.g. excluding commander’s
          choice DAV codes) to better prioritize eligible personnel).
 342                                                 AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013


          14.6.2.3.3. Institutional Force “Any AFSC” Sourcing Business Rules. Within the
          ECS CPS, tasking type "K" “any AFSC” requirements will be allocated and
          scheduled to the generic MAJCOM TPAS in accordance with ECS SIPT-approved
          business rules. Upon receipt of an “any AFSC” requirement, AFPC/DPW will filter
          MilPDS data to create and prioritize a manageable pool of eligible and qualified
          personnel in accordance with paragraph 14.6.2.4. In addition, professional career
          fields will not be considered for “any AFSC” requirements and rated officers will
          only be considered for rated requirements (Note: For taskings sourced to a rated
          Airman, AFPC/DPW will notify AF/A3O to review sourcing solution). MAJCOMs
          are authorized to make a UIC and/or name change and, when necessary, will utilize
          their A1 staff to create a MAJCOM-wide list of eligible qualified personnel within
          the vulnerability period." *

Figure 14.1. AFPC Sourcing Process.




       14.6.2.4. Prioritizing Eligible Personnel. The pool of available and qualified personnel
       will be evaluated by AFPC/DPW based on input criteria, sorted by number of
       contingency deployments (as defined by Duty Status 20, Contingency Deployment),
       earliest deployment return date, number of short tours, and earliest short tour return date
       (STRD).
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                         343


      14.6.2.5. AFPC will enter the tasked PAS and SSAN of the identified most eligible
      person into DCAPES and place the ULN in the designated FM for verification (see
      paragraph 9.9.3.). In the event the organization seeks to make a name change, upon
      request, AFPC/DPW can provide a list of other personnel who meet the requirement
      criteria within the organization.
   14.6.3. Evaluation of Tasking. Upon receipt of a deployment tasking from AFPC, the tasked
   MAJCOM/DRU/FOA will follow similar procedures for UTC taskings: accept the sourcing
   solution (see paragraph 8.14.9.); initiate a UIC change or name change (see paragraph
   10.21.8); or submit a reclama (see section 10C). All actions must be taken in accordance
   with Table 8.5 timelines.
14.7. Forms Adopted. AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request; AF Form 723, SORTS DOC

Terms
AEF Capability Library— Consists of 100% of the USAF’s postured capability and
encompasses one iteration of each of the 41 AEF blocks plus the Enabler force
AF Shortfall— The lack of forces, equipment, personnel, materiel or capability, reflected as the
difference between the resources identified as a plan requirement (or Service asset) and those
apportioned to a combatant commander (or assigned to the Service) for planning that would
adversely affect the command’s ability to accomplish its mission.
Alignment— The determination of which AEF block/pair or Enabler a specific UTC/UIC record
is postured against.
Associate UTC— Unit manpower that provides a capability that is not captured in a standard
UTC will be postured into an "Associate" UTC (A-UTC). A-UTCs do not have a mission
capability statement and do not have a defined manpower detail. They are placeholders for all
deployable positions that cannot be described or do not fit into an existing standard deployable
UTC.
Backfill— Reserve Component units and individuals recalled to replace deploying active units
and/or individuals in the continental United States and outside the continental United States.
Break the Base— A Base or Wing Commander’s assessment, by function, of a deployed forces
level at which he/she can no longer operate critical, base level, functions. Examples of such
functions are base security and airfield operations.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                              359


Code— 1. Any system of communication in which arbitrary groups of symbols represent units
of plain text of varying length. Codes may be used for brevity or for security. 2. A cryptosystem
in which the cryptographic equivalents (usually called "code groups") typically consisting of
letters or digits (or both) in otherwise meaningless combinations are substituted for plain text
elements which are primarily words, phrases, or sentences.
Coding— The act of assigning availability codes to postured UTCs in the AEF availability
library.
Contingency Planning— (DOD) 1. The Joint Operation Planning and Execution System
process involving the development of joint operation plans for contingencies identified in joint
strategic planning documents. Deliberate planning is accomplished in prescribed cycles that
complement other Department of Defense planning cycles in accordance with the formally
established Joint Strategic Planning System. 2. A planning process for the deployment and
employment of apportioned forces and resources that occurs in response to a hypothetical
situation. Contingency planners rely heavily on assumptions regarding the circumstances that
will exist when the plan is executed. See also Joint Operation Planning and Execution System;
Joint Strategic Planning System.
Crisis Action Planning— (DOD) 1. The Joint Operation Planning and Execution System
process involving the time-sensitive development of joint operation plans and orders in response
to an imminent crisis. Crisis action planning follows prescribed crisis action procedures to
formulate and implement an effective response within the time frame permitted by the crisis. 2.
The time-sensitive planning for the deployment, employment, and sustainment of assigned and
allocated forces and resources that occur in response to a situation that may result in actual
military operations. Crisis action planners base their plan on the circumstances that exist at the
time planning occurs. Also called CAP. See also Joint Operation Planning and Execution
System.
Cross functional UTC—A cross-functional UTC is one made up of manpower and/or
equipment from different functional areas. Members of cross-functional UTCs work together and
represent their functional expertise towards a common mission goal. When functional entities in
a cross functional UTC only perform functionally-unique duties, then the capability should be
defined in a standard UTC with a functional mission. Single functional areas that are inherently
linked to an organization UTC (e.g. a First Sergeant in a squadron-level UTC) do not constitute
a cross-functional UTC.
Degree of Risk— (DOD) As specified by the commander, the risk to which friendly forces may
be subjected from the effects of the detonation of a nuclear weapon used in the attack of a close-
in enemy target; acceptable degrees of risk under differing tactical conditions are emergency,
moderate, and negligible.
Deliberate Planning— Superseded (see Contingency Planning).
Enabler— In addition to those forces in the AEF Tempo Bands, the AEF includes strategic
“enabler” or common user assets, such as long-range mobility, special operations forces (SOF),
space forces, and other uniquely categorized forces that provide support to authorized
organizations within and outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force
movements of AEF forces. Forces postured in the Enabler categories are not given stability and
predictability, and therefore should be kept to a minimum.

Force Structure— Numbers, size, and composition of the units that comprise our Defense
forces; e.g., divisions, ships, air wings.
Hazard— (DOD) A condition with the potential to cause injury, illness, or death of personnel;
damage to or loss of equipment or property; or mission degradation.
In Place Support Requirement—A requirement that is needed at home station to conduct day-
to-day operations while a base has forces deployed. In-place requirements are the absolute
minimum requirements needed to keep critical base level functions operating at minimum
capability.
In Place Wartime Mission— - A capability that is intended to perform its wartime mission
from home station. Wartime mission is considered that capability that is providing direct support
to a combatant commander. These requirements should be identified in a combatant
commander’s OPLAN, or as a minimum, a Service’s CONUS-based TPFDD.
Military Capability— (DOD) The ability to achieve a specified wartime objective (win a war or
battle, destroy a target set). It includes four major components: force structure, modernization,
readiness, and sustainability
Modernization— Technical sophistication of forces, units, weapon systems, and equipment.
Readiness— The ability of forces, units, weapon systems, or equipment to deliver the outputs
for which they were designed (includes the ability to deploy and employ without unacceptable
delays).
Sustainability— The ability to maintain the necessary level and duration of operational activity
to achieve military objectives. Sustainability is a function of providing for and maintaining those
levels of ready forces, materiel, and consumables necessary to support military effort.
Mitigation— Actions taken to make capability available while minimizing the effect to the
home station mission.
Operational Capability Package (OCP)— A method of packaging command and control,
operational mission, and ECS forces for presentation to a CCDR through the COMAFFOR. The
OCPs provide pre-packaged capability playbooks to optimize planning.
Posturing— The act of converting the unit manpower document into Unit Type Codes (UTC)
and aligning them to a specific AEF block/pair.
Posturing Codes (P-Codes)— Posturing codes indicate the number of UTCs that a unit has
postured that are needed at homestation (either for CCDR or Service support) or are available for
deployment (ref paragrah 7.13.1.1). The codes are located in the “P-Code” column of the UTC
Availability. The specific procedures and guidelines for determining a UTC record’s P-Code are
outlined in paragraphs 7.14. and 7.16.
Range of Military Operations (ROMO)— The general categories of operations within which
the military participates to fulfill the general strategic goals of the US government. These
operations are broadly defined as War and Operations Other Than War. War involves combat
operations and has as its general goal the ability to fight and win. Operations Other Than War
may involve noncombat or combat operations; the general goals of these operations are,
respectively, promote peace and deter war/resolve conflict.
AFI10-401_AFGSCSUP_I 29 MAY 2013                                                                361


Reachback— (DOD) The process of obtaining products, services, and applications, or forces, or
equipment, or material from organizations that are not forward deployed
Reclama— A request to duly constituted authority to reconsider its decision or its proposed
action (AFI 10-401). The reclama process is the process to “request to duly constituted authority
to reconsider its decision or its proposed action” (JP 1-02) when a valid shortfall exists or in the
event the wing or tasked unit has the capability, but fulfilling the tasking would cause a severe
adverse impact on the wing/unit mission (AFTTP: AF Reclama Process). It is the means for
communicating the inability to meet the Combatant Commander’s requirements when an initial
requirement cannot be met.
Risk— 1. Probability and severity of loss linked to hazards. 2. See degree of risk. See also
hazard; risk management.
Risk Assessment— (DOD) The identification and assessment of hazards (first two steps of risk
management process).
Risk Management— (DOD) The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling, risks arising
from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk cost with mission benefits. Also
called RM. See also risk.
Rotational Operations— Known on going operations where a requirement is needed at a
deployed location for longer than the standard, four month, AEF tasking. Forces will normally be
required to deploy for a standard tour and at the completion of that tour, will be replaced by the
same capability which, in turn, will be replaced. Rotational operations can be sustained
indefinitely. All requirements must meet the following rotational criteria: established supported
Combatant Commander rotational requirements; requirements expected to exist for greater than
one calendar year; must have a PID/TPFDD/DRMD network.
Steady State— The situation where a military involvement is perceived as long-term, on going
and continuous.
Surge— 1. An increase in the production or repair of defense goods of limited duration. (DOD
Dictionary of Military Terms); 2. The condition where rotational requirements exceed the
available D*S capability within the currently deployed AEF pair (AFI 10-401). Surge operations
are only sustainable for a limited duration, and require greater than normal
recovery/reconstitution. This may reduce the future level of capability the AEF can provide.
Therefore, a surge is not authorized to support exercises or rotational presence. A surge may
involve up to all AEF blocks/pairs. Surge Operations are described in AFPD 10-4, Section 4.
Sustainment— (DOD) The provision of personnel, logistic, and other support required to
maintain and prolong operations or combat until successful accomplishment or revision of the
mission or of the national objective.
Unit Type Code (UTC)— (DOD) A Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code,
consisting of five characters that uniquely identify a "type unit."
Unit Type Code Shortfall— When a wing or tasked installation does not possess sufficient
equipment or qualified personnel to support a UTC tasking they will submit a UTC shortfall
through the Installation Deployment Officer/Installation Deployment Readiness Cell via
Reclama Processing Tool (RPT).

Waiver— Specifications. A written authorization to accept a configuration item (CI) or other
designated item, which, during production, or after having been submitted for inspection, is
found to depart from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable as is or after
rework by an approved method.
Waiver— Decision to not require certain criteria to be met for certain reasons, such as national
security.

                           JCS UNIT DESCRIPTOR CODES (UDCS

A8.1. JCS Unit Descriptor Codes (UDC). The mechanism for differentiating between
organizations fulfilling USC Title 10 responsibilities and those designated for USC Title 10
CCDR warfighting support will be the JCS UDC. Every organization (defined by a personnel
accounting symbol (PAS)) is described by a JCS UDC as Combat, Combat Support, Combat
Service Support, or “Other”. The JCS UDC applies to the entire unit, not the AFSCs or the
authorization/personnel assigned to the organization.
A8.1.1. Every organization is assigned a JCS UDC when registered in the PAS table, providing
the source data for registering organizations in Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) of Global
Status of Resources (GSORTS). AF/A1M is responsible for establishing policies and procedures
in determining UDCs. MAJCOMs, Direct Reporting Units (DRU), and Field Operating
Agencies (FOA) will coordinate changes to an organization’s UDC through applicable HAF
DCS to AF/A1M.

A8.2. Determining JCS UDC for Air Force Organizations. Organizations will have only one
UDC and should select the UDC that most closely describes the organization’s primary mission.
If a MAJCOM determines that an organization can be “Other” or one of the “combat” categories,
the MAJCOM should select the combat category that most closely describes the organization’s
primary mission. The codes and definitions outlined in Tables A8.1 and A8.2 will be used to
identify Air Force organizations:

Services, refer to CJCSM 3150.02. Definitions and inclusions are AF-specific and
capture the unique aspects of Air Force organizations; for a more inclusive list of combat,
combat support, and combat service support units, refer to AFI 10-201, Attachment 2.

A8.3. JCS UDC for Organizations “Outside” the Air Force. The UDC for an organization
“outside” the Air Force will be determined by its parent organization. If its parent organization
has not designated a JCS UDC, the Air Force will assign it a JCS UDC characterized as “Other”
(the code itself varies depending on component, see Table A8.1).
     A8.3.1. Organizations “outside” the Air Force can be identified by their MAJCOM code
     and, in some cases, by their PAS code. The MAJCOM codes listed in Table A8.3. are
     considered “outside” the Air Force.
