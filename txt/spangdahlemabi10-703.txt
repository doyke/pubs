                             EWIR

A5.1. When the EW Section is tasked with a SB or PW reprogramming, speed and coordination
are crucial. MSDDS is the primary means of message receipt, but the 52 CMS may need to
contact the 52FW ECO for reprogramming information.
   A5.1.1. The 52 CMS will maintain a current letter with the Wing ECO listing 52 CMS
   individuals authorized to receive SB and PW messages and data products.
   A5.1.2. The 52 CMS will ensure adequate numbers of individuals on all shifts have access to
   the MSDDS for reprogramming issues.
A5.2. The EW Section will operate IAW AFI 21-109, Communications Security (COMSEC)
Equipment Maintenance and Maintenance Training.
A5.3. Upon notification of a reprogramming change, the EW Section will contact the wing ECO
to coordinate a EWIR action team meeting, if requested.
A5.4. The EW Section will maintain a message folder for EWIR messages and a chronological
log of EWIR events. The chronological log will contain important date and time groups of
exercise events (initial notification, receipt of data, start of reprogramming, completion times,
etc.) with a detailed explanation of events and problems encountered.
A5.5. The 52 CMS will ensure 24-hour coverage by qualified individuals and recall
reprogramming equipment from the AMUs, as necessary.
A5.6. During the reprogramming, 52 CMS will:
   A5.6.1. Comply with all messages directing maintenance actions.
   A5.6.2. Verify all software reprogramming changes by performing operational and
   functional check IAW applicable technical orders.
   A5.6.3. Report all discrepancies or problems to the wing ECO as soon as practical.
   A5.6.4. Assist the wing ECO in transferring EWIR program materials to the fighter
   squadrons.
A5.7. At termination of reprogramming, the 52 CMS will submit a report of the reprogramming
event or exercise to the wing ECO within 12 hours to include: chronological events log,
description of problems encountered, and recommendations for improvement.

          52 AMXS/22 AMU, 23 AMU, AND 81 AMU PROCEDURES FOR EWIR

A6.1. AMU EWIR Reprogramming Procedures.
     A6.1.1. Each flight will provide the MOC and Wing ECO a current POC roster for non-duty
     hour notification and authorizing classified EWIR message receipt.
     A6.1.2. Each AMU avionics shop will ensure adequate numbers of individuals on all shifts
     have access to MSDDS for reprogramming issues. A SIPRNET account will be maintained
     at each AMU for this purpose.
        A6.1.2.1. MSDDS will be considered the primary method of receiving reprogramming
        data, when available. If squadron operations are unable to assist in downloading data
        from MSDDS, the wing ECO will be considered an alternate means of coordinating
        EWIR data receipt.
     A6.1.3. Upon notification of EWIR, AMUs will contact the Wing ECO to coordinate a
     EWIR action team meeting or receive specific instructions and guidance.
     A6.1.4. Those units able to download and access files on MSDDS will notify the wing ECO
     of data receipt.
     A6.1.5. Download reprogramming data from MSDDS or pick up the data disk from the
     squadron ECP or wing ECO. Do not start reprogramming procedures until the IMP is
     received and communicated through the ECO/ECP or verbally received from the MOC.
     A6.1.6. AMUs will start a chronological events log. The log will contain date and times of
     events (initial notification, receipt of data, start reprogramming, aircraft tail numbers, and
     completion times) and a detailed explanation of problems encountered and suggestions for
     improvement.
     A6.1.7. Reprogramming personnel will coordinate the affected systems and aircraft tail
     numbers. This coordination will include the squadron ECP, Production Superintendent and
     the MOC.
        A6.1.7.1. Aircraft prioritization will take into account specific EWIR sortie
        requirements, if required.
        A6.1.7.2. All Aircraft in a formation will be configured with the same software. There
        should not be a formation launched with two reprogrammed jets, and two non-
        reprogrammed jets.
     A6.1.8. Once implementation is authorized, check reprogramming equipment status and
     configure the required aircraft. For IMMEDIATE or URGENT reprogramming, criteria are
     2 hours for the first aircraft/pod and 12 hours for the last directed aircraft/pod from the
     release of the implementation message. This guidance is for tactical evaluation or real world
     contingency actions; however, many situations do not require time critical actions. The wing
     ECO will provide required guidance to units clearly specifying time criteria and required
     actions. Note: EURO LIGHTNING generation requirements may not allow a full 12 hours
     to reprogram, however, these scenarios should call for a limited number of assets.
SPANGDAHLEMABI10-703 2 OCTOBER 2009                                                       13


  A6.1.9. AMU personnel will ensure the aircraft AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
  Discrepancy and Work Document, indicates reprogramming of affected EW systems and
  software configuration (e.g. "ALQ-131 reprogrammed to MT# __________/PT#__________").
  A6.1.10. When an ALQ-131 Electronic Counter-Measure (ECM) pod is loaded with a
  combat tape, the AFTO Form 781A will be documented as an INFO entry with the following
  information: "ECM Combat Tape MT#__________/PT#__________ loaded. DO NOT
  TRANSMIT WITHOUT DIRECTION FROM HIGHER HQ. FLY IN STANDBY ONLY."
  Retain this note until the ECM pod is downloaded or reprogrammed back to training settings.
  This note will be entered into the discrepancy block.
     A6.1.10.1. AMU personnel will change the ALQ-131 ECM pod side panel placards to
     show the reprogramming setting (Mission Tape/Power Management Tape numbers and
     date loaded). THIS ENTRY IS MADE WITH A GREASE PENCIL.
     A6.1.10.2. During exercises, do not reprogram ECM pods that are not on aircraft unless
     directed by the wing ECO.
  A6.1.11. For ALR-69/ALR-56M, make an INFO entry in the AFTO Form 781A as follows:
  “ALR-69/ALR-56M reprogrammed to SWV______."
  A6.1.12. AMUs will notify the MOC of start time, completion time and aircraft tail number.
  A6.1.13. Coordinate with the wing ECO and MOC to arrange reprogramming of deployed
  aircraft.
  A6.1.14. At termination of a reprogramming exercise (SB), coordinate with the squadron
  ECP or wing ECO, Production Supervisor and MOC to reprogram the affected systems back
  to original settings. Mark the ECM pods with the training Mission Tape and Power
  Management Tape numbers and annotate in the aircraft AFTO Form 781A.
  A6.1.15. Notify the Production Supervisor, MOC, and wing ECO of completion.
  A6.1.16. Submit a report of the reprogramming action (SERENE BYTE or PACER WARE)
  within 12 hours IAW paragraph 2.6.5 to 52 OSS/OSK to include:
     A6.1.16.1. Date/time notified of reprogramming and implementation authorization
     A6.1.16.2. Date/time affected aircraft were configured.
     A6.1.16.3. If sorties were flown with reprogrammed equipment, AMUs will provide:
         A6.1.16.3.1. Line number.
         A6.1.16.3.2. Tail number.
         A6.1.16.3.3. System discrepancies.
         A6.1.16.3.4. Takeoff and land time (if discrepancies are reported).
         A6.1.16.3.5. Any problems encountered and recommendations for improvement.
         Also include any inputs from FS/ECP.

            WING ECO (OR ALTERNATE) REPROGRAMMING CHECKLIST

Note: Alternates should proceed to 52OSS/OSK vault to refer to PW/SB reprogramming binder
for complete, updated, in-depth reprogramming procedures. Use this list as a general overview
for reprogramming responsibilities.
A9.1. Obtain the message via the DMS or MSDDS.
     A9.1.1. The PACERWARE DATA BASE, MSDDS, and 52 FW/CP are all primary means
     for notification of any PACERWARE/SERENE BYTE.
     A9.1.2. For after-hours notification of IMMEDIATE priority messages, proceed
     immediately to wing weapons and start the procedures outlined in the PW and SB
     reprogramming binder. In the event an alternate is called and does not have access to the
     intelligence vault door, have the 52 FW/CP contact someone within 52 OSS/OSK or 52
     OSS/IN for entry.
        A9.1.2.1. IMMEDIATE precedence messages may require a recall of required personnel
        and may be considered an emergency action during combat operations.
        A9.1.2.2. For messages of PRIORITY precedence, notify the MOC and squadron ECPs
        that reprogramming will begin first opportunity during normal duty hours.
        A9.1.2.3. For messages of ROUTINE precedence, Flagging Reports and INFO
        messages, notify affected organizations and comply with any instructions in a timely
        manner during duty hours.
A9.2. Confirm the priority of the message and affected aircraft with MOC. Be sure that
MOC notifies all appropriate agencies in a timely fashion.
A9.3. Contact EWIR Action Team members to coordinate necessary reprogramming activities.
Required personnel may include the MOC, affected squadron operations ECPs and AMU flights,
wing intelligence and 52 CMS.
A9.4. Direct all reprogramming activities and remain in contact with the participating units.
Distribute messages from the DMS or MSDDS to the MOC, affected fighter squadron ECPs and
affected AMUs (if they do not have access to the DDS).
A9.5. Inform the 52 OG/CC and 52 MXG/CC of potential reprogramming. Request their
verbal approval in order to immediately begin implementation once the IMP is received.
A9.6. Call USAFE/DOTW and request approval for implementation.
     A9.6.1. This will be a verbal approval with follow-on message.
A9.7. Inform affected units through the MOC and squadron ECPs of the implementation
authorization.
A9.8. Ensure reprogramming is performed by all affected units. This includes deployed
units. Coordinate with the squadrons and MOC for reprogramming of off-station aircraft.
     A9.8.1. The first aircraft must be reprogrammed within 2 hours of receipt of the IMP for
     exercise scenarios and messages of IMMEDIATE importance. Depending on the nature of
SPANGDAHLEMABI10-703 2 OCTOBER 2009                                                           19


   the exercise, reprogramming completion for all aircraft may be required within 12 hours or
   less (Euro Lightning) of IMP receipt. If all aircraft are affected, reprogram even partially
   mission-capable aircraft.
A9.9. Ensure the wing and squadron intelligence sections are briefed on the system changes.
A9.10. Inform the squadron ECPs to brief all pilots on EWIR actions that affect system
performance or operation.
A9.11. Start a chronological events log. At a minimum include:
   A9.11.1. Date and time of message, distribution, and receipt of all reprogramming messages.
   A9.11.2. Date and time USAFE/DOTW authorizes implementation.
   A9.11.3. Date and time reprogramming begins on each system involved.
   A9.11.4. Date and time reprogramming completed on each system.
   A9.11.5. Results of any flight testing at an EC Range.
   A9.11.6. All problems encountered with suggestions for improvement.
A9.12. At termination of reprogramming prepare a Unit Loading Message (ULM) (see
Attachment 11).
A9.13. Insure that all aircraft and pods are returned to their original configuration after a SB
exercise.
A9.14. The wing ECO (or acting alternate) will write the after-action report (see Attachment

Unit Codes: Codes for individual units are based on their distinctive unit aircraft identification
markings (tail codes). Provisional units and units without tail codes generate an originator identifier
with their aircraft identification markings (tail codes - SP = Spangdahlem). Provisional units and
units without tail codes generate an identifier with their Major Command (MAJCOM).

(6) Three-Digit Sequence Number Designation: Number each message sequentially by system and
message type (for example, 001 for the first ALR-69 OCR, 002 for the next ALR-69 OCR, and so
on). NOTE: The first RIM for an ALQ-131 reprogramming action will also be 001. Do not attempt
to follow other originators' numbering sequences.

(7) Subject Line Classification: Classify the subject line IAW the classification of the material
within the subject line. For ease of communication it is suggested to keep the subject line
UNCLASSIFIED.

For further guidance on EWIR message designation standards see AFI 10-703.
