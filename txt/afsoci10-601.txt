1. AFSOC Requirements Process. This instruction provides guidance on developing new
acquisition programs to resolve deficiencies and also includes guidance for the AFSOC SR
process. This instruction also identifies several process exceptions to include the following:
Modification Management, Military Construction (MILCON), vehicles, and the communication
and information systems (IS). AFSOC organizations shall first try to satisfy capability
gaps/shortfalls through non-materiel solutions, such as Doctrine, Organization, Training,
materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTmLPF-P) changes.
Capability based planning, top down directed initiatives, urgent/emergent and compelling needs,
science and technology (S&T), and lessons learned are the most common methods of identifying
deficiencies. If the capability gap cannot be mitigated through a non-materiel solution, then the
gap requires a materiel solution. Listed below are some of the more common sources of
requirements documents:
   1.1. Sources of Requirements Documents.
       1.1.1. Capabilities-Based Planning. Capabilities-based planning is the process of
       forecasting under uncertainty to provide capabilities that address warfighter effects and
       operational environments. The AF uses a Service-wide capabilities-based planning
       process where Core Function Lead Integrators (CFLI) develop their respective Core
       Function Master Plans (CFMPs) based on AF strategic guidance, operational expertise
       and analysis. The CFLIs then prioritize the individual capabilities within their own
       CFMPs based on risk and fiscal projections through the planning period. Through CFLI
       planning, capability shortfalls, capability gaps, and DOTmLPF-P analysis, opportunities
       are identified as potential inputs into the JCIDS process. CFLI assessments are also used
       to guide capabilities-based assessments (CBA). (AFI 10-601, paragraph 1.3.4.1.)
       1.1.2. Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA). The CBA forms the analytical basis for
       operational capability requirements development and is an integral part of the
       capabilities-based planning process. In most situations, the CBA is the first step in the
       requirements process. The CBA defines the capability required and any capability
       gaps/shortfalls identified during the assessment. Additional details on the CBA are
       provided in AFI 10-601, Chapter 4.
       1.1.3. Top-Down Direction. Higher authority may direct a sponsor to initiate the
       development and fielding of an operational system to meet warfighter needs. Written
       direction from the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or higher authority fulfills the
       AFPD 10-6, Capability Requirements Development, requirement for identifying a
       capability need. However, the designated sponsor is still responsible for conducting the
       appropriate supporting analysis and producing the necessary operational capability
       requirements documents to support development and/or fielding and sustainment of an
       operational system. (AFI 10-601, paragraph 1.3.4.3.)
       1.1.4. Urgent/Emergent and Compelling Needs.
           1.1.4.1. USSOCOM utilizes the SOFCIDS-Urgent process to address urgent and
           compelling warfighter needs. The SOFCIDS-Urgent process uses the Combat
           Mission Needs Statements (CMNS) which addresses urgent and compelling Special
           Operations-Peculiar (SO-P) capability gaps. SOFCIDS-Urgent is not an unfunded
4                                                            AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014


           requirement request or means of circumventing the SOFCIDS Deliberate process.
           Detailed information for the USSOCOM SOFCIDS-Urgent process is found in
           USSOCOM Directive 71-4, Appendix C.
           1.1.4.2. The Air Force utilizes UONs/JUONs/JEONs to address urgent/emergent and
           compelling warfighter needs. Detailed information for the UONs/JUONs/JEONs
           process is found in AFI 10-601, Chapter 7.
       1.1.5. Science & Technology (S&T) Activities. Science and technological
       advancements and breakthroughs play a crucial role in providing warfighters with
       superior operational systems. Examples of programs and processes used to demonstrate,
       mature, and transition technologies include: Advanced Technology Demonstrations
       (ATDs), Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTDs), Flagship Capability
       Concepts (FCCs), experiments, operational exercises, war games, DOD and Air Force
       research efforts, and commercial sources identified within the Defense Science and
       Technology Program. Evaluation of the results of such activities may lead to a sponsor
       developing an appropriate operational capability requirements document to facilitate
       transition of mature and affordable technologies. For additional information on S&T
       activities refer to AFI 61-101, Management of Science and Technology. (AFI 10-601,
       paragraph 1.3.4.5.)
       1.1.6. Lessons Learned. A key method to achieve transformation of the Joint force is
       by producing compelling recommendations based on direct observations and sound
       analysis of current Joint operations, exercises and experiments. These recommendations
       (lessons) are derived from the full range of Joint activities and operations collected at the
       strategic, operational, and tactical level. Lessons assist senior leaders in making changes
       to DOTmLPF-P capabilities and guide associated programming, budgeting, and
       resourcing activities. To improve Joint capabilities and readiness, commanders may
       submit analytical observations directly to the Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP)
       through the Joint Lessons Learned Information System database, as described in CJCSI
       3150.25, Joint Lessons Learned Program, and/or to the Air Force Lessons Learned
       Program (AFL2P), as described in AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program, or
       USSOCOM Directive 11-3, Special Operations Forces Lessons Learned Program. (AFI
       10-601, paragraph 1.3.4.6.)
       1.1.7. Participation     in     Other  Organizations      Capability    Development
       Processes. Other organizations’ DOTmLPF-P based corrective actions may resolve
       capability gaps identified by the AFSOC Strategic Planning Process (SPP). The review
       of other AF MAJCOM, USSOCOM Component, and other services or agencies
       capability documents provides a primary entry point for AFSOC participation in other
       organizations’ capability development process. AFSOC is a member of the Air Force
       Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) and Special Operations Command
       Requirements Evaluation Board (SOCREB).
    1.2. Capabilities Development within AFSOC. The majority of AFSOC capabilities
    development actions are established within the command as a result of the Capabilities-Based
    Planning (CBP) process IAW current AFPD 90-11, Planning System; Chairman of the Joint
    Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01, Joint Capabilities Integration & Development
    System; and AFPD 10-6, Capabilities-Based Planning & Requirements Development. The
AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     5


  SPP generates the command prioritized gap list (PGL). AFSOC capability documents must
  satisfy capability gaps/shortfalls identified in the PGL, a combat need, lessons learned, safety
  deficiency, higher HQ direction, and other actions. HQ AFSOC/A5KR is the AFSOC focal
  point for staffing capabilities documents and will assist Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). HQ
  AFSOC/A5KR will submit command validated capability documents to the Air Staff and
  USSOCOM for approval. They will also assist the Air Staff and USSOCOM with AFSOC
  documents requiring submission to the Joint Staff.
     1.2.1. Strategic Planning Process. Principle products of the AFSOC SPP are the
     Prioritized Required Capabilities List (PRCL), the PGL, Decision to Proceed (D2P)
     direction from the AFSOC Planning Council, and the Commander’s annual AFSOC
     Strategic Vision. Refer to AFSOCI 90-1101, Strategic Planning Process, for further
     information regarding the SPP process. Designated PGL item managers (PGLIM) are
     responsible for implementing D2P decisions of the AFSOC Planning Council. For D2P
     decisions to “Proceed to Requirements Development,” the PGLIM for a specific
     capability gap will manage the development of products necessary to define and validate
     the requirements for a solution to correct that gap.
     1.2.2. JCIDS. The primary forms of documentation for a potential acquisition program
     are the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Capability Development Document
     (CDD), and the Capability Production Document (CPD) described briefly in this
     document and in more detail in the JCIDS Manual and AFI 10–601, Operational
     Capability Requirements Development. Document formats for an ICD, CDD, and CPD
     can be found in the JCIDS Manual. Additionally, USSOCOM has incorporated the
     Program Parameter Change (PPC) and National-to-Theater (N2T) capabilities documents
     to the overall development and integration system to address SOF peculiar issues. The
     format for these documents can be found in USSOCOM Directive 71-4, Special
     Operations Forces Capabilities Integration and Development System (SOFCIDS).
  1.3. Implementation. Air Force requirements are driven by desired effects and needed
  capabilities. All stakeholders in the acquisition framework must know why the Air Force
  needs a particular capability, how and where it will be used, who will use it, when it is
  needed, and how it will be supported and maintained. For a materiel solution, fielding an
  operational system starts with sound strategies for concept refinement, requirements
  development, acquisition and sustainment life cycle management, and test and evaluation
  (T&E). To be viable, these strategies must be developed in concert and require early and
  ongoing collaboration among operators, developers, programmers, systems engineers,
  acquirers, testers, sustainers, and intelligence analysts. No one strategy can stand alone and
  still be viable, since all are interdependent and require the integration of the others to be
  effective. Reference DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System and AFI
  63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management for additional information.
  1.3.1. Integrated Life Cycle Management. The purpose of the acquisition and sustainment
  framework is to efficiently deliver effective (meets the operational, warfighter, requirements)
  and sustainable operational systems. In concert with developing warfighter requirements,
  requirements definition balances life cycle cost, schedule and performance (both operational
  and sustainment). Refer to AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFI 10-601 for additional details.
 6                                                           AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014


        1.3.2. Acquisition Categories (ACAT) I, IA, II, III. (DODI 5000.2).The level of
        oversight and decision authority for an acquisition program is defined by its ACAT.
        Refer to Table A3.1. in Attachment 3 for the different ACAT levels.
        1.3.3. Joint Staffing Designators (JSD). A JSD is assigned to all JCIDS documents by
        the JS/J8 Gatekeeper, based on the actual/potential ACAT and Joint Staff equities (need
        for endorsements/certifications, special interest, previous guidance). The JSD sets the
        document staffing path/timeline and identifies validation authority. The JSD, along with
        the ACAT level, also provides the basis for determining the level of oversight and
        decision authority in the analytical efforts supporting the development of operational
        capability requirements. There are five Joint Staffing Designators: (1) Joint Requirements
        Oversight Council (JROC) Interest, (2) Joint Capability Board (JCB) Interest, (3) Joint
        Integration, (4) Joint Information, and (5) Independent (see AFI 10-601, paragraph 5.3.
        for more detailed information regarding JSDs). JROC Interest and JCB Interest require
        component level and joint validation, i.e. AFROC followed by the JCB/JROC. Joint
        Integration, Joint Information and Independent require component level validation only,
        i.e. AFROC.
     1.4. Capabilities Process Exceptions: The following processes are exceptions to the
     guidance within this AFSOC instruction and are provided as information and reference only.
        1.4.1. Air Force Modification Management Process. The Modification Management
        Process supports all modifications, safety of flight upgrades, and low-cost upgrades to
        fielded systems (signed DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report). Air
        Force low cost (below $83.5M procurement or $18.5M Research, Development, Test,
        and Evaluation (RDT&E) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2000 constant dollars), temporary, and test
        modifications to fielded systems are submitted and approved using AF Form 1067 IAW
        AFSOCI 63-1101. Refer to Attachment 4 for levels of authority and AFSOCI 63-1101
        for further information on the modification management process.
        1.4.2. Military Construction (MILCON). Requests for MILCON are not submitted
        through the A5KR process. The MILCON process is described in AFI 32-1021,
        Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, and USSOCOM
        Directive 415-1, Oversight of USSOCOM Military Construction Program. However,
        recent changes to USSOCOM processes dictated a change to the AFSOC Corporate
        Process. In accordance with AFSOC Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 16-501,
        AFSOC Corporate Structure Process, the Director of Installations and Mission Support
        (HQ AFSOC/A7) will conduct an AFSOC MILCON Board and Council for the purpose
        of validating Command MILCON requirements for submission to Headquarters Air
        Force or USSOCOM.
Note: Environmental assessments, MILCON, and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) project
costs associated with acquisition programs will be funded by the acquisition program when
directed by the Annual Planning and Programming Guidance.
        1.4.3. Vehicles. Commercial-off-the-shelf or government-off-the-shelf vehicle requests
        are submitted to HQ AFSOC/A4REV IAW AFI 24-302. Unique vehicles requiring
        developmental efforts will be pursued utilizing the capabilities development process.
AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     7


       1.4.4. Communication and Information Systems. In order to assure integrated and
       interoperable AFSOC Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR), air, ground,
       and Command & Control (C2) systems, requests for modifications or initiatives regarding
       common defensive or electronic warfare systems, air/ground radio communications
       ((e.g., radios, satellite communications (SATCOM) systems, waveforms, crypto, data
       links, message formats, modems, ancillaries, or antennas)), or platform information
       technology (IT) (e.g. laptops, software, cables) requestors shall coordinate their efforts
       with the respective HQ AFSOC/A5 and HQ AFSOC/A6 divisions as early as possible
       prior to proceeding with formal actions. Requests to obtain new non-developmental IT
       capabilities with total program cost of less than or equal to $15M are submitted and
       approved IAW AFSOCI 33-109. IAW AFI 10-601, “MAJCOMs have approval authority
       for IS solutions with software development costs less than $15M.” Development of new
       IT systems or IT systems, costing in excess of $15M, will be pursued utilizing the JCIDS
       process. IT requirements that exceed funding, basis of issue or manning limits, or Chief
       Information Officer (CIO) discretion will be validated through the AFSOC Requirements
       Board and Council before submission to FM for funding.
2. Service Requirement Contracts. The contract review process is necessary to ensure that
AFSOC refrains from utilizing contracted services unnecessarily. The 3 June 2012 Deputy
Secretary of Defense memorandum states “the Department’s obligations for all contracted
services shall not exceed, in FY 2012 and FY 2013, the total amount requested for the
Department for all contracted services in the President’s FY 2010 budget submission, excluding
contracted services relating to overseas contingency operations, military construction, and
research and development.” A contracted SR is defined as "a requirement that results in time
and effort of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task rather than to
furnish an end item of supply” (DODI 5000.02). AFSOC must continue to take action to comply
by adhering to the guidance in Attachment 2.
3. AFSOC Requirements Process Responsibilities.
   3.1. HQ     AFSOC/A5/8       Director,     Strategic   Plans,    Programs,      and
   Requirements. Develops and validates requirements/capability documents, Program
   Objective Memorandum (POM), Strategic Plans, doctrine, and force structure. The HQ
   AFSOC A5/8 also provides program oversight of AFSOC weapons systems.
   3.2. HQ AFSOC/A5K Strike/ISR and HQ AFSOC/A5R Mobility Requirements
   Divisions Chiefs. HQ AFSOC/A5K and HQ AFSOC/A5R are the primary focal points for
   AFSOC requirements and represent AFSOC in other MAJCOM, AF, and USSOCOM
   requirements processes. HQ AFSOC/A5K and HQ AFSOC/A5R are responsible for
   facilitating and coordinating AFSOC’s position for requirements development. HQ
   AFSOC/A5K and HQ AFSOC/A5R monitor the program execution and evaluates trade-offs
   in cost, schedule, and performance to ensure warfighter requirements are translated into
   operational capabilities.
   3.3. HQ AFSOC/A5KR Requirements Branch Chief. The Branch Chief is the OPR for
   AFSOC capability documents (e.g., ICDs/CDDs) staffing and consultation in other
   requirements process activities (e.g., AFSOC Requirements Board/Council, AFROC,
   SOCREB and JROC). HQ AFSOC/A5KR Branch is responsible for managing accounts for
8                                                            AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014


    the Information & Resource Support System (IRSS) and monitoring the Knowledge
    Management and Decision Support (KM/DS) tool for coordination requiring AFSOC action.
    3.4. HQ AFSOC/A-Staff and Special Staff. AFSOC Directors will accomplish
    sponsorship letters for requirements development activities that will resolve capability issues
    within their functional area which also identifies their functional SME (see paragraph 3.5.).
    Capability gaps originate from CBA activities and other inputs such as combat, exercises,
    customer inputs, and lessons learned. Efforts to meet/solve capability gaps listed in the PGL
    must be sponsored by an AFSOC Director. PGLIMs or other SMEs will facilitate or support
    events such as meetings, Integrated Process Teams (IPTs), document reviews, and studies.
    SMEs should be chosen based on expertise and continuity to the process.
    3.5. HQ AFSOC Functional SMEs. Functional SMEs will initiate document development
    and write the AF documents via the High Performance Team (HPT) process, to include
    obtaining required architectures (refer to AFI 10-601, para 3.5 for HPT guidance). They will
    write SOF documents with component participation as needed (refer to USSOCOM Directive
    71-4 for guidance). Both AF and SOF documents will then be presented through the AFSOC
    corporate process. The functional SME is responsible to assemble IPTs (similar to weapon
    systems IPTs) with the correct membership, facilitate meetings/IPTs, schedule events,
    coordinate staff packages and documents, contract for and oversee studies (as required), and
    coordinate with/among AFSOC and outside organizations. HQ AFSOC/A5KR members can
    provide assistance to the functional SME leading the IPTs with information regarding
    requirements processes, Joint Functional Concepts, AF Concept of Operations (CONOPS),
    SOCOM Principle Core Tasks, and AFSOC Core Missions. The functional SMEs will keep
    HQ AFSOC/A5KR informed regarding the status of their requirements, briefings to the other
    requirements forums, coordination of requirements documents, and changes to a requirement.
    3.6. AFSOC Requirements Board. The AFSOC Requirements Board, chaired by HQ
    AFSOC/A5K/R, provides a cross-functional division-level review of requirements initiatives.
    Voting members include: HQ AFSOC/A1, A2, A3/9, A4, A5/8, A6, A7, and FM. Advisors
    include: AFSOC/CCC, HC, HO, IG, JA, PA, SA, SE, and SG. There are also “As Required”
    advisors which include the 1 SOW, 24 SOW, 27 SOW, 58 SOW, 193 SOW, 919 SOW, 352
    SOG, 353 SOG, and the AFSOAWC. The AFSOC Requirements Board evaluates emerging
    requirements/capabilities across all AFSOC Mission Areas, ensuring each new capability and
    permanent modification supports AFSOC long-range plans. The AFSOC Requirements
    Board recommends approval of a capabilities document or disapproval to the AFSOC
    Council. The Board may also direct action officers to provide additional information for
    consideration. A more detailed description of the AFSOC Board can be found in AFSOCI
    16-501, AFSOC Corporate Structure.
    3.7. AFSOC Requirements Council. The AFSOC Requirements Council is the director-
    level forum, chaired by AFSOC/CC/CV (or possibly the DS in the absence of the CC/CV).
    Voting members include: HQ AFSOC/A1, A2, A3/9, A4, A5/8, A6, A7, and FM. Advisors
    include: AFSOC/CCC, HC, HO, IG, JA, PA, SA, SE, and SG. There are also “As Required”
    advisors which include the 1 SOW, 24 SOW, 27 SOW, 58 SOW, 193 SOW, 919 SOW, 352
    SOG, 353 SOG, and the AFSOAWC. The AFSOC Requirements Council reviews all
    AFSOC Board recommendations on requirements/capabilities, contracts, resolutions, and
    acquisition programs.        The AFSOC Requirements Council will recommend
AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     9


   approval/disapproval to the AFSOC/CC. A more detailed description of the AFSOC
   Requirements Council can be found in AFSOCI 16-501, AFSOC Corporate Structure.
4. AFSOC Capabilities-Based Planning (CBP). CBP is conducted from a capability
perspective, not a systems or mission perspective. The ability to achieve a desired effect under
specified standards and conditions through combinations of means and ways across the
DOTmLPF-P to perform a set of tasks to execute a specified course of action. AFSOC
Capabilities-Based Planning is part of the AFSOC Strategic Planning Process, which
incorporates combat needs, lessons learned, and top-down directed initiatives. This results in the
publication of the AFSOC PRCL, PGL, Strategic Vision, and Master Plan. Additional
capabilities-based analysis may be required for the development of capability documents.
AFSOC Wings, Groups, or Headquarters’ Directors may also initiate requests for new
capabilities. All new capabilities must link to capability gaps identified in the AFSOC PGL.
   4.1. Determining Materiel vs. Non-Materiel Capabilities. Command deficiencies may be
   satisfied through materiel or non-materiel means. An analysis of the DOTmLPF-P must be
   accomplished prior to initiating a request for materiel solutions. HQ AFSOC functional
   SMEs will work directly with HQ AFSOC/A5KR to ensure solutions/concepts are included
   in the analysis process.
   4.2. Documenting and Developing AFSOC Materiel Capabilities. Functional SMEs will
   work closely with HQ AFSOC/A5KR to ensure the capability is ready for initial staffing.
   This initial staffing will identify potential issues that will arise during capability
   development. The SME is now ready to present the proposed capability through the AFSOC
   corporate process for approval.
   4.3. AFSOC Requirements Process.
       4.3.1. Initial Requirement Validation. Initial requirement validation is the entry point
       to the corporate process. HQ AFSOC/A5KR will assist staff officers when the need for
       an operational capability is identified by functional sponsors or downward directed. The
       SME will present the issue briefing to the AFSOC Requirements Board and Council for
       validation and course of action. New materiel capabilities will be briefed, or in
       exceptional circumstances, processed via electronic staff summary sheet (eSSS) or Task
       Management Tool (TMT), to the AFSOC Board and Council members for validation.
       The commander or designee provides approval or further direction to proceed with the
       development of an operational capability document. Refer to Figure 4.1
 10                                                AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014


Figure 4.1. Initiation Phase/Command Validation.




      4.3.2. Document Development. The AFSOC Board/Council may direct the
      development of an ICD, CDD, CPD, PPCs, N2T, or DOTmLPF-P Change
      Recommendations (DCRs). Refer to AFI 10-601 or USSOCOM Directive 71-4, for
      document development procedures and the JCIDS Manual for document formats. The
      AFSOC SME will lead the document development and be responsible for AF,
      USSOCOM, and Joint Staff validation to include briefing the AFROC and SOCREB.
AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                 11


     4.3.3. Warfighter Urgent Capability Needs. This process does not adhere to the
     directed document development referenced above. This is a highly responsive process to
     field a short-term solution to a warfighter’s urgent capability need. Warfighter needs are
     addressed through the use of UONs, JUONs, JEONs, or CMNS. HQ AFSOC/A5KR,
     through an abbreviated AFSOC Corporate Process, will process the UONs, JUONs, or
     JEONs to develop a validation position for presentation to the AFROC. HQ
     AFSOC/A5KR will also process CMNS actions through an abbreviated corporate process
     for presentation to the USSOCOM Rapid Response Team (RRT) for USSOCOM Vice
     Commander (VCDR) decision. For more detailed information, see AFI 10-601, Chapter
     7 for Urgent Operational Needs or USSOCOM Directive 71-4, Appendix C for CMNS.
     4.3.4. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). AoAs, when required, will be briefed to the
     AFSOC Board and Council prior to entering the AFROC or SOCREB process. Refer to
     AFI 10-601, Chapter 4, for more detail regarding AoAs and the Office of Aerospace
     Studies, July 2010, “Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Handbook: A Practical Guide to
     Analyses of Alternatives.”
     4.3.5. Special Access Programs. Special access programs will be accomplished IAW
     the AFSOC corporate process. Board and Council membership will be tailored to include
     only members with the appropriate clearance and need to know.
     4.3.6. Preliminary Internal AFSOC Document Drafting. A formal IPT to draft the
     capabilities document will convene with dedicated personnel who are trained in
     accordance with paragraph 8. The formal IPT shall be composed of no less than four
     members, and should not exceed one week in duration. This formal IPT will consist of
     representatives from each directorate to include architect(s) (HQ AFSOC/A6XX) and
     SMEs to ensure complete DOTmLPF-P coverage. Respective Directorates will identify
     and provide team members who are readily available for participation in document
     development on a routine basis. The result of this IPT will be a draft document and
     briefing slides to conduct an AF Requirements Strategy Review (RSR), or to perform
     initial SOF coordination.
  4.4. Document Drafting and Staffing.
     4.4.1. Air Force. An RSR is required prior to finalizing a draft Air Force capabilities
     document per AF/A5RP policy. The RSR is requested through HQ AFSOC/A5 using the
     format provided by HQ AFSOC/A5KR. The JCIDS Manual and AFI 10-601 provide
     direction for the drafting and coordination of documents. The process repeats itself for
     each document.
     4.4.2. USSOCOM. SOF capability documents are developed individually or with
     participation from other SOF components IAW USSOCOM Directive 71-4. There are
     SOF peculiar capability documents to include a PPC and CMNS which do not exist in the
     JCIDS Manual or AFI 10-601 and can only be found in USSOCOM Directive 71-4.
  4.5. Review and Comment. HQ AFSOC/A5KR staffs draft documents to AFSOC, AF, or
  USSOCOM agencies for review and comment.                    Upon receipt of comments, HQ
  AFSOC/A5KR will disseminate comments to the appropriate SME for resolution. The SME
  will provide rationale for rejected or partially incorporated comments. The SME will attempt
  to resolve all critical comments and address others. Critical comments should be resolved at
12                                                        AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014


  the lowest possible level. The method, point of contact (POC), and date of resolution must
  be documented in the Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM) (e.g., "via telephone with Maj
  Smith on [xx] date"). Unresolved critical comments will be elevated to a higher authority for
  resolution. (Note: Failure to resolve critical comments is cause for non- concurrence on the
  final document.) HQ AFSOC/A5KR will forward the revised document and resolved
  comments to HQ AF/A5RP or USSOCOM SORR-J8-R.
  4.6. Formal Approval. Documents must be validated by the AFSOC Corporate Process
  and approved by the commander/designee prior to proceeding to the AFROC or SOCREB.
  HQ AFSOC/A5KR supports the AFSOC/CC in finalizing draft documents prior to the
  AFROC and SOCREB (e.g., preparing briefings, updating and gathering background data,
  and identifying AFSOC policy and process concerns). AFI 10-601 and the AFROC Charter
  describe AFROC procedures. USSOCOM Directive 71-4 describes SOCREB procedures.
  AFROC and USSOCOM approved documents are entered into the Joint Staff/JROC process
  IAW CJCSI 3170.01 and the JROC Administrative Guide. Refer to Figure 4.2 for a
  representation of the dual processes.

5. Changes to Previously Validated Documents with AFSOC Requirements.
   5.1. Major Changes. Changes to CDD/CPD Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) or
   changes that drive resource commitments, to include Basis of Issue Plan (BOIP), will be
   processed through the AFSOC Requirements Board and Council. Approved documents are
   vetted through the AFROC or SOCREB, as appropriate. AFROC approved documents with
   a JSD of JROC Interest or JCB Interest must be vetted through the JROC process per CJCSI
   3170.01. SOCREB approved documents with a JSD of JROC Interest must be vetted
   through the JROC process per CJCSI 3170.01.
   5.2. Minor Changes. Changes to Key System Attributes (KSAs), Other System Attributes
   (OSA), threat obsolescence, or administrative updates may be approved by HQ AFSOC/A5K
   and forwarded to HQ AF/A5RPD or USSOCOM SORR-J8-R.
6. AFSOC Staffing of Other Joint, Air Force and SOF Requirements Documents. HQ
AFSOC/A5KR is responsible for receipt, AFSOC staffing and coordination, and filing of other
Joint, Air Force, and SOF requirements documents (i.e., ICDs, CDDs, and CPDs). When HQ
AFSOC/A5KR receives documents originating from other activities, it will staff them to the
appropriate AFSOC directorates for comment/review, consolidate comments, and submit an
approved AFSOC response. HQ AFSOC/A5KR will also record requirement status and indicate
if there is AFSOC impact. AFSOC requirements may be included in other organizational
documents during this staffing process. If AFSOC requirements are to be included, the
appropriate SME will prepare a presentation to the Board and Council for command validation.
   6.1. Follow-on Coordination/Flag Review. Upon receipt of a final draft requirements
   document for coordination, HQ AFSOC/A5KR will provide previously submitted comments
   to the originator of the comment to determine if AFSOC concerns were addressed. If there is
   no AFSOC impact and all critical/substantive comments were reconciled, HQ AFSOC/A5KR
   will return concurrence to the owner of the document. If all critical comments were not
   reconciled, HQ AFSOC/A5KR will elevate the issues for resolution. If issues are not
   resolved, HQ AFSOC/A5KR will return non-concurrence to the originator.
   6.2. AFSOC Representation at Other Requirements Forums. HQ AFSOC/A5 will
   represent AFSOC at the SOCREB and the AFROC as appropriate.
   6.3. Co-sponsorship of Multi-Agency Requirements. When other commands or agencies
   (e.g., National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Laboratory, or Research
   Center) request AFSOC to co-sponsor a requirement, the designated SME will provide a
   coordinated AFSOC response approved by the AFSOC Requirements Board and Council.
   The designated lead operating command will accomplish AF and Air Staff coordination.
7. Information & Resource Support System (IRSS) and Knowledge Management and
Decision Support (KM/DS) Tools. Automated support tools are used for the coordination and
archiving of requirements and related documents. IRSS is the automated system used throughout
the AF as a repository of documents in electronic format and supports the AF capability
development and integration process.         It provides access to Air Force requirements
documentation and assists in tracking and staffing requirements documents. HQ AFSOC/A5KR
is the AFSOC IRSS manager for requirements, and provides users with system information and
access. KM/DS is the Joint Staff database for requirements processing.
8. Training.
AFSOCI10-601 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                15


  8.1. Requirements Manager Certification Training (RMCT). The following guidance
  outlines the implementation of the AF RMCT Program.
  8.2. Accountability. IAW JCIDS Manual guidance, all DOD organizations are accountable
  for ensuring the responsibility for JCIDS documents rests only with fully trained personnel,
  especially document content POCs and validation authorities.
  8.3. Training and Certification Timeline. Failure to complete the certification training
  will preclude individuals from participating in the requirements process until training is
  completed.

                      SERVICE REQUIREMENT BUSINESS RULES

A2.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AFSOC Service Requirement Business Rules is to validate
service requirements and to ensure they are incorporated into AFSOC's portfolio. It is also to
facilitate compliance with AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services, dated 21 May 2013 and the
command's Memorandum of Agreement with the Air Force Installation Contracting Agency
(AFICA) dated 20 Feb 2014.
A2.2. Service Requirement. A service requirement is defined as "a requirement that results in
time and effort of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task rather
than to furnish an end item of supply” (DODI 5000.02). It encompasses a broad range of
contracted requirements such as advisory services, studies, training, weapons system
sustainment, base operating support, and other activities executed using contracted labor.
Notwithstanding compelling, mission-driven demands for contract services or prior decisions
such as A-76 outsourcing and lifecycle systems sustainment concept, contract services must be
exercised efficiently. It is imperative that the requiring activity engage with it’s respective
contracting office early in the development stage for acquisition strategy and to ensure timely

   A2.2.1. All SR requests utilizing AFSOC’s obligation authority, to include Military
   Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs), but excluding Government Purchase Card
   (GPC) must go through AFSOC’s administrative process each year, regardless of option
   year, for review, validation/approval and database update. Contracts valued up to $500K will
   be approved at the Wing level, but are still required to complete the administrative process
   through HQ AFSOC/A5K for validation and database update. All SR requests from either
   HQ, Wings, or Groups WILL NOT be executed or funded by contracting/HQ AFSOC/FM
   without an HQ AFSOC/A5K or AFSOC/CC Validation Memo.
   A2.2.2. Emergency Contracts. Advanced approval is not required in the event of an
   emergency requirement. However, the requirement must be reported to HQ AFSOC/A5KR
   as soon as possible, preferably within 30 days of contract award (T-2). If a requirement has
   historically required additional modifications for unknown situations, the initial data input
   must identify a request for a pre-approved cap/ceiling to execute without additional
   approvals. Be as specific as possible with the details that support why the requested cap is
   necessary. Furthermore, the original requestor must provide updated information pertaining
   to the initial data inputs upon execution of the modifications to reflect the actual spending to
   date.
A2.3. Contract Categorization. Contracts will be categorized as discretionary or non-
discretionary by the AFSOC Board/Council at the first option year approval and will be assigned
a ranking. Ranking of Discretionary contracts will be: 1 - critical (Indispensable), 2 - essential
(Necessary), and 3 - desired (Nice to Have) (T-2). These categorizations will be reviewed semi-
annually or as additional cuts are necessary.
   A2.3.1. Non-Discretionary–contains contracts that were the result of an acquisition decision
   memorandum (ADM), represents a safety/security concern or must pay type of contract.

   AFSOC mission.
A2.4. Service Requirement Request and Approval Process. (see Figure A2.1)
   A2.4.1. New Requirement. The requiring office (e.g. HQ AFSOC/A3, 27 SOFSS) will
   contact HQ AFSOC/A5KR to begin the contract request process (T-2). Acquisition
   procedures and timelines will vary depending on the type and dollar value of the acquisition.
   The required delivery date must include the time required to process documents and obtain
   necessary approvals.
   A2.4.2. Existing Requirement (Renewal). HQ AFSOC/A5KR will notify the requiring
   organization POC 120 days prior to renewal to begin the corporate process. The requiring
   office will complete the required documents within 60 days of notification for the SR request
   package (T-2). The 120-day requirement is based on contracting guidance denoted in FAR
   52.217-9 wherein “the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its
   intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires.” The request will be cancelled
   if not received by the 60 day point.
