This instruction aligns with AFPD 32-20, Fire Protection, and implements AFI 32-2001, The
Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program. It establishes policies, practices, and
procedures for a comprehensive, base fire protection program at Robins Air Force Base (RAFB).
It applies to all personnel assigned or attached to units at RAFB, to include all tenant
organizations. It assigns responsibilities for fire prevention and protection and establishes a
recognized standard practice for safeguarding life and property from the effects of fire. Failure
to prevent fires could seriously hamper mission accomplishment here and at other bases
worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that all personnel, military and civilian, maintain constant
vigilance to prevent needless loss of life and property to fire. This regulation is consistent with
Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards, National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) standards, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-600-01, Fire Protection
Engineering for Facilities, Engineering Technical Letters (ETL), and the International Building
Code (IBC). Standards for unique conditions for which no fire prevention criteria have been
developed or published will be developed according to the recommendation of the RAFB Fire
Department. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-

   on the criteria in 49 CFR 173.137(c) (2). Corrosives are divided into two groups, acids and
   bases. Acids refer to the end of the pH scale, which is from 6 down to 0 and bases; have pHs
   which range from 8 to 15. Oxidizers are defined as materials other than a gas, which may,
   generally by yielding oxygen, cause or enhance the combustion of other materials. Organic
   peroxides are defined as any material, other than a gas, that contains Oxygen (O) in the
   bivalent -O-O- structure and which may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide,
   where one or more of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals.

      7.5.3.2. Division 5.2 - Organic Peroxides.
      7.5.3.3. Corrosives are all included in the DOT hazard class of 8.0.
      7.5.3.4. For the purpose of this RAFBI, oxidizers and organic peroxides shall be
      classified according to the system described in the following section:
          7.5.3.4.1. Class 1: An oxidizer whose primary hazard is that it slightly increases the
          burning rate but does not cause spontaneous ignition when it comes in contact with
          combustible materials (Generic Type G).
          7.5.3.4.2. Class 2: An oxidizer that will cause a moderate increase in the burning
          rate or that causes a spontaneous ignition of combustible materials with which it
          comes in contact (Generic Types E and F).
          7.5.3.4.3. Class 3: An oxidizer that will cause a severe increase in the burning rate of
          a combustible material with which it comes in contact or that will undergo vigorous
          self-sustained decomposition due to contamination or exposure to heat (Generic
          Types C and D).
          7.5.3.4.4. Class 4: An oxidizer that can undergo an explosive reaction due to
          contamination or exposure to thermal or physical shock. In addition, the oxidizer will
          enhance the burning rate and can cause spontaneous ignition of combustibles
          (Generic Types A and B).
