                                               Chapter 1

                                              GENERAL

1.1. Description. This instruction details all requirements for managing a safe airfield environment of
Hurlburt Fields Flightline.

1.2. Airfield Facilities.
    1.2.1. Runways. Hurlburt Field has one primary runway and a Helicopter Landing Area. Both are
    aligned north/south with the primary runway identified as 36/18. The Helicopter Landing Area is
    identified as 36H/18H.
    1.2.2. Taxiways. Identified starting from the north and continuing south as Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,
    Delta, Echo and Fox. The taxiway along the west ramp that runs parallel to 36/18 is called Golf taxi-
    way. Both Charlie and Delta taxiways have an east and west sections from each side of runway 36/18.
    Charlie east and Delta east connect runway 36/18 with the Helicopter Landing Area 36H/18H.
NOTE: Taxiway Echo is closed to all aircraft traffic.
    1.2.3. Helipads. Charlie helipad is located on Charlie West taxiway between Golf taxiway and run-
    way 36/18.
    1.2.4. Aircraft Parking Ramps. Ramps are divided into two types, the helicopter ramp located on the
    east side of the airfield and the fixed wing ramp on the west side. Other ramps are special purpose
    ramps such as the hot cargo ramp located north of the west ramp between Alpha and Bravo taxiways.
    The compass calibration ramp “compass rose” is located at the southwest end of the airfield. The Flare
    ramp is located west of Delta West taxiway.
    1.2.5. Aircraft Parking Rows. Rows are identified starting from the northwest area of the airfield
    beginning with A and B located on the Hot Cargo Ramp and C through N on the West ramp and again
    from the north on the East ramp with O through T.
       1.2.5.1. Rows A and B are used for gunship load operation and also used as the primary Hot or
       Hazardous cargo ramp.
       1.2.5.2. Row C is for C-5 and other transient aircraft parking.
       1.2.5.3. The AC-130U ramp includes rows D, E, F and G.
       1.2.5.4. Rows H and I are C-17 and other transient ramp runway.
       1.2.5.5. Row J is used for VIP aircraft and KC-135s.
       1.2.5.6. The C-130 ramp is K, L, M and N rows.
       1.2.5.7. The helicopter ramp includes O, P, Q, R, S, and T rows and is located on the east side of
       the runway.
       1.2.5.8. Numbers identifying aircraft parking start on the runway side of the ramp and are counted
       outward.

1.3. Terms and Definitions.
HURLBURTFIELDI13-202 30 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                      5


  1.3.1. Aircraft Movement Areas:
     1.3.1.1. The runway, helicopter landing area, helipads, taxiways, and other areas of the airfield
     utilized for aircraft landings, takeoffs, taxiing, and parking.
     1.3.1.2. Flightline Entry Points and Entry Control Points. Flightline Entry Points have sliding
     gates for airfield security. Entry control points also called ECPs are located inside the fence area
     and provide authorized locations to enter restricted areas.
     1.3.1.3. Flightline Authorized Vehicles. Any government vehicle or other vehicles with flightline
     passes issued by the airfield manager are authorized to operate on the airfield.
     1.3.1.4. Emergency Response Vehicles. Any vehicles that are required to respond to aircraft or
     airfield emergencies. Emergency response vehicles include but are not limited to vehicles
     assigned to airfield management, security forces, fire department, crash recovery, safety, ambu-
     lance, mobile wing operations center, and transient alert. Non-emergency vehicles must give way
     to all emergency response vehicles. Emergency response may require these vehicles to enter/exit
     the restricted area at other than designated entry points. Prior to crossing a red restricted area line,
     coordinate intentions with security forces. Vehicles responding to emergencies are required to
     operate flashing lights, rotating beacons or hazard/warning flashers to be priority of operation.
     1.3.1.5. Radio Controlled Movement Areas (CMA). Hurlburt Field Radio CMA are Runway 36/
     18, Helicopter Landing Area 36H/18H, Charlie Helipad and the ILS Glide Slope Critical Area.
     The Glide Slope Critical Area becomes a CMA only when indicated by either a red light at each
     end of Doolittle Road or by a barrier placed in the roadway. Both have signs directing vehicle
     driver’s requirements. These areas are controlled by the control tower:
        1.3.1.5.1. Vehicle access to Radio CMA. Personnel operating a vehicle within a CMA must
        obtain approval from control tower prior to entering the CMA and remain in direct two-way
        radio communications with the control tower while in the CMA. After exiting the CMA
        inform the control tower that you are out of the area. See Attachment 3 for proper radio termi-
        nology.
        1.3.1.5.2. Vehicles operating in CMA must be equipped and use a rotating beacon or hazard/
        warning flashers. NOTE: The phrase “clear” shall not be used by personnel operating on the
        flightline.
        1.3.1.5.3. The Glide Slope Critical Area extends past the Doolittle Road that connects the East
        and West ramps, and also extends past Independence Road outside of the perimeter fence.
        During reduced weather conditions, if an aircraft is on final approach, vehicles operating on
        this road may impact the aircrafts instrument readings. Because of this, the road is controlled
        by the control tower with red stop lights or by road barriers placed on the roadway directing
        vehicle drivers responsibilities. Although the near by Independence Road and the perimeter
        fence are within the ILS critical area, the systems antenna has been engineered to compensate
        for both the placement of the fence and vehicle operations on. Independence Road. If you
        don’t have a radio, don’t enter this area if red lights are on.
     1.3.1.6. Airfield/Flightline. The portion of Hurlburt Field designed for aircraft operations and
     support. This area includes the following: Aircraft support facilities, aircraft parking areas, run-
     way, helicopter landing area, taxiways, flightline road, Doolittle Road, helipads, adjacent land
     areas, and Hurlburt Lake.

       1.3.1.7. ILS Critical Area. Hold signs (Figure 1.4. Mandatory Guidance Signs) and hold mark-
       ings (Figure 1.5. VFR Hold Lines) located on Foxtrot taxiway and adjacent to the approach end of
       Runway 36 are positioned so that the ILS Critical Area is between the runway edge and the hold
       sign/markings. During inclement weather, control tower operated traffic lights control vehicle
       traffic operations through the ILS critical area on the Doolittle Road that connects the East and
       West Ramps.
       1.3.1.8. Flightline Authorized Vehicles:
           1.3.1.8.1. Government owned vehicles (GOV), vehicle owned, leased, or rented by the gov-
           ernment.
           1.3.1.8.2. Privately owned vehicles (POV) vehicle owned or rented by individual for person-
           nel use may be used for official duties on the airfield when authorized by the Deputy Chief,
           Airfield Management (DCAM) or designated representative. POVs require a flightline decal
           placed on the lower left windshield. See paragraph 3.6.for procedures to obtain a POV pass.
       1.3.1.9. Taxi Lanes. Taxi lanes are routes between rows of aircraft parking spots having both
       painted taxi lines plus the wingtip clearance markings indicated by double dashed white lines
       (Figure 1.1.). The double white lines indicate the protected space for a taxiing aircrafts wingspan
       plus 25 foot of additional space for clearance from parked aircraft or parked support equipment.
       Only motor driven vehicles may be temporarily parked between taxi lanes marking and the parked
       aircraft.

1.5. Airfield Restriction and Limitations.
    1.5.1. The CAM is the approval authority for the use of airfield facilities (excluding inside hangar
    areas) including landing areas, and airfield paved areas. This includes exercise events, cargo staging,
    or use of airfield pavements to support POV parking. Contact 16SFS/SFOSS at 884-7252 for guid-
    ance concerning restricted areas. Maintenance Control Center (MCC) manages parking rows D, E, F,
    G, K, L, M, and N on the west ramp and O through S on the East ramp.
    1.5.2. The C-130 parking ramp provides 25 feet wing tip separation, except for the following loca-
    tions:
HURLBURTFIELDI13-202 30 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                      9


       1.5.2.1. N-2 and N-3 have 23 feet, parking rows D, E, F, and G have 15 to 17 feet and 18 feet
       between the security barrier and the wing of an aircraft parked on both E-5 and F-5.
       1.5.2.2. The Hot Cargo Ramp is located north of the West ramp and west of Golf taxiway. The pri-
       mary purpose of this ramp is gunship up/down loads, a hot gun area and the primary airlift hot
       cargo parking area. Priority of use depends on mission priority as determined by the airfield man-
       ager. Aircraft taxiing into or out of ramp parking spots must be marshaled to assure clearance from
       fire bottles and AGE equipment.
   1.5.3. The following activities are prohibited on all areas of the airfield: smoking, jogging, riding pri-
   vate bicycles, or using personal audio headphones.
   1.5.4. Aircraft may not taxi to or from the runway while hot refueling operations are occurring on
   Alpha or Foxtrot taxiway. NOTE: Hot gas, hot refueling or Forward Air Refueling Point operations
   (FARP) on Alpha or Foxtrot taxiways limits use of that taxiway to that event. Aircraft and vehicles
   must use another taxiway to access the runway during these operations.
   1.5.5. During airfield stand-by times, only emergency vehicles responding to an emergency and air-
   craft tows are permitted to cross the runway. All other vehicles must utilize Doolittle Road. Once the
   airfield is on stand-by, the control tower notifies MCC who in-turn assumes responsibility for aircraft
   engine runs and tows. If you call tower and do not receive a response, verify with MCC 884-8106, the
   status of the control tower before proceeding.
   1.5.6. Passengers will not ride on any part of a vehicle that does not provide seat and back support.
   Personnel riding in the back of pickup trucks will sit on the bed floor with the tailgate closed. Do not
   use the tailgate as back support.
   1.5.7. At no time will vehicles drive or park on the shoulders of runways, taxiways or aprons.

1.6. Radio Phraseology/Terminology and Vehicle Call Signs. Proper radio communication is essential
and extremely important while operating on the flightline. See Attachment 3 for proper radio phraseol-
ogy/terminology and discipline. The following vehicle call signs will be standard: Anytime, Airfield 1 &
2, TA 1 & 2, Airfield Lighting, METNAV, Tower, Sting, Sting Tow, Painter 1 & 2, Contractor 1 & 2 and
Sweeper. All other call signs used will be assigned on a case be case basis by Airfield Management.

1.7. Light Gun Signals. Red, green, and white light gun signals from the control tower are for emer-
gency non-radio control of AIRCRAFT ONLY. See Figure 1.2. Light Gun Signals below for description
and procedures.

Figure 1.2. Light Gun Signals.




1.8. Emergency Signals to Exit Radio Controlled Movement Areas. In the event of radio failure, and
tower must recall personnel and vehicles to a safe distance from the runway or other movement area. If on
the runway, Tower will flash runway edge lights on and off. If on Helicopter Landing Area 36H/18H or
Charlie helipad, Tower will flash runway/taxiway lights on and off. Personnel/vehicles should immedi-
ately exit the runway/movement area.

1.9. Obstacles Distance Requirements from Taxiways and Aprons.
     1.9.1. Mobile equipment may be positioned on designated staging areas when in support of arriving
     or departing aircraft. Otherwise, mobile equipment will be stored in designated storage areas. Staging
     areas are white painted AGE boxes on the apron.
     1.9.2. When mobile equipment is positioned on a staging area, aircraft will be marshaled into parking
     spots adjacent to the staging areas and wing walkers will be provided.

1.10. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention.
     1.10.1. The airfield must be free of debris or objects that may damage aircraft engines, tires, etc. or
     cause injury if propelled by prop/rotor wash or jet blast. It is the responsibility of all individuals with
     access to the flightline to remove any objects that could cause damage or injuries at vehicle Flightline
     Entry Points as indicated in (Attachment 2).
     1.10.2. The following procedures will be conduct at all Flightline Entry Points:
        1.10.2.1. Stop vehicle, place it in park, turn off ignition, set parking brake or chock tires. Inspect
        all tires for rock and other debris. Inspect vehicle for any loose materials that could fall out and
        create a hazard. Signs will be posted at all Flightline Entry Points.
HURLBURTFIELDI13-202 30 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                   11


       1.10.2.2. All vehicles should have a FOD can inside and should be emptied at the end of the day.
       1.10.2.3. Vehicle drivers must be flightline certified and have a 483 certified by the DCAM or his
       designated representative.

1.11. Reduced Visibility . When visibility is reduced to the point that a vehicle operator cannot see
beyond 3 parking rows or approximately 500 feet, of a parked aircraft reduce vehicle speed to 10 MPH
and if on taxiways or movement areas, reduce speed to 15 MPH. All vehicles will use emergency flashers
while operating under reduced visibility conditions. Club car type vehicles with out windshield wipers are
prohibited from use on the flightline during periods of precipitation.

1.12. Vehicle operating with daytime running lights.
   1.12.1. Daytime running lights will not hinder daytime operations. If daytime running lights are oper-
   ating at night, don’t point them in the direction of an approaching aircraft.
   1.12.2. Vehicle operating with daytime running lights are prohibited from operating in blackout areas.

1.13. Blackout Driving Procedures.
   1.13.1. Airfield lighting may be turned off as required to support approved special operations airfield
   events. Blackout (NVG) events may be limited to runway and approach lights out operation or to a
   limited section of the airfield such as the Hot Cargo area, or the complete airfield environment. Pilots
   requesting lights out approaches that do not impact normal ramp or taxiway operations are authorized
   by the control tower. Taxiway lights are controlled by the control tower and ramp “stadium” lights are
   controlled by Airfield Management. Aircraft parking area lights-out operations must be approved by
   16 OG/CC and must be coordinated with Security Forces and MCC. Airfield Management will take
   NOTAM action closing the airfield to non-special operations aircraft when taxiways and ramp lights
   are not available.
   1.13.2. Non-participants will not drive into the blackout area. They are required to keep vehicles at a
   safe distance and reduce vehicle lights to a minimum.
   1.13.3. Partial Airfield Blackouts. These events are normally limited to Alpha taxiway or the area
   north of Bravo taxiway including Golf taxiway and the Hot Cargo area. Operations within the black-
   out area are limited to pre-coordinated events and personnel participating in the event. The person in
   charge of ground operations must request in advance lights on or off as required.
   1.13.4. Total Airfield Blackout. Impact of this event requires more effort to restrict non-participants
   to safe operations. Success of the operations demands all individuals involved in Airfield Operations
   receiving instructions as to start/finish times and radio announcements of requirements from Wing
   operations center/MCC on all ramp nets.

1.14. Perimeter Road/In-field Road Procedures. See paragraphs 1.3.1.5., 1.3.1.5.3., 1.5.5., 1.25.3. and
1.27.

1.15. Runway Crossing and Route Procedures. See paragraph 1.3.1.5.1. and Attachment 3.

                      FLIGHTLINE DRIVING PROGRAM TRAINING GUIDE

A3.1. Flightline ECPs are located at various points around the airfield (see Attachment 2). Restricted
Area ECPs are identified by painted black boxes on the pavement, outlined by a red line, with white diag-
onal lines across the box. The flightline restricted area contains several ECPs.

A3.2. Flightline Vehicle Traffic Flow. When driving on the ramp or taxiways, use the yellow centerline
as you would a highway centerline. On the west ramp use the space between Golf taxiway and the parked
aircraft as a major route between sections of the ramp. This is a safer route for fuel trucks and other larger
vehicles and eliminates the hazards of the tight turns on the ramp.

A3.3. Speed Limits.
   A3.3.1. General purpose Vehicles. Vehicles that are legal to use on public highways are limited to 15
   MPH on all areas of the ramp including in the restricted area and the adjacent roadway. The speed
   limit on taxiways is 25 MPH.
   A3.3.2. Special Purpose Vehicles. Vehicles used to tow, sweep, load/unload or other aircraft Support
   vehicles are limited to speeds as directed by Technical Orders (TO) and Maintenance and are not to
   exceed 15 MPH on ramp and 25 MPH on taxiways.

A3.4. Airfield Markings and Signs. Military, as well as civilian airfields have standard markings, which
provide pilots and vehicle operators with location and or directional information:
   A3.4.1. Airfield signs include. Runway direction signs, taxiway signs, hold signs etc.
   A3.4.2. Markings include. Helipad markings are located on Charlie West taxiways and are marked
   with a large 50’ X 50’ letter H. A simulated helicopter ship landing marking is painted on 36H/18H
   spot 3. A gear up pad is paint within the 36H/18H at the intersection of Delta East Taxiway. Runway
   and helipad hold lines consist of two parallel rows of dashed yellow and two rows of solid yellow
   lines. In order to enhance the appearance of these lines, they are outlined in black. These marking indi-
   cate CMA and personnel operating a vehicles must obtain approval from control tower prior to enter-
   ing the Radio CMA and remain in direct two-way radio communications with the control tower while
   in the Radio CMA. After exiting the Radio CMA inform the control tower that you are out of the area.
   A3.4.3. Aircraft parking rows are lettered alphabetically from the north to the south. Each parking
   row and parking spot are identified by white painted letters located on “G” taxiway at the turn point
   for each row and a letter and number at the turn point for each parking spot. They are identified as C
   through N (on the West ramp) and O through T (on the East ramp). Aircraft parking spots are num-
   bered from the runway side of the parking ramp and are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.
   A3.4.4. Aircraft de-arm spots. Aircraft de-arm spots are identified as Hot Gun (HG) on Alpha taxi-
   way, Hot Cargo ramp and Golf taxiway. Primary de-arm spots located on Alpha taxiway at HG-1 and
   HG-2. The next spot is HG-3 or load spot (LS) 3 on the hot cargo ramp. The spot HG-4 is on Golf taxi-
   way and is identified with a white arrow painted 300 feet south of Bravo taxiway.
   A3.4.5. Restricted Area. A painted red line and/or the area within the confines of the jersey barriers
   identify the restricted areas. These areas are used as aircraft parking and maintenance areas. Enter
22                                                   HURLBURTFIELDI13-202 30 NOVEMBER 2003


     these areas through authorized ECP’s. Some ECP’s are open and do not require prior approval from
     the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC). Others are closed and require approval from the SFCC.
     Crossing a red line or entering a closed ECP without prior coordination with SFCC will result in a
     security violation and all violators will be immediately apprehended.
     A3.4.6. Taxi Lane Lines. Dashed white lines are used in the aircraft parking area, on Alpha and Fox-
     trot taxiways and the East ramp to identify wing tips clearance plus 25 feet, to taxiing aircraft.
        A3.4.6.1. To assure clearance for taxiing aircraft, support equipment must be placed between the
        dashed lines at the front/ rear of parked aircraft.

A3.5. Operating in the vicinity of aircraft.
     A3.5.1. Circle of Safety. Do not operate a vehicle within 10 feet of a parked aircraft unless the vehicle
     is involved in a maintenance or loading procedure, and parking within 10 feet is necessary to complete
     the activity.
        A3.5.1.1. Vehicles will not be parked closer than 25 feet from a parked aircraft.
        A3.5.1.2. Do not operate a vehicle within 200 feet in front of or behind a moving aircraft.
        A3.5.1.3. Do not operate a vehicle within 500 feet behind a C-130 or larger aircraft during full
        engine runs.

A3.6. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Control and Prevention. Aircraft movement areas must be free of
debris or objects that may damage aircraft engines, tires, etc. or which may cause injury if propelled by
prop/rotor wash or jet blast. It is the responsibility of all individuals with access to the flightline to remove
or report any objects that could cause damage or injuries.

A3.7. Unique Operations and Situations:
     A3.7.1. Blackouts and night vision goggle (NVG) events may cause airfield lighting to be turned off
     as required. Blackout/NVG events may be limited to runway and approach lights-out operation, lim-
     ited sections of the airfield such as the Hot Cargo ramp and north edge of the hot cargo ramp, or the
     complete airfield environment. Pilots requesting lights out approaches that do not impact normal ramp
     or taxiway operation are authorized by the control tower. Taxiway lights are controlled by the control
     tower and ramp “stadium” lights are controlled by Airfield Management. Complete airfield lights out
     operations must be approved by 16 OG/CC. Airfield Management will take NOTAM action closing
     the airfield to non-special operations aircraft when taxiways and ramp lights is not available.
        A3.7.1.1. Approximately 5 to 10 minutes prior to blackout/NVG events, MCC must transmit a
        warning identifying the area to be blacked out and other requirements such as:
            A3.7.1.1.1. Non-participants will not drive into the blackout area.
            A3.7.1.1.2. Non-participants must park vehicles at a safe distance and keep vehicle lights to a
            minimum as required for safety.
     A3.7.2. Partial Airfield Blackouts. These events are normally limited to Alpha taxiway or the area
     north of Bravo taxiway including Golf taxiway and the Hot Cargo ramp. Operations within the Black-
     out area are limited to pre-coordinated events and personnel participating. The person in charge of
     ground operations must request lights on or off as required.
HURLBURTFIELDI13-202 30 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                      23


      A3.7.3. Total Airfield Blackout. Impact of this event requires more effort to restrict non participants
      to safe operations that do no involve driving on the airfield. Success of the operations demands all
      individuals involved in airfield operations receive instructions as to start/finish times and radio
      announcements of requirements from WOC/MCC on all ramp nets.

A3.8. Runway Intrusion Prevention. Runway Intrusion is the act of entering a CMA without clearance
from the ATC Tower. Vehicle access to or for the CMA is limited. The flightline roadway around the
south end of the airfield is the required route of travel. All vehicles that are transiting from the East ramp
to the West ramp, or West ramp to East ramp should use this road. Vehicles participating in towing an air-
craft must have radio contact with the tower and will use Delta taxiway to cross the runway.

A3.9. Radio terminology/phraseology and discipline:
NOTE: The phase “clear” shall not be used by personnel operating on the flightline.
      A3.9.1. Examples of Standard Radio Terminology/Phraseology.


Radio phrase                    Meaning


Acknowledge                     The message has been received and understood.


Affirmative                     Yes.


Confirm                         Tell me if this is correct. For example, "Confirm clear to land on 28R”.


Correction                      An error was made in the previous information. Here is the correct

                                information



Go ahead                        Proceed with the transmission.


How do you hear me?             How did you receive the transmission (quality of radio signal)?


I say again                     I repeat (usually added for emphasis).


Negative                        That is incorrect; no.


Out                             The message is completed, and no response is expected. The word out

                              is seldom used since modern radios are so reliable that there is usually
                              no question that the transmission was ended intentionally.


Over                          The transmission is ended, and a response is expected. The word over
                              is usually omitted unless a reply ordinarily would not be made.


Read back                     Repeat all of the transmission that has just been received.


Roger or copy                 All of your last transmission has been received and understood.


Say again                     Would you repeat (to clarify a garbled/broken message).


Stand by                      Please wait for further information to be transmitted momentarily.


Verify                        Double-check the accuracy of the transmission; usually followed by a
                              repetition of the message in question.


Wilco                         I understand and will comply.


Words twice                   Please repeat each phrase or key word twice (usually required because
                              of radio interference).


     A3.9.2. Example of a communication between ATC tower and Airfield 1:


Airfield 1: Tower, Airfield 1 request clearance across Charlie Helipad.


Tower: Airfield 1, proceed across Charlie Helipad, Report when off.


Airfield 1: Tower, Airfield 1 proceeding.
