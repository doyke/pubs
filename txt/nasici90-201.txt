SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction reflects changes to the Agency and Center organization structures and removes
the requirement for additional program assessments during self-inspections.             Further
administrative changes were incorporated.
1. Purpose. Annual self-inspections (SIs) will be conducted to insure compliance with Air
Force inspection guidelines and address any deficiencies in the operating practices of NASIC.
Additionally, these procedures will be used to prepare for external IG inspections.
2. Appointment of SI Monitors (SIMs) and Assistant SIMs (ASIMs):
     2.1. Each Group and Directorate (not including CC/CV/CA/DS/CCS), CCQ/CSS, FD, FM,
     HO, JA, PA, RI, SE and SO will appoint a SIM and ASIM and provide an appointment letter
     to NASIC/IG. Updates to this list will be made on an ongoing basis to maintain currency
     (not just to prepare for NASIC SI or external IG inspection).
     2.2. A consolidated list will be maintained by the NASIC/IG.
3. SIMs/ASIMs will:
     3.1. Identify, to NASIC/IG, the inspection POCs within their organization (as/if applicable)
     for Compliance & Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRLs), Special/Command
     Interest Items (SII/CIIs) and additional functional responsibilities designated by NASIC/IG.
     Internal to their organization, SIM/ASIMs will maintain lists of additional intermediate
     organization POCs (if needed/designated) and inspectors for the "Individual Office
     Requirements" section (in preparation for NASIC SIs). See paragraph 5.2. below for
     additional explanation of these requirement areas.
     3.2. Receive, review and ensure distribution to organization POCs of reference materials
     identified by NASIC/IG. Use reference materials to define and organize the SI process.
     3.3. Train organization personnel involved with the IG inspection program and/or request
     supplemental training from NASIC/IG.
     3.4. Coordinate with C&SRL and other designated (by NASIC/IG) functional POCs (as
     applicable within assigned organization) to ensure all inspection POCs and functional criteria
     listed by NASIC/IG are accurate and complete.
     3.5. Maintain a self-inspection continuity book, subsection of higher-level office continuity
     book or continuity file (hardcopy or electronic), to contain all applicable IG inspection
     reference materials, prior inspection findings (SIs and HQ AF ISR Agency inspections) and
     notes/references of other significant IG inspection issues/lessons learned for the organization.
     At a minimum, the continuity book/file must:
        3.5.1. Be neat, orderly and current;
        3.5.2. Contain their organization's SIM/ASIM appointment memo;
        3.5.3. Contain the C&SRLs which apply to their organization or for which their
        organization is a/the NASIC OPR;
NASICI90-201 5 MAY 2011                                                                          3


      3.5.4. Contain the AFIs, AFISRAIs, NASICIs or other guidance documents or directives
      upon which the aforementioned C&SRLs are based (those C&SRLs' primary reference
      documents);
      3.5.5. Contain copies of the most recent UCI, Limited No-Notice UCI, SAV and NASIC
      and organization Self-Inspection reports which involved their organization;
      3.5.6. Contain all organizational responses to open NASIC or HHQ findings or
      deficiencies.
   3.6. Coordinate with organization management to define an organization-level inspection
   program, if required, to supplement the NASIC IG Inspection Program. This may include
   selective application of parts of the NASIC SI/IG Preparation Program and supplemental
   procedures defined within the organization.
   3.7. Oversee organization SIs IAW instructions from NASIC/IG and Command Section.
   Consolidate inputs from organization POCs and submit SI reports to NASIC/IG.
      3.7.1. Provide consolidated organization updates to NASIC/IG on all SI findings of
      “DOES NOT COMPLY” or “COMPLIES WITH COMMENTS.” These updates will be
      progress reports on corrective actions and estimated get well dates and will be provided
      periodically until all deficiencies are corrected.
4. NASIC Inspector General (IG) will:
   4.1. Maintain a list of SIM/ASIM appointees and functional POCs. Provide training to
   NASIC organizations as required/requested.
   4.2. Provide relevant IG inspection criteria to SIM/ASIMs based on HQ AF ISR Agency/IG
   criteria and inspection data. Develop and provide to SIM/ASIMs a detailed guide for the
   NASIC SI/IG Preparation Program to ensure complete and consistent response from NASIC
   organizations.
   4.3. Lead efforts to conduct annual NASIC SIs and any additional SIs in preparation for an
   external IG inspection. Review SI reports from NASIC organizations, write a summary
   NASIC SI report and ensure required corrective actions are taken and documented for
   identified discrepancies.
   4.4. Oversee the NASIC preparations for HQ AF ISR Agency IG inspections (to include any
   defined requirement for a "joint inspection" with other government organization) NASIC and
   higher-level IG inspection criteria/instructions. Track the status of any NASIC inspection
   findings and comments. Request corrective actions and recommendations for extension or
   closure of findings from applicable NASIC organizations and forward response letter to HQ
   AF ISR Agency/IG for NASIC/CC signature via fully coordinated Staff Summary Sheet.
   Update monthly until HQ AF ISR Agency closes all findings.
   4.5. Maintain an IG continuity book (hardcopy or electronic), subsection of higher-level
   office continuity book or continuity file, to contain all applicable IG inspection reference
   materials, prior inspection findings (SIs and HQ AF ISR Agency inspections) and
   notes/references of other significant IG inspection issues/lessons learned for the organization.
5. Self-Inspection Requirements.
 4                                                                 NASICI90-201 5 MAY 2011


     5.1. SIs will be conducted annually (at least once within each calendar year). The NASIC
     goal for completion will normally be mid-March. This date may be adjusted depending on
     circumstances (including schedule for external IG inspection).
        5.1.1. Safety Program self-inspections will be accomplished in accordance with NASICI
        91-1, Mishap Prevention Program.
        5.1.2. Security Program self-inspections will be accomplished in concert with the
        NASIC SI and will be managed by NASIC/SO.
     5.2. SIs will cover three separate areas (see process guide from NASIC/IG for detailed
     procedures):
        5.2.1. The C&SRL section is based on AF and AF ISR Agency C&SRLs (normally
        listed in 90-series publications) identified for use by AF ISR Agency/IG and additional
        AF C&SRLs specified by NASIC/IG (based on applicability to NASIC requirements).
        5.2.2. The SII/CII section is based on SIIs and CIIs identified for use by AF ISR
        Agency/IG and additional Air Force specified by NASIC/IG (normally those written to
        cover installation requirements and NASIC ensures it is not missing any necessary
        emphasis by being a tenant unit).
        5.2.3. The Individual Office Requirements section is a collection of additional
        administrative requirements defined at the NASIC level to help ensure efficient and
        effective operations.
     5.3. SI teams will:
        5.3.1. Begin the SI process as directed by NASIC/IG and Command Section. Based on
        NASIC/IG provided criteria and other guidance, organizations/SI teams will plan long-
        lead activities (e.g. training and organizing preparation efforts) as required to meet
        specified dates to end inspection activities and provide final report to NASIC/IG.
        5.3.2. Use NASIC/IG provided materials/guidance to conduct SIs of C&SRLs, SII/CIIs
        and Individual Office Requirements.
        5.3.3. Record discrepancies (defined by supplemental guidance from NASIC/IG) on
        NASIC Form 24 (See Attachment 2). Annotate individual discrepancies on separate
        NASIC Form 24s. SIMs will maintain NASIC Form 24s.
        5.3.4. SI organization team members will forward all inspection results to their
        SIM/ASIM. SIM/ASIMs will write a narrative report IAW detailed guidance from
        NASIC/IG.
6. NASIC SI Report. Following each SI, a hard copy NASIC inspection report will be
published summarizing the results and status.
     6.1. The report will be published within 30 days of the inspection completion.
     6.2. All write-ups and reports will be put on NASICWEB.
     6.3. The first SI following an HQ AF ISR Agency inspection will address all findings and
     proposed fixes with statements that findings are "closed" or give projected dates for
     correction.
