                                        Guidance Changes

The below changes to AFI 36-3802, dated 23 February 2009, are effective immediately.
This AFGM includes guidance with respect to procedures for processing classified orders,
guidance on names in system for deploying personnel, and identifies tier waiver authority
levels for compliance items within this AFGM for each wing, FOA, or DRU level task as
specified by Table 1.1 of AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. Remaining Tier
information will be submitted during normal AFI review.


(Revised) 2.7.5. Ensures the IPRs follow all component command reporting guidance/processing
instructions, to include Combatant Commander OPLAN TPFDD classification guidance.


(Revised) 2.8.12.2. Uses the AF Reporting Instruction Tool (AFRIT), available on the AEF
Online web site, to develop reporting instructions. At a minimum, reporting instructions will
contain unique Combatant Command classification guidance and comply with the Foreign
Clearance Guide. (T-1)

(Revised) 2.16.4. Identifies personnel to fill requirements and provides name(s) to IDO, IDRC,
and/or IPR NLT timeline established in AFI 10-401. (T-1)

(Revised) 4.3.4.1.3. Unit commanders identify and notify members selected to fill requirements and
provide the names of tasked personnel to the IDO, IDRC, and/or IPR within the timelines established
in AFI 10-401. DCAPES will be updated as soon as possible but NLT 1 duty day after receipt of the
names of tasked personnel.

(Revised) 4.3.4.3. Assigns person(s) to requirements within DCAPES as soon as possible but NLT 1
duty day after receipt of names of tasked personnel.

(Revised) 4.3.4.7. Prepares CED orders IAW AF Component Command reporting instructions,
Comptroller Alert Messages (if any), and Chapter 7 of this instruction when individual meets
final deployment qualifications. Prepares NATO order IAW current Foreign Clearance Guide
(FCG) (if applicable).

(Revised) 4.4.5. Uses DCAPES to produce CED orders IAW AF Component Command
reporting instructions, Comptroller Alert Messages (if any), and Chapter 7 of this instruction.

(Revised) 7.2.15. The IPR or PDF uses the DCAPES orders program to prepare CED orders, or
DD Form 1610 when DCAPES is not operational. Include the following data elements: ULN
(including FRAG and insert codes), ULN position, deployed AFSC, deployed unit PAS code,
and line remarks (if necessary). NOTE: These data elements will not be data masked. PERSCO
requires this information to perform proper accountability. The orders issuing official will
review the Combatant Commander classification guidance to determine which OPLAN TPFDD
data elements, when aggregated, would make the CED order classified. All classified data
elements directed by the combatant commander classification guidance except the ULN, will be
data masked on the unclassified extract.

(Add New) 7.2.15.1. IPRs, in conjunction with the IDO, will review Combatant Commander
classification guidance and AF Component Command reporting instructions to determine which
OPLAN TPFDD data elements, when aggregated, would make the CED order classified. The
IPR will create a classified CED order, with an unclassified extract copy, if TPFDD data
elements, when aggregated, are classified. Classified TPFDD data elements, with the exception
of the ULN, will be data-masked on the extract copy. The ULN is used for accountability
purposes and will never be data-masked on a CED order.

(Add New) 7.2.15.2. If classified orders are required, prepare two sets of orders. Classified
CED orders will be given only to agencies requiring this information such as Comptroller,
Transportation, etc. Local procedures will be used to determine the full distribution list of
classified CED orders. All other agencies and the traveling Airmen will be given the
unclassified extract CED orders.

(Add New) 7.2.15.2.1. To generate the unclassified extract, use asterisks (*) in place of
classified elements. EXCEPTION: The ULN will not be data-masked.

(Add New) 7.2.15.2.2. Fill in all elements on a classified order, and mark/handle according to
DoDI 5200.01, DoD Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive Compartmented
Information and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.

(Revised) 7.4.3. PURPOSE. DCAPES automatically publishes “Special Mission Travel (MSN)”
and the statement “Participate in” on the orders. Do not include the name of the operation or
exercise (e.g., “Operation SEA SIGNAL”) unless the Combatant Commander classification
guidance states otherwise. Orders for other than Secretary of Defense (SecDef) designated
contingencies should not contain any reference to “contingencies” in this block of the orders. Do
not enter the PID unless the Combatant Commander classification guidance states otherwise. If
the TDY is in connection with field duties, put in “field duty.” In the REMARKS area include:
“The inclusive dates of field duty are from (date) to (date).” NOTE: See Combatant Commander
classification guidance for specific classification guidance on OPLAN TPFDD data elements
such as operation name and PID, ULN, RDD, destination, etc.

(Revised) 7.4.8. ITINERARY (TO). Always show specific location where TDY will be
performed unless the Combatant Commander OPLAN TPFDD guidance states otherwise or will
make the CED order Classified. If location will classify the CED order, use "****" to data mask
TDY location. See paragraph 7.2.15. for more information on classified CED orders.

(Revised) 7.4.6.1. Amendments to CED orders will be accomplished as outlined in AFI 65-103
and DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation.

                                    Chapter 1
                         PERSONNEL READINESS OPERATIONS

Section 1A-Purpose, Background, Introduction and Scope
1.1. Purpose. PERSCO is everything the personnel community does to support the warfighter.
It is the collection of manual and automated procedures, systems, hardware, personnel agencies,
and deployable individuals or teams to accomplish Total Force accountability and reporting,
casualty reporting, and personnel program advice.
1.2. Background. The primary mission of the personnel community is force accountability, and
the top priority is supporting the combatant commander’s operations. The Air and Space
Expeditionary Force (AEF) is how the Air Force organizes, trains, equips, deploys, and sustains
itself. This concept embraces the unique characteristics of Air and Space power, range, speed,
flexibility, and precision to meet national security challenges. Personnel agencies provide
critical links and support in virtually every aspect of AEF operations.
1.3. Introduction. This instruction provides personnel program policy and guidance for Air
Force personnel agencies and commanders supporting contingency, wartime, emergency
operations, and exercises. This instruction also provides policy and guidance for PERSCO.
1.4. Scope. The roles and responsibilities of personnel agencies at all levels involved in
readiness operations are explained in this instruction. As an essential element within
expeditionary combat support (ECS), the personnel community contributes to the AEF by
providing mission-ready personnel forces as well as providing Total Force accountability,
casualty reporting and advice on personnel policies and procedures to all levels of command
involved in readiness operations.         Understanding and accomplishing these roles and
responsibilities are crucial for ensuring the primary goal of accurate real-time Total Force
accountability is met. Total Force accountability and force management require a coordinated
effort by personnel readiness functions at all levels of command.

Section 1B-Accountability Concepts
1.5. Total Force Accountability. Total Force accountability is defined as the accurate
accounting for all Air Force personnel at all times regardless of location.1.5.1. “Total Force” is
comprised of Air Force active duty, Air Reserve Component (ARC), Department of the Air
Force (DAF) civilians, contractors supporting the Air Force mission, and other civilian personnel
not employed by the Department of Defense (DoD) who support the AF mission (e.g., Red
Cross, United Service Organization [USO], consultants) as well as the in-place force supporting
contingency operations. Total Force accountability can be expanded        by     the   combatant
commander or the component command to include other DoD civilians, other DoD-essential
contractor personnel, other Services, allied forces, coalition forces and/or other personnel.
Commanders, at all levels, are ultimately responsible for maintaining accountability of their
forces. PERSCO is a tool to assist commanders in obtaining and maintaining accountability.
Commanders must establish procedures to account for their forces when there is no PERSCO at
the deployed location.
1.5.2. Total Force accountability enables planners and managers to support the commander’s
concept of operations by providing strength and casualty information essential for the
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           7

commander to make informed decisions concerning force allocation and capabilities. At the
unified command level and above, this information also assists senior leaders in making
informed decisions.
1.5.3. Accounting for deployed and residual forces provides senior military and civilian
leadership visibility of the human resources committed to contingency operations.
1.5.4. The historical capture of force accountability data is provided by AFPC/DPW on a regular
basis to the chain of command (who was deployed where and for how long). This allows the
tracking and analysis of personnel and their association to specific military operations for future
programs and initiatives (e.g., Gulf War Syndrome, follow-up treatment for the Khobar Towers
bombing, medical counseling, state bonuses and entitlements).
1.5.5. There are several elements of Total Force accountability that must be tracked:
1.5.5.1. Total Force accountability. PERSCO maintains accountability of the deployed
location’s Employment Requirements Manning Document (ERMD) requirements and all
personnel assigned against these positions.
1.5.5.2. Strength accountability. PERSCO will maintain accountability over all personnel on the
ground, including transients, at their deployed and designated geographically separated locations,
regardless of status, in accordance with (IAW) component command policies.
1.5.5.3. Unit accountability. The deployed unit commander is responsible for maintaining
accountability for the unit personnel assigned. This accountability includes knowing where
assigned personnel are at any given time, where they live and where they work.
1.5.5.4. Replacement accountability. If it becomes necessary to replace a deployed individual
prior to completing the specified tour length, the deployed commander initiates the replacement
action. Refer to paragraph 5.10.1.2 of this instruction and component command reporting
instructions for replacement actions. Once the replacement requirement has been sourced,
PERSCO is responsible for tracking the status of all incoming and/or departing personnel as well
as their arrival and departure plans. Arrival and departure information should be available
through the Area of Responsibility (AOR) transportation function. If this information is not
provided; contact the component command for guidance.
1.5.5.5. Transient accountability. Transient forces are those that spend at least one night at a
location but their final duty location is elsewhere. PERSCO, in coordination with deployed
services (lodging) and transportation, tracks arrival and departure of transient personnel as
outlined by the on-site commander and/or component command guidance.
1.5.5.6. Tasked Wing Accountability. Unit commanders and Installation Personnel Readiness
Elements (IPRs) (formerly know as the Personnel Readiness Function (IPR)) are responsible for
maintaining accountability over their deployed personnel until they have returned to home
station.
1.5.5.7. The Employment Requirements Manning Document (ERMD) lists all the requirements
for a particular deployment location. The PERSCO team is responsible for monitoring to ensure
all requirements are filled or confirming with the deployed commander that the requirement isn't
needed.
1.5.6. Total Force accountability is accomplished with Global Command and Control System -
Air Force (GCCS-AF) systems utilizing Deliberate Crisis Action Planning and Execution
8                                                    AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

Segments (DCAPES) and/or MANPER-B software. This software uses a series of business rules
to alert users to changes in deployment requirements and the status of deployed persons. This
software is also programmed to generate Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) transactions
to inform home-station commanders of the whereabouts and status of their deployed personnel.
Section 1C-Deployed PERSCO Concepts
1.6. PERSCO Mission and Objective. Total Force accountability is PERSCO’s primary
mission. PERSCO is what the personnel community provides to commanders at all levels to
accomplish the Total Force accountability mission and objectives. PERSCO Teams (PTs)
deploy to provide force accountability and reporting, casualty reporting, and advice on personnel
programs. See Chapter 5 of this instruction for further PERSCO guidance.
Section 1D-Deployment Planning and Execution Concepts
1.7. Deployment Planning. General planning guidance for personnel functional managers can
be found in the War Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 1, AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations
Planning and Execution and AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. Personnel
planners should review these documents before planning any contingency operation or exercise.
During war or a contingency operation, there is little time to set up new support plans to correct
deficiencies in pre-planned manpower and personnel requirements; therefore, personnel policies
or procedures during readiness operations that vary from peacetime applications must be in the
hands of the users prior to execution of the operation plan (OPLAN) or concept plan
(CONPLAN).
1.7.1. Personnel war planners at all echelons must understand that contingency and war-fighting
planning actions are prioritized and time-phased in order to support the immediate execution of
war plans.
1.7.2. The personnel war planner has responsibilities in contingency and execution planning.
These responsibilities may differ depending on the environment (deployment or employment)
and the planning, contingency, or exercise scenario. However, the primary goal is always timely
and accurate force accountability. This is accomplished by working closely with operations
planners, installation deployment officers (IDOs), logistics planners, manpower, MAJCOM
functional area managers (FAMs), unit deployment managers (UDMs), and understanding the
deliberate execution planning, deployment execution, employment, sustainment and force
management processes.

1.7.3. Wartime, contingency, exercise, and emergency operations validate the quality of
personnel wartime planning actions. It is critical that personnel wartime planning actions and
PT readiness be evaluated and tested before crisis action operation.
1.8. Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) Force Module Concept. The AETF
force modules (Figure 1.1.) are a method of packaging command and control, operational
mission, and ECS forces for presentation to a combatant commander through the commander,
Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) and Air Force Component Headquarters (AFCHQs). The
modules were developed to provide a standardized template optimizing initial planning through
rapid requirements generation. The elements of AETF force modules are linked together or are
uniquely identified so that they may be extracted from or adjusted as an entity to enhance
flexibility and usefulness of the operation plan during a crisis or a humanitarian relief operation
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        9

(HUMRO) effort. It articulates AEF capabilities in sets of basic, building-block capabilities to
support all Task Force Concept of Operations (CONOPS) or AEFs. It provides rapid global
projection and sustainment of combat capabilities through expression of military power;
optimizes base opening, initiating operations from a bare base to an Air Expeditionary Wing
(AEW), and provides a seamless transition of operational phases.
1.8.1. PERSCO is an integral part of most force modules (FM). A PERSCO presence in the
Open the Airbase FM comes from a PERSCO qualified 3S0X1 on the Contingency Response
Group (CRG) 7E1AE unit type code (UTC). This individual will perform the initial
accountability duties required. An RFL01 UTC with the GCCS-AF equipment will arrive in the
Command & Control FM to take over the accountability, strength reporting and casualty
reporting mission. The Establish the Airbase FM contains RFL03 and RFL03 UTCs. This
package augments the RFL01 to provide additional personnel leadership and advisory support.
Two RFPF3 UTCs and one each RFL04 and RFL05 UTC arrive in the Operate the Airbase FM
to provide additional personnel leadership accountability capability. One or more additional
RFPF3 UTCs are deployed in the Robust the Airbase FM to complete the PERSCO capability
for the AETF FM. The number of RFPF3 teams utilized in this FM is dependent on the size of
the force. The Air Force Forces (AFFOR) A1 staff will use additional PERSCO UTCs as the
mission dictates in the sustainment phase of operations.
1.8.2. PERSCO support for the FMs will be provided by the lead wings, followed by other iron
providing units within the same FM, and then non-aircraft providing units.
1.8.3. The figure below illustrates how PERSCO teams fit in the FM construct.

1.9. Deployment Execution. Personnel planners are responsible for ensuring (1) sufficient PTs
and equipment are scheduled with the earliest arriving FMs, advanced echelon (ADVON)
packages, or as early as possible in force flows into all forward operating locations (FOLs) or
augmented main operating bases (MOBs), (2) all PERSCO requirements are filled with the best
fully qualified personnel, (3) reclamas are aggressively worked, (4) deployed forces are tracked
throughout the deployment process, (5) policy issues concerning the deployed force are
aggressively worked, (6) all DCAPES update transactions are timely and accurate, and (7) PTs
are immediately capable of expedient and flawless strength accountability and reporting.

2.3.14. Serves as the Air Force focal point for questions concerning deployed personnel
accounting and reporting.
2.4. Air and Space Expeditionary Force Operations (AFPC/DPW). AFPC/DPW executes
the AEF battle rhythm. They are the reachback enabler that plans and delivers versatile Air and
Space power to the right place at the right time to support COMAFFOR’s mission needs. At the
core of AEF planning, AFPC/DPW incorporates AEF-related processes in every step of
operational planning, preparation, and execution, from crisis to sustainment to redeployment
actions, with emphasis on identifying functional trigger points that stress or break the AEF
concept of operations and force sourcing outside the on-call resources. AFPC/DPW coordinates
with component planners for deployment/redeployment time-phased force deployment data
(TPFDD) construction.
2.4.1. AFPC/DPW initiates the sourcing of AEF-aligned ECS forces to support combatant
commander requirements. Identifies scheduling disconnects and discrepancies and initiates the
process for resolution. AFPC/DPW develops and publishes the ECS Target Base Alignment
Template, used to schedule the deployment of all deployable units and personnel per AEF cycle.
2.4.2. AFPC/DPW coordinates, integrates, and publishes the timelines, plans, and tasks required
for each AEF cycle and each AEF rotation to include monitoring the scheduling of deployment
transportation. AFPC/DPW provides continuity throughout critical AEF prepare-to-deploy,
deployment, redeployment, and transition phases of the AEF cycle. AFPC/DPW pushes relevant
and timely deployment preparation information to the field and provides a comprehensive
database of AEF-focused material through the AEF Online web page.
2.4.3. AFPC/DPW manages the DCAPES data process for AEF-sourced requirements as
identified in contingency and rotational TPFDDs. AEF Library-aligned resources are used to
source TPFDD requirements, including ECS UTCs scheduled by the ECS SIPT, maintenance,
munitions, and aviation UTCs scheduled by the AMC/A3X and CAF SIPTs.

                                Chapter 3
                 PERSONNEL CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS)

Section 3A-Overview and Planning

3.1. Overview. A personnel CONOPS lays out the force accountability responsibilities,
command relationships, strength reporting procedures, reporting instructions and known Forward
Operating Location (FOL) PERSCO resources in a theater of operations. As such, the personnel
CONOPS is a living document critical to Total Force accountability operations and may require
revisions as a contingency or war evolves. The component command personnel war planners are
the primary OPR for the personnel CONOPS.

3.2. Planning. Personnel war planners at all echelons must understand the personnel CONOPS
functionality and the importance of accurate contingency and execution planning for CONOPS
development. General planning guidance for personnel war planners can be found in the War
Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 1, and AFI 10-401. These documents should be reviewed
before planning for any contingency operation or exercise.

Section 3B-Roles and Responsibilities

3.3. Roles and Responsibilities:
3.3.1. Component Command A1.
3.3.1.1. When directed by the combatant commander, maintains accountability of all DoD
personnel in their theater of operations.
3.3.1.2. During execution planning, develops and coordinates a personnel CONOPS to lay out
force accountability responsibilities, command relationships, strength reporting procedures,
reporting instructions and known FOL PERSCO bed down resources.
3.3.1.3. Ensures personnel war planners participate in FOL site surveys to determine PERSCO
bed down resources available. If personnel representation can’t accompany the site survey team,
the component command personnel war planner will ensure all bed down requirements for
personnel support are addressed and documented in the site survey report.

Section 3C-CONOPS Format and Content

3.4. CONOPS Format and Content. As a minimum, the personnel CONOPS will contain
clear and specific guidance in the following areas. Note: The following paragraphs are written
as a guide so the component command personnel war planners may cut and paste these sections
into their CONOPS. Appropriate adjustments are needed to address AOR-specific details.
3.4.1. General. This paragraph should state that the CONOPS lays out responsibilities,
command relationships, reporting procedures and standard operating procedures for personnelists
pertaining to all AOR operations and Plan Identification Numbers (PIDs). As such, it should
state that the CONOPS is a living document and may require revisions as operations evolve.

3.4.4.1. PERSCO Concept of Operations. This paragraph should also specify the PERSCO
supply package(s) needed and the communications support necessary to be used by the PTs at
each FOL and the relationships that the FOLs have with each other. It should also specify
known reception points and procedures. It should detail each PT’s FOL chain of command. (As a
general rule, deployed PTs will report directly to and work for the combat support element (CSE)
commander or the site commander, when there is no CSE commander). If a PT is tasked to
provide support for the AFFOR/A1, the tasking must be specifically stated in the CONOPS. A
PT used to      augment an on-site FSS’s IPR must also be specifically identified. Examples of
PERSCO Concept of Operations paragraphs are:
3.4.4.1.1. FOL, XXXX, is projected to have total deployed personnel strength of XXX and will
be supported by PERSCO RFPF# team(s). The PT(s) will deploy with a supply package and
GCCS-AF equipment for on-site support. Communications capabilities are limited, initial
SIPRNET capabilities reside at the deployed command post, communications squadron, and
TALCE. Additional communication capabilities are projected in-place by X-day; in the interim,
contact the above agencies for SIPRNET use. The FOL XXXX PT will support GSU YYY.
Duty status change reports will be sent no later than (NLT) XXXX hrs daily. Note: List other
notable FOL planning factors.
3.4.4.1.2. FOL, YYYY, is projected to have total deployed personnel strength of YYY; it won’t
have an on-site PT presence; PT support will be provided by FOL XXXX but will be supported
by FOL XXXX. The site YYYY will be supported by the PT from FOL XXXX. FOL YYYY
deployed commander, through the deployed CSS, will relay strength and duty status changes to
FOL XXXX NLT XXXX hrs daily. Additionally, any personnel actions will also be relayed to
FOL XXXX PT by the CSS.
3.4.5. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO). Should be supplemented by AFFOR/A1
(Forward and Main) as appropriate

                                            Chapter 4

INSTALLATION PERSONNEL READINESS (IPR) AND PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT
           FUNCTION (PDF) OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

Section 4A - Introduction, Scope, and Background

4.1. Introduction and Scope. This chapter outlines all facets of processes and responsibilities
involved with the IPR and PDF.

4.2. Background. The IPR and PDF are organized processing activities designed to ensure
deploying personnel are eligible to deploy and properly accounted for. The IPR and PDF are the
personnel processing agencies serving as the installation’s focal point for monitoring all
personnel processing activities to include orders publication and eligibility screening. The IPR
will not be assigned the unit internal duties and functions performed by the FSS Unit Readiness
Element (URE) such as unit deployment manager (UDM) or AFE/UTC management, as these
will conflict with the IPR’s primary installation level support mission.

Section 4B- The Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR)
4.3. Operations and Procedures. The IPR is an office in the FSS responsible for providing
installation wide personnel deployment planning and execution and personnel support in matters
pertaining to (1) deployment availability (DAV) information, (2) personnel accountability, and
(3) duty status reporting for contingency, exercise, and deployments. IPR responsibilities are
covered in the following five categories: (1) planning, (2) GCCS-AF systems, (3) accountability,
(4) deployment processing, and (5) general.
4.3.1. Personnel Planning.
4.3.1.1. Serves as the FSS war planner for the personnel facet of all contingencies, exercises, and
deployments.
4.3.1.1.1. Maintains familiarity with all tasked OPLANs and other taskings requiring movement
of personnel. Works with the IDO to ensure the base’s installation deployment plan covers all
aspects of processing and accounting for moving forces IAW AFI 10-403. The IPR will be
collocated with the Installation Deployment Readiness Center (IDRC) in accordance with AFI
10-403 unless the installation deployment mission does not justify the collocation.
4.3.1.1.1.1. Installations requesting to maintain IPR functions separate from the IDO/IDRC
should forward waiver requests to the MAJCOM A1R and A4R. The waiver request will be in
the form of an official memorandum from the Mission Support Group Commander or the first O6
equivalent in the chain of command. The request should outline the rational for the waiver and
include the length of time the requirement is to be waived; requests should not exceed 24 months.
The MAJCOM A1R and A4R will provide a joint approval or disapproval and forward.
MAJCOM A1Rs and A4Rs will forward a courtesy copy of the approved or disapproved waiver
request to HAF A1PR and A4LX workflows. MAJCOM wide waiver requests will be forwarded
to HAF A1PR and A4LX for approval or disapproval
AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            37

4.3.1.1.2. Develops personnel inputs to base deployment plans, COOP plans, and emergency
action plans.
4.3.1.1.3. Works with IDO, the FSS commander and the PDF chief in developing centralized
in/out- processing procedures in support of plans requiring mass movement of forces.
4.3.1.1.4. Serves as the Personnel Control Center (PCC), reporting directly to the battle staff
during exercises, inspections, disaster control exercises; and accomplishes personnel actions
required to respond to natural disasters, chemical, biological, or nuclear attacks/accidents.
4.3.1.1.4.1. Serves as a focal point for gathering and reporting accountability data.
4.3.1.1.4.2. Provides on-site commanders and staff with the capability to rapidly determine how
many personnel, by skill, are available at any given time.
4.3.1.1.4.3. Provides the capability at all organizational levels in cases of catastrophic events, to
monitor the status, progress, and capability of the base’s forces, including augmented forces.
4.3.1.1.5. When directed, the IPR may be manned on a 24-hour basis with trained augmentees
appointed by the FSS/CC.
4.3.1.1.6. Works with the base IDO to establish procedures to out-process deploying personnel
who meet all eligibility requirements (e.g., medical, dental, immunization, skill level, grade, etc.)
IAW AFI 10-403 and the deployment tasking and to establish procedures to in-process deployed
personnel upon return to home station. Will coordinate with the IDO on all force movement
issues.
4.3.1.1.7. IPR's will develop out-processing and in-processing deployment checklists and ensure
they are included in the Installation Deployment Plan (IDP). These checklists will be used for all
personnel that depart and return from a contingency deployment. Deployment in-processing
checklist must be accomplished before the commander will grant compensatory time off.
4.3.1.2. When directed by higher headquarters, the IPR:
4.3.1.2.1. Coordinates with the IDO to ensure the reception processing plan contains adequate
measures to in-process and account for all inbound forces.
4.3.1.2.2. Outlines in the In-garrison Expedition Site Plan (IGESP) when a PT must augment the
IPR. See paragraph 5.2 of this instruction for PT sizing details. Note: The IPR is only
responsible for the Total Force accountability and reporting discrepancy missions of PERSCO.
Because an MPE already exists, the appropriate MPE function is responsible for providing
personnel-type support to the deployed force. A casualty assistance representative (CAR) is
responsible for all casualty matters concerning the deployed force.
4.3.1.3. Provides assistance to PTs tasked to the FSS.
4.3.1.3.1. Provides the PT chief with information (OPLANs, CONOPS, reporting instructions,
etc.) for any deployment operations the PT may be tasked to support.
4.3.1.3.2. Trains PTs on GCCS-AF systems.
4.3.2. GCCS-AF Systems.
4.3.2.1. Manages the GCCS-AF systems assigned to the FSS IAW paragraph 2.19 of this
instruction.
38                                                     AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

4.3.2.2. Ensures GCCS-AF equipment is loaded by the designated equipment custodian into a
deployable ITAMS account IAW AFI 33-112, Information Technology Hardware Asset
Management, with the information identified in AFCSM 10-626, Volume 2. Note: This
information allows high-level visibility of GCCS-AF equipment supporting the MAJCOMs.
4.3.3. Accountability. Force accountability accuracy and its reporting is the single most
important responsibility of personnel and the IPR. Accountability provides information to
deployed theater leadership as well as Air Staff, HQ AFPC, and MAJCOMs concerning the force
structure being deployed. The home-station commander and the supporting MAJCOMs are
provided a concise picture of force capabilities remaining at home-station supporting other
operations or missions. To ensure accurate accountability, the IPR:
4.3.3.1. Maintains personnel strength accountability (deployed and TDY augmentation forces)
using the GCCS-AF system, currently DCAPES, and MilPDS. IPRs must constantly work to
maintain accurate accountability information allowing them to provide useful products to
customers.
4.3.3.1.1. DCAPES is the Air Force system that feeds into the Joint Operations Planning and
Execution System. It resides on the Global Command & Control System (GCCS) network.
DCAPES is used to build requirements in the OPLAN and to create reports on both existing and
future requirements.
4.3.3.1.2. DCAPES is programmed to generate MilPDS transactions to inform home-station
commanders of the whereabouts and status of their deployed personnel. MilPDS is the tool used
duty status conditions. The IPR will produce the Personnel Refresh File (IPR) to update
DCAPES at least once a month or as directed by MAJCOM or local policy.
4.3.3.1.3. The IPR will review the DCAPES Deployed Personnel Change Log (Dep Chg Log)
and Daily Transaction Registers (DTR) at least twice each duty day to determine the changes to
their plan file and personnel deployed. This review will be conducted more often as the
operation tempo requires. Validates all MilPDS updates to ensure corrective action is taken in
case of rejects, regardless of the update manner. The IPR must review and take immediate action
to correct rejected transactions.
4.3.3.2. Depending on the scope of the crisis, the IDO, in coordination with the FSS
commander, may establish a PDF to process and account for forces.
4.3.3.3. Ensures all areas of contingency TDY reporting are accomplished daily. Establishes a
daily routine to send and retrieve TDY information. The requirement for updating deployment
data originates upon notification by a MAJCOM that forces are required to deploy or upon
assignment to an execution plan requirement. Establishes reporting to provide:
4.3.3.3.1. Minimum personnel information to sustain essential on-site mission operations.
4.3.3.3.2. A method of achieving and maintaining strength accountability and monitoring
overseas country strength ceilings.
4.3.3.3.3. The capability at all organizational levels to monitor the status, progress, and
capability of the deployed force.
4.3.3.3.4. The capability of forecasting or projecting arrivals and their travel itineraries allowing
for deployed reception, bed down, and commander-mission planning at the deployed location.
4.3.4. IPR Deployment Processing.
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                          39

4.3.4.1. Establishes procedures to ensure personnel are identified to fill requirements confirmed
and validated by the base-level manpower office. Note: Reserve Component units are not
authorized a manpower function; therefore, the IPR must coordinate with the Logistics
Readiness Squadron (LRS) to ensure requirements are validated IAW AFI 10-401, AFI 10-403,
and this instruction.
4.3.4.1.1. Both the manpower office and IPR receive plan requirements. IPRs will only utilize
validated plan requirements to include: (1) Plan requirements flowed by AFPC/DPW, (2)
MAJCOM-directed plan requirements, (3) Requirements directed by higher headquarters to be
locally built.
4.3.4.1.2. In conjunction with the IDO and MO, ensures new taskings or changes to existing
taskings are verified and updated to LOGMOD NLT 3 duty days after receipt of tasking. This is
performed by the Manpower Office (MO) except in ARC units where there is no MO; in these
cases the IPR will do this.
4.3.4.1.3. Unit commanders identify and notify personnel to fill requirements and provide the
IDRC the names of tasked personnel and date notified. DCAPES must be updated as soon as
possible after the IDRC receives the deployment tasking. Wings/Bases are required to have
names in system NLT 15 days after IDO accepts tasking (BX in the Project Code) for taskings
received 30 days prior to first movement or with 24 hours for tasking received within 30 days of
first movement. First movement refers to TPFDD planning and movement dates such as training
line remarks requirements, Available to Load Date (ALD), Ready to Load Date (RLD), Earliest
Arrival Date (EAD), and the Required Delivery Date (RDD).
4.3.4.2. Advises commanders when personnel selected for deployment are ineligible to deploy
IAW DRMD requirements, this instruction, AFI 10-403, AFI 36-2110, any special personnel
program(s) in effect, and the reporting instructions/processing guidance issued by the component
command. Although the ultimate responsibility for deployment eligibility rests with the unit
commander, the IPR serves as the wing’s last set of eyes, ensuring all personnel in a questionable
deployment status have appropriate waivers according to the governing guidance or are replaced.
Reports personnel found ineligible to deploy to the unit for resolution. Tasked commanders can
request the deployed group commander waive the DRMD requirements. Such requests must be
routed through the IPR to the deployed group commander via the PT with information copies to
the supporting and component commands. Until approved waiver is received from the deployed
commander, the tasked unit will continue to process fully qualified personnel and prepare for the
deployment. If the unit does not have a qualified individual, the unit should be prepared to
submit a shortfall IAW AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.
4.3.4.2.1. If the deployed commander approves the request, the PT will notify the tasked
commander via IPR, courtesy copying the supporting MAJCOM and component command and
Intermediate Level Headquarters (IHQ), if established. Note: If appropriate, the deployed
commander may want to consider modifying the DRMD to reflect this change.
4.3.4.2.2. Directs that if the deployed commander disapproves the request, the tasked
commander must fill the requirement as specified in the DRMD or submit a reclama.
4.3.4.3.    Assigns persons to requirements within DCAPES. Performs accountability
responsibilities IAW paragraph 4.3.3 of this instruction.
40                                                    AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009

4.3.4.4. Prepares an AF Form 3847, Deployment Processing TDY Checklist, IAW attachment 4
of this instruction, supporting command-unique or locally developed checklist for all personnel
identified to deploy who are not a part of a unit move. Command or locally developed checklist
must include, as a minimum, all items identified on the AF Form 3847. The AF Form 3847 is
utilized as an internal checklist for the IPR to ensure all required actions are completed before
the individual departs from home station.
4.3.4.5. The IDO will verify the mode and source of movement by using the TPFDD. The IPR
will coordinate with the IDO to request official travel for personnel deploying. The IPR will not
make travel arrangements for deploying personnel.
4.3.4.5.1. Updates travel information in DCAPES NLT 45 days prior to first movement date
identified in the TPFDD or NLT 15 days after receipt of taskings that were received within 30
days of first movement date. Note: This information provides deployed commander and PTs
with in-transit visibility (ITV) and projected arrival information for accountability purposes.
4.3.4.6. Ensures the initial personnel deployment processing briefing is provided to tasked
personnel within 3 duty days of receiving the tasked personnel information from the unit
commander.
4.3.4.6.1. Ensures tasked individuals have proper identification credentials according to the
component command’s reporting guidance/processing instructions and the DoD Foreign
Clearance Guide. If applicable, the IPR identifies passport and/or visa requirements to the
passport office to process passport and/or visa applications, ensuring all documentation is
submitted      IAW DoD guidelines.
4.3.4.6.2. Provides guidance on obtaining medical, dental, immunizations and other clearance
paperwork to the tasked individual for deployments not requiring activation of the PDF or if an
activated PDF will not include those capabilities.
4.3.4.6.3. Provides tasked personnel information concerning the tasking to include final location.
Other information will be provided in fact sheets, CNAF’s out-processing checklist, processing
guidance/reporting instructions, etc.
4.3.4.7. Prepares CED orders IAW the component command’s reporting instructions and/or
Comptroller Alert Messages, and Chapter 7 of this instruction when individual meets final
deployment qualifications. Prepares NATO order IAW current Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG)
(if applicable).
4.3.4.8. Is responsible for out-processing the individual. Individual will not deploy from home
station prior to receiving CED orders and IDO confirmation of transportation allocation.
4.3.4.8.1. Informs individual to hand-carry all required items identified in AOR reporting
instructions (e.g., CNAF’s out-processing checklist, deployable medical records, identification
tags, and OJT Records etc.). Note: ARC personnel will hand-carry copies of activation order;
i.e., MPA, AGR, mobilization.
4.3.4.9. Updates the individual’s departure in DCAPES which will depart the individual in
MilPDS.
4.3.4.10. Maintains accountability of deployed personnel IAW paragraph 4.3.3 of this
instruction.
AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                          41

4.3.4.11. Establishes procedures for units to report the return to home station of deploying
personnel. Ensures the return is updated within 24 hours after the member’s return. Update
member’s return in DCAPES which will return member in MilPDS.

and equipment. DAF civilians will deploy on CED orders and all systems accountability
information will be updated. The following are additional requirements for civilians.
4.3.4.12.1. Ensure individual is issued the appropriate Common Access Card (CAC). All
deploying DAF civilians are considered Emergency-Essential for purposes of the deployment
and require the correct CAC.
4.3.4.12.2. Ensure the CPF has briefed the individual on pay, benefits, and entitlements as a
result of the deployment.
4.3.4.12.3. Ensure the CPF has initiated and the individual has signed the Emergency-Essential
position agreement (DD Form 2365).
4.3.4.12.4. Brief deploying personnel on wear of uniforms IAW AOR policies and AFI 36-801,

42                                                     AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

additional reported discrepancies will be managed by the appropriate unit/squadron commander
in conjunction with the IDO.
Section 4C- The Personnel Deployment Function (PDF)
4.4. Operations and Procedures. The PDF is part of the installation’s deployment processing
activity designed to ensure deploying personnel are properly accounted for and processed for
deployment. It serves as the installation’s focal point for monitoring all personnel processing
activities to include orders publication, eligibility screening, pre-deployment briefings, assisting
the transportation/passenger terminal in passenger manifesting by providing a Cargo Movement
Operations System (CMOS) file.
4.4.1. The IDO, in coordination with the MPE commander, establishes a PDF IAW this
instruction and AFI 10-403. Although establishing a formal PDF processing line provides the
most effective means to check personnel eligibility and readiness, special circumstances
(resource availability, limited deployment scope, etc.) may not warrant standing up a processing
line. If the IDO deems a stand-alone PDF line is not required, deploying personnel must be
provided a deployment checklist to ensure deploying personnel receive the same processing and
services that are afforded in the formal PDF line.
4.4.2. The PDF OIC/NCOIC ensures PDF capabilities meet the requirements of the forces
deploying. Once established, the PDF must be prepared for personnel processing around the
clock as the local mission dictates.
4.4.2.1. At a minimum, establishes Deployment Eligibility and Medical stations for processing
deploying forces.
4.4.2.2. Establishes optional personnel processing stations (e.g., ID station) or services IAW AFI
10-403.
4.4.2.3. Maintains positive control and accountability of deploying personnel from the time they
arrive at the PDF processing line until they leave home station, if departing the same day. This
includes controlling the personnel until they reach the “sterile” area for departure. The IPR will
maintain contact with the IDO and UDM(s) when departure from home station is scheduled for a
different day.
4.4.3. Coordinates with the IDO and Transportation office on the TPFDD mode and source of
movement. Provides travel information to DCAPES operators for update.
4.4.4. Advises commanders when personnel selected for deployment are ineligible to deploy
IAW DRMD requirements, this instruction, AFI 10-403, AFI 36-2110, any special personnel
programs in effect, and the reporting instructions/processing guidance issued by the component
command. Although the overall responsibility for deployment eligibility rests with the unit
commander, the PDF serves as the wing’s last checkpoint ensuring all personnel in a
questionable deployment status have appropriate waivers or are replaced. Reports ineligible
personnel to the IDO for resolution.
4.4.4.1. Prepares new ID tags IAW AFI 36-3103, Identification Tags and appropriate CACs for
both military and civilian with the correct Geneva Convention status, benefits and entitlements.
4.4.4.2. Accomplishes changes to SGLV-8286, Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI)
Election and Certificate upon request.
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         43

4.4.4.3. Ensures deploying individuals have a printed copy of their Virtual Record of Emergency
Data (vRED).
4.4.4.4. The following agencies may establish stations on the PDF processing line to accomplish
the actions required in AFI 10-403: Finance, Legal, Chaplain, Family Support, and Services.
Additional agencies may be included as required.
4.4.4.5. Collects completed AF Form 245, Employment Locator and Processing Checklist, for
inclusion in the Troop Commander’s Personnel Accountability Kit (PAK) IAW AFI 10-403.
4.4.5. Uses DCAPES to produce CED orders IAW Chapter 7 of this instruction and component
command reporting instructions/processing guidance.
4.4.6. Uses Integrated Deployment System (IDS) components to the maximum extent.
4.4.6.1. Provides logistics module (LOGMOD) updates or changes of personnel information to
the IDO as they occur IAW AFI 10-403.
4.4.6.2. ARC IPRs provide LOGMOD updates or changes to plan information as they occur
IAW AFI 10-403. Note: For active duty units, the manpower office is responsible for providing
LOGMOD changes to plan information.
4.4.6.3. Processes LOGMOD personnel assignment data into DCAPES for issuing orders.
4.4.6.4. Unless already produced by the IDO, the IPR will provide the IDO a CMOS file for
electronic manifesting once processing for a chalk is complete regardless of the number of
individuals deploying.
4.4.7. Instructs all deploying personnel to report to the deployed personnel processing facility,
normally a PT, for in-processing and deployed accountability purposes. If delayed en route,
instructs deploying personnel to report to a personnel processing facility for in-transit
accountability.
4.4.8. Ensures all DCAPES updates for deploying personnel are processed IAW this instruction
and the component command’s reporting instructions/processing guidance.
44                                                    AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009


                           Chapter 5
 PERSONNEL SUPPORT FOR CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

Section 5A-Introduction and Scope

5.1. Introduction and Scope. PERSCO is everything the personnel community does to support
the warfighter. It is the collection of manual and automated procedures, systems, hardware,
personnel agencies, and deployable teams to accomplish Total Force accountability, reporting,
and provide advice on personnel programs. This chapter outlines basic PERSCO processes and
responsibilities.

5.1.1. PTs are established by the Air Staff PERSCO FAM, HQ USAF/A1PR, and sourced to the
MAJCOMs to meet the national military strategy and the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan
(JSCP). All PTs are structured IAW the UTCs registered in the MEFPAK. MAJCOMs may task
FSSs with multiple team requirements.

5.1.2. For planning purposes, all PTs are considered formed, trained, and immediately available
for deployment.

5.1.3. PERSCO teams are responsible for Total Force accountability and reporting, casualty
reporting, and providing personnel program advice.

Section 5B-PERSCO Team Planning Factors for the Component Command

5.2. PERSCO Team Sizing. The component command personnel planner determines the PT
requirements at each location based on a variety of factors. Table 5.1 is an overview of all
UTCs. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) illustrates the complete capability
and the Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR) lists the required equipment/supplies for
each UTC.

5.2.1. Teams Employed at an existing Air Force installation. PTs deployed to main operating
bases will augment the IPR and work for the FSS/CC or as directed by the CNAF. Because an
FSS already exists to provide basic personnel services, a PT going into an existing Air Force
installation should only be responsible for the Total Force accountability aspect. An existing
FSS may require augmentation to properly support the reception of projected employed forces.

5.2.2. Teams Employed at Bare Base Operations/ FOLs. The component command personnel
planner may want to increase PERSCO support for Bare Base locations/FOLs, especially in the
deployment phase of operations when it is generally more difficult to locate and account for
personnel, coordinate management actions, and provide for personnel matters.

5.2.3. Available facilities and equipment will determine the PT equipment requirements.

5.2.4. When tasked, a PT provides strength accountability for and support to GSUs.

5.2.5. Size of Activity Supported. There is not necessarily a direct relationship between the size
of the force and the PERSCO support needed. PTs supporting a large GSU population will need
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         45

personnel to support their accountability activities. Judgment of the personnel planner is a key
element in establishing a PT tasking and its ultimate size. The formula of 1 personnel technician
per 275 individuals is used as only a guide. Factors such as: working a 60-hour workweek per
AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements, location at an Aerial Port Of Debarkation
(APOD), supporting GSUs, threat level, deployment phase, incoming personnel surge level, Joint
population serviced, strength ceilings, supporting MOB vs. FOL, CNAF-unique reporting
requirements, Joint reporting requirements, and other available support at a deployed location
must be taken into account.
Table 5.1. PERSCO and Personnel Augmentation Team Overview Table.

Team        Description
RFL01       Command & Control. A FSS UTC that includes a Commander, Superintendent and
            the basic PERSCO accountability team, a MSgt 3S071 and a 3S051. This is the basis
            for forming an Expeditionary Force Support Squadron (EFSS).
RFL02       Manpower and Personnel Force Management Team. Team consisting of two
            individuals, one 3S371, and one 3S071, who provide Manpower operations and

            requirement.
RFPF1       PERSCO Accountability Team. An independent team composed of two individuals.
            A MSgt 7-level 3S0X1, and a 5-level 3S051; both will be PERSCO and DCAPES
            qualified. This team is trained and equipped to provide personnel accountability and
            reporting, force management, and casualty reporting. This UTC can support up to
            275 personnel before it should be augmented with additional UTCs. This is the only
            stand-alone PERSCO team.
46                                               AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009


RFPF2   PERSCO Augmentation Team. This is a dependent team consisting of four
        individuals. This team cannot deploy without a RFPF1 team or FSS IPR present at
        the deployed location. This team requires a 3S091, a 3S071 and two 3S051s. All
        team members will be PERSCO qualified and one team member will be DCAPES
        qualified. This team is designed to augment an already in-place RFPF1 team or FSS
        to provide additional accountability capability and limited personnel program support.
        This UTC along with RFPF1, RFL02, RFL05 can support up to 1,650 personnel.
RFPF3   PERSCO Sustainment Team. A dependent team of two individuals that cannot
        deploy without a RFPF1 team or FSS IPR present at deployed location. This team is
        made up of one 3S071 and a 3S051. Both team members must complete the
        PERSCO JQS. This team augments the RFPF1 Accountability team and provides
        additional capability to support routine deployed personnel programs. Add this UTC
        when supported population exceeds 1,650 personnel then consider adding additional
        teams for every additional 550 supported personnel.
RFPF4   PERSCO Chief Enlisted Manager. Provides senior enlisted leadership capability if
        no like capability is present. This particular UTC is postured at above wing-level
        organizations.
RFPF5   Civilian Sustainment Team. A one-person team, 38F YA-02, who coordinates and
        directs civilian personnel programs for deployed commanders and personnel staffs.
        This team provides advice, guidance, and support on civilian personnel programs and
        can be used to support Joint or special staff requirements.
RFPF6   Air Reserve Component Personnel Sustainment Team. This independent team
        composed of two individuals, one 3S071, and a 3S051, will be used at a deployed
        location in stead of the RFPF3 where the Reserve Component population drives this
        requirement or in-garrison to provide additional sustainment support during periods
        of mobilization or other emergency situations.
RFPF7   PERSCO Superintendent. Provides SMSgt level PERSCO leadership when Chief
        level leadership is not needed.
RFPF8   PERSCO Augmentation Flex Pkg. A Personnel 5-level capability to augment

AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         47


Section 5C-PERSCO Responsibilities and Qualifications

5.3. PERSCO Eligibility Criteria. All 3S0XX personnel are eligible for designation as a PT
member. AFI 10-403 outlines Deployment Availability Codes (DAV) in Attachment 2. AFI 10-
401 outlines AEF assignment policy along with deployment selection within and outside a
person’s assigned AEF on-call window.

5.4. PERSCO Member Response Time. All PTs must be available for deployment at all times
during their AEF on-call period. PTs will be available to deploy NLT 24 hours after notification
to deploy. Note: Applicable to ARC teams only after mobilization.
5.5. The Planning Phase - Pre-Deployment Actions
5.5.1. Training. Training is the primary factor in the planning phase
5.5.1.1. The FSS commander/superintendent is responsible for all PT training.
5.5.1.2. The designated PERSCO trainer coordinates training for team members according to the
guidelines outlined in this instruction, applicable Personnel Readiness AFJQSs, and the tasked
UTC MISCAP statement.
5.5.1.3. The FSS UDM serves as the focal point for scheduling and documenting all
initial/recurring ancillary deployment training and classified courier training for PT members.
AFI 10-403 outlines the basic deployment training requirements. The UDM ensures the
equipment custodian (EC) receives training in equipment management and reporting procedures
according to AFCSM 10-626, Volume 2, cargo preparation, and check-in procedures according
to AFI 10-403 and the IDO.
5.5.1.4. FSS commanders will ensure PT training program certifies all PERSCO AFJQS items
before the person enters their assigned AEF on-call window. FSS commanders will ensure
recertification training is accomplished for any training item where an individual fails to
demonstrate proficiency.
5.5.1.5. Only GCCS-AF system operators, filling PERSCO positions identified as requiring SEI
295, are required to be “Task Performance” trained on the GCCS-AF system.
5.5.1.6. The following training recommendations are provided:
5.5.1.6.1. Realistic PERSCO training scenarios, after-action reports, and PERSCO
Readiness Course lessons can be found at: https://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil. The FSS commander
will ensure some of these scenarios and after-action report observations are included in wing
exercises.
5.5.1.6.2. The PT chief should assign areas of expertise to individual PT members and require
each member to build training packages for his/her area of expertise. During training sessions,
the “experts” should provide training to the rest of the team for their area of concentration. As
programs evolve, the “experts” will change and modify training packages, maximizing the reuse
capacity of the information.
5.5.1.6.3. In-house training sessions will be conducted and documented twice a month (at least
once a month for ARC units) to ensure all team members receive training on all required areas
within 15 months of initial assignment.
48                                                    AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

5.5.2. The FSS commander appoints an EC and accomplishes a Custodian Authorization/Custody
Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) for PERSCO LOGFOR equipment. Note: Each team tasked with a
GCCS-AF system and/or LOGFOR equipment must have its own appointed EC since they may
deploy to different locations.
5.5.2.1. The PT chief will ensure the EC completes an annual inventory of supplies, equipment,
and CA/CRL. The team chief will also ensure an inventory is completed immediately upon
notification of a deployment. Note: If the FSS is tasked with multiple teams supporting multiple
locations, each team supporting a different location must identify a different EC.
5.5.2.2. Maintenance of Supply Kits. A supply kit (as specified in the tasked UTC LOGDET and
this instruction) must be established and maintained for each PT. The required contents of the
PERSCO supply kits are based on minimum essential needs for performing initial PERSCO
duties.
5.5.2.3. Forms and expendable supplies will be packed and maintained ready for deployment at
all times. Air Force Electronic Publications Library (AFEPL) and forms management software
may be used in place of paper copies of required forms and publications listed in Attachment 9.
Arrangements should be made with base information management offices to obtain the most
current versions of the AFEPL and forms management software.
5.5.2.4. PT equipment custodians, along with the team chiefs, are responsible for maintaining the
accuracy and correctness of their respective kits, and will audit the contents annually (unless the
responsible MAJCOM directs a more frequent audit). This responsibility will not be delegated.
5.5.2.5. PTs must audit kits before and after all deployments. Items in Attachment 9 and the
tasked UTC LOGDET are the minimum items required. Team chiefs may add other items they
deem appropriate; however, total weight and/or dimensions cannot exceed that outlined in the
LOGFOR. Before and after all deployments, PT members should check kits to ensure all items
are usable. Identify publications and other FSS equipment designated for PERSCO use. Note:
These items may be used in daily FSS operations if they are maintained in a mission-ready status.

5.5.2.6. AFPC owns and controls all PERSCO GCCS-AF equipment at real-world deployed
locations and has sole responsibility for software upgrades, warranty information, and
replacement parts. The designated deployed equipment custodian(s) must ensure all GCCS-AF
equipment (to include; laptop/desktop, printer, scanner, docking station) is inventoried, at the
beginning and end of each cycle, on the GCCS-AF Inventory sheet provided by AFPC (found on
the AFPC Readiness NIPR and SIPR websites). Any movement (whether from re/forward
deployment or closure) of GCCS equipment must be coordinated through and approved by
AFPC/DPWRSF (DSN 665-2770).

5.5.2.6.1. Bases will maintain their deployable GCCS-AF equipment for training, local exercises
and ORIs. Although these systems are intended for non-deployable use, bases should be
prepared to deploy with their equipment as a last resort during national disasters or when
simultaneous surge operations deplete staged equipment. MAJCOMs own base level GCCS-AF
equipment and are responsible for software upgrades, warranty information, and replacement
parts.

5.5.3.   Briefing PERSCO Responsibilities.       The PT chief annually briefs PERSCO
responsibilities to all home-station commanders with a deployment mission. Use information
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        49

provided in this instruction and Annex E of the tasked OPLAN(s) to inform them of the
component command expectations and personnel CONOPS while deployed. Attachment 5 of
this instruction provides a sample responsibilities memorandum. A continuing education
program for all commanders will enable PTs to successfully complete their wartime mission. It
must be stressed to commanders that personnel’s number one priority is Total Force strength
accountability.

5.5.4. PERSCO Team Pre-Planning Actions. The pre-planning checklist at Attachment 6
provides a list of items to look for in a deployment tasking to ensure pre-planning is achieved.

5.5.4.1. PT chiefs will use Attachment 6 to review taskings, ensuring the parent MAJCOM
personnel planner covers all issues needed for planning a smooth transition from pre-planning to
deployment execution. Items listed in Attachment 6 identify specific references to issues of
general guidance in the Air Force war and mobilization guidance directives that may be pertinent
to the OPLAN or tasking. Ask the component command personnel planner for the PERSCO
CONOPS for review prior to deployment.
5.5.4.2. Attachment 6 also lists the specific deployment guidance component commands must
outline to support PTs at each deployed forward operating location.

Section 5D-PERSCO Operations and Procedures
5.6. Site Infrastructure. Although not directly affecting the number of PERSCO members,
permanent structures, services, and communications support may affect the amount of PT support
equipment needed to operate effectively. The component command personnel planner
coordinates with logistics planners IAW AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site
Planning, to determine what facilities exist, and what equipment and supplies are readily
available at each employment location identified in the TPFDD. At a minimum, the personnel
planner coordinates with the following agencies to identify PERSCO infrastructure requirements:
5.6.1. Logistics and security forces planners for facility, equipment, and supply requirements.
Note: Security forces are involved because GCCS-AF system operations require classified
operating environment protection.
5.6.2. Civil engineer planners for electric power requirements. The component command
provides electrical transformers to meet GCCS-AF power requirements to convert 220 volts to
110 volts, where applicable. ONLY GCCS-AF systems are capable of automatically switching
over to 220 volts internally on their mainboards (dual-voltage capable). JAZ drives and printers
are not dual-voltage capable. Note: Units deploying overseas should ensure a 220 volt surge
suppressor is available for the GCCS-AF system.
5.6.3. Communication planners are responsible for communications requirements for all
locations in the AOR capable of supporting wartime and contingency operations. Communication
support includes:
5.6.3.1. Identifying the need for secure and non-secure telephone/data fax capability.
5.6.3.2. Identifying the need for SIPRNET and NIPRNET capability.
5.7. Utilization of PERSCO Teams. The MANFOR provides the manpower structure of each
PT, the LOGFOR provides the equipment requirements, and Attachment 9 lists the necessary
50                                                    AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009

supply items. The RFPF1 is the only stand-alone PERSCO UTC. The RFPF2, RFPF3, RFPF4,
RFPF6, RFL04, and RFL05 or a combination of these UTCs will be used to augment the RFPF1
UTC as needed.
5.7.1. The requirements in specific contingency situations must be continuously monitored and
reviewed by the component command personnel planner. In the event of forward deployments of
TDY forces or other adjustments in the size of these forces, the PT requirements will be reviewed
and adjusted if necessary.
5.7.2. PTs will augment the IPR when deployed to an existing FSS. The RFL04 or RFL05
team is used to augment the FSS office if augmenting an existing FSS. If used at a bare-
base/FOL, the RFL04 UTC will be the director of personnel programs for base leadership. The
CNAF/A1 personnel planner will specify command relationships for PTs in the PERSCO
CONOPS.
5.7.3. PTs providing support to GSUs. When this occurs, a PERSCO augmentation should be
considered using the formula of 2 personnel technicians per 275 GSU individuals as a guide.
5.7.4. Proximity to Area of Conflict. Additional PERSCO UTCs should be considered as the
anticipated casualty rate directly influences the casualty reporting workload.
5.8. Execution Phase. The Execution Phase begins when the PT is tasked to deploy.
5.8.1. Upon notification of deployment, the FSS or FSS commander notifies the PT(s) they are
deploying.
5.8.2. The PT will coordinate with the IPR and the IDO about the tasking and location. If
available, review component commander’s PERSCO CONOPS. The FSS commander and PT
chief should review all PT taskings and immediately identify to the supporting MAJCOM
personnel planner all LIMFACs/shortfalls. Review available lessons learned at AFPC’s
Readiness web sites.
5.8.3. Other PT final deployment planning actions should include the following:
5.8.3.1. The PT chief will contact the IPR to obtain as much information as possible about the
deployment operation, as a minimum: 1) Listing of base personnel who may be deployed and if
they are going to the same FOL as the PT; 2) Messages (replacement, reporting instructions, etc.)
relating to the operation and/or FOL.
5.8.3.2. Determine scope of PT accountability (e.g., combined or Joint assets).
5.8.3.3. Determine availability of in-place or pre-positioned equipment. Contact the component
command and make arrangements to review the FOL’s Base Support Plan (BSP) (if available).
Consider requirements for: power, secure and unsecured telephone/fax capability, SIPRNET
LAN capability, and a classified operating environment. Note: Because the GCCS-AF system is
a classified operating system the need for a classified operating environment exists for both
primary and alternate locations.
5.8.3.4. PT Chief must submit a Red-Mini Log-in Request sheet (see Red-Mini User’s Guide)
for all deploying team members operating the GCCS-AF system IAW paragraph 2.18 and 2.19 of
this instruction. Contact IDO to ensure equipment is moved IAW the TPFDD after the
component command validates the requirement.
5.8.4. Other actions to be taken during deployment execution are:
AFI 36-3802           23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         51

5.8.4.1. PT chief should develop tentative shift schedule(s) and assign specific duties and
responsibilities to each deploying PT member based on most current information available.
Discuss with each deploying PT member the tentative work schedules, expected duties, and
initial arrival actions. Review the required actions needed to be accomplished upon arrival to
ensure everyone understands what to do and how to accomplish their actions.
5.8.4.2. Ensure all classified material is prepared for transportation and personnel are briefed on
classified courier responsibilities according to AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
Management, and DoD 5200.1-R.
5.8.4.3. Travel on commercial flights. Ensure the FSS commander or security manager
authorizes appropriately cleared couriers to hand-carry classified material IAW DoD 5200.1-R
and AFI 31-401. Ensure deploying courier reads and acknowledges the cautionary statement for
hand-carrying classified material on commercial flights IAW AFI 31-401.
5.8.4.4. Travel on other than commercial flights. Ensure the FSS unit commander or security
manager authorizes appropriately cleared couriers to hand-carry classified material IAW AFI 31-
401. Issues and controls the DD Form 2501, Courier Authorization Card (available through the
AFEPL) for hand-carrying classified material by means other than on commercial flights.
5.9. Initial Set-up Actions. The checklist in Attachment 8 outlines the general responsibilities
and actions required when PTs initially arrive at their final destination.
5.9.1. The PT will:
5.9.1.1. Establish strength accountability for everyone the PT is responsible for, regardless of
location and update into accountability system. These updates include normal arrival updates as
well as all needed force gains. A force gain is required if there is no record in the accountability
system. Strength accountability provides valuable planning and decision-making information to
senior leaders at all levels concerning deployed force closure, force sustainment and force
availability.
5.9.1.2. Establish manual files as backup for the GCCS-AF system.
5.9.1.3. Establish connectivity to the Red-Mini file server. Note: Users should exhaust all
means to ensure SIPRNET connectivity to the Red-Mini, such as deployed communications
squadron, Intel, or AMC TALCE.
5.9.1.4. Contact component command A1 to obtain command relationships.
5.9.1.5. Brief commanders and their staffs on the PT’s duties, capabilities, and responsibilities
IAW this instruction and the component command’s guidance. Attachment 5 of this instruction
provides a sample responsibilities memorandum.
5.9.1.6. Establish reception processing procedures. It is imperative that PTs meet and account
for personnel as soon as they arrive on station.
5.9.1.7. Obtain at least one copy of the CED orders annotated with the date arrived and a
completed AF Form 245 to establish manual files. Note: Obtain at least one copy of the
activation order for ARC members; i.e., MPA, AGR or mobilization, and establish a manual file.
5.9.1.8. Ensure a Reception Control Center (RCC) is established to in-process forces in an
effective and efficient manner IAW AFI 10-403 and AFI 10-404. The PT must work with the
logistics staff to incorporate adequate accountability in processing into the RCC.
52                                                      AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

5.9.1.9. If an RCC is not established, PTs must coordinate with the appropriate agencies to
ensure accountability is obtained.
5.9.1.10. Prior to arrival of a PT, the deployed commander is responsible for capturing arrival
information regardless of the mode of travel. Consider all potential avenues by which a person
may arrive such as commercial air, privately-owned vehicle (POV), rail, etc., and determine how
to account for them. The PT must obtain and crosscheck information to include AF Form 245
and copies of orders from the deployed commander to ensure GCCS-AF system data integrity.
5.9.1.11. Identify a unit manning POC for all units at the deployed location and establish
procedures for duty status reporting and accountability maintenance. Provide the unit POC with
ERMDs and alpha rosters of deployed personnel assigned to their unit weekly at a minimum.
These products will be utilized by the POC to maintain oversight of assigned individuals as well
as projected inbounds. Unit POCs must report arrivals, departures, hospitalizations, etc., within
24 hours of the change in duty status.
5.9.1.12. Establish a unit manning POC and accountability procedures to account for GSUs, if
tasked to support. Ensure the GSU manning POC and/or commander reports any personnel
changes to the servicing PT on a daily basis. Note: This may require traveling to GSUs to assist
establishing reporting procedures.
5.9.1.13. If required by component command CONOPS, establish unit manning POC with other
branches of military service, civilian contracting companies, coalition forces, etc. The
accountability responsibilities will be defined by the component command.
5.9.1.14. PTs will account for all AF transient forces (others as directed by component A1).
Transient forces are those who spend at least one night at a location which is not their final duty
location. Updating of transient personnel into GCCS-AF system is required. Individuals
accounted for in a transient status will be included in section VIII of the DSC message.
5.9.1.15. If directed, PTs can obtain the status of en-route individuals traveling on dedicated
airlift through the transportation office using the Global Air Transportation Execution System
(GATES) or the Global Transportation Network (GTN). Transportation systems provide the
capability to track individuals by name, SSN, and ULN from the time they depart from their
home station until arrival at their final destination. These systems can also provide the status of
aircraft delays or layovers that will assist PERSCO in the overall accountability effort.
5.9.1.16. Establish PERSCO Operating Location. Minimum requirements for operating location
are:
5.9.1.16.1. Power supply.
5.9.1.16.2. Secure and non-secure telephone.
5.9.1.16.3. SIPRNET and NIPRNET capability.
5.9.1.16.4. Classified operating environment.
5.9.1.16.5. AFPC OSC POC Listing for message traffic.
5.9.1.16.6. Secure and non-secure e-mail accounts.
5.9.1.16.7. Standard supply items (e.g., pens, pencils, printer paper, etc.).
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         53

5.9.1.16.8. Transportation requirements. Note: If any of the above is unavailable, identify the
LIMFAC to the component command for their action and include on the commander’s Situation
Report (SITREP) and PT Status Report. Maintain LIMFAC reporting until capability is
operational. All LIMFACs are classified at the same classification level of the operation being
supported and must be handled accordingly.
5.9.1.17. Complete PT Initial Arrival Checklist IAW Attachment 8 of this instruction.
5.9.1.18. Submit a PT Status Report IAW paragraph 6.5 of this instruction.
5.9.1.19. Submit the GCCS-AF System Initial Report IAW AFCSM 10-626, Volume 2, if not
included with the PT status report.
5.9.1.20. Create and maintain a POC book containing grade, name, phone numbers, fax
numbers, e-mail addresses, and locations of key personnel at the FOL and higher headquarters.
Note: Should include commanders, first sergeants, billeting, mortuary affairs, medical staff, and
others deemed appropriate.       MAJCOM, IPR, and PERSCO POCs can be found at
https://www.randolph.af.smil.mil/afpc/personnel_readiness.
5.9.1.21. Establish a casualty reporting program according to AFI 36-3002 and local procedures.
Establish points of contact with the medical treatment facility (MTF) and mortuary affairs.
5.9.1.22. Establish PRP reporting procedures IAW AFI 36-2104, Nuclear Weapons Personnel
Reliability Program.
5.9.1.23. Use a daily events log to keep team members updated and to help prepare PERSCO
AARs.
5.9.1.24. In the absence of a deployed manpower agency, assist deployed commanders in
completing Authorization Change Requests (ACRs) needed to accomplish mission objectives.
5.9.1.25. Ensure the PT equipment custodian inventories each GCCS-AF System and sets up and
tests system components.
5.9.1.26. Ensures all accountable deployed PERSCO GCCS-AF equipment is loaded into
ITAMS within 3 days of arrival.
5.10. Sustainment Operations and Actions. The sustainment phase is a transition from the set-
up phase, where the majority of the main operating force has arrived and completed in-
processing actions. The sustainment phase can occur any time after arriving at the FOL and lasts
until a build-up/surge phase occurs or until the redeployment phase. During the sustainment
phase, the PT continues to maintain Total Force accountability and strength reporting and
provides personnel program advice.
5.10.1. The following actions help maintain accountability:
5.10.1.1. Report unfilled positions required by the deployed commander to the supporting and
component commands for fill action.
5.10.1.2. Early Release and Replacement Required. For early return of individuals assigned to
requirements, the PT must send an early release/return message to the component command,
home-station IPR, home-station unit/CC, supporting command personnel readiness branch and
AFPC/DPW, advising of the individual’s status and requesting replacement if needed IAW AFI
10-401. The component command will forward the approved request to AFPC/DPW for their
54                                                   AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009

action. Note: For PIDs not managed by AFPC/DPW, requests will be worked directly by the
responsible component command. Disapproved requests will be sent back to the deployed
commander. Utilize report format provided in paragraph 6.11. of this instruction.
5.10.1.3. Process incoming and outgoing DCAPES updates daily. Note: Report the lack of
DCAPES capability as a LIMFAC to the component command for their resolution.
5.10.1.4. PTs must retain a copy of their DCAPES update logs (incoming and outgoing) for a
minimum of 30 days.
5.10.1.5. Update duty status changes daily.
5.10.1.6. Submit daily DSC messages NLT 2400 hours local daily or NLT the timeline provided
by the component command. Negative DSC messages are required.
5.10.2. Produce and use the following products:
5.10.2.1. Employment Requirements Manning Document (ERMD). Identifies the number and
types of requirements projected to the deployed location. It can be used to monitor force build-
up, identify unfilled positions, and replacement actions (identified by a “R” position suffix).
5.10.2.2. Requirements Mismatch Report. Used to validate PERSCO-captured information so
PTs can correct erroneous or mismatched conditions. Use this product to identify personnel
records containing PID data not matching the validated plans received from the component
command, possible shortfalls, and erroneous data in the GCCS-AF system.
5.10.2.3. Duplicate Position Report. Identifies multiple personnel assigned to the same
requirement position. PTs will validate identified personnel records and notify the appropriate
IPR to delete the erroneous DCAPES data.
5.10.2.4. The Unfilled Requirements Report. This is a preformatted report identifying all
unfilled requirements within 60 calendar days of RDD. Report is sent to supporting commands
and FSS for their action.
5.10.2.5. Alpha Rosters. PTs provide alpha rosters to units. Units will review alpha rosters to
maintain accountability by identifying personnel who have departed or have not in-processed.
The PT then takes appropriate action to capture changed unit information. Recommend a
representative from each unit and PERSCO member meet face to face on a weekly basis and
review the unit’s accountability rosters to ensure there is no difference between the personnel
physically in the unit and what PERSCO reflects in system.
5.10.3. Tour extensions. PTs will process all tour extension requests to the component
command informing AFPC/DPW, supporting command Personnel Readiness Office, IPR, and
home-station commander IAW AFI 10-401. Note: For PIDs not managed by AFPC/DPW,
requests will be worked directly by the responsible component command. Send requests NLT 60
days prior to individual’s established end of tour. Note: ARC personnel deployed on MPA man-
days under 10 USC 12301(d) are called to AD for a specific period of time and, by law, cannot
be involuntarily extended. The mobilized individual can be extended, but the extension cannot
prevent them from returning to home station in time to take authorized down-time, use accrued
leave and complete any required out-processing actions. Extensions of ARC personnel require
the approval and coordination of HQ ANG for ANG personnel and HQ ARPC for AFRC
personnel. The PT must work these with the individual’s IPR.
AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                        55

5.10.4. The Deployment Processing Discrepancy Reporting Tool (DPDRT) is a classified,
automated tool used by deployed locations to report deployment processing discrepancies.
PTs will be responsible for collecting and updating Personnel deployment processing
discrepancies within 72 hours of arrival of Airman. PTs will assist the Reception Control Center
(RCC), Deployed Logistics Readiness Office (LRO), and deployed functions/units in updating
their identified discrepancies.
5.10.5. PT should have a copy of, and be familiar with, the AOR’s unique guidance regarding
personnel policies and procedures. These instructions should be used to answer questions and
concerns of commanders and the population in general. Issues not addressed in the AOR’s
instructions should be elevated to the component command for action.
5.10.6. The Reclama Processing Tool (RPT) is a classified automated tool used to submit,
process and track reclama requests submitted by units and MAJCOMs. PTs can use the tool to
determine if a reclama request was submitted for a requirement on the ERMD that has not yet
been filled by the tasked unit.
5.10.7. GCCS-AF System Maintenance. Total Force accountability is accomplished with
GCCS-AF systems utilizing DCAPES and/or MANPER-B software. This software uses a series
of business rules to alert users to changes in deployment requirements and the status of deployed
persons. The PT must maintain accurate accountability data to provide useful products to
customers. The following actions help maintain accurate GCCS-AF system stored information:
5.10.7.1. Follow the Red-Mini user responsibilities IAW paragraph 2.18. of this instruction any
time access requirements change.
5.10.7.2. Follow the GCCS-AF system user responsibilities IAW paragraph 2.19. of this
instruction when equipment custodians or GCCS-AF system operators change.
5.10.7.3. Based on deployed location tempo, the GCCS-AF system operator must develop a
routine procedure to backup information residing on the GCCS-AF system. Note: Recommend
a daily data backup of MANPER-B data on GCCS-AF systems.
5.10.7.4. Establish a deployed GCCS-AF system ITAMS account with the deployed or
supporting communications units.
5.10.8. PTs will provide personnel program advice to deployed commanders and limited support
to all deployed Airmen. Deployed Airmen are to be encouraged to use vMPF and the AFPC
Contact Center at DSN 665-5000 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to the fullest extent possible
where available.
5.11. Rotation and Redeployment Actions. The rotation and redeployment concepts apply to
onward or forward deployments as well as returns to home station. Logistics planners, on behalf
of the deployed commander, are responsible for coordinating and monitoring
rotation/redeployment/base closure activities. It is important to understand that redeployment is
not a "deployment in reverse." The PT will participate in the rotation/redeployment planning
process and ensure procedures are established to maintain accountability. A site or operation
may turn into a rotational (sustainment) site requiring planning on how to rotate or replace the
forces already there.
5.11.1. PTs will:
56                                                     AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

5.11.1.1. Actively participate in redeployment planning.
5.11.1.2. Out-process all redeployment personnel to maintain accountability.
5.11.1.3. Update the GCCS-AF system which updates DCAPES and send DSC report.
5.11.1.4. Properly dispose of administrative files IAW established procedures.
5.11.1.5. Transfer accountability IAW the component command A1 guidance or to the incoming
PT. This will include proper overlap with the incoming PT as determined by component
command.
5.11.2. Rotation and Redeployment Planning Factors.
5.11.2.1. During this phase, PTs can employ any approach that accomplishes the end objective
of Total Force accountability. A Redeployment Assistance Team (RAT) may be established to
facilitate redeployment. If not established, PTs must coordinate with all involved agencies to
develop an effective out-processing capability (i.e., consider host nation customs requirements,
Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs), force protection level, residual mission capability
requirements, and unit or main operating base out processing requirements).
5.11.2.2. PTs will need to project how they will scale down as the base draws down. Coordinate
these actions with the deployed commander and the component command A1 personnel planner.
5.11.3. Equipment Accountability.
5.11.3.1. Once the deployed location’s population reaches a certain level, the component
command may deactivate the PT. Coordinate with component commander personnel planner on
disposition of the GCCS-AF system and PT equipment.
5.11.3.2. During the transition from one team to another, equipment accountability must be
maintained. Before the original team departs from the deployed site, the GCCS-AF system
equipment custodian must complete an inventory of GCCS-AF equipment IAW AFCSM 10-626,
Volume 2. Note: The new PT chief ensures all equipment is accounted for before the old
equipment custodian departs.
5.11.3.3. For equipment not accounted for, the PT chief will take action to involuntarily extend
the GCCS-AF equipment custodian to enable the team chief or noncommissioned officer in
charge (NCOIC) to initiate a report of survey (ROS) and allows the investigating officer to
interview the custodian and obtain a sworn statement to complete the ROS actions.
5.12. Forward Deployment Process. Individuals or an entire UTC may be required to forward
deploy to support a tasking. This includes personnel on routine TDY orders (DD Form 1610)
who are selected to fill operational tasking, personnel who remain in place to fill and additional
rotation, those who remain in place to fill a different operational tasking or are medical evacuated
from your servicing location. This paragraph provides an overview of the processes utilized to
ensure forward deployed personnel are tracked, accounted for, processed, and that they receive
the authorized entitlements.
5.12.1. Personnel forward deploying within the same PID. The PT will ensure the following
procedures are accomplished.
5.12.1.1. The losing PT will utilize the forward deployment function within the PERSCO
module of the GCCS-AF system to update the new requirement information in DCAPES.
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                          57

5.12.2. Personnel transitioning from routine TDY to an operational PID requirement.
Individual TDY on routine orders, (DD Form 1610) (not on CED orders), and a TDY unit
commander requests the individual fill a PID requirement.
5.12.2.1. The TDY commander submits request to the home-station IPR via the servicing
PERSCO team for approval from the home-station commander.
5.12.2.2. If the home-station commander disapproves, the individual remains at the TDY
location and returns to home-station as scheduled.
5.12.2.3. If the home-station commander approves, the home-station IPR notifies the
servicing PT. The PT notifies the component and supporting command to coordinate the TPFDD
change.
5.12.2.4. The component command coordinates with AFPC/DPW to update the new tasked PAS.
AFPC/DPW flows the deployment data required (PID, ULN, etc.) to individual’s home-station
IPR. Component commands will identify tasked PAS and update DCAPES for those operations
not managed by AFPC/DPW.
5.12.2.5. The TDY IPR will coordinate with the home unit to rescind the original TDY order
(DD Form 1610) and accomplish the CED order to have the home station include the original
TDY information. CED orders should state when original TDY starts and ends, and identify the
fund cite to be used for each TDY. Note: ARC personnel must have status changed as required.
5.12.2.6. The home-station IPR must update DCAPES as appropriate and ensure all personnel
receive CED orders.
5.12.3. The home-station commander is tasked with a PID requirement and requests individuals
already on routine TDY orders to fill the requirement.
5.12.3.1. The home-station commander submits the request to the servicing PT via the home-
station IPR. The PT will coordinate action with the deployed commander.
5.12.3.2. If the individual’s TDY commander disapproves, the individual remains at the TDY
location and returns to home-station as scheduled.
5.12.3.3. If the TDY commander approves, the TDY IPR will coordinate with the home unit to
revoke the original TDY order (DD Form 1610) and accomplish the CED order to include the
original TDY information. CED orders should state when original TDY starts and ends, and
identify the fund cite to be used for each TDY.
5.12.3.4. The home-station IPR will update DCAPES as appropriate, and ensure all personnel
receive CED orders that include the routine TDY and contingency TDY.
5.12.4. The home-station commander is tasked with a PID requirement and requests members
already on CED orders to fill the requirement.
5.12.4.1. The home-station commander submits the request to the servicing PT via the home-
station IPR. The PT will coordinate action with the deployed commander.
5.12.4.2. If the deployed commander disapproves, the PT notifies the home-station IPR and the
unit member or UTC remains at the TDY location and returns to home-station as scheduled.
5.12.4.3. If the deployed commander approves, the PT forwards to the component and
supporting commands for approval.
58                                                    AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009

5.12.4.4. If either component or supporting command disapproves, individual remains at the
TDY location and returns to home-station as scheduled.
5.12.4.5. If both the component and supporting command approve the request, the home-station
IPR will amend the original CED orders to include the new deployment information. Note: In
situations where the individuals are moving from one component command to another, both
component commands and the supporting command must approve.
5.12.4.5.1. The IPR will return member to home-station on the day they are supposed to move to
the new requirement and then update them (with departure date) to the new requirement.
5.13. Reconstitution Actions. The PT’s mission is not complete upon return to home-station
until the following actions are performed.
5.13.1. After-Action Report (AAR). The PT chief must finalize and send a consolidated PT
AAR IAW paragraph 6.9 of this instruction. During the deployment tour, the team should have
maintained a daily events log, recording daily activities, problems, and resolutions to be used in
completing a comprehensive AAR. The AAR captures feedback to assist other PTs in future
operations. NOTE: AAR's are required to be submitted 15 days before departure from AOR.
5.13.2. Reconstitution of Supplies and Equipment. Conduct a complete inventory of supplies
and equipment to ensure everything is accounted for or replenished in the case of consumables.
The FSS commander will use the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) fund cites for reconstituting
supplies or equipment when supporting JCS-sponsored deployments or exercises.
5.13.3. Relocation Report. This report allows HQ AFPC and the PT’s parent MAJCOM
Personnel Readiness and GCCS Program Office to know the PT and equipment has been
returned from an operation and identifies its operating condition. The Relocation Report is
required within 7 duty days of return. The GCCS-AF equipment custodian inventories all
equipment, prepares and dispatches the GCCS-AF System Hardware Relocation Report IAW
paragraph 6.12. of this instruction.
5.13.4. Training. The most opportune time to review training and ensure its accuracy is after the
deployment. Deficiencies in training are readily identified via the daily events log or AAR. This
review can provide insight to rewriting portions of the training that lack realism. Upon
completion of MAJCOM-authorized “down time” after a deployment, PTs must initiate the
training cycle to maintain mission-ready status.

Section 5E—Combined/Joint Force Planning Factors

5.14. Combined/Joint operations. Deploying personnelists must be aware that they may be
tasked to fulfill a number of personnel functions, not PERSCO related. A team might deploy not
just as a PERSCO, but also as a combined, Joint, or a service personnel function. As a result,
they will be responsible for accomplishing not only their USAF tasks, but also combined or Joint
tasks as well. Although the tasks may be similar, the processes required to accomplish the tasks
can be significantly different in nature than that required by USAF instructions. It is important
for all deploying personnelists to familiarize themselves with JCS Pub 1. Contact the responsible
component command personnel planner for specific guidance.
5.14.1. Additional personnel functions may include:
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           59

5.14.1.1. A C1/J1/A1 may be tasked to perform accountability for all assigned forces under their
functional control; e.g., combatant commander identifies Commander, Air Force Forces
[COMAFFOR] as the C/JFACC. As a result, all combined air and space assets are now under
Operational Control [OPCON] to the new structure. Processes will need to be developed to
capture all assets now under their control, to include allied and Joint personnel.
5.14.1.2. The combatant commander will require a daily JPERSAT. C1/J1/A1s will be
responsible for compiling and transmitting this document per Joint component instructions. The
JPERSTAT at a minimum will identify losses, gains, overall strength (by unit and location) and
could include alpha rosters.
5.14.1.3. The combatant commander will identify additional casualty reporting criteria. As a
result, the C1/J1/A1 may not only need to provide casualty information via the USAF channels,
but must also provide similar data through their Joint channel. It is required on the JPERSTAT.
5.14.1.4. C1/J1/A1 will be required to submit daily SITREP inputs. This will include daily
strength changes by unit and director’s comments. Other requirements may be imposed per Joint
component direction.
5.14.1.5. C1/J1/A1 may be required to accomplish Services responsibilities not unlike a support
group function. This can include MWR activities and billeting/lodging actions.
5.14.1.6. C1/J1/A1 may be required to coordinate transportation of all departing personnel.
5.14.1.7. C1/J1/A1 may be required to perform postal duties.
5.14.1.8. If not the responsible PERSCO, the C1/J1/A1 must identify and establish a relationship
with the PT to provide accountability information.
5.14.1.9. C1/J1/A1 must understand that they may be responsible for all Joint and Service
decorations under their control. Decorations processing and tracking procedures must be devised
to meet all submission channel requirements. Joint decorations must be submitted through Joint
channels, and Service-unique decorations may be submitted through either combatant component
channels, or through the Service channels.
5.14.1.10. See AFCSM 10-626, Volume 2 for GCCS-AF system procedural guidance.

                                           Chapter 6
                                 CONTINGENCY REPORTS

Section 6A – Introduction and Scope
6.1. Introduction and Scope. This chapter outlines the responsibility and reporting
requirements for all levels of contingency operations.
6.1.1. From the onset of contingency operations, commanders and staffs at all levels require a
variety of personnel command and control information. Contingency reports provide an
uninterrupted flow of information between locations and each level of command.
6.1.2. Personnel agencies require contingency reports at all levels of command under both
automated and manual conditions. Use standardized reports to the maximum extent possible
according to this instruction.
Section 6B-Reporting Requirements and Guidance
6.2. Personnel Deployment Reporting System. Personnel agencies use GCCS-AF systems
utilizing DCAPES and/or MANPER-B software to report and account for personnel (active,
Guard, Reserve, and civilian) deployed by the Air Force to support a contingency, exercise, or
rotational operation (Duty Status Code 20 or 21). Note: This reporting requirement is
designated emergency status code C-1; continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority
precedence. Submit data requirements assigned to this category as prescribed, or by any means
to ensure arrival on the established due dates. Continue reporting during MINIMIZE.
6.2.1. The IPR updates DCAPES which flows to PT or FSS, the supporting and component
commands, HQ AFPC, the Central Site (if applicable), and others as directed by higher
headquarters.
6.3. Contingency Report Classification. The component command receiving support from all
the supporting agencies must provide definitive classification guidance. When the component
command fails to do so, treat the PID, operation nickname, ULN, GEOLOC, clear text duty
location, Required Delivery Date (RDD), TASK PAS, and ATCH PAS as classified data
elements until authorities instruct otherwise.
6.3.1.      Properly classify each paragraph by placing the classification code (U-
UNCLASSIFIED, C-CONFIDENTIAL, S-SECRET, or T-TOP SECRET) in parentheses at the
beginning of each paragraph. Do not do this if the message is unclassified. The highest
classification of any paragraph determines the classification of the entire report. For example,
the entire message is classified SECRET if one paragraph is classified SECRET. Equally
important, all messages classified as SECRET or higher must have declassification instructions
according to AFI 31-401, AFI 31-501, and AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official
Communications.
6.3.2. The reporting requirements described in this instruction are exempt from licensing in
accordance with AFI 33-324, paragraph 2.12.

6.4. Contingency Report Recipients. All reports described in this chapter must be addressed to
the recipients listed in report examples. All applicable e-mail addresses can be obtained from the
AFPC Readiness Points of Contact Book, available at:
AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           61

https://www.randolph.af.smil.mil/afpc/personnel_readiness. Due to frequent updates, everyone
is encouraged to check for updates to this listing on a regular basis. Any required changes will be
sent to: afpc.OSC@randolph.af.mil. This listing will be updated on a monthly basis; however,
during crisis operations, changes will be updated as they occur.

Section 6C - Types Of Contingency Reports

6.5. PT Status Report. The PT or FSS providing support to deployed forces submit this report.
PTs will submit this report within 12 hours of arrival at their final destination, and FSS/IPRs will
submit this report NLT 12 hours after an operation begins.
6.5.1. PT sends report as a word processing attachment via e-mail. If e-mail does not exist, the
PT contacts HQ AFPC/OSC by telephone (DSN 665-2020), data fax, or the quickest means
available; e.g., courier, FedEx, first-class mail, etc.
6.5.2. E-mail addresses for the report are as follows:
FROM: Deployed PERSCO TEAM
TO:    HQ AFPC/OSC; Component/Supported command Personnel Readiness Office
CC:    Home-Station IPR
               Supporting command Personnel Readiness Office
               AF/A1PR
               ARC as appropriate
6.5.3. For base exercises, the PT prepares but does not transmit the report.

NOTES:
1. The subject line is always unclassified.
2. Always use actual GEOLOC and classify message according to paragraph 6.3. of this
instruction. DO NOT USE XPQF as a TDY GEOLOC.
3. You may include the initial GCCS-AF System Report (see AFCSM 10-626, Volume 2) with
this report. If you elect to do so, include it as “PART IV-INITIAL GCCS-AF System
REPORT.”
4. As a reminder, ensure the Red-Mini login sheet, included in the Red-Mini User’s Guide, is
prepared and faxed to HQ AFPC/DPWRSF at DSN 665-3923.
6.6. Commander’s Situation Report (SITREP) (Joint Publication 1-03. Joint Reporting
Structure [JRS] General Instructions). Continue reporting during MINIMIZE. The installation
commander prepares and submits this report, which contains two personnel sections. PT submits
deployed personnel data as prescribed for inclusion in the commander’s daily SITREP. The PT
AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            63

must aggressively seek out the folks that prepare the SITREP and provide them the personnel
statistics for the report. It’s critical the personnel numbers reported in the SITREP agree with the
strength accountability numbers being reported through the personnel community as they come
together at the Joint Staff.
6.6.1. Section One includes summary information (the total officers, enlisted, civilians, and
contractors employed) on personnel deployed (to include in-place forces) supporting the
contingency operation. Note: The commander is required to submit summary information only
if no mechanized reporting system is available, (e.g., GCCS system and SIPRNET connectivity)
or if it is non-operational at the deployed location.
6.6.2. Section Two lists existing personnel problems and LIMFACs affecting Total Force
accountability and their impact to the deployed site’s readiness posture or mission capability
(outlines problems degrading the mission capability of a PT or FSS). For LIMFACs, provide an
expected “get-well” date, if known. Note: LIMFACs are considered classified and must be
handled accordingly.
6.7. Duty Status Change (DSC) Report. PTs use this report to identify force status changes
(e.g., arrivals, departures [to home station and forward deployments], TDY duty status changes,
and strength figures). The information provided in this report is necessary in order to monitor
the initial build-up of forces and continues until the deployed site is deactivated.
6.7.1. This report will be initiated within 24 hours after the PT’s arrival for all contingencies and
on an “as-directed” basis for exercises. Personnel agencies send this report by 2400 hours local
on the day the DSC occurs.
6.7.2. HQ USAF or the component command may direct more frequent reporting.
6.7.3. The component command may add additional data elements.
6.7.4.   E-mail addresses for the report are as follows:
FROM: DEPLOYED PERSCO TEAM
TO: Home-Station IPR for all personnel on DSC Report.
          Component/Supported command
CC: HQ AFPC/OSC

6.10. Delayed Reporting Request/Notification. This request is utilized by the deployed
location for an individual to arrive in the AOR after their established RDD. It is submitted after
members are selected to fill a requirement and circumstances do not allow personnel to arrive
prior to or on the established RDD (e.g., airlift not available, IPR receives plan requirement with
short notice or after the established RDD). Note: If airlift is unavailable, the request is utilized
by the gaining location as notification of the late arrival. Also, if the requirement was received
after the RDD, the request is utilized by the gaining location as notification of the late arrival.
Certain circumstances occur that cause a delay in reporting to be unavoidable. For delayed
reporting requests:
6.10.1. The IPR submits this request as soon as it is identified that the individual will not be able
to make their RDD.
6.10.2. The request is submitted to the gaining PT for coordination with the gaining commander,
with copies to the supporting and supported commands, and the IDO.
6.10.2.1. If the deployed commander approves the request, the PT will notify the tasked
commander via IPR, courtesy copying the supporting MAJCOM, the component command and
the IHQ if established. The IPR will include a hard copy of the approval with the other hand-
carried items upon out-processing.
6.10.2.2. If the deployed commander disapproves the request, the IPR will ensure the individual
is in place prior to or on the established RDD.
6.10.3. Figure 6.4. provides an example of a Delayed Reporting Request/Notification. This
report may be sent as a word processing document attached to an e-mail.

                                           Chapter 7

          CONTINGENCY, EXERCISE, AND DEPLOYMENT (CED) ORDERS
7.1. Administrative Orders. This chapter establishes procedures and provides guidance for
preparation, issuance, numbering, funding, authentication, distribution, and maintenance of CED
orders. Only Personnel Readiness Flights or designated individuals on an activated PDF are
authorized to publish CED orders.
7.1.1. CED orders published by the IPR are the only type of orders authorized for deployment of
Air Force personnel assigned to Air Force units in support of contingency, humanitarian or
disaster relief operations or CJCS or Command exercises that require a TPFDD.
7.1.2. Use of the computer-generated CED orders in lieu of the DD Form 1610 is authorized
according to AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders.
7.1.3. Information appearing on computer-generated CED orders must comply with guidelines
outlined in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) and Joint Travel Regulation (JTR).
7.2. General Information:
7.2.1. MAJCOMs, through the IPR, use CED orders to direct the validated TPFDD deployment
of active, Air Reserve Component, and federal civilian personnel to a specific location in a
theater of operation during contingency, wartime, exercise, and emergency operations. The IPR
or PDF (as applicable) prepares, verifies, and authenticates CED orders. IPRs can not issue CED
orders on personnel the servicing MPF does not have administrative control over (e.g., active
duty IPRs cannot issue CED orders on ARC personnel). See Attachment 2 for CED orders
issuance on IMAs. PERSCO teams will not issue CED orders.
7.2.1.1. Do not authenticate CED orders for local exercises where movement is simulated.
7.2.1.2. Generate NATO orders to fulfill treaty requirements (see paragraph 7.5.3).
7.2.1.3. For DCAPES-generated NATO orders, refer to AFI 65-103, paragraph 2.7. Use AF
Form 1631, NATO Travel Order/Ordre De Mission OTAN, when the DCAPES system is not
operational.
7.2.2. TDY is defined in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), Volume 1, Appendix A,
and Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), Volume 2, Appendix A. Both regulations limit TDY at any
one location to no more than 180 consecutive days (JFTR, Volume 1, para U2145 and JTR,
Volume 2, para C4430). Exceptions must be approved by appropriate authority. The
appropriate authority for authorizing/approving TDY assignments in excess of 179 consecutive
days at any one location is the Secretary of the Service concerned, the chief of an appropriate
bureau or staff agency specifically designated for that purpose or the commander/deputy
commander of a combatant command (Ref JFTR, Volume 1, para U2145B). Route requests for
exceptions through the local military personnel flight (MPF) IAW AFI 36-2110. Note:
JTR/JFTR paragraph references preceded by a “C” refer to federal civilians. Those preceded
with “U” refer to military personnel.
7.2.3. Authentication. This is the process that makes administrative orders official.
Authentication takes place when the signatures of the approving official (AO) (or authorized
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             77

stamp in lieu of signature) and the fund certifying official and the travel order number are placed
on the travel order.
7.2.4. Effective date. This is the date the orders go into effect, usually the date shown in the
orders for travel to begin.
7.2.5. The FSS commander appoints an orders-issuing or approving official for CED orders in
writing. This official must sign manually prepared orders; however, computer-generated orders
do not need to be signed as long as adequate controls are in place to ensure proper approval
before orders are authenticated.
7.2.6. IPR or PDF must cite an authority on all orders. List the appropriate authority (Operation
Order (OPORD), OPLAN, letter, message, levy flow, etc.) directing the deployment or exercise.
7.2.7. All CED orders will be series “TE.”
7.2.8. Information required to identify personnel.
7.2.8.1. Identify personnel by grade, name, and SSN. The name and grade must be in upper case
letters.
7.2.8.1.1. When two or more people are on the same orders, the IPR or the PDF prepares two
sets of orders. This is automatic for DCAPES-generated orders; however, when using DD Form
1610, you must prepare two sets of orders.
7.2.8.1.1.1. Block out the first five digits of the SSN on one order and leave the complete SSN
on the other order.
7.2.8.1.1.2. Deploying personnel receive orders with first five digits of the SSN suppressed.
7.2.8.1.1.3. Agencies receiving orders with complete SSNs are financial services offices, MTFs
and air passenger terminals (APTs) (during deployment operations), IDOs, IPRs, PDFs, and
troop commanders.
7.2.8.1.1.4. Other base agencies with an established need for copies of orders with complete
SSNs in order to perform official duties may obtain the information IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy
Act Program. Submit requests to the FSS commander for approval. Include a list of agencies
approved to receive CED orders with complete SSNs in a supplement to this instruction. FSSs
will keep these letters on file and verify requirements annually.
7.2.8.2. Show the eight-digit PAS code for the unit and major command of assignment.
7.2.8.3. Grade for Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) agents will always be “99-
UNK.”
7.2.9. Do not issue verbal orders unless absolutely necessary. Verbal orders are authorized only
when time or error prevented written orders from being published in advance of travel. Confirm
verbal orders (in writing) as soon as possible. Include in the written orders the date and who
issued the verbal orders along with a statement on why written orders were not issued earlier.
For example, “The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances
prevented written orders in advance.” On composed orders, include this in the Remarks block.
7.2.10. Changes to Orders/Amendments, Rescissions, and Revocations. To amend, rescind, or
revoke CED orders, use a composed amendment (DCAPES generated) or an AF Form 973,
Request and Authorization for Change of Administrative Orders. Publish amendments,
78                                                     AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009

rescissions, and revocations in the “TE” series. Do not use blanket statements such as “previous
orders are rescinded” or “this order supersedes all previously published orders.”
7.2.10.1. Orders may be amended, rescinded, or revoked only by the organization publishing the
original orders.
7.2.10.2. Publish an amendment to add, delete, or change pertinent data to read as originally
intended. Correct inaccurate first or middle names and initials and other personal data when
required for an individual to enter a foreign country. Add or change a travel advance payment
statement or to authorize leave outside the local area prior to or after deployment.
7.2.10.3. Do not publish an amendment to delete an individual, to rescind or revoke in part the
original orders pertaining to the person, or to change an effective date after it has passed. Revoke
or rescind an expired order and publish a new order (see below for guidance on revoking versus
rescinding). Do not publish an amendment to include leave taken in the local area prior to or
after deployment. Note: Document through normal channels as if the individual was not
deployed. Also, after the individual has departed home station, do not amend orders to include
leave en route when authorized. A message or e-mail from the member’s unit authorizing the
leave is sufficient. It should be kept on the member while in leave status and filed with the travel
voucher.
7.2.10.4. Rescind an order when some action has been taken on the published order, such as
issuance of airline tickets or issuance or receipt of a travel advance.
7.2.10.5. Revoke an order when no action occurs against the original order such as before it
has gone into effect. If an effective date has passed and no action has occurred, revoke the
original order and publish a new order. The orders approving official determines when to
revoke “TE” series orders.
7.2.10.6. Retroactive amendments to increase or decrease the amount of money due the traveler
must be fully explained and justified. Written requests for such amendments must clearly show
the original order was unclear, incomplete, or lacked necessary information. Order-publishing
agencies should look carefully at any request for such amendments to make sure the amendment
and the reasons given agree with the comptroller general’s decision. The circumstances
permitting an amendment to authorize additional payment are rare; thus, claims based on
previous approvals are seldom allowed. Instead, travel claims should be re-submitted with
amended orders and a statement of facts and circumstances. Civilian employees should re-
submit the travel claim to the General Services Administration (GSA). Military personnel should
re-submit claims to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. All re-submitted claims will be
submitted through the base Financial Services Office.
7.2.10.7. If an order is revoked or rescinded and replaced immediately by new orders; the new
orders may also announce the revocation or rescission. Include this statement (upper case letters)
as the last paragraph in the remarks section: “THIS ORDER REVOKES OR RESCINDS
(specify which) (ORDER NUMBER AND DATE).”
7.2.10.8. Once revoked, an order no longer exists as an official document. Once rescinded,
although still an official document, it can no longer be used. Do not revoke a revocation or
rescission; instead, publish a new order.
7.2.11. You may reproduce any order, or portion of it, as a true copy or a true extract copy.
Include the same heading and close as the original orders and the statement “A TRUE COPY”
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         79

or “A TRUE EXTRACT COPY.” In a true extract copy, include only the required
information. For example, if a paragraph is on several individuals, include only the name of
the one for whom you need a copy. Use asterisks to indicate omitted material. Any officer or
other individual authorized to authenticate orders may authenticate true copies or true extract
copies.
7.2.12. Ensure DCAPES-generated orders meet the criteria in AFI 33-328, Administrative
Orders. For information on length of orders, continuation lines, paper size, margins, and
numbering, refer to AFI 33-328.
7.2.13. Reproduction of CED orders is the responsibility of the orders-issuing official. The IPR
or PDF (as applicable) prepares, verifies, and authenticates CED orders. The IPR or PDF
distributes CED orders to deploying personnel, other deployment work centers, other base
agencies (see local base supplement to AFI 33-328), and the financial services office (FSO).
Note: For local exercises not involving actual deployment of personnel, do not reproduce copies
for members.
7.2.14. Air Force military and civilian personnel are not placed on funded TDY at any one
location for more than 179 days (except when approved in advance by the SAF according to AFI
36-2110 or as provided in the JTR, Vol 2, para C4430.). Note: Does not apply to ARC
personnel.
7.2.15. The IPR or PDF uses the DCAPES orders program to prepare CED orders, or DD Form
1610 when DCAPES is not operational. Include the following data elements: ULN (including
FRAG and insert codes), ULN position, deployed AFSC, deployed unit PAS code, and line
remarks (if necessary). Note: These data elements will not be data masked. PERSCO requires
this information to perform proper accountability.
7.2.16. Assumptions:
7.2.16.1. The Air Force considers all deployed personnel to be “performing duty on a military
installation.” Exception: Deployment guidance from the supporting or component command
states otherwise.
7.2.16.2. CED orders specify group travel status if any portion of travel occurs under the “group
travel” conditions set forth in the JFTR. Also, all personnel on the orders must meet these
conditions.
7.2.16.3. Temporary change-of-station weight allowance (JFTR, Volume 1, U4705) may be
authorized or approved by the orders issuing official or the member’s commanding officer.
7.2.17. Special authorizations add to the cost of normal travel. Special authorizations are
approved to accomplish a mission. Note: Do not include special authorizations on CED orders
without written approval.
7.2.17.1. Personnel may not include special authorizations on CED orders for JCS-directed
contingency operations without approval. These operations include rotational deployments, JCS
field-training exercises, and emergency operations such as natural disasters. Exception:
Deployment guidance from the component command states otherwise.
7.2.17.2. Personnel sends requests for special authorizations not included in deployment
guidance to the deployed PERSCO Team with information to component command for approval.
80                                                     AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009

7.2.17.3. The individual requesting the special authorization must show an advantage to the
government or a need for mission accomplishment.
7.2.17.4. The unit commander may recommend approval of all requests.
7.2.17.5. Unit commanders may approve excess baggage for professional equipment a member
needs for a mission. The commander notifies the IPR or PDF in writing for excess baggage
approval, specifying the type of equipment (e.g., tool box), number of pieces, and total weight.
Note: The IPR or PDF will include this information in the CED orders.
7.2.17.5.1. For deployment equipment required by deployment guidance, members and
commanders do not need to justify excess baggage.
7.2.17.5.2. For travel in a POV, personnel follow the guidance contained in the JFTR.
7.3. Responsibilities of the Orders Issuing or Approving Official:
7.3.1. Direct the use of government-procured transportation when appropriate. When directing
government-procured transportation, strictly adhere to the following guidelines.
7.3.1.1. When government-funded travel will be arranged by the Transportation Management
Flight (TMF), the orders will contain this statement: “Government-procured transportation
directed, report to TMF ASAP.” This is required except when authorized travel by POV or
special conveyance as more advantageous to the government.
7.3.1.2. When a specific mode of travel (e.g., military air) is directed in the orders or when
travelers are authorized to use their POV or to personally procure commercial transportation as
“not advantageous” to the government, it will be necessary to coordinate with TMF to obtain the
lowest fare available with a transportation request. Include the cost on the travel orders to
determine the amount to reimburse the traveler.
7.3.2. Additional information for orders-issuing officials:
7.3.2.1. Provide written authorization for persons to escort or hand-carry classified information.
7.3.2.2. Approve requests to hand-carry classified information within the United States, its
territories, and Canada.
7.3.2.3. Identify personnel on the orders hand-carrying classified material outside the United
States, its territories, and Canada when travel is on government-owned, controlled, or on
chartered aircraft. Note: The unit commander trains, briefs, and designates in writing classified
couriers IAW AFI 31-401.
7.3.2.4. Take full responsibility and can answer for approval of special authorizations.
7.3.3. Include the FSO travel advance eligibility statement as prescribed by table 7.2, rule 1 of
this instruction.
7.3.4. Annotate orders of individuals traveling TDY to designated high-threat areas to reflect
compliance with the DoD Travel Security Policy. Refer to the Foreign Clearance Guide or
contact the local anti-terrorism representative or an AFOSI detachment to determine current
high-threat areas. Compliance with the policy requires individuals to travel by AMC air or AMC
charter to the maximum extent possible, receive briefings on the availability and use of fee
passports by the local passport agent, and receive briefings on the terrorist threat and suggested
personal travel precautions by designated local officials prior to travel.
AFI 36-3802         23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           81

7.3.5. The Commercial Ticket Program (CTP). Use of this program is authorized only by
USTRANSCOM and only for CJCS exercises. See AFI 10-204, paragraph 8.2 for additional
information. Authorization for individual unit line numbers to use this program for either
deployment, redeployment or both can be viewed only through the Single Mobility System via
the Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). Also refer to Table 7.3.
7.3.6. The POV Storage Program allows individuals, if authorized, to store their POVs while
deployed to support contingency operations (ref JFTR Vol 1, Chap 5, Part E). If authorized, the
member must contact the TMF for arrangements to store the vehicle. Refer to Table 7.2., rule 31
for the statement to be included on the CED orders.
7.4. Preparing the DCAPES-Generated CED Orders. Use the following information to
complete DCAPES-generated CED orders.
7.4.1. HEADING. For the publishing headquarters, include DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR
FORCE; the complete unit designation (clear text); the name of the major command of
assignment (abbreviated in parentheses); and the complete mailing address. Do not postdate or
predate. An example is shown in Figure 7.1.

Figure 7.1. Sample Heading CED Order.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
12th FORCE SUPPORT SQUADRON (AETC)
550 D Street East Suite 3
RANDOLPH AFB TX 78150-4429

7.4.2. SPECIAL ORDER NUMBER. Enter “TE” followed by the order number. Number order
starting with number “TE-001” for each fiscal year (FY). Cite above the heading of the first
order of a year, the number of the last order published the previous year; “SO TE-<Enter the last
FY order series number>, <Enter orders issuing squadron>, was the last of the series at the end of
FY <Enter last two digits of the previous fiscal year>.” Example: “SO-TE-1297, 12th Force
Support Squadron, was the last of the series at the end of FY99.”
7.4.3. PURPOSE. DCAPES automatically publishes “Special Mission Travel (MSN)” and the
statement “Participate in” on the orders. Do not include the name of the operation or exercise
(e.g., “Operation SEA SIGNAL”) unless the AOR reporting instructions state otherwise. Orders
for other than Secretary of Defense (SecDef) designated contingencies should not contain any
reference to “contingencies” in this block of the orders. Do not enter the PID unless the AOR
reporting instructions state otherwise. If the TDY is in connection with field duties, put in “field
duty.” In the REMARKS area include: “The inclusive dates of field duty are from (date) to
(date).” Note: See AOR reporting instructions for specific classification guidance on data
elements such as operation name and PID.
7.4.4. PROCEED ON OR ABOUT (O/A) DATE. Enter the date, in YYYYMMDD format, the
deploying personnel will leave home station. DCAPES translates numerical data into day,
month, and year format. The on or about date is valid for 7 days before or after date shown, as
long as the traveler does not depart before the date the order is authenticated. Note: Member

Terms

Advanced Echelon (ADVON)--A team of airlift control element members deployed in advance
of the main airlift control element to coordinate requirements at the arrival airfield. The
ADVON may deploy equipment to establish communications with command and control
agencies and to establish the airlift operations center before the main airlift control element
arrives.
Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF)--The USAF methodology for organizing, training,
equipping and sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet the defense strategy
requirements. Through the AEF, the AF supports defense strategy requirements using a
combination of both permanently assigned and rotational forces. The AF organizes Air and
Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETF) to meet defense strategy requirements using both
CONUS-based and forward-stationed units. AETFs are capability based to generate desired
effects and sized to meet the mission. AETFs are assigned or attached to a combatant
commander through the Joint allocation scheduling process, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan
(JSCP), Forces for Combatant Commanders Memorandum or Deployment Order (DEPORD).
Assigned Forces--Forces under the component command or operational control of a
commander.
Bed down--Location where a unit or force is employed.
Casualty--Any person lost to the organization by reason of having been declared dead, duty
status-whereabouts unknown, missing, ill, or injured (Joint Pub 1-02) (AFI 36-3002).
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           105

Normally a Joint force is organized with a combination of Service and functional components.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)--(DoD) A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of
a commander’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The
concept of operations frequently is embodied in campaign plans and operation plans, in the latter
case, particularly when the plans cover a series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
operation. It is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose; it is also called a
commander’s concept.
Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES)--The Air Force
standard automated data processing subsystem of the Joint Operation Planning and Execution
System (JOPES), which is used by operations, logistics, manpower and personnel planners at all
command levels to develop and maintain force packages and task requirements for OPLAN
TPFDD.

requirements and unit tasking for a contingency or exercise deployment.
Designed Operational Capability (DOC)--A mission for which a measured unit has been
equipped, organized, designed, tasked, and trained.
Employment Requirements Manning Document (ERMD)--A product providing total
manpower requirements to be employed at a TDY location.
En-Route Personnel--Military member, DoD civilian, or DoD contractor who has departed
home station and not arrived at the deployed location, or who has departed the deployed location
and has not arrived at final destination.
Force Accountability--The ability to accurately account for all Air Force personnel and the
related Air Force manpower requirements at all times regardless of their location.
Force Module (FM)--A force module is a planning and execution tool that provides a means of
logically grouping records, which facilitates planning, analysis and monitoring. Force modules
may include both forces and sustainment.
Forward Deployment--The transfer of a unit, an individual, or supplies deployed in one area to
another area, or to another location within the area, or to the zone of interior for the purpose of
further employment.
Fragmentation Code (FRAG)--A one-character code, the second of three parts of a unit line
number (ULN). Used to uniquely identify subordinate units, fragmentations (FRAG), or
increments of a single force requirement. If a single unit satisfies a force requirement, leave the
FRAG code blank. When more than one unit is needed to satisfy the requirement, each unit is
assigned a separate FRAG.
106                                                     AFI 36-3802          23 FEBRUARY 2009

Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES)--A system utilized by transportation
to manifest passengers on dedicated military/commercial airlift. Provides the ability to track
individuals by name, SSN, and ULN from the time they depart home station until arrival at their
final destination. Can provide the status of aircraft delays or layovers that will assist PERSCO
teams in the overall accountability effort.
Global Command and Control System (GCCS)--(DoD) Highly mobile, deployable command

programs and data files at remote locations, update and transfer files remotely, send messages
and already-formatted data, and teleconference.
Global Transportation Network (GTN)--(DoD) The designated Department of Defense (DoD
in-transit visibility system, providing customers with the ability to track the identity, status, and
location of DoD units and non-unit cargo, passengers, patients, forces, and military and
commercial airlift, sealift, and surface assets from origin to destination across the range of
military operations. The GTN collects, integrates, and distributes transportation information to
component commanders, Services, and other DoD customers. The GTN provides the US
Transportation Command with the ability to perform command and control operations, planning
and analysis, and business operations in tailoring customer requirements throughout the
requirements process.
Installation Deployment Officer (IDO)--The individual acting for the installation commander
in the overall direction and control of deployments from a base.
Limiting Factor (LIMFAC)--A factor or condition that either temporarily or permanently
impedes mission accomplishment (e.g., transportation network deficiencies, lack of in-place
facilities, malpositioned forces or materiel, extreme climatic conditions, distance, transit or
overflight rights, political conditions, etc. [Joint Pub 1-02]).

statement of standard Air Force unit type codes (UTCs).
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) System--A data system designed to
support contingency and general war planning with predefined and standardized manpower and
equipment force packages. MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment,
is composed of two subsystems: the MANFOR and the LOGFOR.
Mini-record--A small (approximately 200 characters) individual data record used for tracking
and management of individuals who are deployed for manning assistance, exercise, rotational,
and contingency purposes. Data in the record is updated as changes and corrections occur. The
mini-record is generated by the GCCS system when an individual departs, or is projected to
depart for a deployment.
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           107

MINIMIZE-- A procedure used during periods of crisis or other abnormal periods to reduce the
volume of record and long distance telephone traffic ordinarily transmitted electrically.
MINIMIZE applies to all users of DoD communications systems, including originators of card
and tape traffic. When MINIMIZE is imposed, users of DoD electrical communications must
determine that: (1) the information to be sent is required to avoid a seriously detrimental impact
on mission accomplishment or safety of life; and (2) electrical transmission is the only way to get
the information to the addressee in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose.
Mission Capability (MISCAP)--A short paragraph that describes the capability a specific unit
type code is expected to have at execution. The statement usually contains pertinent information
such as the type of base to be deployed to, the functions included, and other augmentation
requirements necessary to conduct specific missions.

the Department of Defense, or other appropriate authority whereby noncombatants are evacuated
from areas of danger overseas to safe havens or to the United States.
Official Notification Date--The actual day the individual receives verbal or written, formal or
informal notification by an official in authority of their potential or actual selection for
contingency deployment as either a primary or alternate selectee. Examples: Official
notification occurs when the unit commander or designated representative verbally tells the
individual they are being considered to fill a contingency tasking. Written notification with
endorsement by the individual serves the same purpose. The first time an individual is made
aware they possibly will deploy, they have received “official” notification and should begin
preparations, both mental and physical, for deployment.
Operation Order (OPORD)--A directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders
for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation (Joint Pub 1-02).
Operation Plan (OPLAN)--Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operation Plan, for the
conduct of military operations. Plans are prepared by component commands in response to
requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of
subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified
commander. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to execute the combatant
commander strategic concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the theater of
operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD files.
Plan Identification Number (PID)--A command-unique four-digit number followed by a suffix
indicating the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) year for which the plan is written; e.g.,
“2220-95.” In the JOPES database, a five-digit number representing the command-unique four-
digit identifier, followed by a one-character, alphabetic suffix indicating the OPLAN option, or a
one-digit number whose numeric value indicates the JSCP year for which the plan is written.
Reclama--A request to duly constituted authority to reconsider its decision or its proposed
action.
Replacements--Personnel required to take the place of others who depart a unit (Joint Pub 1-02).
Required Delivery Date (RDD)--The date that a unit must arrive at its destination and complete
unloading (Joint Pub 1-02).
108                                                     AFI 36-3802          23 FEBRUARY 2009

Shortfall--The lack of forces, equipment, personnel, materiel, or capability, reflected as the
difference between the resources identified as a plan requirement and those apportioned to a
component commander for planning that would adversely affect the command’s ability to
accomplish its mission. (Joint Pub 1-02).
Supported Command--The command having primary responsibility for all aspects of a task
assigned by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan or other Joint operation planning authority. In
the context of Joint operation planning, this term refers to the commander who prepares
operation plans or operation orders in response to requirements of the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. The supported command receives assistance from another commander’s force or
capabilities, and is responsible for ensuring that the supporting commander understands the
assistance required.
Supporting Command--The command that provides augmentation forces or other support to a
supported commander or who develops a supporting plan. Includes the designated combatant
commands and Defense agencies as appropriate. The supporting command aids, protects,
complements, or sustains another commander’s force, and is responsible for providing the
assistance required by the supported commander.
Tanker Airlift Control Element (TALCE)--A mobile command and control organization
deployed to support strategic and theater air mobility operations at fixed, en route, and deployed
locations where air mobility operational support is nonexistent or insufficient. The TALCE
provides on-site management of air mobility operations to include command and control,
communications, aerial port services, maintenance, security, transportation, weather,
intelligence, and other support functions, as necessary.
Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD)--The JOPES database portion of an
OPLAN; it contains non-unit-related cargo and personnel data, and movement data for the
OPLAN, including (a) in-place units, (b) units to be deployed to support the OPLAN with a
priority indicating the desired sequence for their arrival at the port of debarkation, (c) routing of
forces to be deployed, (d) movement data associated with deploying forces, (e) estimates of non-
unit-related cargo and personnel movements to be conducted concurrently with the deployment
of forces, and (f) estimate of transportation requirements that must be fulfilled by common-user
lift resources as well as those requirements that can be fulfilled by assigned or attached
transportation resources.
Transient Personnel-- Military member, DoD civilian, or DoD contractor who spend at least
one night at a location but their final duty location is elsewhere.
Unit Line Number (ULN)--A seven-character, alphanumeric code that describes a unique
increment of a unit deployment; i.e., advance party, main body, equipment by sea and air,
reception team, or tail party, in Joint Operation Planning and Execution System time-phased
force and deployment data. (JP 1-02).
Unit Type Code (UTC)--A Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, consisting of five
characters that uniquely identify a “type unit.” (JP 1-02).
War Planning and Execution Integrated Process Team (WPIPT)--The lead entity
formulating the policy, process, and organization of War Planning and Execution process.
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)--The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic

                                Attachment 2

      UTILIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL RESERVISTS (IR)

A2.1. General Information:
A2.1.1. To comply with Joint reporting requirements, GCCS systems will be used to track and
account for all IRs on active duty orders in direct support of a contingency operation.
A2.1.1.1. Direct support personnel are those assigned against a valid plan tasking in the area of
responsibility (AOR). All members supporting operation requirements in an AOR must be
against a valid ULN and on CED orders to ensure accountability and member entitlements.
A2.1.1.2. Indirect support personnel are those backfilling positions not in the AOR and not
supported by AEF MPA man-days. Funding comes from each applicable MAJCOM.
A2.2. For indirect support and once all active duty resources are exhausted (with the approval of
the member’s commander, the member’s RMG Program Manager, HQ USAF/A1PR, and
AFRC/A3M), AFPC/DPW builds the IR requirement into the TPFDD. AFRC/A3M validates the
requirement in DCAPES and pushes the tasking to the RMG for processing IAW Attachment 2.
A2.3. Upon receipt, HQ ARPC flows the mini-record to the base where the IR deployed and
publishes CED orders.
A2.4. The “Tasked PAS” in DCAPES will always reflect “963IF1Z2” or a new PAS identified
by HQ AFPC to ensure RMG has accountability of all deployed IRs. Note: The “Attached
PAS” is determined by where the IR is deployed to. If deployed to a base “not owned” by the
command using the IR, the attached PAS will be the PAS of the command’s headquarters.
Example: HQ AETC requires an IR at Brooks AFB TX; the attached PAS will be BV0JFGTW
(Brooks AFB MPF ID and HQ AETC MAJCOM ID). Note: This ensures the command and
base using the IR receive appropriate DCAPES updates and can account for all activated IRs.
A2.5. The GEOLOC will reflect the base where the IR is being deployed (indirect support) or
out-processed if being further deployed (direct support). This ensures the base receiving the IR
receives advance notice of their arrival.
A2.6. AFRC/A3M will ensure DCAPES requirements are valid taskings and will act as liaison
between the RMG and the supporting command.
A2.7. HQ RMG will produce CED orders for IRs deployed for a contingency operation. HQ
RMG will update DCAPES with appropriate personnel identification and travel itinerary
information. Individual reservists deployed for indirect support will not be further deployed
without AFRC/A3M approval. Prior to approval AFRC/A3M will coordinate with RMG to
ensure member meets eligibility, Readiness requirements and ensures accountability. The
message will include PID and ULN, central site MPF ID, attached PAS, reporting instructions,
and other information the FSS may require to redeploy the IR to a new location.
A2.8. FSS IPR will:
A2.8.1. In-process IRs who are deployed for direct or indirect support of a contingency
operation. RMG will distribute orders to the FSS/ IPR. Using the personnel identification and
travel itinerary message and mini-record received from HQ ARPC, confirm the IR’s arrival in
AFI 36-3802        23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                         111

DCAPES by updating an arrival transaction in the PERSCO module. Note: Should an IR arrive
prior to receipt of the message or mini-record, contact HQ RMG immediately before
accomplishing any DCAPES updates.
A2.8.2. All IRs selected for a contingency operation in direct support regardless of present
location (Continental United States [CONUS] or overseas) will report to an Air Force installation
before deploying to the AOR. Note: IRs WILL NOT deploy to the AOR without CED orders.
IRs must process through the active duty PDF or IPR to ensure immunizations, personal, and
equipment requirements are completed. The IPR will distribute the CED order to Individual
Reservists only after they complete all out-processing requirements including deployment
availability verification, pre-deployment training, equipment issue etc.

                   SAMPLE PT RESPONSIBILITIES MEMORANDUM

A5.1. The following sample in Figure A5.1 provides a foundation to inform deployed
commanders of PERSCO responsibilities and capabilities. Because each operation and
deployment is different, this memorandum is not all-inclusive and must be tailored upon
arrival at the deployed location.

Figure A5.1. PT Responsibilities Memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPLOYED COMMANDERS

FROM: PERSCO TEAM CHIEF

SUBJECT: Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) Responsibilities
1. A PERSCO team is employed at your location and available to assist you and your personnel
on a 24-hour basis. Our capabilities include: Total Force personnel accountability, strength
reporting, force management, casualty reporting (if you are at a main operating base that has a
servicing MPF, they will report casualties and provide personnel program support. Their number
is__________). Personnel program support will be limited until we are augmented by other
PERSCO team UTCs specifically trained and equipped for providing personnel program support.
2. Total Force accountability consists of Air Force active duty, Air Reserve Component,
Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilians, and Air Force contractors deployed to our location
and geographically separated locations we are responsible for. The accountability scope can be
expanded by the combatant commander or the component command to include other Services,
Allied Forces, or other personnel. To achieve this goal, we will coordinate with other deployed
agencies to capture information on arriving and departing personnel. We need your help to
ensure your key personnel are aware of the significant role PERSCO plays and the importance of
notifying us of any changes to your unit personnel (e.g., gains, losses, or changing duty status
conditions). We ask that you designate one person from your unit to act as a unit manning
representative who will provide us with this information as it occurs.
3. We will keep you aware of the personnel strength supporting your mission. We will also
report daily personnel strength to the Air Staff, Air Force Personnel Center, and the MAJCOMs
who, in turn, report to senior military and civilian leadership.
4. We have the Employment Requirements Manning Document (ERMD) to help you manage
your forces. We will help you process and track requests for additional forces as well as identify
unfilled requirements to the component command. If personnel need to be sent home
prematurely, we will work with you to obtain a replacement if necessary.
5. We have established a casualty reporting program, and we will prepare the necessary reports
ensuring the next of kin are notified promptly and accurately. Please have your key personnel
contact us immediately if a casualty occurs (including injury, illness, hospitalization, missing or
captured, as well as death).

Figure A5.1. PT Responsibilities Memorandum.


6. Our capability to support routine personnel programs depends on our communication
capabilities. Items we can normally support are:
   a. vRed changes.
      b. SGLI changes.
      c. Separation or retirement applications (until STOP LOSS is implemented).
      d. Limited promotion release actions.
    e. Processing emergency leave orders for units without a deployed commander’s support
staff.
7. Other personnel services will not be denied; however, they will be acted upon as time permits
during build-up or any augmentation surge phase. This memorandum will be supplemented if
and when other teams arrive and our mission capability expands.
8. If my team can be of any assistance, please contact us at extension___________. We are
located in building_______, room ________.

2. This briefly states the mission and general support personnel provides in mission support of
the OPLAN or tasking. The component command should use this area to identify unique
reporting requirements, designate supporting PTs for geographically separated locations, and
designated intermediate levels of command.
3. Assumptions are items such as STOP LOSS, an inherent part of the activation tasking.
Assumptions listed influence the feasibility of Annex E.
4. This identifies the tasks and responsibilities a PT is expected to maintain in order to support
the OPLAN or tasking. These should be the generic tasks expected of all PTs.
5. This should tell you how to request backfills for personnel that have departed or request
individual augmentation.
6. Ensure the tasking command actively works any LIMFACs.
7. All known communications requirements for PTs should be listed in the OPLAN.
Communications support is essential for accessing the Red-Mini and dispatching messages, the
DSN voice is a must. Without reach-back capability, the service provided to the deployed
location is severely degraded or causes failure.
8. For missing/broken GCCS-AF equipment, notify HQ AFPC/DPWRSF ASAP.
9. Access to the Red-Mini enables the receipt of mini-records on inbound forces or plan
requirements for the locations you support. Using the tasking information, you can prepare the
Log-in sheet request; upon execution, have the tasked personnel sign the request, have the unit
security manager validate the security clearances, and fax to HQ AFPC/DPWRSF at DSN 665-
3805 or commercial (210) 565-3805. Contact HQ AFPC/DPWRSF at DSN 665-2770/2406 and
the Red-Mini User’s Guide for completion instructions.
10. The Red-Mini User’s Guide outlines logging in, uploading, and downloading procedures for
the Red-Mini.

NOTES:
1. Any item checked as NO is a LIMFAC. Report this to your MAJCOM and the component
command and courtesy copy HQ USAF/A1PR/MPRC and HQ AFPC/DPWRO/OSC. Ensure
your MAJCOM and the component command act to correct the LIMFAC.
2. This briefly states the mission and general support personnel provides in mission support of
the OPLAN or tasking. The component command should use this area to identify unique
reporting requirements, designate supporting PTs for geographically separated locations, and
designate intermediate levels of command.
3. Assumptions are items such as STOP LOSS, an inherent part of the activation of the tasking.
Assumptions listed influence the feasibility of Annex E. If an assumption is critical to the
success of the plan, it will list an alternate course of action (COA).
4. This identifies the tasks and responsibilities a PT is expected to maintain in order to support
the OPLAN or tasking. These should be the generic tasks expected of all PTs.
5. This should tell you how to request backfills for personnel that have departed or request
individual augmentation.
6. Ensure the tasking command actively works any LIMFACs.
7. All known communications requirements for PTs should be listed in the OPLAN.
Communications support is essential for accessing the Red-Mini, and dispatching messages; the
DSN voice is a must. Without reach-back capability, the services provided to the deployed
location is degraded severely or cause failure. Requirements outlined in Annex E must also be
identified in Annex K (command, control, and communications systems).
8. For missing/broken GCCS-AF system equipment, notify HQ AFPC/DPWRS ASAP.
9. Access to the Red-Mini enables receipt of mini records on inbound forces or plan
requirements support for the locations you support. Prepare the log sheet request using the
tasking information, have the tasked personnel sign the request, have the unit security manager
validate the security clearances, and fax to HQ AFPC/DPWRSF at DSN 665-3805 or
commercial (210) 565-3805. Contact HQ AFPC/DPWRSF at DSN 665-2770/2406 and the Red-
Mini User’s Guide for completion instructions.
10. The Red-Mini User’s Guide outlines logging, uploading, and downloading procedures for
the Red-Mini.

NOTES:
1. Any sub-item checked as NO is a LIMFAC. Report this to your MAJCOM, the component
command, and courtesy copy HQ USAF/A1PR/MPRC and HQ AFPC/DPWRO/OSC. Follow
up to ensure the parent MAJCOM and the component command act to correct the LIMFAC.
2. Take into consideration the status-of-forces agreements (SOFAs) and customs of the host
country. The security forces are able to answer these types of questions. Take into consideration
OPLAN or tasking requirements when coordination with support agencies. Identify all choke
points to capture accountability of personnel, such as billeting, entry/exit gates, recreational
facilities, etc.
3. This includes constant coordination with supporting medical and mortuary counterparts to
ensure you’re notified of casualties.
4. Documenting problems, achievements, or milestones establishes the foundation for inputs to
the AAR.
5. The responsibility for accounting for GSUs is identified by the tasking message or by the
component command’s CONOPS. GSU accountability procedures may include a GSU
representative faxing copies of orders/AF Forms 245, calling, or e-mailing duty status changes to
the supporting PT.
6. When establishing procedures, all accountability responsibilities of the PT outlined by the
component command must be taken into consideration. The term “Total Force” consists of Air
Force active duty, Air Reserve Components (ARC), Department of the Air Force (DAF)
civilians, contractors supporting the Air Force mission, and other civilian personnel not
employed by the DoD who support the AF mission (e.g., Red Cross, USO, consultants) as well
as the in-place force supporting contingency operations. Total Force accountability can be
expanded by the combatant commander or the component command to include other DOD
civilians, other DoD-essential contractor personnel, other Services, Allied Forces, coalition
forces and/or other personnel.
