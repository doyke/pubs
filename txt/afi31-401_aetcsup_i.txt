5.8.6. (Added) Local Security OIs. Commanders and staff agency chiefs will ensure local security OIs
address facsimile transmissions via secure circuits and will conspicuously post quick reference operating
procedures at equipment authorized to transmit classified information. These OIs should outline proce-
dures for operating facsimile equipment in a secure mode.
5.8.7. (Added) Quick Reference Operating Procedures. Include procedures for handling registered, certi-
fied, first class, and express mail in agency local operating instructions.
5.9.3. (Added) Include procedures for the protection, removal, or destruction of classified material in

into unit OIs. SF 701, Activity Security Checklist, is not required in areas that are continuously staffed. (SF
Form 701 is prescribed by 5 CFR 2003, National Security Information—Standard Forms. Refer to that
publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
5.11.2. Submit residential storage requests to HQ AETC/A7S for approval. When submitting requests,
provide full justification for residential storage and a copy of the final or draft OIs/contingency plans for
the protection of classified information at the residence.
5.13.1. The facility must afford adequate security against unauthorized access from both physical intrud-
ers and sound emissions. Before working with classified components or conducting classified meetings or
briefings, participants will turn off all wireless products (cell phones, pagers, beepers, hand-held radios,
wireless microphones, etc.) and place them in a holding area outside the location where classified compo-
nents are stored or briefed. Posting personnel from the sponsoring activity will establish entry control and
perimeter surveillance in and around the room or facility, as necessary. Note: Security forces is not
responsible for this function, but may assist in the review of unit security plans.
5.13.2.1. (Added) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all secure conference facility
requirements. Security forces and civil engineering (CE) personnel will inspect all new and modified
secure conference facilities to ensure security requirements and construction standards are met according
to DoD 5200.1-R, Appendix 7. Results of the inspection will be documented. The servicing ISPM certi-
fies secure conference facilities in writing. The requesting organization will maintain the original certifi-
AFI31-401_AETCSUP 5 JUNE 2007                                                                            5


cation package, and the security forces will maintain a copy of the package. All documentation will be
maintained according to the Air Force RDS.
5.13.2.2. (Added) Coordinate proposed structural modifications to secure conference facilities with the
ISPM and CE. The ISPM and CE will recertify, in writing, the structural integrity of secure conference
facilities that have been modified.
5.14.2.4. (Added) If criteria in paragraphs 5.14.2.1 through 5.14.2.2 cannot be met, US-cleared personnel
must provide continuous surveillance.
5.14.6. During weather diverts and in-flight emergencies, aircraft commanders will determine how clas-
sified information will be secured using the procedures in AFI 31-401, paragraph 5.14, as applicable.
When those procedures cannot be met, and US-cleared personnel are not available, using local guards for
area control is an acceptable risk when combined with the use of tamper evident seals on aircraft open-
ings. When local guards are not available, the use of tamper evident seals on aircraft openings will be the
minimum security requirement. If the seal is subsequently determined to have been broken, the aircraft
commander will inspect the aircraft for damage, theft of equipment, sabotage, etc. The aircraft com-
mander will report the incident to their home base servicing security office.
5.15.1.1. (Added) Copiers with volatile memory, or no permanent memory, can be approved for classified
reproduction.
5.15.1.2. (Added) Copiers with permanent memory are not authorized for classified reproduction.
5.15.1.3. (Added) Units/offices will develop procedures for classified information processing equipment
(for example, copiers and fax machines) and will incorporate the procedures into unit security OIs. Proce-
dures will ensure volatile memory is erased after each classified reproduction.
5.18.1. General Services Administration (GSA) security containers and doors used to store classified
information will be equipped with locks meeting Federal Specification FF-L-2740.
5.18.2. Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, of all vaults or secure room requirements. Vaults
and secure rooms will not be certified for convenience. Security forces and CE personnel will inspect all
new and modified vaults and secure rooms to ensure security requirements and construction standards
comply with DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, Appendix 7. Results of the inspection will be
documented in writing and maintained in the official records repository. The ISPM certifies secure rooms
and vaults in writing. The requesting organization will maintain the original certification package in the
vault or certified room, and security forces will maintain a copy. All documentation will be maintained
according to the Air Force RDS. The unit security manager will maintain a copy of the vault or secure
room certification package in the unit security manager’s handbook.
5.18.2.1. (Added) The requesting organization will coordinate proposed structural modifications made to
vaults and secure rooms with the ISPM and CE. The ISPM and CE will recertify, in writing, the structural
integrity of vaults and secure rooms that have been modified.
5.18.2.2. (Added) Requesting organization will develop a written plan or operating instruction outlining
procedures for providing protection and positive entry control to the vault or secure room.
5.18.2.3. (Added) Organizations will notify the ISPM, in writing, when the vault or secure room is no
longer used for classified storage.
5.18.2.4. (Added) The structural standards identified in DoD 5200.1-R (Appendix 7) and Military Hand-
book 1013/1A, Design Guidelines for Physical Security Facilities, apply to AETC activities. (Contact
6                                                                  AFI31-401_AETCSUP 5 JUNE 2007


your local ISPM for access to Military Handbook 1013/1A.) Vaults and secure rooms that were certified
and approved before 1 October 1995 are still valid and do not require recertification. (Note: Tenant units
on AETC installations that participate in the host base information security program will follow the pro-
cedures in this paragraph. Tenant units that do not participate in AETC information security programs will
follow their major command (MAJCOM) guidance, and provide a copy of the MAJCOM guidance to the
host ISPM.) The following guidance applies:
5.18.2.4.1. (Added) AETC activities should consider building a secure room to store Secret and Confi-
dential materials only when necessary. These structures will provide an effective safeguarding capability
and eliminate the high costs associated with building vaults.
5.18.2.4.2. (Added) Compensatory measures are required when vaults or secure rooms do not meet the
construction standards in DoD 5200.1-R, (appendix 7), and Military Handbook 1013/1A. Refer to DoD
5200.1-R, paragraph C6.4.3.1, for measures that must be applied before open storage of classified mate-
rial and supplementary controls involving storage of Top Secret material may be approved.
5.18.2.4.3. (Added) Modifications made to vaults and secure rooms will rescind any previous certifica-
tion and approval authority for continued open storage of classified materials (per DoD 5200.1-R, Appen-
dix 7). The ISPM and CE must recertify the structural integrity of vaults and secure rooms even if they
were previously built to standards.
5.18.3. (Added) Certification and Approval:
5.18.3.1. To openly store classified materials in vaults or secure rooms and obtain certification and
approval, the unit or staff agency requiring the secure room or vault will:
5.18.3.1.1. (Added) Submit an OI, outlining procedures for providing protection and positive entry con-
trol to the vault or secure room. The ISPM will certify that the OI provides adequate safeguards for the
protection of classified material.
5.18.3.1.2. (Added) Ensure the ISPM and CE review new construction or structural modifications before
construction or compensatory measures are included to validate the vault or secure room design meets
physical security standards for Secret or Top Secret storage. Once construction or modifications are com-
plete, the ISPM and CE will certify, in writing, whether the facility meets physical security standards.
5.18.3.1.3. (Added) Take no further action if the facility meets physical security standards. If the facility
does not meet the standards and the deficiency cannot be corrected or is cost prohibitive, the submitting
unit or staff agency will send a written plan (via AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet) for forwarding
through the ISPM and CE to the installation commander. (AF Form 1768 is prescribed by AFMAN
33-326, Preparing Official Communications. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the
form.) The plan package will explain what compensatory measures will be implemented for the level of
certification required (Secret or Top Secret) and will address in-depth security along with a risk analysis.
One copy each of the ISPM and CE physical security reviews will be attached along with floor plans of
the facility.
5.18.3.2. (Added) The ISPM and CE will concur or nonconcur with the plan. If either nonconcurs, he or
she will provide rationale for the decision and attach it to the package. In any event, the package will be
forwarded to the installation commander.
5.18.3.3. (Added) The installation commander will approve or disapprove the agency request for certifi-
cation of vaults or secure rooms for open storage. In either case, a copy of the final package will be sent
AFI31-401_AETCSUP 5 JUNE 2007                                                                               7


to the servicing ISPM, who will send it to the submitting agency. (The submitting agency will maintain
the original for the life of the facility.)
5.18.3.4. (Added) When open storage is no longer required, the submitting agency will notify the servic-
ing ISPM, in writing, that the vault or room is no longer being used for classified storage.
5.18.4. (Added) Storing Classified Material for Other Units or Staff Agencies:
5.18.4.1. (Added) AETC units or staff agencies may store classified material for other units or staff agen-
cies when the volume of classified material or frequency of use of the owning unit does not justify main-
taining a security container. The material will be placed in a sealed envelope or container, and the
envelope or container will be marked front and back with the highest classification.
5.18.4.2. (Added) The owning agency will provide the storing agency a memorandum with the names,
organizational addresses, telephone numbers and security clearances of personnel authorized access to the
envelope or container. The owning agency will review the material quarterly, and the reviewing official
will sign and date a review sheet or log attesting that the material is still required.
5.18.4.3. (Added) Units providing storage will:
5.18.4.3.1. (Added) Use AF Form 614, Charge Out Record, when the material is temporarily removed.
(AF Form 614 is prescribed by AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records. Refer to that publication for
guidance on filling out the form.)
5.18.4.3.2. (Added) Establish procedures to ensure all classified material is returned to the storage con-
tainer before the end-of-day check.
5.21.2. For security containers with more than one locking drawer, post an SF Form 700, Security Con-
tainer Information Form, in each individual locking drawer of the container. (SF Form 700 is prescribed
by 5 CFR 2003, National Security Information—Standard Forms. Refer to that publication for guidance
on filling out the form.)
5.21.4. (Added) Units are encouraged to permanently mark each security container with the unit and
security container number. The marking will be placed on either the top-front or left or right side-front of
the security container. The purpose of this marking is to positively identify security containers in the event
of a disaster (fire, hurricane, or other natural disasters).
5.22.1.1. (Added) The ISPM will maintain a list of GSA-certified locksmiths.
5.22.1.2. (Added) Safe custodians will contact the ISPM for assistance in identifying GSA-certified lock-
smiths.
5.22.3. Damaged or malfunctioning locks that do not meet Federal Specification FF-L-2740 will not be
repaired; instead, new locks that meet this specification will be installed. (Note: The combinations on all
classified security containers will be reset to 50-25-50 before turn-in.) Refer to Federal Standard 809
(FED-STD-809), Neutralization and Repair of GSA Approved Containers, for additional information.
5.23. Maintenance and Operating Inspections. Unit commanders or staff agency chiefs will appoint a
security container safe custodian, in writing, for each security container. The safe custodian memorandum
should identify the security container by its identification number, serial number, and the location of the
security container. Forward a copy of the safe custodian appointment memorandum to the unit security
manager and the ISPM. At least once per calendar year, safe custodians will perform a visual inspection
of all classified security containers and annotate the results on AFTO Form 36, Maintenance Record for
8                                                                 AFI31-401_AETCSUP 5 JUNE 2007


Security Type Equipment (AFTO 36 is prescribed by AFTO 00-20F-2, Inspection and Preventive Mainte-
nance, Procedures for Classified Storage Containers. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out
the form.) Custodians will check for worn or damaged parts, loose handles, and other deficiencies that
could degrade protection of the container.
5.24.3.4. (Added) Will post AETC VA 31-5, Classified Reproduction Authorized, above or on all copiers,
facsimile machines, and scanners approved for reproduction of classified material.
5.24.3.5. (Added) Will post AETC VA 31-6, Unclassified Reproduction Only, above or on all copiers,
facsimile machines, and scanners not approved for reproduction of classified material.
NOTE: All AETC visual aids can be found on the HQ AETC Publications Web site at
https://www-r.aetc.af.mil/im/ae31ser.html.
5.25. Control Procedures. This information will be incorporated into local unit or staff agency security
OIs.
5.27.2. During annual program reviews, the ISPM will review at least 25 percent of the classified hold-
ings of a unit or staff agency and will document the results of the inspection in the report.
5.28.1.1. (Added) Security managers will post AETC VA 31-7, Classified Destruction Only, on all shred-
ders authorized for destruction of classified information.
5.28.1.2. (Added) Security managers will post AETC VA 31-8, Unclassified Destruction Only, on all
shredders not authorized to destroy classified information.
