This instruction defines and implements boundaries of the corporate limits and commuting area for
Patrick AFB.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision redefines corporate limits to Patrick AFB proper (paragraph 1.).

1. The corporate limits are defined as only Patrick AFB proper.

2. The commuting area for Patrick AFB is defined as the area outside the corporate limits but within the
county limits of Indian River and Brevard counties.

3. According to the Department of Defense Finance Management Regulation (DODFMR Vol 9) and
Defense Finance Accounting Service-Denver Regulation (DFAS-DER) 7010-3, each reservist who is
called to active duty must be paid mileage from the home of record (HOR) and return when the reservist
lives outside the corporate limits but within the commuting area. This instruction establishes the corporate
limits and commuting area for Patrick AFB and will ensure the accurate payment of travel entitlements to
reservists.
