                                            INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will
assist Orthopedic Surgical Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized
tasks. The tasks are broken down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into
becoming proficient with the task. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for
task certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each
subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of
each module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to
learn each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is
to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is
ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist
as you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document
appropriately in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review
the areas needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each
module. After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a
certifier should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them. The subject-matter-expert for writing and developing this QTP was:

OBJECTIVE:                                     In a clinical setting, apply standard short arm cast.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of casting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Casts should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented
using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.

PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine cast requirements.
2. Gather needed supplies.
3. Greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient to relax as much as
    possible.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient in position of function (0-15 degrees of extension with fingers and
    thumb free; no radial or ulna deviation; no pronation or supination) or as directed
    by physician.
2. Inspect skin for integrity/injury; remove jewelry.
3. Apply stockinet, if appropriate. Smooth out wrinkles.
4. Roll webril around extremity, wrinkle free, beginning at wrist, proceed wrapping
distally to 1” distal to MCP joints, and ending 1” distal to cubital space. Pay close
attention to bony prominences.
5. Ensure proper overlap (approximately 50%).
6. Remove excess webril to ensure no pressure points.
7. Ensure patient/extremity is positioned properly.
8. Dip casting material into cold water if using synthetic casting tape or tepid
(lukewarm) water if using plaster rolls.
9. Remove excess water from casting material.
10. Roll casting material circumferentially beginning at the wrist proceeding distally to
distal palmar crease proceed proximal to 1” distal of cubital space.
11. Trim cast to distal palmar crease and 1” from cubital space. Ensure cast is
trimmed at base of thumb to allow full range of motion. Patient should be able to
touch all digits with thumb.
12. Dress cast by turning back stockinet and webril.
13. Apply additional casting material as required (based on patient’s dimensions).
14. Form casting material to patient by rubbing/smoothing material as appropriate. An
interosseous mold can be accomplished by molding with the flat of both palms and
gently pressing between the radius and ulna both dorsally and volarly to spread the
interosseous membrane.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around cast.
2. Ensure patient comfort and circulation.
3. Fit sling to patient and instruct on use if/as directed by provider.
4. Brief patient on cast care procedures and precautions.
5. Document medical records or AF Form 600.
6. Discard used items and return unused items to storage.

OBJECTIVE:                                     In a clinical setting, apply short arm thumb spica cast.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of casting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Casts should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented

PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine cast requirements.
2. Gather needed supplies.
3. Greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient to relax as much as
    possible.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient in position of function (wrist extended to 15 degrees, thumb
    abducted in a position of function, similar to position hand would assume if holding
    a glass, digits two to five are free) or as directed by physician.
2. Inspect skin for integrity/injury; remove jewelry.
3. Apply stockinet, if appropriate.
4. Roll webril around extremity, wrinkle free, beginning at wrist, proceed wrapping
distally to 1” distal to MCP joints, incorporating thumb and ending 1” distal to cubital
space. Pay close attention to bony prominences.
5. Ensure proper overlap (approximately 50%).
6. Remove excess webril to ensure no pressure points.
7. Ensure patient/extremity is positioned properly.
8. Dip casting material into cold water if using synthetic casting tape or tepid
(lukewarm) water if using plaster rolls.
9. Remove excess water from casting material.
10. Roll casting material circumferentially starting at wrist proceeding distally to distal
palmar crease incorporating the thumb and maintaining position, proceed proximal to
2” distal of cubital space. Ensure visualization of distal thumb.
11. Trim cast to expose tip of thumb, distal palmar crease and proximal MCP joints
and distal to within 1” of cubital space.
12. Dress cast by turning back stockinet and webril.
13. Apply additional casting material as required (based on patient’s dimensions).
14. Form casting material to patient by rubbing/smoothing material as appropriate. An
interosseous mold can be accomplished by molding with the flat of both palms and
gently pressing between the radius and ulna both dorsally and volarly to spread the
interosseous membrane.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around cast.
2. Ensure patient comfort and circulation.
3. Fit sling to patient and instruct on use if/as directed by provider.
4. Brief patient on cast care procedures and precautions.
5. Document medical records or AF Form 600.
6. Discard used items and return unused items to storage.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of casting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Casts should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication.

PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine cast requirements.
2. Gather needed supplies.
3. Greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient to relax as much as
    possible.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient in position of function (knee at knee at 0-30 degrees flexion and
    ankle at 90 degrees; for Achilles tendon injuries, the foot is placed in equinus) or as
    directed by physician. Maintain neutral position (no inversion, eversion,
    plantar/dorsiflexion). This may take two people.
2. Provide patient with sheet or towel for privacy.
3. Inspect skin for integrity/injury. Remove all jewelry.
4. Apply stockinet, if appropriate.
5. Roll webril around extremity starting 1” distal to metatarsal heads and ending 3”
distal from groin, paying close attention to bony prominences. Apply additional
padding where needed.
6. Ensure proper overlap (approximately 50%).
7. Remove excess webril to ensure no pressure points.
8. Ensure patient/extremity is positioned properly.
9. Dip casting material into cold water if using synthetic casting tape or tepid
(lukewarm) water if using plaster rolls.
10. Remove excess water from casting material.
11. Roll casting material circumferentially starting at the toes and proceed to popliteal
space as if applying a short leg cast.
12. Maintain patient position, readjust if needed
13. To finish cast, begin rolling cast material on ½ length of short leg cast and roll to
4” distal of groin.
14. Apply additional casting material as required (based on orders; weight/non-weight
bearing and patient’s dimensions).
15. Form casting material to patient by rubbing/smoothing material as appropriate.
Special attention should be paid to the transverse and longitudinal arches of the foot,
the malleoli and the heelcord. The mold of the thigh and knee are crucial to the
efficacy of this cast. Mold cast around the condyles of the femur to prevent cast sliding
down the leg. A quadrilateral thigh mold is applied manually by placing the heels of
the palms just above the knee on the medial and lateral sides.
16. Place leg on pillows and allow to dry.
17. Apply cast shoe for weight bearing cast if appropriate.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around cast.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of casting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Casts should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions and follows applicable radiation safety
guidelines.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task with 100% accuracy, without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented
using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of splinting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Splints should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication. This
                                               cast takes several assistants to apply expeditiously and correctly.

PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine cast requirements.
2. Gather needed supplies and adequate number of assistants. This cast should be
    done under the direction of the attending physician.
3. Greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient to relax as much as
    possible.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient as directed by physician.
2. Inspect skin for integrity/injury. Remove all jewelry.
3. Padding should consist of multiple layers of cast padding and cruciate cut felt strips
applied to bony prominences (the anterior superior iliac spine, the spine and sacrum,
and costal margins). Additional felt should be placed at the superior edge and on the
inner groin under the cast for additional comfort. ABDs should be placed on top of the
abdomen so they can be removed when cast application is complete in order to allow
room for abdominal expansion.
4. Ensure patient/extremity is positioned properly.
5. Dip casting material into cold water if using synthetic casting tape or tepid
(lukewarm) water if using plaster rolls.
6. Remove excess water from casting material.
7. Apply casting material circumferentially starting on the abdomen, then move down
to the lower extremities. Reinforce the cast with multiple 15 inch splints (3-5
thicknesses). Pay particular attention to the where the cast crosses the hip joint. This
area (intern’s angle) is most susceptible to breakdown from stress. Additional rolls are
applied following splint application to give a smooth, finished appearance.
8. Trim cast as appropriate. Cut a circular hole in the abdomen to allow for expansion.
Trim perineal and sacrum area well to allow for adequate bowel and bladder functions.
9. Place wood spreader bar between the two legs to stabilize and strengthen cast. Tie
in with rolls of plaster
10. Pad perineal and areas of irritation with moleskin for comfort.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around cast.
2. Ensure patient comfort and circulation.
3. Brief patient on cast care procedures and precautions.
4. Document medical records or AF Form 600.
5. Discard used items and return unused items to storage.

OBJECTIVE:                                     In a clinical setting, remove all types of casts.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of cast removal is cast saw burns or lacerations
                                               over bony prominences. This is especially true with anesthetized

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of splinting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Splints should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication.

PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine splint requirements.
2. Gather needed supplies.
3. Greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient to relax as much as
    possible.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient in position of function (ankle in neutral or 90 degrees of
    dorsiflexion with neither inversion or eversion) or as directed by physician. This is
    most easily accomplished by have patient lay in the prone position and flexing the
    knee at 90 degrees.
2. Inspect skin for integrity/injury; remove jewelry.
3. Measure first splint material on uninjured side to determine length. Measure from
the tips of the toes upward to 3” distal to the popliteal region of the knee. Fabricate
10-15 thickness splint of plaster material. The other 5-10 thicknesses will be used for
the stirrup for medial and lateral support.
4. Roll webril around extremity, wrinkle free, beginning at the metatarsal heads and
proceed to 2” distal to the popliteal region of the knee. Pay close attention to bony
prominences.
5. Ensure proper overlap (approximately 50%).
6. Remove excess webril to ensure no pressure points.
7. Ensure patient/extremity is positioned properly.
8. Dip splinting material into cold water if using synthetic splinting material or tepid
(lukewarm) water if using plaster.
9. Remove excess water from splinting material.
10. Apply first splint beginning at the metatarsal heads and proceed to 3” distal to the
popliteal region of the knee. Apply second splint in a stirrup fashion starting on the
lateral aspect of the leg going down over the first splint around the ankle and ending on
the medial aspect of the leg opposite the starting point.
11. Secure splint in place with ace bandage starting from distal to proximal.
12. Use tape instead of clips to secure ace if applying to young child.
13. Place a pillow lengthwise under extremity and maintain proper position of
    extremity until splint has dried.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around splint.
2. Ensure patient comfort and circulation.
3. Brief patient on splint care procedures and precautions.
4. Document medical records or AF Form 600.
5. Discard used items and return unused items to storage.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 The principal danger of splinting an extremity that has recently been
                                               injured, manipulated or operated on is causing an iatrogenic
                                               compartment syndrome when the extremity swells in a limited space.
                                               Splints should be carefully wrapped to prevent this complication.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions and follows applicable radiation safety
guidelines.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task with 100% accuracy, without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented

arranged so that a delicate balance of traction and counter-traction is maintained.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Ensure patient comfort and circulation.
2. Ensure meticulous skin care and decubitus prevention measures are carried.
3. Ensure leg does not rotate externally and place pressure on the peroneal nerve.
Have nursing personnel check neurovascular status every two hours.
4. If elastic bandages are used, check frequently for excessive pressure at the site of
the fibular head and dorsum of foot.
5. Slings should be positioned so that the heel and Achilles tendon do not carry the
    weight of the lower leg.
6. Inform nursing personnel upon completion of task.

OBJECTIVE:                                     In a clinical/ward setting, setup and apply Balanced suspension with
                                               skeletal traction.

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 Potential complications with skeletal traction are related to the pin
                                               migration and pin tract infection. Occasionally pin tract infections can
                                               lead to osteomyelitis. There is also risk of neurovascular and
                                               circulatory compromise due to immobilization of the patient and
                                               pressure points caused by external pressure on the skin. BOTTOM
                                               LINE: NEVER IGNORE A PATIENT’S COMPLAINT.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions and follows applicable radiation safety
guidelines.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task with 100% accuracy, without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented
using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.
