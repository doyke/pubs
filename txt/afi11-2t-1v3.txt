                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to safe operation of the T-1A.
With the complementary references cited, this instruction prescribes standard operational
procedures to be used by all aircrew operating T-1A aircraft.
1.2. Pilot-In-Command Responsibility (Aircraft Commander). In conjunction with other
governing directives, this instruction prescribes T-1A procedures under most circumstances, but
is not to be used as a substitute for sound judgment or common sense. The pilot-in-command
(PIC) is ultimately responsible for the safe and effective operation of the aircraft.
1.3. Deviations. Deviations from the procedures in this instruction require specific approval of
the MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates otherwise. In
such a case, the PIC will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
1.4. References. The primary references for T-1A operations are technical order (TO) 1T-1A-1,
Flight Manual-T-1A Series Aircraft, and applicable supplements; AFMAN 11-247, T-1A Flying
Fundamentals; and this instruction. Training units may develop local standards from the
procedures contained in these documents. Local standards may be used to augment initial and
mission qualification training defined by AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 1, T-1A Aircrew Training.
Although local standards may expand these basic procedures, in no case will they be less
restrictive.
1.5. Definition of Specific Terms. For the purposes of this instruction, the term “student”
refers to any crewmember enrolled in joint specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT),
undergraduate combat training (UCT), pilot instructor training, fixed-wing qualification training
and combat systems officer (CSO) instructor training. The use of the term “CSO” refers to
students enrolled in UCT and instructor combat sytems officer (ICSO) upgrade training; and
qualified CSOs and ICSOs.
1.6. Crew Requirements. The minimum basic T-1A crew requirement is defined in TO 1T-
1A-1, Flight Manual-T-1A Series Aircraft. When an individual not fully qualified as a T-1A pilot
occupies either the pilot’s (left) or copilot’s (right) seat (for example, CSO, ICSO, UCT, SUPT,
initial qualification, requalification, orientation) a current and qualified T-1A instructor pilot (IP)
must occupy the other seat with immediate access to a set of flight controls. (EXCEPTION:
Single and/or double seat changes, and to meet physiological needs.) At no time will both the
pilot and copilot's positions remain unoccupied.
   1.6.1. CSO Sorties. The minimum crew complement will consist of a qualified and current
   T-1A instructor ( pilot or CSO) in the left seat and a T-1A qualified, upgrade or student CSO
   in the right seat.
       1.6.1.1. Sorties in which an undergraduate CSO student occupies the right seat also
       require a qualified T-1A instructor (pilot or CSO) in the jump seat.
   1.6.2. Break-In-Training (BIT) Sorties. (See AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 1, T-1A Aircrew
   Training.)

       1.6.2.1. Pilot. The minimum crew complement will consist of a T-1A IP with immediate
       access to a set of flight controls and a rated, unqualified T-1A SUPT pilot graduate at the
       other set of flight controls.
       1.6.2.2. CSO. The minimum crew complement will consist of a qualified T-1A IP in the
       left (pilot) seat; rated, unqualified CSO in the right (copilot) seat; and qualified T-1A
       instructor (pilot or CSO) in the jump seat.
    1.6.3. Passenger-Carrying Sorties. Minimum crew complement will consist of qualified
    T-1A pilots in both the left and right seats on any sortie carrying passengers (to include
    Mission Essential Personnel). See AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for MEP
    requirements.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                      7

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by individual
crewmembers and the operations functions of organizations.
2.2. General Procedures. Sufficient flight planning must be done to ensure safe mission
accomplishment. AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, specifies the minimum
requirements.
2.3. Flight Planning Software. Upon validation and approval by the NAF/DO or
MAJCOM/A3V, aircrews may use automated mission planning (software for example, Portable
Flight Planning System [PFPS]/Joint Mission Planning System) for mission planning IAW AFI
11-202, Volume 3. Refer to the AETC/A3FV Web site located at https://www-
r.aetc.af.mil/do/dof/ for software approval information. Refer to the applicable syllabus for
additional guidance on the use of flight planning software during formal student training.
2.4. Briefings and Debriefings:
   2.4.1. Minimum Briefing Times. For student syllabus sorties, minimum briefing times are
   determined IAW the syllabus. For all other sorties, the minimum brief time will be 1 hour
   and 30 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff. The aircraft commander will determine briefing
   requirements for off-station sorties.
   2.4.2. Briefing Guides:
       2.4.2.1. The aircraft commander will brief all personnel on specific duties and
       responsibilities relating to safe mission accomplishment to include in-flight discipline.
       Aircrews should reference the appropriate briefing guides, located in Attachments 2, 3,
       and 4 to brief applicable items before each mission. Briefing guides are a reference list of
       items that may apply to particular missions.
       2.4.2.2. Items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items covered by written
       squadron standards and understood by all participants may be briefed as “standard.” Each
       guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important items of the flight. Brief
       only those items applicable to the particular mission and in sufficient detail to prevent
       any misunderstanding between crewmembers.
       2.4.2.3. The flight briefing will be structured to accommodate the capabilities of each
       crewmember in the flight.
       2.4.2.4. If appropriate, an alternate mission will be briefed for each flight. The alternate
       mission will be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary mission. If
       the alternate mission does not parallel the primary mission, brief the specific mission
       elements that are different. Mission elements or events may be briefed airborne if
       practical and flight safety is not compromised.
       2.4.2.5. All missions student and continuation training (CT) will be debriefed using the
       debriefing guide in Attachment 5 as a reference.
   2.4.3. Unit-Developed Checklists and Local In-flight Guides (IFG) and/or Pilot Aids:
8                                                      AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


    2.4.3.1. Unit-developed checklists (fanfold) may be used in lieu of TO 1T-1A-1CL-1,
    Checklist--Flight Crew, T-1A Aircraft, and TO 1T-1A-1CL-2, Checklist -- Flight Crew, if
    they contain, at a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the checklist.
    Submit fanfold checklists through NAF/DO for MAJCOM/A3V and flight manual
    manager approval (see AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP]). The use of
    a fanfold checklist does not negate the requirements of paragraph 3.1.2.1.
    2.4.3.2. Unit-developed IFG or aircrew aids will include, as a minimum, the following
    items:
       2.4.3.2.1. Briefing guides.
       2.4.3.2.2. Local ultra-high frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF)
       channelization.
       2.4.3.2.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams.
       2.4.3.2.4. Emergency information (for example, emergency action checklists, no-
       radio procedures, divert information).
       2.4.3.2.5. Cross-country procedures to include command and control and aircraft
       servicing information.
       2.4.3.2.6. Operational risk management (ORM) guides and checklists.

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Preflight:
   3.1.1. Visual Signals. Aircrew will ensure they receive proper acknowledgment from
   ground personnel before activating any system that could pose any danger to the ground
   crew. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft
   Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. The crew chief will repeat the
   given signal when it is safe to operate the system.
   3.1.2. Required Publications and Equipment:
       3.1.2.1. On all sorties, one aircrew member will carry a complete set of current aircraft
       technical orders (that is, TO 1T-1A-1; TO 1T-1A-1-1, Flight Manual, Appendix 1,
       Performance Data; and TO 1T-1A-1-2 [when operating CSO-modified aircraft]). All
       aircrew members are required to carry a current TO 1T-1A-1CL-1 (pilot’s abbreviated
       flight crew checklist) or TO 1T-1A-1-2CL-1 (when operating CSO-modified aircrafts)
       and a unit-developed IFG.
       3.1.2.2. In addition to required publications, aircrews will carry a suitable terrain chart to
       cover the proposed route when flying outside the local area (e.g., Visual Flight Rules
       [VFR], Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Operational Navigation Chart [ONC], Tactical
       Pilotage Chart [TPC], JOG). Carry the flight information publications (FLIP) prescribed
       by local directives. Each aircrew member will also carry an operational flashlight on
       sorties that will be flown between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
       morning civil twilight.
       3.1.2.3. A life raft is required for overwater flight unless the only overwater portion of
       the flight is during the departure or approach phase or if the aircraft remains within
       gliding distance of land. Life preservers should be carried onboard whenever a life raft is
       required. Reference AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program,
       and applicable lead-command directives for specific life preserver requirements.
       3.1.2.4. All qualified and student T-1A aircrew members are required to wear Nomex®
       flight suits during T-1A operations.
       3.1.2.5. All aircrew members will have Nomex® flight gloves in their possession while
       performing aircrew duties. In addition, aircrew members must wear Nomex® flight
       gloves during external aircraft inspection and servicing. It is recommended that primary
       crewmembers wear Nomex® gloves during engine start, takeoff, and landing.
       3.1.2.6. Individuals are only authorized to utilize David Clark® headsets (model H10-76
       or command-approved equivalent) in the T-1A. Noise-cancelling headsets are not
       approved for use in the T-1A. MAJCOM/A3T approval is required for use of alternative
       headsets after testing IAW applicable military standards and certification for specific use
       in the T-1A.
       3.1.2.7. Electronic flight bags are not authorized.

  3.1.3. Aircraft Systems. Operational checks flights (OCF) may be performed during
  student training sorties if the checks do not interfere with the training objectives.
  3.1.4. CSO-Modified T-1A Aircraft. Aircrews are prohibited from utilizing the jump and
  instructor seat 110 Volt AC, 60 Hertz outlet and Ethernet port units for any personal
  electronic devices. Only those devices certified and required for use with the CSO
  modification may be utilized.
     3.1.4.1. Aircrew will utilize MAJCOM/A3V-approved checklists for pre- and post-flight
     mission equipment setup. At a minimum, checklists will address power up and power
     down of jump and instructor laptops; testing of hand control units; and procedures to
     upload and download mission data.
     3.1.4.2. Aircraft performance and navigational data displayed on CSO monitors and
     laptops are for training use only and not certified for and will not be used as primary
     aircraft instrument or navigation sources.
  3.1.5. Equipment Stowage. Clothing and personal items should be stowed aft of the jump
  seat. Larger items of cargo will be carried in the aft cabin, using tiedowns or secured in a
  passenger seat. Do not place items in front of the crew entrance door or emergency escape
  hatch which may delay or prohibit emergency egress from the aircraft.
     3.1.5.1. CSO Equipment (Modified Aircraft). Stow the jump seat laptop and copilot
     mission monitor prior to take-off roll and crossing the threshold for landing. Unstow the
     copilot mission monitor and jump seat laptop after take-off as required by the mission or
     permitted by the aircraft commander. The copilot display will not be unstowed until
     completion of the “After Take-Off” checklist.
  3.1.6. Storage of the Jump Seat. When the crew compliment consists of two
  crewmembers, the jump seat will remain locked in the stowed position (full aft and full
  right). Required TOs must be stowed within arms reach of the seat-belted crewmembers
  (using the jump seat is allowed, as long as the restraint belts are used to secure the TOs). The
  jump seat is not a primary crew position except as required by the UCT mission.
  3.1.7. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To reduce the risk of FOD during ground
  operations:
     3.1.7.1. Do not allow personnel to approach the crew entrance door or allow
     crewmembers to open the crew entrance door when both engines are running. Personnel
     may enter and exit the crew entrance door with the right engine operating and left engine
     shut down.
     3.1.7.2. Limit power during ground operations to approximately 70 percent N2 in
     congested areas.
     3.1.7.3. Avoid prop or jet blast.
     3.1.7.4. Do not place objects other than flight gloves on the flight deck glare shield to
     prevent scratching and abrasions to the windshield.
     3.1.7.5. Do not pass open containers of food or drinks over the center console, circuit
     breaker panel or aft CSO station console (modified T-1A aircraft).
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                  11


      3.1.7.6. Do not place objects other than flight gloves or mission planning paperwork on
      the horizontal CSO workstation monitor and do not utilize the monitor as a writing
      surface.
   3.1.8. Refueling:
      3.1.8.1. Do not refuel the aircraft with the engines running. Cell phone use is prohibited
      within 50 feet of aircraft refueling operations.
      3.1.8.2. Fuel anti-icing inhibitor, as required by TO, must be pre-mixed into fuel from
      the source (e.g., fuel truck) by qualified personnel and may not be manually mixed during
      aircraft refueling.
3.2. Taxiing:
   3.2.1. Obstacle Clearance. Do not taxi with less than 25 feet of wingtip obstacle clearance
   unless a marshaller is used in conjunction with a wing walker at each affected wingtip. When
   obstacles affect only one wingtip, the marshaller may also act as the wing walker and direct
   the aircraft while monitoring the affected wingtip. This requirement does not apply at the
   home station when fixed taxi routes are marked and provide a minimum of 10 feet of wingtip
   clearance from obstacles and other aircraft. Never taxi with less than 10 feet of wingtip
   obstacle clearance.
   3.2.2. Taxi Interval. Do not taxi staggered. Maintain a minimum of 150 feet behind other
   aircraft while taxiing.
   3.2.3. Minimum Taxiway Width. Minimum taxiway width is 50 feet. Operations group
   commanders may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
   3.2.4. Ice and/or Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all
   portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. Conditions to
   consider are snow berm locations and reported taxiway runway condition reading (RCR)
   along the planned taxi route. With ice or snow present, taxi on centerline with a minimum of
   300 feet of spacing behind other aircraft. For removal of snow and ice, refer to the aircraft
   TO command guidance, and TO 42C-1-2, Anti-icing, De-icing, and Defrosting of Parked
   Aircraft.
   3.2.5. CSOs. CSOs will not taxi the aircraft, except as required to accomplish the “Taxi”
   checklist.
3.3. Takeoff and Landing:
   3.3.1. During engine runup, the crewmember not in control of the aircraft will guard the
   brakes and be ready to assume control of the aircraft in case of brake failure.
   3.3.2. CSOs are prohibited from controlling the aircraft during takeoffs and landings (to
   include touch-and-goes) and will only perform copilot or pilot monitoring duties.
   3.3.3. Touch-and-go operations require a qualified IP at a direct set of controls.
   3.3.4. Touch-and-go operations are prohibited with an undergraduate or BIT CSO (see AFI
   11-2T-1, Volume 1, definition) at a direct set of controls, regardless of IP presence.
12                                                           AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


  3.3.5. CSOs are prohibited from controlling the aircraft during visual traffic pattern
  operations, go-around and/or missed approach and circling to land procedures and will only
  perform pilot monitoring duties.
  3.3.6. Fuel:
     3.3.6.1. The T-1A will normally take off with a full fuel load from the home field. The
     aircraft commander will decide whether to take off at the home field or out base with less
     than a full fuel load. Factors to consider include weight and balance, mission
     requirements, aircraft performance, weather conditions and fuel conservation.
     3.3.6.2. Declare “minimum” or “emergency fuel” to the controlling agency any time it
     becomes apparent the fuel remaining at final touchdown will be less than the
     requirements indicated in paragraphs 3.3.6.3 and 3.3.6.4. After declaring minimum or
     emergency fuel, add the fuel status call and amount of fuel remaining (in minutes) to each
     new air traffic control facility. Once established in the local traffic pattern, add fuel status
     with each radio transmission.
     3.3.6.3. Minimum fuel for the T-1A is 500 pounds.
     3.3.6.4. Emergency fuel for the T-1A is 300 pounds.
     3.3.6.5. Aircrews must be aware that minimum fuel for landing may be greater than the
     fuel requirements of paragraphs 3.3.6.3 and 3.3.6.4, to ensure aircraft center of gravity
     limitations are not exceeded in some configurations or aircrew and/or passenger and/or
     cargo complements.
  3.3.7. Performance Data. The minimum climbout factor for all takeoffs is 2.5. Reference
  Zero will occur no later than the departure end of the runway for all initial takeoffs and
  touch-and-go departures.
  3.3.8. Runway:
     3.3.8.1. The minimum runway length for T-1A takeoffs is 6,000 feet, critical field length
     (CFL), or the distance required to reach reference zero whichever is greater. Note: The
     minimum usable runway for takeoff, touch-and-go and landing is computed between
     arresting cables located on or above the runway surface. EXCEPTION: Reference Zero
     calculations may take into account runway distance past a departure end arresting cable,
     however in no case may “Reference Zero” occur past the departure end of the runway.
     3.3.8.2. The minimum runway length for full-stop landings is 6,000 feet or computed
     landing distance, whichever is greater. If the tabular data landing distance is within 1,000
     feet of the total usable runway for landing, aircrews must use the longer of the
     performance chart or tabular data landing distance. If the tabular data landing distance is
     not within 1,000 feet of runway available, aircrews may use tabular data landing.
     3.3.8.3. The minimum usable runway length for touch-and-go landings must be equal to
     or greater than the applicable touch-and-go distance but never less than 6,000 feet. (See
     Attachment 6 for touch-and-go distances for 15,500 to 12,000 pounds gross weight.)
     Touch-and-go distances reflect the most restrictive of the go or stop option from the
     appropriate decision point (flaps and throttles). From these points, the applicable touch-
     and-go distance allows acceleration, rotation, and climb to Reference Zero by departure
     end, or deceleration to stop within the runway remaining.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 13


     3.3.8.4. For airfields with Declared Distances as defined in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1,
     Instrument Flight Procedures, aircrews will use the shortest of Take-Off Run Available
     (TORA), Take-Off Distance Available (TODA), Accelerate-Stop Distance Available
     (ASDA) or Landing Distance Available (LDA) to determined the usable runway length
     for touch-and-go landings.
     3.3.8.5. Minimum runway width for single-ship takeoffs and landings is 100 feet.
     3.3.8.6. Minimum runway width for formation takeoffs (normal and feed-on methods) is
     150 feet.
     3.3.8.7. Takeoffs and touch-and-go landings will not be accomplished on unplowed
     runways when ice or snow is present. These operations are permitted on plowed runways
     provided the plowed portion is a minimum of 100 feet wide and meets the minimum
     length requirements of paragraphs 3.3.8.1 through 3.3.8.3. Additionally, the RCR of the
     plowed surface must be 12 or greater.
     3.3.8.8. The operations group commander may waive the requirements in paragraphs
     3.3.8.1 through 3.3.8.7 on a case-by-case basis.
  3.3.9. Spacing:
     3.3.9.1. Takeoff. Do not begin the takeoff roll until preceding aircraft are airborne or
     clear of the runway EXCEPTION: Does not apply to the wingman during 15-second
     interval formation takeoffs.
     3.3.9.2. Landing. Land on runway centerline with 6,000 feet minimum spacing behind
     other aircraft unless the aircraft is airborne. This includes touch-and-go and full stop
     landings, and applies to single-ship and formation operations.
  3.3.10. Low Approach. During low approaches, do not allow the aircraft to touch down. A
  restricted low approach is defined as no lower than 500 feet above ground level (AGL) or as
  directed by the controlling agency. Minimum altitude to initiate a practice single-engine go-
  around is 100 feet AGL.
  3.3.11. Crosswind Limitations. The maximum crosswind limitation for takeoff and landing
  is 25 knots for a dry runway, 15 knots for a wet runway, and 10 knots for an icy runway.
  3.3.12. Traffic Patterns:
     3.3.12.1. Tactical Overheads. Single-engine and no-flap tactical overheads are
     prohibited (simulated or actual). A tactical pattern is one turn to downwind and one turn
     to final.
     3.3.12.2. Closed Pattern (Tactical or Rectangular). The minimum airspeed to begin
     the closed pull-up is 160 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). Maintain 160 KIAS minimum
     during the pull-up. On downwind, maintain minimum speeds for fuel weight and
     configuration.
     3.3.12.3. Bank Angles. Pilots should adjust pattern spacing as to not exceed 30 degrees
     of bank in the final turn or on final. Pilots should not exceed 45 degrees of bank
     anywhere in the traffic pattern, to include the break during tactical overhead patterns.
  3.3.13. No-Flap Landings. Do not practice no-flap full-stop landings.
 14                                                          AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


   3.3.14. Circling Approaches. Do not practice single-engine circling approaches or single-
   engine low-closed patterns.
   3.3.15. Simulated Dual Engine Flameout Patterns. Do not practice simulated dual engine
   flameout patterns.
   3.3.16. Crew Seat Change Procedures:
      3.3.16.1. The minimum altitude for seat changes is 1,000 feet AGL. Seat changes will
      not be conducted during a critical phase of flight.
      3.3.16.2. Crew seat changes on the ground will not be performed with the engines
      running unless there is a pilot at the controls at all times to guard the brakes. Seat changes
      with only two crewmembers on board will not be performed with the engines running.
      3.3.16.3. At the discretion of the aircraft commander, CSOs may unstrap shoulder
      harnesses when occupying the jump seat and aft crew seats to facilitate training during air
      intercept operations or the low-level portion of formal training syllabus; and continuation
      training sorties.
   3.3.17. Delayed Braking:
      3.3.17.1. Delayed braking is defined as the time and/or distance between aircraft
      touchdown and brake application. Delayed braking is also defined as the time and/or
      distance between initiating an abort and brake application. Although utilized to reduce
      brake energy, delayed braking increases landing distance significantly.
      3.3.17.2. Do not let concern over brake energy override good judgment in stopping the
      aircraft. Apply the brakes based on the runway remaining, not on hot brakes speed. Apply
      brakes as necessary to ensure the aircraft does not depart the runway. Do not hesitate to
      use maximum braking if necessary. Note: Charted stopping distances do not account for
      possible decreased braking effectiveness due to rubber deposits, especially when wet.
      3.3.17.3. The ability to delay braking during an abort is dependent upon several factors
      (e.g. aircraft speed, runway remaining, RCR, inoperative aircraft systems, tailwind
      component, etc.). Upon initiating an abort, if any doubt exists as to whether the aircraft
      will stop in the confines of the runway, immediately apply maximum braking until the
      aircraft has slowed to a safe taxi speed. As a guide, do not delay braking if the runway
      remaining is less than RCR-corrected CFL.
      3.3.17.4. When landing, do not delay braking when runway remaining is less than the
      RCR corrected landing distance. The flare component of the landing distance is not
      calculated separately and provides an added margin of safety. Refer to TO 1T-1A-1-1 for
      additional assumptions concerning landing distance and landing ground roll distance
      calculations. If any doubt exists as to whether the aircraft will stop in the runway
      remaining, immediately apply maximum braking until the aircraft has slowed to a safe
      taxi speed.
   3.3.18. Afterlanding. Do not perform any afterlanding checklist items until the aircraft is
   clear of the active runway.
3.4. Maneuvering Parameters:
   3.4.1. Critical Phases of Flight. The following flight regimes are critical phases of flight:
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                        15


     3.4.1.1. Takeoffs and landings.
     3.4.1.2. Traffic pattern operations (instrument and visual) after initiating the base turn.
     3.4.1.3. Low-level navigation (below 1,000 feet AGL).
     3.4.1.4. Precontact (astern) and contact positions.
     3.4.1.5. Airdrop maneuver (IP to target).
  3.4.2. Cruise Checklist. If actual cruise time will be a short duration (approximately 15
  minutes), the cruise checklist does not have to be accomplished. Aircrews transiting between
  airfields located in close proximity to each other (approximately 15 minutes) and remaining
  below transition level, may accomplish the pattern checklist in lieu of the after-takeoff,
  climb, cruise, descent, and before-landing checklists.
  3.4.3. Transfer of Aircraft Control. At all times, crew members must know who has
  control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement “Pilot (or
  copilot), you have the aircraft.” The individual receiving control of the aircraft will
  acknowledge “Pilot (or copilot) has the aircraft.” The individual assuming control of the
  aircraft will maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above.
     3.4.3.1. Autopilot Coupled Instrument Approaches (CSO-only). Transfer of aircraft
     control from the CSO to the pilot during autopilot coupled instrument approaches will be
     initiated no later than 100 feet above approach minimums and no later than the missed
     approach point, but in no case lower than 300 feet above touchdown zone elevation
     (TDZE) or airfield elevation (approaches terminating in a circle).
     3.4.3.2. Crew members occupying the jump seat are prohibited from manipulating the
     autopilot controls or throttles.
  3.4.4. Altitudes:
     3.4.4.1. Minimum altitude for visual flight routesVFR point-to-point navigation is 3,000
     feet AGL. Aircrews may descend below 3,000 feet AGL as required for low-level
     entry/VFR arrival. Do not descend outside of the area covered by the chummed low-level
     or VFR arrival chart.
     3.4.4.2. Complete approach to stalls, traffic pattern stalls, slow flight, unusual attitudes,
     and flight characteristic demonstrations above 5,000 feet AGL.
     3.4.4.3. CSOs are prohibited from hand-flying the aircraft below 8,000 feet AGL. Hand-
     flying is defined as operating the aircraft flight controls without use of the autopilot.
     3.4.4.4. CSOs are prohibited from flying the aircraft, autopilot coupled, below 1,000 feet
     AGL unless established on an instrument approach procedure (IAP). Note: Established
     on an IAP includes being radar vectored for an IAP or cleared direct the initial approach
     fix for an IAP.
  3.4.5. Weather Requirements. Approach to stalls, traffic pattern stalls, slow flight, unusual
  attitudes, steep turns and flight characteristics demonstrations will be conducted in day visual
  meteorological conditions (VMC).
 16                                                          AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


   3.4.6. Stalls. Do not practice approach to stalls or traffic pattern stalls beyond the stick
   shaker. Note: A qualified IP must be at a direct set of controls for all practice approach to
   stall or traffic pattern stall training.
   3.4.7. Asymmetrical Thrust Demonstration. The yaw damper may be on or off. The high
   speed maneuver will be performed at approximately 220 KIAS and the low speed portion at
   approximately 150 KIAS. Calculate and use a maximum continuous thrust (MCT) to avoid
   over boosting the engines.
   3.4.8. Yaw Damper Failure Demonstration. The demonstration must be conducted below
   flight level (FL) 280.
   3.4.9. Unusual Attitudes. Initiate recoveries above 130 KIAS and below 270 KIAS. Do not
   exceed 45 degrees angle of bank. Maximum pitch attitudes are 25 degrees nose up and 20
   degrees nose down. Compute and use no more than MCT to avoid over boosting the engines.
3.5. Night Operations:
   3.5.1. Night Prohibited Maneuvers. In addition to the maneuvers listed in paragraph
   3.4.5.1, the following missions are prohibited at night:
      3.5.1.1. Formation.
      3.5.1.2. Low level navigation.
      3.5.1.3. Air intercept.
   3.5.2. Taxiing. Taxi spacing will be a minimum of 300 feet and on taxiway center line. The
   landing/taxi lights will normally be used during all night taxiing. EXCEPTION: Landing
   and/or taxi lights may be turned off when they might interfere with the vision of the pilots of
   an aircraft landing or taking off. Pilots will bring the aircraft to a stop when the area cannot
   be visually and safely cleared.
   3.5.3. Pattern Restrictions. Night VFR rectangular patterns, tactical patterns, visual
   straight-in approaches and circling approaches may be flown with the following restrictions:
      3.5.3.1. Simulated single-engine and no-flap approaches and patterns, as well as, circling
      approaches may be flown at night if the ceiling and visibility is at least 2,000 feet and 3
      statute miles (sm) or circling minimums, whichever is greater.
      3.5.3.2. Fields used for this training must be familiar; that is, instructors must have
      accomplished either T-1A daylight VFR pattern operations or a daylight circling
      approach at the airfield prior to night operations.
      3.5.3.3. Visual or instrument glide path guidance (including global positioning system
      (GPS) vertical navigation received from a published area navigation (RNAV) instrument
      approach) must be available and used for all off-station night landings.
   3.5.4. Filing:
      3.5.4.1. For all night operations (unless required for syllabus-directed training), do not
      file to a destination other than home station unless there is operable straight-in approach
      with glide path guidance. Aircrews may perform en route descents at facilities with no
      glide path guidance, however will not descend lower than the published minimum
      descent altitude (MDA). Note: Visual descent path indicator, precision guidance systems
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                       17


       or GPS vertical navigation received from a published RNAV instrument approach,
       constitute acceptable forms of glide path guidance.
       3.5.4.2. Do not file to a destination at night if a circling approach is the only available
       approach.
       3.5.4.3. For night instrument flight rules (IFR) operations, alternates must have an
       operational instrument straight-in approach.
   3.5.5. Lighting. If requested by runway supervisory unit controllers, aircrews may turn off
   strobe lights during the hours of darkness while in the home base traffic pattern.
3.6. Take-off and Landing Minimums and Pilot Weather Category (PWC). PWCs are
designed to reduce the exposure of pilots with limited experience to the risks inherent during
periods of low ceiling and visibility. See AFI 11-2T-1, Volume 1, for PWC certification
requirements.
   3.6.1. Requirements:
       3.6.1.1. Certified PWC 1 pilots require weather equivalent to published ceiling and
       visibility approach minimums.
       3.6.1.2. PWC 2 pilots require weather minimums of no less than a ceiling of 300 feet and
       visibility of 1 sm (5,000 feet runway visual range [RVR]) or published approach
       minimums, whichever is greater. EXCEPTION: PWC 2 pilots may utilize published
       ceiling and visibility approach minimums at home station.
       3.6.1.3. Published ceiling and visibility approach minimums may be utilized if at least
       one certified PWC 1 pilot is occupying one of the pilot seats.
       3.6.1.4. When overriding mission requirements dictate, operations group commanders
       may individually authorize any qualified T-1A pilot to use published approach
       minimums.
       3.6.1.5. If available, utilize runway approach-end RVR to determine visibility criteria.
       3.6.1.6. Autopilot coupled instrument approaches (CSO only). Minimum weather for
       CSO-flown autopilot coupled instrument approaches is a ceiling of 700 feet and visibility
       of 2 sm, or approach minimum weather, whichever is greater.
3.7. Weather and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR):
   3.7.1. Weather Restrictions:
       3.7.1.1. The T-1A will not be flown in areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence,
       severe icing, freezing rain, or freezing drizzle. If severe icing or turbulence is
       encountered on a mission, but was not forecast, notify appropriate weather personnel or
       Air Traffic Control (ATC).
       3.7.1.2. Do not cruise or conduct multiple pattern operations in actual moderate icing
       conditions.
       3.7.1.3. If required weather minimums cannot be maintained during a low level, abort
       the route IAW applicable directives.
18                                                         AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


     3.7.1.4. Do not exceed 30 degrees of bank in instrument meteorological conditions
     (IMC) unless safety of flight dictates otherwise.
     3.7.1.5. Aircrews should use all available cockpit aids to increase situational awareness
     during night or IMC operations, including loading and displaying flight management
     system (FMS) approach data on the multi-function display (MFD) for all approaches.
     This does not preclude setting the MFD to traffic mode to enhance student training during
     day VMC.
  3.7.2. Filing:
     3.7.2.1. Destination. Do not file to a destination unless the ceiling and visibility for the
     estimated time of arrival (ETA) (plus or minus 1 hour) is at or above the appropriate
     PWC or suitable published minimums, whichever is greater. (EXCEPTION: If two or
     more suitable alternate airfields are available, aircrews may file flight plans to the home
     field when the terminal weather is forecast to be below published landing minimums.)
     Aircrews will compute divert fuel for the most distant alternate.
     3.7.2.2. Alternate. See AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Aircrews will file an alternate whenever
     forecast crosswinds (plus or minus 1 hour of ETA) for the intended landing runway at a
     destination are out of limits.
  3.7.3. Remote or Island Destination. Aircrews going to a remote or island destination will
  have fuel on board to hold 1 hour and 15 minutes (1+15) at the destination fix in place of an
  alternate. Forecast weather will meet the following restrictions for ETA plus 2 hours:
     3.7.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits.
     3.7.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be at or above published minimums for
     an available non-precision approach (excluding approach surveillance radar [ASR]) or, if
     a precision approach is available, the ceiling and visibility may be intermittently below
     non-precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
     minimums.
  3.7.4. Takeoff:
     3.7.4.1. Minimums. Base the decision to launch local (home station) sorties on the
     existing weather and forecast for planned landing plus 1 hour. Base the decision to launch
     non-local (off-station) sorties on the existing weather at takeoff time. Pilots will utilize
     ceiling and visibility to determine adequate departure weather. PWC 2 pilots require a
     ceiling of at least 300 feet and visibility of 1 sm or published suitable approach
     minimums, whichever is higher, unless flying with a PWC 1 pilot. EXCEPTION: PWC 2
     pilots may use suitable published approach minimums less than 300 feet and 1 sm if
     departing the pilot’s home station.
     3.7.4.2. IFR Departures. Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as
     outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. Aircrews and
     supervisors must consider the criteria listed in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, when using the
     options listed below:
         3.7.4.2.1. Vertically Clear All Obstacles. See AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 19


         3.7.4.2.2. Unable to Met Required Climb Gradient. When higher priority methods
         of departing IFR are not possible and if authorized according to AFI 11-202, Volume
         3, aircrews may depart VFR or climb in VMC to a safe IFR altitude (e.g. Min Enroute
         Altitude, Min Safe Altitude, etc.) provided a minimum 2.5 climbout factor is met, and
         the weather permits a VMC emergency return to the departure field from an
         appropriate minimum IFR altitude.
         3.7.4.2.3. Visual Climb Over Airport (VCOA). Pilots may fly published VCOAs
         after completion of MAJCOM-approved training. Note: Ensure airspeeds during
         maneuvering are appropriate for aircraft configuration and bank angle. Target
         airspeed during VCOA departure is 180 KIAS.
  3.7.5. Penetration and Approach. Do not begin a penetration, enroute descent, or
  approach unless existing ceiling and visibility meet or exceed the requirements for the
  approach being flown or PWC 2 minimums, as applicable. During actual IMC, a precision
  approach (instrument landing system [ILS] or precision approach radar [PAR]) monitored by
  surveillance radar is the preferred approach. This does not prevent instrument training for
  other types of approaches if the ceiling and visibility are at or above required minimums for
  the approach being flown.
     3.7.5.1. After commencing a penetration or approach, if weather subsequently is reported
     below the required minimums (ceiling or visibility), the approach may be continued to a
     missed approach or landing. Aircrew must ensure the aircraft has sufficient fuel to
     execute a missed approach and land at the alternate airfield with required fuel reserves.
     PWC 2 decision height (DH), decision altitude (DA) or MDA will be determined by
     reference to the TDZE for straight-in approaches and field elevation for circling
     approaches. Use field elevation if TDZE is unavailable.
     3.7.5.2. Pilots may descend below the DH/DA/MDA if the aircraft is in a position to
     make a normal approach to the runway of intended landing and the pilot clearly sees the
     approach threshold of the runway, approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the
     approach end of the runway. In all cases, the pilot will comply with the last clearance
     received until obtaining a revised clearance.
     3.7.5.3. The use of PWC 2 minimums on a precision approach ILS, PAR or a GPS
     approach flown to lateral navigation (LNAV)/vertical navigation (VNAV) minimums
     may require pilots to execute a missed approach prior to the published DH/DA. In these
     instances, upon reaching PWC 2 minimums and making the decision not to continue the
     approach, the pilot should start a climb immediately while proceeding to the missed
     approach point (MAP) or missed approach waypoint (MAWP). Upon reaching the
     MAP/MAWP, continue the missed approach procedure or ATC issued climb out
     instructions, as applicable.
     3.7.5.4. When flying instrument approaches in VMC, PWC 2 pilots may utilize
     published approach minimums if the runway environment is in sight. Note: If reported
     weather is 1,500 feet and 3 sm (ceiling/visibility) or better, PWC 2 pilots may set
     published minimums in their flight instruments. If reported weather is below 1,500 feet
     and 3 sm, PWC 2 pilots will set the greater of PWC 2 minimums or published approach
     minimums, unless flying with a PWC 1 pilot.

3.8. GPS Navigation:
   3.8.1. The T-1A is Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-equipped and meets the
   requirements for IFR GPS operations in the National Airspace System (NAS) Federal
   Aviation Administration (FAA)-controlled airspace) and is approved for RNAV 1 terminal
   (departure and arrival) and RNAV 2 en route operations (“T” and “Q” routes) (see TO 1T-
   1A-1 for aircraft certification information). T-1A aircrews may use GPS as the primary
   navigational source for all IFR operations from terminal departure through en route
   navigation to non-precision approach provided the aircraft contains a current Jeppesen®
   database.
   3.8.2. T-1A aircrews will check Jeppesen® NAVDATA Alerts/Change Notices/Notices to
   Airmen (NOTAM) prior to every flight in which the Jeppesen® database will be relied upon.
   3.8.3. The flight director must be utilized for all published RNAV operations in which GPS
   is the primary navigation source. Autopilot use is highly encouraged.
      3.8.3.1. Aircrews are expected to maintain route and course centerlines for all RNAV
      operations.
   3.8.4. “DME/DME” and “WAAS” notations on published “RNAV” instrument procedures
   are not applicable to the T-1A. If a published RNAV procedure requires either, and has no
   provision for GNSS or GPS, T-1A aircrew may not file or fly the procedure. Additionally, T-
   1A aircrews are not authorized to fly instrument approaches labeled “RNAV/RNP.” Suitable
   procedures for the T-1A will state “GPS Required” or “GNSS.”
   3.8.5. Since the T-1A control data unit (CDU) does not display RNAV waypoint type (flyby
   or flyover), and to meet the requirements of AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, aircrews must be
   vigilant to ensure that flight director guidance corresponds to each waypoint type as
   published in FLIP while flying published RNAV terminal and en route procedures. In rare
   instances of a database error, pilot intervention of flight director guidance may be required to
   ensure the procedure is flown as published.
   3.8.6. MAJCOM review and approval of the Jeppesen® database is required for IFR
   operations outside the NAS.
   3.8.7. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). RAIM must be available
   during all operations utilizing GPS as the primary navigational source.
      3.8.7.1. Preflight Planning. Aircrews must check predictive RAIM if intending to file
      published RNAV terminal or en route procedures. Approved sources for checking
      predictive RAIM are www.raimprediction.net, flight service stations, or approved
      military sources.
          3.8.7.1.1. If RAIM is not available along the planned or actual route of flight for
          more than 5 continuous minutes, aircrews should alter routing or plan the flight
          utilizing traditional navigational sources.
          3.8.7.1.2. If the only suitable approach at an intended destination requires GPS,
          aircrews must check predictive RAIM prior to filing for that airfield, unless weather
          allows for VFR arrival, approach, and landing IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 21


     3.8.7.2. Aircraft Operations. Aircrews will check predictive RAIM utilizing the
     aircraft FMS prior to:
         3.8.7.2.1. Takeoff for any RNAV departure procedure (DP).
         3.8.7.2.2. Commencing any RNAV standard terminal arrival (STAR) or RNAV
         instrument approach procedure.
  3.8.8. RNAV (GPS) Instrument Approach. When flying GPS “Overlay” approaches, the
  underlying navigational aids (NAVAID) must be operational and properly displayed on the
  “pilot monitoring” instruments. Day VMC is required for GPS overlay approaches if the
  underlying NAVAID cannot be displayed.
     3.8.8.1. The T-1A is certified for circling, LNAV MDA, and LNAV/VNAV DA minima
     for RNAV approaches. Because the T-1A is not WAAS-equipped, aircrews may not use:
     “GLS” or “LPV” minimums.
     3.8.8.2. Aircrews must closely monitor the electronic attitude director indicator (EADI)
     and CDU for FMS messages during RNAV approaches. The following CDU messages
     require termination of an RNAV approach and coordination with ATC for an alternate
     clearance or execution of a missed approach: “GPS-FMS DISAGREE,” “GPS NOT
     AVAILABLE,” “NO GPS RAIM,” “NO APPR GPS RAIM” (see TO 1T-1A-1 for
     message descriptions). These messages are not all inclusive and aircrews will coordinate
     for an alternate clearance anytime FMS/GPS integrity is in doubt.
     3.8.8.3. Because the T-1A FMS utilizes an uncompensated barometric-vertical
     navigation (BARO-VNAV) aiding system, “cold temperature limitations” apply to T-1A
     RNAV approach operations IAW AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. Additionally, aircrews
     may not descend to LNAV/VNAV minimums with remote altimeter settings. (See
     AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, for additional guidance.)
     3.8.8.4. Since the T-1A CDU does not display RNAV instrument approach segment
     distances in tenths of a mile and to meet the requirements of AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1,
     aircrews must ensure that once established on the unverified segments of the approach,
     the electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI) distance is evaluated to ensure an
     appropriate published charted value. If the value is appropriate based on current aircraft
     position, crews may continue the approach. Deviations from expected values should be
     treated conservatively and crews will abort the approach if the evaluated distance does
     not correspond to within 0.1 nm of the FLIP published value.
  3.8.9. RNAV 1 Terminal Procedures. The T-1A is certified for FLIP published RNAV 1
  [1 nm total system error (TSE)] DPs and RNAV 1 STARs. RNAV DPs and STARS are
  RNAV 1 unless depicted otherwise. Some RNAV 2 procedures exist within the NAS, and
  aircrews may fly these procedures using RNAV 1 guidance. RNAV DPs and STARs must be
  retrieved, in their entirety, by procedure name from the FMS database and aircrews must
  ensure that the proper departure or arrival runway is selected. Manual entry of waypoints
  using latitude/longitude or place/bearing is prohibited.
     3.8.9.1. Since RNAV 1 procedures require lateral deviation of no more than 0.5 nm,
     aircrews must not exceed one dot on the course deviation indicator (CDI) of the EHSI
     (approximately 0.5 nm) while in the “Terminal Mode,” with the display select panel
22                                                        AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


     (DSP) set to “FMS, FMS” and flight director set to “NAV.” Additionally, aircrews
     should monitor cross track utilizing the MFD or CDU “Progress” page.
         3.8.9.1.1. Some RNAV 1 terminal procedures may begin or terminate outside of the
         FMS “Terminal Mode” 30 nm area. In these instances, one dot displacement on the
         CDI will not approximate the required RNAV 1 lateral accuracy.
         3.8.9.1.2. Any time a segment of an RNAV 1 terminal procedure is flown outside of
         the 30 nm “Terminal Mode” area, aircrews must monitor cross track utilizing the
         MFD or CDU to ensure the aircraft remains within the 0.5 nm lateral tolerance of the
         RNAV 1 routing.
     3.8.9.2. Aircrews must closely monitor the EADIs and CDU for FMS messages during
     RNAV 1 procedures. The following CDU messages indicate position errors exceeding
     RNAV 1 tolerances, and require termination of RNAV 1 procedures and coordination
     with ATC for an alternate clearance: “GPS-FMS DISAGREE,” “GPS NOT
     AVAILABLE,” “NO GPS RAIM.” (See TO 1T-1A-1 for message descriptions.) These
     messages are not all inclusive and aircrews will coordinate for an alternate clearance
     anytime FMS/GPS integrity is in doubt.
     3.8.9.3. Course difference of up to 3 degrees is acceptable when comparing FMS loaded
     RNAV 1 departure or arrival procedures from the aircraft database to the FLIP published
     courses.
     3.8.9.4. During RNAV 1 DPs, aircrews will select “NAV” on the flight director as soon
     as practical after takeoff to ensure lateral RNAV guidance is available and followed.
  3.8.10. RNAV 2 En Route Procedures. The T-1A is certified for FLIP published RNAV 2
  (2 nm TSE) en route operations in Required Navigation Performance airspace (“Q” or “T”
  designated routes found in FLIP). These procedures will be depicted and identified on FLIP
  as “RNAV 2.” Whenever possible, RNAV 2 routes should be extracted from the FMS
  database, in their entirety, by inserting the starting and ending waypoints and utilizing the
  route name in the “VIA” line of the flight plan pages of the CDU. Selecting and inserting
  individual, named fixes from the database is permitted utilizing the “TO” lines, however all
  fixes along the published route to be flown must be inserted. Manual entry of waypoints using
  latitude/longitude or place/bearing is prohibited.
     3.8.10.1. Since CDI lateral deviation is automatically set by the FMS to 5 nm outside of
     the 30 NM terminal area (with FMS selected on the DSP), aircrews must monitor cross
     track utilizing the MFD or CDU to ensure the aircraft remains within the 1.0 nm lateral
     tolerance of the RNAV 2 routing.
     3.8.10.2. Aircrews must closely monitor the EADIs and CDU for FMS messages during
     RNAV 2 procedures. The following CDU FMS messages indicate position errors
     exceeding RNAV 2 tolerances and require termination of RNAV 2 procedures and
     coordination with ATC for an alternate clearance: “GPS-FMS DISAGREE,” “GPS NOT
     AVAILABLE,” “NO GPS RAIM.” (See TO 1T-1A-1.) These messages are not all
     inclusive and aircrews will coordinate for an alternate clearance anytime FMS and/or
     GPS integrity is in doubt.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     23


      3.8.10.3. Course difference of up to 3 degrees is acceptable when comparing the FMS
      loaded RNAV 2 route from the aircraft database to the FLIP published courses.
3.9. Low Level:
   3.9.1. Weather. Comply with VFR cloud clearance requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   For locally published routes, slow routes (SR), and instrument routes (IR), aircrew will
   ensure a minimum ceiling and visibility of 1,500 feet and 3 sm. For VFR training visual
   routes (VR) see AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2.
   3.9.2. Groundspeeds. Planned ground speeds on military training routes are 210 and 240
   knots (maximum planned ground speed is 270 knots). Aircrews should avoid actual ground
   speeds exceeding 300 knots.
   3.9.3. Altitudes. Plan altitudes which provide adequate terrain and obstacle clearance. The
   minimum allowable altitude on all low levels is 500 feet above the highest terrain or obstacle
   or greater if specified in FLIP, within 2,000 feet of the aircraft.
   3.9.4. Obstacle Clearances. Towers and other manufactured obstacles are more difficult to
   see than high terrain. Aircrew will fly a minimum of 500 feet above the highest unseen
   obstacle within 2 NM of the aircraft. Once the obstacle is visually acquired, aircrews will fly
   a minimum of 500 feet above, or laterally avoid the obstacle by a minimum of 2,000 feet.
   3.9.5. Maneuvering. During low-level operations, aircrews will not exceed 45 degrees of
   bank unless required for safety of flight.
   3.9.6. Daylight Restrictions. Enter the route no earlier than 30 minutes after sunrise (1 hour
   for mountainous terrain) and exit the route no later than 30 minutes prior to sunset (1 hour for
   mountainous terrain). See Figure 3.1.
 24                                                       AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011


Figure 3.1. Air Defense Identification Zone Boundaries and Designated Mountainous
Terrain.




3.10. Airdrop:
   3.10.1. Altitude. The simulated airdrop maneuver is performed at a minimum of 1,000 feet
   AGL or 500 feet above planned route altitude. When accomplished in a military operating
   area (MOA), flight lead will determine an appropriate altitude. On the route, wingman will
   never fly below lead or 500 feet AGL, whichever is higher, unless safety dictates otherwise.
   (EXCEPTION: Wingman may fly below lead’s altitude during a climbing egress from a
   simulated airdrop or during route exit.) Whenever a flight path conflict with lead exists,
   wingman should attempt to cross high in relation to lead.
   3.10.2. Configuration. Airdrop configuration is 10 degrees flap setting and 140 KIAS
   minimum. (Airspeed may be higher as briefed by flight lead.)
3.11. Formation Restrictions:
   3.11.1. Takeoff, Approach, and Landing:
      3.11.1.1. Visual formation departures are not authorized when IMC will be encountered.
      Separate departures (a separation of 1 minute or as determined locally) will be made with
      a join-up on top.
      3.11.1.2. When IMC will be encountered, formation instrument approaches are not
      authorized.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                      25


       3.11.1.3. Drag approaches are authorized to expedite formation recoveries, but they must
       comply with the separation criteria.
   3.11.2. Maneuvering:
       3.11.2.1. Practice lost wingman will be performed in day VMC above 1,000 feet AGL.
       3.11.2.2. Formation is prohibited in IMC. Formations on an IFR clearance will maintain
       clear of clouds. Formations under a VFR clearance will maintain VFR cloud clearances
       IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
       3.11.2.3. The maximum number of aircraft in formation is two.
       3.11.2.4. The maximum airspeed for number two is 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet mean
       sea level.
       3.11.2.5. The minimum altitude for formation position changes is 1,000 feet AGL.
3.12. Simulated Air Refueling:
   3.12.1. Turbulence Restriction. Do not fly precontact (astern) or contact positions in
   conditions exceeding light turbulence. Turbulence is limited to no greater than moderate up
   to the astern position.
   3.12.2. Separation. Receiver aircraft will maintain 1,000 feet below air refueling base
   altitude until visual contact is established with the tanker. Rendezvous closure will not be
   continued when the in-flight visibility is such that the receiver does not have visual contact
   with the tanker at 1 nm.
   3.12.3. Weather. Weather criteria for flying precontact (astern) and contact positions are an
   in-flight visibility of 1 mile and clear of clouds.
   3.12.4. Altitude Restriction. Do not conduct closures to astern or contact from the 1 mile
   visual position above FL 310.
3.13. Air Intercept:
   3.13.1. Maximum Participating Aircraft. Maximum participating aircraft during air
   intercept is two.
   3.13.2. Separation. Aircraft will coordinate to accept MARSA (Military Assumes
   Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft) and will maintain a minimum of 1,000 vertical feet
   of separation during role reversals.
       3.13.2.1. During role reversals, participating aircraft will ensure a minimum of 1 nm
       separation utilizing the air-to-air (A/A) function of the aircraft TACAN (Tactical Air
       Navigation) and diverging courses before swapping intercept altitudes. The mission
       commander may direct the altitude swap with the aircraft commander’s concurrence.
       3.13.2.2. Both aircraft will report established on altitude with the proper altimeter setting
       before commencing subsequent intercepts.
       3.13.2.3. Both aircraft will squawk an ATC assigned or VFR transponder code (as
       applicable) during air intercept operations.

  3.13.3. Maneuvering. Aircraft will not exceed 45 degrees of bank and 2 Gs; and
  maneuvering will occur in the horizontal plane only. Maximum use of the autopilot is
  recommended.
     3.13.3.1. Maximum planned intercept airspeed for participating aircraft is 0.6 indicated
     MACH number (IMN).
     3.13.3.2. Target aircraft are limited to 30 degrees of bank and should not exceed 60
     degrees of heading change either side of planned intercept course.
     3.13.3.3. Target aircraft will cease maneuvering (roll wings level) no later than passing
     the attacking aircraft’s 3/9 line (determined visually or on aircraft systems) unless
     required to maintain airspace boundaries, avoid weather and/or hazards or directed by
     ATC.
     3.13.3.4. Both A/A TACANs and automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B)
     (GDL-90) functions are required to be operable on both aircraft during air intercept.
     EXCEPTION: This does not apply to air intercept training utilizing simulated targets.
  3.13.4. Altitude Restriction. Air intercept will not be conducted below 5,000 AGL.
  3.13.5. Airspace. Air intercept will only be accomplished in special use airspace.
  3.13.6. Weather. Day-VMC only with a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical (above and below)
  and 1 NM horizontal cloud clearance and 5 nm in-flight visibility.
  3.13.7. Terminate. Intercepts will terminate via an interplane radio call no later than the
  point at which the attacking aircraft acquires a zero aspect on the target aircraft; or to initiate
  role reversal; or for break-up recovery.
  3.13.8. Mission Commander. A certified air intercept instructor pilot or instructor CSO
  will be designated as mission commander between the two participating aircraft during
  mission planning and is responsible for ensuring proper coordination, de-confliction and
  execution of the mission.
  3.13.9. Aircraft Maneuvering Calls. During air intercept training, CSOs will direct the
  pilot to maneuver the aircraft utilizing the following standardized interphone terminology:

      turn.
3.14. Advisory Calls: (See TO 1-1T-1A and applicable supplements for additional
information.)
   3.14.1. Mandatory Calls for Pilot Monitoring (PM). (PM refers to a student, pilot, or
   CSO occupying a position with direct access to a set of flight controls.) The PM will make
   the following calls:
      3.14.1.1. Nonprecision Approaches:
          3.14.1.1.1. “One hundred feet above” MDA (published, PWC or CSO, as applicable).
          3.14.1.1.2. “Minimums” at MDA (published, PWC or CSO, as applicable).
          3.14.1.1.3. “Runway in sight.” Call when the runway environment is, and will remain
          in sight. Avoid making the call too soon when obstructions to vision, such as fog,
          haze, low clouds, etc., are present.
          3.14.1.1.4. “Go around.” Call at the MAP if the runway environment is not in sight.
      3.14.1.2. Precision Approaches:
          3.14.1.2.1. “One hundred feet above DH/DA” (published, PWC or CSO, as
          applicable).
          3.14.1.2.2. “Continue.” Call at DH/DA if the runway environment is in sight but the
          runway red termination bars or the red side row bars are not visible or identifiable.
          When using the “continue” call at DH/DA, the “land” or “go around” calls described
          below may be delayed until 100 feet AGL above TDZE to line up with procedures
          described in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1. In order to call “land” at 100 feet, the red
          termination bars or the red side row bars must be visible and identifiable.
          3.14.1.2.3. “Land.” Call at DH/DA, if the runway is in sight and the aircraft is in a
          safe position for a normal landing.
          3.14.1.2.4. “Go around.” Call at DH/DA if the runway environment is not in sight or
          the aircraft is not in a safe position for a normal landing.
          3.14.1.2.5. When flying an RNAV approach to LNAV/VNAV minimums, use the
          precision approach calls. For all other GPS approaches, use nonprecision calls.
      3.14.1.3. Climbout:
          3.14.1.3.1. Transition altitude.

      3.14.1.5. Deviations. The PM will announce heading deviations, airspeed deviations of
      5 knots or more below desired, and altitude deviations of 100 feet or more from desired.
   3.14.2. Calls for Any Crewmember. Any crewmember will announce an altitude variation
   of 200 feet or more, an airspeed deviation of 10 knots from desired, any potential terrain or
   obstruction clearance problems, and airborne hazards (e.g., birds or traffic conflicts).
3.15. Simulated Emergencies:
   3.15.1. Procedures and Restrictions:
      3.15.1.1. Do not practice simulated emergency takeoff, approach, or landing procedures
      unless an IP is seated at, and has immediate access to aircraft controls and weather is a
      minimum of 1,500 feet and 3 sm.
      3.15.1.2. Brief all airborne simulated emergencies prior to execution. Compound or
      multiple simulated emergencies are prohibited.
      3.15.1.3. Maintain clear of clouds when conducting simulated emergencies.
      3.15.1.4. Do not practice a single-engine go-around after selecting 30 degree flaps.
      3.15.1.5. Do not initiate practice simulated engine failure below 500 feet AGL during
      takeoff or landing.
      3.15.1.6. Do not fly VFR single-engine and no-flap patterns from the tactical pattern.
      3.15.1.7. Discontinue simulated emergencies if intracockpit communications cannot be
      maintained.
      3.15.1.8. CSOs may only perform PM duties during simulated emergency procedures.
3.16. Uncontrolled Airfields: (See AFI 11-202, Volume 3.) Note: VFR pattern maneuvers
may only be flown at airfields with an approved MAJCOM letter of agreement (LOA).
   3.16.1. Each operations group commander will develop a training program to prepare
   aircrews to operate in the uncontrolled airfield environment. Prior to implementation,
   NAF/DO or MAJCOM/A3T must approve the training program. As a minimum, the program
   should include a discussion of all applicable codes of FAA regulations, advisory circulars,
   and Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), Official Guide to Basic Flight Information and
   ATC Procedures, references on uncontrolled and nontowered airport operations. Training
   will emphasize standard common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) radio phraseology and
   instrument approach procedures in a non-radar environment.
   3.16.2. Each operations group commander will develop VFR pattern procedures for each
   uncontrolled airfield utilized. These procedures should include (at a minimum): normal
   pattern operations, pattern breakout procedures and emergency procedures. Other
   information may be included at the OG/CCs discretion.
   3.16.3. With a certified IP in either pilot seat, T-1A aircrews may conduct VFR pattern
   operations at uncontrolled public-use airfields, with the following restrictions:
      3.16.3.1. They will be flown in the day only.
      3.16.3.2. They will be flown single ship only.
      3.16.3.3. Weather at the field must be equal to or greater than 3,000 feet and 3 sm.
AFI11-2T-1V3 3 OCTOBER 2011                                                                   29


     3.16.3.4. Winds must be within limits for each runway to which the aircrew operates.
     3.16.3.5. All patterns and approaches will be flown to a low approach unless landings are
     specifically permitted in the LOA. In the event an unplanned landing is required, the
     OG/CC will ensure fire or crash recovery and maintenance line personnel, as appropriate,
     are available for the subsequent launch. Aircrews will make CTAF radio calls prior to
     taxiing and taking the runway for takeoff.
     3.16.3.6. Aircrews will monitor the published CTAF frequency and will, at a minimum,
     make radio calls and position reports at approximately 10 miles from the airfield to report
     intentions; entering downwind; entering final; and departing the airfield.
     3.16.3.7. No more than two aircraft total, military or civilian, may be in the pattern. If
     additional aircraft enter the pattern for the purpose of performing multiple approaches, T-
     1A aircrews will depart the airfield as soon as practical. If additional aircraft enter the
     pattern for full stop landings only, aircrews do not need to depart the airfield, but may
     breakout of the pattern and re-enter once the aircraft has landed. If two or more aircraft
     are already in the traffic pattern, aircrew will not attempt to enter the pattern.
     3.16.3.8. Standard rectangular patterns will be flown left hand traffic, unless the airfield
     traffic pattern indicators or FLIP depict otherwise. No tactical patterns will be flown.
     3.16.3.9. Except for climbout after takeoff, the maximum airspeed for operations at an
     uncontrolled airfield is 200 KIAS.
     3.16.3.10. Instrument approaches will be flown under an IFR clearance, unless waived
     IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3. If cleared to switch to CTAF or IFR cancellation occurs,
     radio calls will be made to report the final approach fix or inbound segment of the
     approach; and upon termination or completion of the approach.
        3.16.3.10.1. Instrument approaches may be flown at non-LOA uncontrolled airfields
        for the purposes of descending below the weather to cancel IFR and proceed VFR
        (e.g., to facilitate entering a military training route).
     3.16.3.11. Aircrews will immediately notify the supervisor of flying if any hazardous
     conditions exist at an uncontrolled airfield that would prevent normal operations.
     3.16.3.12. Aircrews should refer to FAA AIM, Traffic Advisory Practices at Airports
     Without Operating Control Towers, for more information regarding uncontrolled airfield
     operations.

                                 OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy:
     4.1.1. Missions originating from the home station should not normally launch with a known
     malfunction. Official aircraft status is determined IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory,
     Status and Utilization Reporting. However, aircraft commanders may utilize the MEL (Table
     4.1) to determine the acceptability of an aircraft for a mission without further approval.
     4.1.2. It would be impractical to prepare a list that would anticipate all possible
     combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent circumstances. The MEL identifies
     the minimum equipment and systems required to launch the aircraft under normal conditions.
     The MEL represents MAJCOM restrictions only and does not include all equipment or
     systems essential to airworthiness, e.g., rudder, elevator, flaps, ailerons, tires, etc. Consider
     equipment and/or systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items.
     4.1.3. The aircraft commander is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure
     the aircraft is not accepted with inoperative equipment or systems that may result in an
     unsafe degradation and/or an undue increase in crew workload. The aircraft commander shall
     account for the possibility of additional failures during continued operation with inoperative
     systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefinite
     period with systems and/or subsystems inoperative.
     4.1.4. Once airborne, aircraft commanders must weigh all pertinent factors when deciding
     whether to continue or abort a sortie for an aircraft malfunction. Factors include weather
     conditions at home base and divert base, student’s mission requirements, etc.
     4.1.5. Operations group commanders may waive restrictions listed in the MEL or unlisted
     items and/or equipment on a flight-by-flight basis if there is no compromise of flight safety
     or Air Force directives. This authority may not be delegated below the group deputy
     commander.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the difference
between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the difference
between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

 Notes:
 1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
 2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
 3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
 difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
 4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
 5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
 6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
 LEGEND:
 F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
 T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
 NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.

 Notes:
 1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
 2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
 3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
 difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
 4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
 5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
 6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
 LEGEND:
 F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
 T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
 NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the difference
between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance
by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance
for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists. adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual. 3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway
slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the difference between the takeoff flare
distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists - adjust the touch and go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exist, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the difference
between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).

4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go distance
by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance
for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists. adjust the touch-and-go distance by the
difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.
6. Data is based on ACM ON and anti-ice OFF.
LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.

Notes:
1. If additional runway exists, use the T (throttles) decision point.
2. Data basis--flight test and flight manual.
3. Data is based on no slope. If a published runway slope exists, adjust the touch-and-go
distance by the difference between the takeoff flare distance with no slope and the takeoff flare
distance for the published slope.
4. Data is valid for an RCR of 23 (dry) or 12 (wet) and no wind. Headwind is considered a
benefit.
5. Add 50 feet for each 1 knot of tailwind up to 10 knots.

LEGEND:
F -- flaps (the go/no-go decision point).
T -- throttles (the go/no-go decision point).
NA -- The takeoff flare cannot be computed due to an inadequate climbout factor.
