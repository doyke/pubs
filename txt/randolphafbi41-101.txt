This instruction establishes guidelines for Randolph Air Force Base Public Access to
Defibrillation (PAD) Program and implements states and federal law. This program provides for
Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) to be placed in strategic locations on the installation.
Prior to arrival of medial personnel, these devices can be employed by trained individuals to
revive individuals who have suffered an acute cardiac event. This instruction identifies
responsibilities, maintenance, quality assurance, and documentation requirements. Ensure all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFM 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the
Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) (available at <https://afrims.amc.af.mil>).

This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information subject to the Privacy Act of
1974 authorized by 10, USC 8013. Section 9012, Title 10, United States Code, and Executive
Order 9397 are authority for establishing and maintaining medical records.
