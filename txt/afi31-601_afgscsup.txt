   SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING DD FORM 254, DOD CONTRACT
              SECURITY CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION

A3.1. (Added). General Information.
A3.1.1. (Added). A classified contract is any contract that requires, or will require, access to
classified information by contractor personnel in performance of the contract. (A contract may
be a classified contract even though the contract document is not classified.)
A3.1.2. (Added). The government provides guidance to prime contractors for classified
contracts primarily by incorporating DD Form 254, DoD Contract Security Classification
Specification, into every classified contract. The DD Form 254 tells the contractor what needs to
be protected and to what degree. The DD Form 254, with its attachments and incorporated
references, is the only authorized means for providing security classification guidance to a
contractor. It should be written as specifically as possible, and it should include only that
information that pertains to the contract for which it is issued. Do not cite government
regulations in the DD Form 254. The contractor rarely has the regulation and may be confused
by the citation. If access to a regulation is absolutely essential, cite the appropriate regulation in
the DD Form 254. The government program manager must ensure the contractor receives a copy
of the necessary regulation.
A3.1.3. (Added). If any attachment to the DD Form 254 includes classified information, refer
to it in Item 13 as a separately transmitted instruction rather than as an attachment. Cite a short
title or use whatever means necessary to identify such instructions without inserting classified
information on the form. Transmit classified information separately from the DD Form 254.
A3.1.4. (Added). The contracting office will forward one copy of the DD Form 254 and a copy
of the SOW to the Wing IP for review and coordination purposes. The Wing IP’s coordination is
annotated in "Block 13" of the DD Form 254 or a separate attachment, if required.
A3.1.5. (Added). The DD Form 254 must be an original, and all entries must be typewritten.
Do not staple the DD Form 254 to any other document. For original (new buy) DD Forms 254,
enter the Purchase Request (PR) number in pencil in the margin. Corrections made using
correction fluid or tape must be neat and legible.
A3.1.6. (Added). DD Forms 254 should be forwarded to the Wing IP for coordination, through
the base mail system if time allows.
A3.1.7. (Added). The form must contain the signature of the certifying official prior to
distribution.
A3.2. (Added). Item-By-Item Instructions
A3.2.1. (Added). Item 1, Clearance and Safeguarding.
A3.2.1.1.1. (Added). Item 1.a. Insert the highest level of facility clearance required by the
contractor for performance of the contract. Use only the words "TOP SECRET," "SECRET," or
"CONFIDENTIAL." Special caveats such as RESTRICTED DATA, FORMERLY
RESTRICTED DATA, COMSEC INFORMATION, etc., are not appropriate in this item. The
contractor must have a valid facility clearance at least as high as the classification indicated in
this item.
A3.2.1.2. (Added). Item 1.b. Insert the highest level of safeguarding capability required by the
contractor for performance of the contract. The classification level shown in 1.b may not be
6                                                     AFI 31-601_AFGSCSUP 20 August 2010


higher than that shown in Item 1.a. If the contractor will not possess classified information at the
cleared facility in performing the contract, enter "Not Applicable" (N/A) or "None."
A3.2.1.3. (Added). NOTE: If 11.a is "YES," safeguarding capability IS NOT required. If
11.b or c is "YES," safeguarding capability IS required.
A3.2.2. (Added). Items 2. and 3.
A3.2.2.1. (Added). For an original (new buy) DD Form 254:
A3.2.2.1.1. (Added). Item 2.a. Insert "X" (contract number is entered at time of award by
contracting official.)
A32.2.1.2. (Added). Item 2.b. Do not use. For prime contractor use only.
A3.2.2.1.3. (Added). Item 2.c. Insert "X" (solicitation or other number and due date
(YYMMDD).
A3.2.2.1.4. (Added). Item 3.a. Insert "X" in block before 3.a and the current date
(YYMMDD).
A3.2.2.2. (Added). For a revised DD Form 254:
A3.2.2.2.1. (Added). Item 2.a. Enter existing contract number.
A3.2.2.2.2. (Added). Item 3.a. Enter date of original.
A3.2.2.2.3. (Added). Item 3.b. Enter "X," latest revision number, and current date
(YYMMDD).
A3.2.2.2.4. (Added). NOTE: The date of the original will appear unchanged on each revised
DD Form 254. Any change to DD Form 254 once it has been provided to a contractor either
during the solicitation process or upon award, will be made by revising the form. Each time a
revision is issued, it shall be given a sequential revision number.
A3.2.2.3. (Added). For a final DD Form 254:
A3.2.2.3.1. (Added). Item 3.a. Enter date of original.
A3.2.2.3.2. (Added). Item 3.b. Enter latest revision number and date of latest revision
(YYMMDD).
A3.2.2.3.3. (Added). Item 3.c. Enter "X" in 3.c and current date (YYMMDD).
A3.2.2.3.4. (Added). NOTE: When a final DD Form 254 is issued, Item 5 is always marked
"YES." Issue a final DD Form 254 only when a contract is completed and retention of the
classified material has been authorized, or the material in question is declassified.
A3.2.3. (Added). Item 4: This item pertains to follow-on contracts. To qualify as a follow-on
contract, the new contract must be to the same contractor for the same item or service as the
preceding contract. When these conditions exist, enter "X" in the "YES" box, and enter the
preceding contract number in the space provided. This item authorizes the contractor to transfer
classified material received or generated under the preceding contract to the current contract. It is
assumed that the contractor will require access to the same information for performance of the
follow-on contract as was required for the previous contract. If the preceding contract is not
complete, transfer of accountability is not permitted; enter "X" in "NO." An active contract
justifies possession of the classified material.
A3.2.4. (Added). Item 5. Issue a final DD Form 254 only when a contract is complete and
retention of the classified material has been authorized, or the material in question has been
declassified. If a final DD Form 254 is being issued, enter "X" in the "YES" box, the date of the
contractor’s request for retention and the authorized period of retention in the spaces provided.
Retention period will not extend beyond 2 years. If a final DD Form 254 is not being issued,
enter "X" in "NO."
A3.2.5. (Added). Item 6.
AFI 31-601_AFGSCSUP 20 August 2010                                                              7

A3.2.5.2. (Added). NOTE: When applicable, enter the name and address of the prime foreign
contractor in Item 6.a, when contract performance is outside the U. S., Puerto Rico, or a U. S.
possession, territory, or trust territory. In Item 6.c, enter the name and address of the following
government agency who will notify the appropriate security officials of the foreign government
responsible for enforcing security requirements in the foreign contractor facility:
        Defense Security Service
        Office of International Programs
        1340 Braddock Place
        Alexandria, VA 22314-1651
A3.2.5.3. (Added). Also, the USAF program/project manager (Item 13) and certifying official
(Item 16) must include in the contract document or in Item 13, any special security clauses or
physical security requirements necessary by virtue of the foreign location.
A3.2.5.4. (Added). All release of classified information to foreign nationals must agree with
National Disclosure Policy. Coordinate any classified contract involving foreign disclosure with
your Foreign Disclosure office.
A3.2.6. (Added). Item 7. Enter "N/A" in 7.a, b, and c. (This item is not used by the Air Force,
only the prime contractor when subcontracting.)
A3.2.7. (Added). Item 8. If work is to be performed at another contractor’s facility other than
as specified in 6.a, enter the appropriate name and address in Item 8.a, the Cage Code in 8.b, and
the CSO in 8.c. If work will not be performed at another contractor’s facility, enter "N/A" in 8.a,
b, and c. If work will not be performed at another contractor’s facility, but at a government
installation, enter "See Item 13" in 8.a, and list the performance location in item 13. The CSO is
always the DSS Director of Industrial Security who has industrial security jurisdiction over the
geographical area in which the contractor is located -- no other activity should be shown in this
block. If inspections will be conducted by someone other than the CSO, enter "See Item 15" in
8.c and enter that information in Item 15. (See instructions for Item 11.a, for additional
information.)
A3.2.8. (Added). Item 9. Enter a brief, yet sufficiently complete unclassified statement to
identify the nature of the procurement. Use a general description of the procurement. Do not
use stock numbers or part numbers.

COMSEC material/information must submit a request to the appropriate Air Force or National
Security Agency (NSA) central office of record through the contracting or program office. If
applicable, mark this item "YES." COMSEC information includes accountable or non-
accountable COMSEC information and controlled cryptographic items (CCI). If accountable
COMSEC information is involved, the contractor must have an Air Force or NSA COMSEC
account or be supported by a COMSEC account and Item 11.h should be marked "YES." An
"X" in the "YES" box imposes the requirements of the COMSEC Supplement to the NISPOM on
the contractor for safeguarding the COMSEC information. If this item is marked "YES," enter
the following statement in Item 13:
8                                                    AFI 31-601_AFGSCSUP 20 August 2010


A3.2.9.1.1. (Added). "Ref. 10.a: COMSEC material/information may not be released to DOD
contractors without Air Force Cryptological Support Center (AFCSC) approval. Contractor must
forward requests for COMSEC material/information to the COMSEC officer through the

material by personnel is restricted to U. S. citizens holding final U. S. Government clearances.
Such information is not releasable to personnel holding only reciprocal clearances."
A3.2.9.2. (Added). Item 10.b, RESTRICTED DATA. This item will be marked "YES" if
access to RESTRICTED DATA, information which is classified and controlled under the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or CRITICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN INFORMATION

A3.2.9.5. (Added). Item 10.e, INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION. Special Security Office
(SSO) coordination is required on each DD Form 254 for contracts involving intelligence
releases and should coordinate prior to the Wing IP. If a determination is made that the
contractor will require access to intelligence information during contract performance, the
contract monitor prepares the DD Form 254 and routes through SSO for coordination and
instructions on release of intelligence information to contractors. The contract monitor will
receive instructions from the SSO for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or non-SCI
(or both if applicable), attach the appropriate one to the DD Form 254, and show as an
attachment in Item 14. Item 10.e(1) or (2) should be marked accordingly. The contract monitor
