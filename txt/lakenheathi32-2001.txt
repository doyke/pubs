                        ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

1.1. Mission. Our mission is to provide superior Fire Emergency Services (FES) to protect
lives, property and the environment from adverse effects of emergency situations that have been
created by either man or nature. Our core mission is incident command (IC), fire prevention,
firefighting (aircraft/structural/etc.), technical rescue (Motor Vehicle Accidents/Road Traffic
Accidents, Confined Space Rescue, Collapse/Trench), mitigating hazardous materials at the
operations level, and first responder first aid. Our secondary mission supports Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive to include Hazardous Material offensive
operations, Emergency Medical Service (EMS), miscellaneous emergencies, and mutual aid.
1.2. Values. We accomplish this by providing; technical consultant services; promoting
aggressive fire prevention and public education programs; and maintaining a professional FES
force to protect the lives, property, and environment.
1.3. Standards. This agency will comply with the relevant standards IAW DoDI 6055.6, DoD
Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program, promulgated by the Department of Labor-
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
National Fire Codes, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for
Facilities, and other fire safety criteria published by the Department of Defense.
1.4. Objective. A successful fire prevention program requires command support at all levels
and the continued involvement of all personnel. The Fire Emergency Services Flight (48
CES/CEF), commanders/functional managers, supervisors, facility managers, tenant units, and
all military and civilian personnel must take adequate measures to eliminate and prevent fires or
fire safety hazards. Loss of life due to inadequate fire prevention can never be condoned. Loss
of property will result in unnecessary expenditure of funds, inconvenience, and costly delays in
mission accomplishment, which could seriously hinder the national defense effort. Since the
most effective means of reducing fire losses is an aggressive fire prevention program, all
personnel must strictly adhere to the provisions of this publication. There are four primary focus
areas of Fire Prevention, to include, plans review, facility inspection, code enforcement, and
public education. Although the Fire Chief is charged with managing the program he/she must
rely on Commanders to enforce the program and Installation personnel to execute the program.
1.5. Response. Firefighters respond to emergency events that pose risk to personnel or property
and employ management actions within the limits of available resources. FES provides on-scene
incident management, fire prevention, firefighting, aircraft, rescue, managing hazardous
materials incidents (including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high yield
explosive (CBRNE) agents) that result from accidents or terrorism. FES may assist the primary
EMS as determined by local agreements and only when FES resources are available.
1.6. Authority   Having     Jurisdiction     (AHJ). Deviation  from    established Fire
Prevention/Emergency Services Policy will be handled IAW DoDI 6055.06, AFI 32-10141 and
AFI 32-2001.
1.7. Fire Emergency Services Personnel. Those delegated authority to affect stoppage of
operations when deemed necessary to protect life or property from fire, fire threat, or life safety

infractions (i.e., confined space, trench operations, etc.). During such situations all unauthorized
personnel will be restricted from the area.
1.8. Incident Commander (IC). IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM)
Program Planning and Operations, the IC in charge at the scene of an emergency has authority
to utilize available military vehicles, materials, and personnel considered necessary for prompt
mitigation of an emergency incident. The IC may solicit voluntary civilian assistance.
1.9. Enforcement. Commanders, functional managers, real property facility managers and
supervisors shall continually emphasize compliance of this instruction. Disciplinary action may
be initiated where willful misconduct compromising the safety of the base populace occurs.
Examples of such behavior are willfully transmitting false or emergency alarms, tampering with
or negligence of fire protection equipment, and disregarding policies that jeopardize lives and/or
government property. Violations are subject to adverse administrative action, to include
debarment from base or dismissal from base housing, or punishment under the UCMJ or other
applicable laws.
