This Instruction defines the Hill Air Force Base (Hill AFB) Central Technical Order
Management Committee (CTOM), the Hill AFB Technical Order Advisory Council (TOAC) and
their members’ responsibilities. The Air Force and Air Force Material Command (AFMC)
CTOM and TOAC are established in accordance with AFI63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment
Life Cycle Management , and AFMCI 21-301, Air Force Materiel Command Technical Order
System Implementing Policies. This Hill AFB Instruction provides additional detailed guidance
necessary for effective CTOM and TOAC implementation at the Center level. Technical Order
Management oversight is critical to the success of several Air Force transformation initiatives
such as Electronic Technical Information Management System (ETIMS) and Expeditionary
Combat Support System (ECSS). Critical to the success of these initiatives is commonality of
data structure, data formatting and management processes between all programs. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command.
