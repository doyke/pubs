SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision incorporates interim change (IC) 2001-1 by adding requirement for the unit stan/eval func-
tion to ensure and document the annual review of MTRs (paragraph 3.2.2.10.). Additional provisions of
IC-2001-1 were determined to already be covered in existing text or to be out of scope for this instruction.
The following is a synopsis of changed requirements set forth in this revision:
Formalizes MAJCOM, NAF and unit responsibilities in the processing of AF Forms 847 for flight and
other AF publications (paragraphs 2.3.2.5.1. thru 2.3.2.5.2., 2.3.2.6.2., 2.4.2.3.1. thru 2.4.2.3.2., 3.2.2.9.,
3.3.2.5., Attachment 5); tasks the OGV to establish procedures to maintain and review unit FEFs (para-
graph 3.2.2.2.); changes approving official from MAJCOM/DO to OG/CC (with notification to MAJ-
COM DO) when designating additional OGV flight examiners (paragraph 3.2.3.3.); requires MAJCOM/
DO notification when ARFC/ANG OG/CC designates flight examiners not assigned to squadron/OG
(paragraph 3.2.3.4., 3.3.3.3.); deletes paragraph stating that senior flight examiners will normally admin-
ister evaluations to lower echelon flight examiners (old paragraph 3.5.5.); deletes the Instrument
Refresher Course as a requisite for INSTM evaluations (paragraph 5.2.1.2.); clarifies procedures for
instructor evaluations including the use of INIT INSTR designation (paragraphs 5.2.1.4. thru 5.2.1.4.3.);
simplifies the requisite completion window (paragraphs 5.2.7.1. and 5.2.7.2.); adds guidance on remedial
actions for evaluation deficiencies (5.2.12. thru 5.2.12.3.); adds guidance for aircrews flying in non-US
Air Force Aircraft and with non-US Air Force Units (paragraph 5.2.17.); makes EPE evaluation a require-
ment for MSN evaluations (paragraph 5.3.1.); requires flight surgeons to complete examination for each
aircraft in which they fly as a crewmember (paragraph 6.6.); specifies the date format for all fields in the
AF Forms 8 (paragraph 7.3.2.1.); requires the organization and location of the FTU be used on all AF
Forms 8 generated for students (paragraph 7.3.4.2.2.); specifies the flight examiner as the party responsi-
ble for the content of the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.1.1.1.); directs the flight examiner to be the first
dated signature on the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.1.1.3.); clarifies documentation responsibilities of any
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                                                              3


flight examiners who participated in administering an evaluation but did not sign Section III of the AF
Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.1.3.); directs that the reviewing and final approving officers for AF Forms 8 gen-
erated during formal courses will be assigned to the FTU (paragraph 7.3.6.2.2.); directs the examinee to
be the last dated signature on the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.4.); establishes guidance on the minimum
requirements of a temporary evaluation certificate (paragraph 7.3.7.2.); adds additional documentation
guidance for ground re-checks (paragraph 7.3.8.3.6.); clarifies documentation procedures for commander
directed downgrades (paragraphs 7.3.9.3. thru 7.3.9.3.2.4.); implements changes in format and content of
the AF Form 942 (paragraph 7.4.); directs that FEFs be maintained by a stan/eval function wherever they
reside (paragraphs 7.5.1.1. and 7.5.1.2.); limits responsibility of unit maintaining FEF to that documenta-
tion added after the initial review of the FEF (paragraph 7.5.4.1.1.); implements separation of FEF dis-
crepancies into major and minor categories with only documentation of major discrepancies becoming a
permanent part of the FEF (paragraph 7.5.5.); provides guidance for correcting entries on the AF Forms 8
and 942 (paragraph 7.5.5.4.)

   4.3.9. Not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically requested by the
   MAJCOM stan/eval agency of the examinee and approved by the MAJCOM stan/eval agency of the
   examiner.

4.4. Senior Examiner Program.
   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary assigned
   aircraft.
   4.4.2. NAF/CCs and OG/CCs do not require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor certification or
   MR/CMR status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs and OG/CCs must maintain BMC status
   and be flight examiner certified. For other than SPOT evaluations, Senior Flight Examiners will eval-
   uate only events for which they are current and at a level for which they are qualified.

                                              EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure qualification
of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification evaluations are administered
periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8 to ensure aircrew qualification. Emergency Procedures
Evaluations (EPEs) are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations. Supplementary evaluations
are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure standardization of flying and other opera-
tions.

5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two structured
phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The ground phase, if
required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew performance in a controlled emer-
gency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an in-flight or, if applicable, simulator evalua-
tion of aircrew performance.
     5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Types. There are five types of aircrew qualification evalu-
     ations that may be further described by four prefixes. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are
     administered to ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member
     (QUAL), qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM if applicable) and
     qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unit's operational mis-
     sion (MSN). Provisions are made to periodically ensure aircrew are certified and maintain instructor
     qualification (INSTR) and provide the flexibility to evaluate and certify specific aircrew performance
     (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
        5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their pri-
        mary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific,
        Volume 2.
        5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
        Air Force, e.g. exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification (exception: indoctrination
        flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401, Flight Management, USAF Test Pilot School
        students, and TG-glider pilots). To maintain instrument qualification, pilots must successfully
        complete a periodic INSTM evaluation, including the requisite open book instrument examination
        required by AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program.
            5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under his/her
            command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke an instrument
            qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the procedures for a com-
            mander-directed downgrade in paragraph 7.3.9.
            5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a pilot
            except in a training program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in super-
            vised status.
        5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC aircrew status
        will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites,
        as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. The MSN evaluation should
        reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the performance of normal operational and train-
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                    17


     ing sorties. The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for those aircraft whose perfor-
     mance of normal operational, test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the
     accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
     Volumes 2. QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a partic-
     ular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional capability in that
     MDS aircraft.
         5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew member
         must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation. Accomplish INIT
         INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever possible. When students are not
         available or mission requirements/crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of stu-
         dents, the flight examiner may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the exam-
         inee's instructional ability.
         5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be conducted
         during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description for
         these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as the AF Form 8 aircraft/crew position is
         already annotated with highest qualification demonstrated during the evaluation (e.g. IP, IN,
         IF).
         5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained through an
         instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2. and 5.2.3.2.4.) as directed in
         AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1.
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic (i.e., INSTM, QUAL or MSN) or INIT INSTR evaluation. SPOT
     evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements, unless specified in MAJCOM supple-
     ments. An evaluation begun as a SPOT evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required
     periodic evaluation if all required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval
     and the examinee subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within
     the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the require-
     ments for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs with the aircrew
     member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves the additional flight time
     requirements. All evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.5. above will be documented
     as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
     qualified in the MDS and crew position of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited
     towards a periodic evaluation.
  5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying resources,
  accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the designation of
  each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8 - e.g., QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN.
  5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, if applica-
  ble, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.5. above:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor qualifica-
     tion in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
18                                                         AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005


       5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of qualification due to
       expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency
       items as specified in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1), a flight recheck following a
       failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.8. for ground rechecks) or loss of qualification due to
       a commander-directed downgrade.
           5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic evaluation, the
           evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation. The AF Form 8 Mis-
           sion/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix.
NOTE: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to complete one or more of the
ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4.), the flight evaluation has successfully been completed
within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in para-
graph 5.2.7.2. for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation and the OG/CC determines that qualification
will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight
evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in paragraph 5.2.15., the AF Form 8 Mission/Check
description will not be documented with an RQ prefix.
           5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile will be
           as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those items for which
           the individual is non-current for over 6 months. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description
           will be documented with RQ SPOT (exception: when loss of qualification is due to loss of cur-
           rency for instructor as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1, the AF Form 8 Mission/
           Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR).
           5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the recheck eval-
           uation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check
           description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable.
           5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see para-
           graph 7.3.9.), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF Form 8
           Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable.
           5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No qualifica-
           tion was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
           5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8 Mission/
           Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
       5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
       evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The beginning of nor-
       mal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner and may be defined in the
       unit supplement to this instruction. The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mis-
       sion because it is to be an evaluation.
           5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of daily air-
           crew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
           5.2.3.3.2. If an examinee elects, a no-notice evaluation may update an QUAL/INSTM/MSN
           evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed within
           the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all requirements were not completed on the first
           flight, subsequent flights are authorized to complete required events. If the examinee elects not
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                     19


         to update a QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be docu-
         mented as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted in a simula-
     tor.
     5.2.3.5. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The
     applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations will be explained under Mis-
     sion Description in the Examiner's Remarks (see paragraph 7.3.5.8..).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew certification evaluations
  includes a series of requisites as listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guid-
  ance on aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination, Boldface/Critical
     Action Procedures (CAPs) examination (if applicable), EPE and a publications check of all
     required flight publications.
         5.2.4.1.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as outlined in
         applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series publications.
         5.2.4.1.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current and
         properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew members
         are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications required for the mission.
     5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination. Note: Instrument refresher course (IRC) is
     not a requisite, but a ground training item, which must be completed according to AFMAN 11-210
     and AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
     5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew certification evaluations include execu-
  tion in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator of a profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all appropriate
  requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, and allow accurate measure of
  the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit tasking, daily training missions,
  be realistic and incorporate current tactics.
  5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month
     following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic evaluation in
     which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 01 expires on 31 Mar 03.).
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (6-month period prior
     to expiration date).
     5.2.6.3. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a periodic
     evaluation will expire within 3 months after the proposed departure for Permanent Change of Sta-
     tion (PCS) or during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY), complete the required evaluation(s)
     before departing for either the PCS or TDY.
         5.2.6.3.1. Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval agency waiver for unusual situations.
20                                                         AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005


            5.2.6.3.2. MAJCOM stan/eval agency waivers are not required for individuals who will PCS/
            Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) to a non-flying assignment or those departing PCS
            or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
        5.2.6.4. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders may extend the
        expiration date of periodic evaluations up to 3 months for the reasons listed below. Document such
        extensions with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF.
            5.2.6.4.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
            5.2.6.4.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
            5.2.6.4.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
            5.2.6.4.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement from the
            Service).
            5.2.6.4.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include operations other than
            war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s) before or during
            deployment.
     5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of com-
     bined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2. Requisites from a completed eval-
     uation may not be used for subsequent evaluations. For pilots possessing multiple instrument
     qualifications, the instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam
     occurs for each evaluation IAW the provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1. and 5.2.7.2. For all evaluations,
     accomplish requisites as follows:
        5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in the eligibil-
        ity period, all requisites must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the expi-
        ration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
        5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility period, all
        requisites must be completed within a 6-month period encompassing the month in which the flight
        evaluation was administered.
        5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
            5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for the failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1. or 5.2.7.2.
            above remain valid to update an evaluation expiration date upon successful recheck according
            to paragraph 5.2.13.1.
            5.2.7.3.2. Requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8 will not be annotated on the
            recheck AF Form 8. The recheck AF Form 8 will only include documentation of the flight
            phase evaluation.
     5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible,
     the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight examiners will
     make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to this provision. See the
     appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2 for areas prohibited from verbal/ATD evaluation.
     5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD 10-9, in
     coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized QUAL, INSTM,
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                   21


  MSN and INSTR evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2. The lead
  command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
     5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those required
     and critical for evaluation completion.
     5.2.9.2. Criteria for Publications Check.
         5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as outlined in
         applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series publications.
         5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current and
         properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew members
         are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications required for the mission.
     5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the appropriate areas/
     subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and AF Form
     4031, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Skills Criteria, as references
     5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules and
     procedures. Specifically, ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering speeds below
     10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and flight operations.
  5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew per-
  formance. Individual scores are recorded for examinations while areas/subareas of aircrew perfor-
  mance are individually graded against established evaluation criteria. Performance less than fully
  qualified is documented. An overall qualification level is determined from the compilation of these
  individual scores/grades.
     5.2.10.1. Written, Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Grade written, computer
     based or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See paragraph 6.4.4.1. for
     minimum passing grade specifics.
     5.2.10.2. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q) or
     Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, will establish areas and sub-
     areas to be evaluated and the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas will have
     a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall area grade will be the low-
     est of any subarea grade awarded.
         5.2.10.3.1. Q. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfac-
         tory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
         tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.10.3.2. Q-. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks, but
         requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner. Deviations
         from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight
         safety.
         5.2.10.3.3. U. Assign a U area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance outside
         allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
         affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
22                                                       AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005


            area grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the flight
            examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not
            required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
        5.2.10.4. Qualification Levels . EPE and overall evaluation performance are graded by qualifica-
        tion levels as follows:
            5.2.10.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired perfor-
            mance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in
            the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be
            awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
               5.2.10.4.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any area(s)/sub-
               area(s).
               5.2.10.4.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
               awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
               5.2.10.4.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief
               of that evaluation.
            5.2.10.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to per-
            form duties safely, but:
               5.2.10.4.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
               assigned.
               5.2.10.4.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
               5.2.10.4.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on perfor-
               mance in one or several areas/subareas.
            5.2.10.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable
            level of safety, performance or knowledge.
               5.2.10.4.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3 for the
               evaluation.
               5.2.10.4.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner,
               there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.2.11. Grading Policies.
        5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on requisite
        examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the grading criteria in the applicable 11-2
        MDS-Specific, Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas accomplished during an evaluation.
            5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the gen-
            eral and specific evaluation sections of the applicable 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
            5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner may grade any area/subarea accomplished during an evalua-
            tion if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or flight
            safety.
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                 23


         5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
         5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are acceptable, pro-
         vided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize
         flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels .
         5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance
         during both the flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all evalua-
         tion requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
         5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the
         criteria set forth in the applicable MDS-Specific, Volume 2 and demonstrate ability to operate
         the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2 MDS
         Specific, Volume 2, guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE based on area
         and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the determining factor in
         deciding the overall qualification level.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy and/or
  deficiency in performance while maintaining flight and operational safety. Remedial action includes
  debriefing discrepancies, assignment of additional training and imposing of flight restrictions.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the evalua-
     tion wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy and
     determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy the
     discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with “Debriefed” in paragraph
     B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8 Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to remedy defi-
     ciencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator
         or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate attainment of satis-
         factory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended Additional
         Training, under Examiner's Remarks in the AF Form 8 Comments. Description of assigned
         additional training will include how satisfactory knowledge or proficiency will be demon-
         strated to a flight examiner, supervisor or instructor.
         5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be documented
         in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8 (see paragraphs 7.3.5.6. and 7.3.5.7.).
         5.2.12.2.4. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed. Accomplish
         additional training by the last day of the second month following the date of the discrepancy,
         e.g. for an evaluation on 21 Jan 02, additional training due 31 Mar 02. AFRC/ANG accom-
         plish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date of the discrep-
         ancy. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional training, the
         squadron commander will review the situation and direct appropriate action. Document the
24                                                         AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005


            circumstances with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF of the affected individ-
            ual.
        5.2.12.3. Restrictions.
            5.2.12.3.1. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment of the
            flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until successful comple-
            tion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
            5.2.12.3.2. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
            requires supervision until successful retraining is completed. Restrictions are not punitive, but
            designed to enhance flight and operational safety.
            5.2.12.3.3. Specific restrictions will be documented as the first item of the AF Form 8 Com-
            ments.
     5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation .
        5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful recheck must be
        completed by the end of the second month after the date of the first failure, e.g. for an evaluation
        on 20 Jun 02, complete recheck by 31 Aug 02. AFRC/ANG accomplish recheck by the last day of
        the third month following the date of the first failure. A recheck is successfully completed when
        the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs
        may approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such
        action with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF. Every reasonable effort must be
        made to requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
        during this period, based on the individual's experience level, present qualifications and number of
        hours of training required.
        5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM, QUAL or
        MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), non-basic
        mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) status, as applicable. For
        instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if the dis-
        crepancies were only in instructor areas.
        5.2.13.3. Restrictions. Restrict aircrew failing to complete an evaluation within the required
        period (see paragraph 5.2.15.) or receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation, as listed below, until a success-
        ful evaluation is completed:
            5.2.13.3.1. QUAL or INSTM Evaluation. Place the examinee on supervised status.
            5.2.13.3.2. MSN Evaluation. The examinee may perform basic qualification/ instrument tasks
            unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised status for mission tasks.
            5.2.13.3.3. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
            area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
     5.2.14. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance requires the aircrew member be placed on
     supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be determined
     by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1.
     Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific, Volume 1) qualified in the specific aircrew position.
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                     25


  5.2.15. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew member
  fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the eligibility period for an
  in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2. for an
  out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses the qualification covered by the
  evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.13.3. apply. Qualification may be re-established by
  administering a requalification evaluation (see paragraph 5.2.3.2.) or by completion of the delinquent
  evaluation. OG/CCs may approve waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites
  to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with a Memo for Record
  placed in Section II of the FEF.
  5.2.16. Multiple Qualification. For aircrew members (other than those in a Companion Trainer Pro-
  gram) who maintain qualification in two or more mission design aircraft (e.g., F-16 and F-15) accord-
  ing to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, the following guidance applies (for purposes of this instruction,
  different series [models] of the same basic aircraft do not constitute multiple qualification - e.g. F-16C
  and F-16CG):
     5.2.16.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification, including a
     list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in a Memo for Record placed in Section
     II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority may be delegated,
     but not lower than wing commander.)
     5.2.16.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to include
     requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by the authoriz-
     ing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by the MAJCOM in
     its supplement to this instruction.
     5.2.16.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and,
     if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission design aircraft according to
     applicable AFI 11-2, MDS-Specific, Volumes 2.
     5.2.16.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
     downgrade in all aircraft flown. A downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation
     applies only to the aircraft for which the evaluation was administered.
  5.2.17. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force Units. A i r -
  crew members performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft per AFI 11-401, or on duty with or
  attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host service or host country rules, except for
  the requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI
  11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily abide by USAF rules, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
  and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must com-
  plete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during
  their tour. The restrictions in paragraphs 5.2.13.3.1. through 5.2.13.3.3. of this instruction apply to
  such individuals until successful evaluations are completed. (Exception: MAJCOM/DOV may
  approve exceptions to this paragraph, if, after case-by-case review, they determine non-USAF evalua-
  tions are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2 evaluations. Document such
  action with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8
  equivalent.) Note: Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
  program may use Air Force guidance, as permitted in the applicable Memorandum of Agreement/
  Understanding.

5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations .
     5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS EPs and systems knowledge for all
     QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and systems knowledge during
     MSN evaluations. Only one EPE need be accomplished for each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE
     for an INSTM/QUAL or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
     5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the proper
     action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible for the
     Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
     5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, will specify contents of
     EPEs and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in an ATD, or verbally.
     5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade (1, 2 or 3) in the Qualification Ground
     Phase block of the AF Form 8, regardless of whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed
     in-flight.
     5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner will indi-
     cate if the additional training will be accomplished before the flight evaluation under restrictions in
     the Comments block of the AF Form 8.
     5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during an EPE
     requires an unqualified (Q-3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a Q-3 grade as a result of
     Boldface/CAPs error will not fly until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
     5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (Q-3) will be placed on
     supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.

5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools to be used by the
commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These evaluations
are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists) whose results are
reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations is entirely at the discre-
tion of the commander.
     5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
     5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the method
     of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection and will report results
     as directed by the commander.
     5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct supplemen-
     tary evaluations.
     5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight evaluation. If con-
     ducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all encompassing, result in the assignment
     of an overall rating for any specific aircrew member or be documented on an AF Form 8.
     5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.

                              AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The Aircrew Examination Program measures aircrew member knowledge of normal/emer-
gency procedures, threats and other information essential for the safe and effective operation of their
assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer based or electronic examina-
tions. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring increased training emphasis.

6.2. Scope. The Aircrew Examination Program includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations,
unit periodic examinations and Flight Surgeon examinations. Requisite examinations include qualifica-
tion open book and closed book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examina-
tions as described in paragraph 5.2.4.. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.

6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program in the
   unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic information
   management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam answer
   sheets/computer records until AF Form 8 is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs and prepared
   exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source documents. Units will document their
   procedures for reviewing and updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this
   instruction.
   6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in
   the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
   (https://etca.keesler.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the requirements
   of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite examinations.
       6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with the
       MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of this instruction
       and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, before awarding credit for requisite completion.
       6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs. All ques-
       tions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and not conflict
       with any MQFs.
       6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will be
       graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1. and entered on the AF Form 8 according to paragraph
       7.3.5.1.

6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and Boldface/
CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.4.1.;
instrument examinations as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.4.2.and any
28                                                          AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005


other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2 (see paragraph
5.2.4.3.).
     6.4.1. Instrument Examinations. Pilots will take the instrument exam as specified in paragraph
     5.2.1.2. of this instruction.
     6.4.2. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exami-
     nations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a unique test for
     each aircrew member requiring an exam. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew posi-
     tion:
        6.4.2.1. Develop and control a minimum of two requisite examinations for each crew position.
            6.4.2.1.1. Units having ten or fewer individuals per crew position require only one examina-
            tion.
            6.4.2.1.2. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information (for exam-
            ple, in two-place fighters, front and back seat or left and right seat pilots of the same aircraft),
            units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
        6.4.2.2. Change fifty percent of the questions on the requisite examinations every calendar year.
     6.4.3. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite
     exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media. Instrument requi-
     site exams and answer sheets associated with administration of the IRC may be controlled by the unit
     training function.
     6.4.4. Grading Policy For Examinations.
        6.4.4.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs exams is
        100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite examinations is 85 per-
        cent - corrected to 100 percent.
        6.4.4.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will grade all
        completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s next flight. Units
        will describe how this restriction is enforced in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     6.4.5. Examination Question Sources.
        6.4.5.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from publications con-
        taining information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the
        assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
        be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an open book secure question bank (SQB)
        that serves as the source for some or all of the open book examination questions. Do not distribute
        the SQB to unit aircrews and safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval
        examination.
        6.4.5.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs. These
        questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe flight and mission
        accomplishment.
            6.4.5.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-specific MQFs
            containing approved questions for closed book testing are available for MAJCOM use and dis-
            tribution to applicable aircrew.
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                  29


            6.4.5.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
            develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM expertise.
            That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for approval prior to their pub-
            lication.
            6.4.5.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs
            as necessary.
                6.4.5.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures, admin-
                istrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational procedures;
                however, subject matter may not be changed.
                6.4.5.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         6.4.5.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures MQF
         to augment HHQ MQFs.
     6.4.5.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the Instrument
     MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The selection and content
     of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
  6.4.6. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.6.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated through a
     written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.6.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing the proper
     actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight examiner will
     assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form
     8.
  6.4.7. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all failed items
  have been successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.7.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination or Boldface/
     CAPs at any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than
     Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
     6.4.7.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination must com-
     plete a successful reexamination by the end of the second month (AFRC/ANG: third month) fol-
     lowing the date of the first failure. Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully
     complete the examination is the OG/CC. Document such waivers with a Memo for Record placed
     in Section II of the FEF of the affected individual.
     6.4.7.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a Boldface/
     CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is accomplished.
     6.4.7.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open
     book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful retesting is
     completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting
     from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the aircraft for which the
     examination was administered. Failure of a requisite instrument exam results in the examinee
     being placed in supervised status in all aircraft flown.

6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may conduct peri-
odic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope
of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or oper-
ational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be
open or closed book, but will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the require-
ment for a periodic exam. Units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to
include procedures for failed exams.

6.6. Flight Surgeon Examinations. Flight surgeons will complete an aircrew examination every 17
months for each aircraft in which they fly on as an aircrew member. The unit-developed Flight Surgeon
Exam will cover, as a minimum, the emergency procedures applicable to the flight surgeon’s crew posi-
tion. Flight surgeons will not fly on any USAF aircraft as an aircrew member until successful completion
of the exam. Units flying flight surgeons as aircrew members will document the results IAW procedures
detailed in the unit supplement to this instruction.

                                 EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate documenta-
tion. The qualifications and authorizations to which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are determined
from the unit certification document. The results of an evaluation are recorded on the AF Form 8, which
then serves to certify the qualification of the aircrew member. The chronological history of evaluations for
an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. Both these AF Forms are
maintained in the FEF for the aircrew member.

7.2. Qualifications/Authorizations. A certified ARMS product or a unit certification document signed
by the official authorized to approve AF Forms 8 or other appropriate authority, designated in writing,
may be used to indicate special qualifications/authorizations as required.

7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record and to certify aircrew member qualification as demon-
   strated in required ground and flight evaluations.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see paragraph 7.3.8.).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8 and see
   Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit
       year format (e.g., 25 Dec 01). (Exception: For electronic forms, use the date format required by
       the form.)
       7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter month
       and two-digit year format (e.g., Apr 01) (except when a different format is required for electronic
       forms).
       7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph 7.3.5.8., sam-
       ple AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the data presented (see
       Figure A3.1. through Figure A3.5.).
       7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted otherwise, use
       upper and lower case letters.
       7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification (right,
       left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format stan-
       dards for such data entry.
   7.3.3. Date Completed.
       7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation requisites, not
       including additional training.
       7.3.3.2. Use this date on the AF Form 942.
   7.3.4. Section I - Examinee Identification.

            for flying.
            7.3.4.2.2. When attending a FTU course in which an evaluation is administered, the organiza-
            tion and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
            7.3.4.2.3. HHQ aircrew members may use their office symbol in place of the unit designation.
        7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
            7.3.4.3.1. Enter the aircraft MDS in which the evaluation was given.
            7.3.4.3.2. Enter the examinee's highest qualification in that particular aircraft MDS demon-
            strated during the evaluation. Note: Examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification, and
            should only be entered when demonstrated during the evaluation, e.g., a SPOT evaluation in
            which the examinee receives an evaluation while administering an evaluation.
        7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
            7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last similar evalu-
            ation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation expires Sep 02, enter Apr-Sep 02).
            7.3.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for initial periodic evaluations, periodic evaluations
            accomplished outside the examinee's normal eligibility period and SPOT evaluations.
            7.3.4.4.3. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the previous eval-
            uation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.2.6.4., enter the 6-month period preced-
            ing the original preceding the original expiration date. Note: Squadron commanders extend
            only the expiration date, not the eligibility period.
            7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if last
            INSTM evaluation expires Nov 02 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 03, enter “INSTM:
            Jun-Nov 02/QUAL: Aug 02-Jan 03” for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).

            events are required and they are administered by either different flight examiners or on
            separate days (exception: where a single mission [such as airlift tasking] consists of multi-
            ple flights over one or more days with the same flight examiner, a single line entry may be
            used).
        7.3.5.2.2. Date.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.2.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights over one or
            more days, a single line entry with the inclusive dates of the flight(s) may be used (see
            paragraph 7.3.5.2.1.4.). Document this fact in the Mission Description portion of the
            Examiner’s Remarks.
            7.3.5.2.2.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight spanning
            more than one day, a single line entry with the date the mission was completed may be
            used. Document this fact in the Mission Description portion of the Examiner’s Remarks.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Place a "1" or "2" in the qualified block or a "3" in the unqualified block for the air-
        crew member’s overall qualification level.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN) require only
        one qualification level number if all parts of the evaluation were awarded the same qualifica-
        tion level grade.
        7.3.5.3.3. If the qualification levels assigned parts of a combined evaluation vary, indicate the
        qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and “QUAL: 2” in the qualified
        block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).

        7.3.5.4.1. For evaluations that establish a new eligibility period, enter the month and year that
        is 17 months after the month in which the flight phase of the evaluation was successfully com-
        pleted.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL) require only one date if all parts of the
        evaluation were successfully completed and “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
        7.3.5.4.4. For a combined evaluation where one component is successfully completed and one
        component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by assigning a new expiration date for
        those portions completed successfully, and “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified
        grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 02 / INSTM-N/A”).

           be assigned to the FTU.
           7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing and Approving Officers will ensure the recommended additional
           training is adequate to correct the noted deficiencies.
           7.3.6.2.4. If a Reviewing or Approving Officer does not agree with the overall rating, the
           overall grade will not be changed. The Reviewer or Approver will mark the "Do Not Concur"
           block and will comment in the Comments section.
        7.3.6.3. Organization Block Format. The format and content of data for the Organization block
        for the flight examiner, reviewing officer and final approving officer will be defined in the MAJ-
        COM supplement to this instruction.
        7.3.6.4. Examinee. The examinee will be the last dated signature on the AF Form 8.
     7.3.7. Temporary Evaluation Certification and Suspense .
        7.3.7.1. File a temporary flight evaluation certificate or a draft AF Form 8 in the aircrew mem-
        ber’s FEF immediately after the flight evaluation as a temporary record of the flight evaluation
        results.
        7.3.7.2. The temporary flight evaluation certificate will include examinee, examiner, type evalua-
        tion, qualification level, and date completed; list any discrepancies by area/subarea, any restric-
        tions, any additional training and any additional training due dates; and must be signed and dated
        by the flight examiner completing the evaluation. Procedures concerning the temporary flight
        evaluation certificate will be outlined in the unit supplement.
        7.3.7.3. Remove the temporary flight evaluation certificate when the permanent AF Form 8 is
        filed in the FEF.
        7.3.7.4. MAJCOMs may establish a suspense for the insertion of the completed permanent AF
        Forms 8 in the FEF.
     7.3.8. Ground Rechecks.
        7.3.8.1. Ground rechecks are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of an unqualified evalu-
        ation when the flight examiner deems a flight recheck unnecessary.
        7.3.8.2. The ground recheck will be documented on the original AF Form 8 generated to docu-
        ment the Q-3 flight evaluation (see Figure A3.5.).
        7.3.8.3. To document the ground recheck, follow instructions in paragraphs 7.3.3.through 7.3.6.
        except as noted below:
           7.3.8.3.1. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (ground phase or successful ground
           recheck) of the evaluation, not including additional training.
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                      37


         7.3.8.3.2. Flight Phase. Document the date of the ground recheck on a separate line as
         “GROUND RECHECK” below the flight evaluation entry under Flight Phase.
         7.3.8.3.3. Qualification Level. Annotate the overall qualification grade as “3/1” in the quali-
         fied block.
         7.3.8.3.4. Expiration Date of Qualification. For evaluations that establish a new eligibility
         period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the ground recheck
         was successfully completed.
         7.3.8.3.5. Restrictions. Place an “X” in the “Yes” block and list specific restrictions as the first
         item in the Comments block based on the original failed evaluation.
         7.3.8.3.6. Examiner's Remarks: Recommended Additional Training. Document all recom-
         mended additional training associated with grading areas whose deficiencies will be remedied
         by a ground recheck under subparagraph labeled Ground.
         7.3.8.3.7. The flight examiner that administered the flight evaluation will sign the front of the
         AF Form 8. If the recheck examiner is different than the initial flight examiner, the recheck
         examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in the Comments/Examiner’s Remarks.
  7.3.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron/detachment or above) in the
  aircrew member’s chain of command may direct a downgrade to an intermediate level of qualification
  or unqualified status without administering an evaluation under the following guidance:
     7.3.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, e.g., breach of flying discipline or flight
     safety - including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but by an examiner of
     another aircrew specialty.
     7.3.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of, administrative
     or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the commander’s confidence in
     the aircrew member’s flying or performance ability to safely operate the aircraft and/or equip-

7.4. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent informa-
tion extracted from all the AF Forms 8 accomplished by the aircrew member.
     7.4.1. Data Entry. The sample AF Form 942 is provided to demonstrate the content, not the format,
     of the data presented (Figure A4.1.).
        7.4.1.1. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except type of evaluation designations in capi-
        tal letters, use upper and lower case letters.
        7.4.1.2. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification (right,
        left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format stan-
        dards for such data entry.
        7.4.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those on which the qual-
        ification levels awarded portions of a combined evaluation are not all the same.
        7.4.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded to any of
        the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level awarded indicat-
        ing which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification level.

     long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942 should be forwarded
     with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If electronic backups are normally main-
     tained on removable storage media (e.g., floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate transfer
     of an FEF, file the storage media behind the AF Form 972 in Section I of the FEF.
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                     39


7.5. Flight Evaluation Folders. The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the history of
flying qualification for each aircrew member. The AF Form 8 is the source document used to record and
certify the qualification of an aircrew member. A complete history of the AF Forms 8 in an FEF is main-
tained on an accompanying AF Forms 942.
   7.5.1. Maintenance. Each aircrew member who is on flying status (except flight surgeons) must have
   a FEF, which includes all AF Forms 8, AF Forms 942, and additional MAJCOM specified items.
       7.5.1.1. The FEF must be maintained by a stan/eval functional office - normally in the organiza-
       tion to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
       7.5.1.2. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the stan/eval
       function at their assigned stations.
       7.5.1.3. The FEF for personnel in inactive flying status will be maintained with their Flight
       Records Folder (FRF).
       7.5.1.4. FEF maintenance may be further defined in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction.
       7.5.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of the ser-
       vice of the unit of attachment to document their history of qualification.
   7.5.2. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections:
       7.5.2.1. Section I (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, MAJCOM required items and
       those items authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g., logs of initial and annual
       reviews).
           7.5.2.1.1. AF Forms 942 should be on top of this section, in chronological order with the most
           recent on top.
           7.5.2.1.2. If used, file backup electronic storage media behind the AF Form 942 in Section I
           of the FEF.
           7.5.2.1.3. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual's flight record, a
           copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
           Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, may be
           filed in this section. If used, place AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training,
           or any certifications, qualifications, and/or authorizations in this section.
       7.5.2.2. Section II (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8 and Memos for Record for all
       evaluations listed on the AF Forms 942 in Section I.
           7.5.2.2.1. File AF Forms 8 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
           7.5.2.2.2. Permanent Memos for Record documenting waivers, extensions and major discrep-
           ancies relating to qualification (see paragraph 7.5.5.1.1.) are filed in chronological order with
           AF Forms 8.
           7.5.2.2.3. Memos for Record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF Form 8 will
           be filed on top of that Form 8 regardless of date the discrepancy is discovered.
           7.5.2.2.4. Memos for Record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple AF Forms
           8 will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8.

            7.5.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for evalua-
            tion program management.
     7.5.3. Description of Folders.
        7.5.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and constructed of
        heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
        7.5.3.2. Standard 2 3/4-inch metal fasteners may be used.
        7.5.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual's name and SSAN to the inside back cover so that the
        folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information on the label if required.
     7.5.4. Review of FEF.
        7.5.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned aircrew mem-
        bers to establish their qualification prior to their first flight.
            7.5.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and qualifi-
            cation of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in Sec-
            tion II of the FEF. Following determination of the currency and qualification of the aircrew
            member, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible only for documentation subsequently
            placed in the FEF.
            7.5.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the stan/eval
            function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review the FEF prior to
            their first flight.
        7.5.4.2. Annual Review. As a minimum, the stan/eval function will review each FEF annually
        for expiration dates of required evaluations as outlined in the unit supplement to this instruction.
        The unit supplement will include how the annual review of FEFs is to be documented. An annual
        review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not required.
     7.5.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8 and 942 contained
     therein.
        7.5.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on qualifi-
        cation.
            7.5.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification of the affected aircrew member are consid-
            ered major.
            7.5.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification of the affected aircrew mem-
            ber are considered minor and include typos, formatting and misspellings.
        7.5.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent
        Memo for Record filed in Section II immediately above the affected AF Form 8, or in chronolog-
        ical order with the AF Forms 8 for items other than those found on AF Forms 8.
        7.5.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-per-
        manent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
            7.5.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization of AF
            Forms 8, AF Forms 942 and aircrew member FEFs.
            7.5.5.3.2. Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.
AFI11-202V2_439AWSUP1_I 14 JULY 2005                                                                 41


         7.5.5.3.3. Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior to any
         permanent change in station or status of the affected aircrew member.
     7.5.5.4. Corrections.
         7.5.5.4.1. AF Forms 8. As source documents, AF Forms 8 may be corrected by use of
         white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the flight
         examiner signing Section III of the Form 8 initials said correction.
         7.5.5.4.2. AF Forms 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered with-
         out restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the contents of
         Section II of the FEF.
  7.5.6. Transfer of FEF. When custody of the FEF is transferred to a new unit or base:
     7.5.6.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the folder until reviewed by the gaining unit.
     After review, return those forms not retained in the folder to the individual.
     7.5.6.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting directly
     to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for transfer to the
     subsequent gaining unit.
     7.5.6.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF with their FRF
     to the gaining organization.
         7.5.6.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the folder to the
         gaining unit.
         7.5.6.3.2. Mail any flight evaluation records not included in the folder at time of transfer to
         the gaining organization with clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.5.6.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy until the gaining organi-
         zation has received the original FEF.
         7.5.6.3.4. If any FEF information is maintained electronically, a suitable storage media con-
         taining that information will be included with the FEF.
  7.5.7. Disposition of FEF.
     7.5.7.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule,
     and this instruction.
     7.5.7.2. Outdated certification letters, AFORMS products, Medical Recommendations and mis-
     cellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the aircrew member for
     disposal.

     duced and maintained database and is a unique per crewmember randomly generated computer test.
     Written tests are available as backups. The database is continuously reviewed and revised as necessary
     to rectify errors and accommodate changes to sources. Sources include:
        9.9.1.1. (Added-439AW) T.O. 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual USAF Series C-5A, C-5A(SCM), and
        C-5B Airplanes.
        9.9.1.2. (Added-439AW) T.O. 1C-5A-1-1, Flight Manual USAF Series C-5A, C-5A(SCM), and

     9.9.2. (Added-439AW) The C-5 Closed Book Qualification test is also a randomly generated com-
     puter test, but is derived from the current AMC MQF with questions as appropriate for special quali-
     fications. The MQF is revised yearly by AMC and distributed to the users. The MQF is continuously
     revised to correct errors discovered during the testing process. Corrections to Higher Headquarters
     MQFs are forwarded to AMC A37V as necessary, but not less than once a quarter. Written tests are
     also available as backups. The Boldface/CAPs Examination is administered as part of the Closed
     Book Exam and an immediate grade is generated at the completion of testing. If the Closed Book
     Exam or the Boldface/CAPs is failed the requisite Resource Manager and the Squadron Commander
     is notified. For Boldface/CAPS failures the crewmember is taken off the flying schedule until a suc-
     cessful retest has been accomplished. For other requisite exam failures the crewmember is placed in
     supervised status until successful reexamination. A locally produced worksheet is used to track indi-
     viduals who fail to pass requisite exams. All exam failures are discussed at the R&C Board to ensure
     a repetitive pattern of failures does not exist.
     9.9.3. (Added-439AW) The Instrument Test is administered from the database of questions assess-
     able from the AFFSA Web site. A computer generated test of one hundred questions is derived from
     this source. Many different sources of instrument questions comprise this database. Written tests are
     available as backups.

   AES specific instructions.
   9.9.5. (Added-439AW) The 439 AES Closed Book test is derived from the AMC Master Question
   File. Corrections as necessary are forwarded to AMC. The procedures to ensure successful retest
   prior to the next flight are the same as for the C-5.
   9.9.6. (Added-439AW) The appropriate squadron commander is notified of all test failures and a
   worksheet is completed to ensure this process takes place and that the crewmember does not fly until
   successfully completing a retest. These test failures will also be reported during the Stan/Eval Board.
   9.9.7. (Added-439AW) Flight Surgeons exams are administered every 17 months to all assigned
   Flight Surgeons and are derived from a locally produced database reflecting their required procedures.

                     RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A5.1. General . The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of recom-
mended changes to Air Force publications at each command level. Unless different guidance is provided
by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended changes and improvements to Air Force
publications on AF Form 847 according to the procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (cov-
ering completion of the Form). Submit recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on
operational efficiency, to correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do
not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF publication
OPR.

A5.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A5.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the MAJ-
   COM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure A6.1. and in
   compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will utilize the NAF/MAJ-
   COM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will submit AF Form 847s electroni-
   cally to the maximum extent possible.
   A5.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847, ensure
   the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review, forward approved
   original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the preceding command level of
   disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent of electronic Forms 847 may allow
   each level to inform all levels below (including the originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep
   each command level and the originator advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF
   Form 847.
   A5.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form 847 to
   the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the AF Form 847,
   the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to disposition. The parent
   MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A5.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information copies of AF
   Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The other using MAJCOMs
   may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions to the AF publication OPR.
   A5.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original AF Form
   847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting command level with justifi-
   cation annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the disapproval. MAJCOMs may address
   how to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR in
   their supplement to this instruction.
   A5.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the stan/eval
   function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no requirement to track
   receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.
