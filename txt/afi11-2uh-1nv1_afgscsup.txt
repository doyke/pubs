1. General Information. This supplement is intended to provide guidance in UH-1N aircrew
training for AFGSC and PACAF. For purposes of this instruction, unit refers to AFGSC
Helicopter Squadrons (HS) and those PACAF units with UH-1N assets. For those units with
multiple MDS airframes (i.e., 459 AS), different L-MAJCOM guidance may conflict. The unit
may choose to follow the other L-MAJCOM guidance for administration of the aircrew training
program. Units must be sure alternate guidance does not present an inherent danger based upon
the different nature of helicopter operations, or create products that vastly differ from other UH-
1N programs. The Unit/CC will inform HQ AFGSC/A3TO if alternate L-MAJCOM guidance is
used.
1.2.3.2.2. Refer to 20 AF Community of Practice (CoP), AFGSC Training Methods, for the
authorized Syllabi of Instruction (SOI) and courseflow for in-unit training.
1.2.3.3. For AFGSC units, identify training shortfalls through 20 AF/A3H to HQ AFGSC/A3TO.
For PACAF units, identify training shortfalls via PACAF/A3TV to HQ AFGSC/A3TO.
1.2.3.4. (Added) Route AFGSC unit supplements through 20 AF/A3H for approval by HQ
AFGSC/A3TO. Route PACAF unit supplements through PACAF/A3TV and coordinate with
AFGSC/A3TO.
1.4. Training Records and Reports. Training folders will be maintained IAW Attachment 2.
1.5.2. Direct involvement of supported user forces is encouraged for realism and training benefit.
1.7.1. All aircrew members will maintain mission-ready status in their primary crew positions
IAW AFGSCI 10-139, Helicopter Capabilities and Mission Descriptions. EXCEPTION: The
Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) will determine who (if any) maintains certifications in
the missions not considered part of the Basic Mission requirement, (i.e., day water, cargo sling,
fire bucket, etc.).
1.7.2. HQ AFGSC indoctrination (INDOC) program flyers who maintained UH-1N BMC status
within 24 months of assignment to HQ AFGSC do not have to complete the UH-1N Key Staff
Course. No recurring training is required.
1.10. Intra/Intercommand Aircrew Training. AFGSC assigned aircrew members may train
with another AFGSC-assigned unit. Forward requests through 20 AF/A3H to HQ
AFGSC/A3TO. AFGSC and PACAF aircrew members desiring training within another
MAJCOM must forward their requests through appropriate channels to HQ AFGSC/A3TO.
Aircrew members from other MAJCOMs desiring to fly with an AFGSC or PACAF unit will
route the request to AFGSC/A3TO through their appropriate MAJCOM/A3 4-Letter office. For
requests to fly with an AFGSC-assigned unit, HQ AFGSC/A3TO will notify 20 AF/A3H. For
requests to fly with the 459 AS, HQ AFGSC/A3TO will notify HQ PACAF/A3TV. Reference
AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 11-2UH-1NV2, UH-1N
Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, for intra/intercommand flight evaluations.
1.12. Waiver Procedures. AFGSC/A3 delegates waiver authority for in-unit training to HQ
AFGSC/A3T. For AFGSC units, submit waiver requests through 20 AF/A3H and HQ
AFGSC/A3TO. For PACAF units, submit waiver requests through HQ PACAF/A3TV and HQ
AFGSC/A3TO. Follow the In-Unit Training Waiver example on the AFGSC A3TO CoP.

Memorandum For Record example on the AFGSC A3TO CoP.
2.1.2.2. (Added) All OG/CCs with UH-1N assets in their organizations should also attend either
