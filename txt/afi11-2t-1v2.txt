                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. Conduct all T-1A aircrew evaluations according to the
provisions in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this AFI.
1.2. Recommended Changes and Waivers:
     1.2.1. Submit suggested changes to this AFI via AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change
     of Publication, to the parent MAJCOM through standardization/evaluation channels. (AF
     Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP]. Refer to that
     publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
     1.2.2. HQ USAF/A3/5 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction.
     1.2.3. IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and except as specified elsewhere in this instruction,
     AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority for this instruction. Waiver requests may be
     submitted in message or memorandum format and will be sent through the stan/eval chain of
     command.
1.3. Procedures. T-1A certified flight examiners will give emergency procedures, instrument,
qualification, and mission evaluations to aircrew members of the same rating only. Exception:
HQ AETC/A3V designated T-1A pilot flight examiners may administer combat systems
officer (CSO) qualification evaluations.
     1.3.1. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria in Chapter 3 to conduct flight
     and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and objective evaluations,
     FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
     1.3.2. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any seat or authorized flight position
     that will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation. A qualified instructor pilot will
     be at a direct set of controls for all CSO evaluations in the aircraft.
     1.3.3. Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
     how it will be conducted. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning required of
     the flight position during the evaluation. Higher headquarters FEs (and unit FEs, as
     determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials,
     and charts.
     1.3.4. Areas required by AFI 11-202, Volume 2, are indicated in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of
     this instruction. Use an alternate method of evaluation (such as an aircrew training device
     (ATD) or oral examination) to complete the evaluation when it is impossible to evaluate a
     required area in flight. Document the alternate evaluation on AF Form 8, Certificate of
     Aircrew Qualification, in the examiner's remarks of the comments block.
        1.3.4.1. Recurring periodic CSO qualification (QUAL) evaluations may be conducted in
        the simulator at the discretion of the FE. Profile should follow a normal sortie profile and
        will be flown in ―real time‖. The simulator’s visible fidelity may require the evaluation
        to be flown away from the examinee’s ―local area‖ for the low level navigation
        requirement.
AFI11-2T-1V2 1 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    5


           1.3.4.1.1. If Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE) requirements are also met in
           the simulator, separate the EPE from the QUAL evaluation. EPE requisite may be
           accomplished prior to or after the QUAL evaluation sortie profile.
   1.3.5. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include the
   examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
   and any required additional training. A squadron supervisor must be debriefed on all check
   rides. Additionally, if the overall grade is Q-2 or Q-3, a squadron supervisor must attend the
   debriefing.
1.4. Grading Instructions:
   1.4.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and a
   stable aircraft. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in grading,
   provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
   jeopardize flying safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
   1.4.2. Compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the evaluation
   with the standards provided in this instruction (Figure 1.1 and Chapter 3) and assign an
   appropriate grade for the area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3)
   from the area grades, based on a composite for the observed events and tasks according to
   AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction.
   1.4.3. If an examinee receives an unqualified grade in any of the critical areas identified in
   this publication, an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) will be assigned.
   1.4.4. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
   1.4.5. Use the following grading criteria to grade individual items on all evaluations:
       1.4.5.1. (Q). Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.4.5.2. (Q-). Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
       omission or commission.
       1.4.5.3. (U). Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
   1.4.6. The general evaluation criteria in Figure 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except
   as noted for specific events and instrument final approaches).

Figure 1.1. General Evaluation Criteria.




1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). If available and configured appropriately, an
ATD should be used to conduct the requisite EPE for pilot instrument/qualification evaluations.
If an ATD is not used, the EPE will be given verbally. An ATD will be used, if available, for the
requisite EPE of CSO qualification (QUAL) evaluations.

     1.5.1. EPEs will include:
        1.5.1.1. Aircraft general knowledge.
        1.5.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate all boldface procedures and a minimum of one
        emergency procedure per phase of flight.
        1.5.1.3. Use of standby or emergency instruments (pilot only) and a minimum of one
        instrument approach.
        1.5.1.4. CSO Evaluations. Additionally, FEs will administer a ground evaluation
        emphasizing emergency ground egress procedures, CSO proficiency procedures, local
        mission knowledge and aircrew flight equipment.
     1.5.2. For EPEs graded as qualified with additional training:
        1.5.2.1. FEs will indicate whether the additional training generated by the EPE must be
        accomplished before the examinee’s next flight.
        1.5.2.2. The flight phase of an evaluation will not be accomplished until additional
        training generated by an EPE is accomplished.
     1.5.3. For EPEs graded unsatisfactory, examinees will not fly in any crew position until a
     successful reevaluation.
     1.5.4. Accomplish additional training and reevaluations in accordance with AFI 11-202,
     Volume 2.
1.6. Completion of AF Form 8:
     1.6.1. Use AF Form 8 to record and certify aircrew qualification, in accordance with AFI 11-
     202, Volume 2.
     1.6.2. Place all comments, except restrictions and the exceptionally qualified designation (if
     used), on the reverse side of the AF Form 8.
     1.6.3. Log all mission (MSN) evaluations, including transition, airdrop, air refueling (A/R),
     basic formation, navigation (instrument fight rules [IFR] or visual flight rules [VFR]), basic
     navigation, air operations, and air intercept, as "MSN" evaluations in the flight phase block
     of AF Form 8. In accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and the lead command
     supplement, include additional clarification as to the specific type of mission evaluation in
     the mission description section of the comments block.

                                             Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Guidelines. All evaluations will follow guidelines in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. See Table 2.1
of this instruction for pilot evaluation requirements. Pilot evaluations are divided into three areas:
instrument (INSTM), qualification (QUAL), and mission (MSN). MSN evaluation categories
include transition, airdrop, air refueling, basic formation, navigation/low-level navigation, and
air intercept. See Table 2.2 for CSO evaluation requirements. CSO evaluations are divided into
two evaluation areas: qualification (QUAL) and mission (MSN). MSN evaluation categories
include instructing basic navigation, air operations, and air intercept. Use all areas for criteria
applicable to the events performed on the evaluation.
   2.1.1. Unless specified, evaluations may be combined if all requisites and Table 2.1 or
   Table 2.2 flight-required items are accomplished for each evaluation administered.
   2.1.2. Table 2.1 and 2.2 areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A
   required area is a specific area that must be evaluated to complete the evaluation. All
   required areas must be included in the flight evaluation profile. However, if it is impossible
   to accomplish a required area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the area by an alternate
   method (such as ATD, oral, etc.) in order to complete the evaluation. If the FE determines a
   required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, an additional flight by
   the examinee will be required to complete the evaluation.
   2.1.3. Table 2 1 and 2.2 areas indicated with an asterisk (*) are critical items for that
   evaluation and are graded Q or U only.
2.2. Formal Course Evaluations. Syllabus evaluations will be flown according to syllabus
mission profile guidelines (if stated) or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training
objectives. To complete the evaluation, formal course guidelines may be modified based on local
operating considerations or FE judgment. Syllabus tasks not addressed in Section C will be
evaluated using criterion-referenced objectives (CRO) from the appropriate syllabus.
2.3. Instructor Evaluations (INSTR). To qualify initially as an instructor, qualified T-1A
aircrew must successfully complete an initial instructor/mission evaluation (INIT INSTR/MSN),
normally accomplished in conjunction with formal mission qualification training.
   2.3.1. Periodically evaluate the ability of qualified T-1A aircrew to instruct, in accordance
   with AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
   2.3.2. Unless specified, examinees will occupy the seat most appropriate for the mission, as
   determined by the FE, unit supplemental guidance, and aircrew certifications.
   2.3.3. Attempt to accomplish recurring, periodic MSN/INSTR evaluations during actual
   formal training course missions, with the examinee instructing student or upgrade aircrew.
2.4. Pilot Evaluations.
   2.4.1. Instrument (INSTM). T-1A instrument evaluations are generally combined with a
   qualification evaluation. Examinees will fly a mission in accordance with instrument flight
   rules (IFR) and accomplish Table 2.1 requirements.
 8                                                           AFI11-2T-1V2 1 NOVEMBER 2012


         2.4.1.1. Accomplish requisites prior to the flight portion of the evaluation, and include, at
         minimum, an instrument examination.
     2.4.2. Qualification (QUAL). T-1A qualification evaluations are generally combined with
     an instrument evaluation. Include visual and instrument approaches at airfields other than the
     examinee's home field to the maximum extent possible. The examinee will complete Table
     2.1 requirements.
         2.4.2.1. Requisites should be accomplished prior to the flight portion of the evaluation
         and at a minimum will include a boldface examination, EPE, closed-book examination,
         and open book examination.
         2.4.2.2. During the evaluation, check TO 1T-1A-1, Flight Manual USAF Series T-1A
         Aircraft; TO 1T-1A-1-1, Flight Manual Appendix 1 Performance Data; TO 1T-1A-1CL-
         1, Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist; supplemental T-1A flight manuals (Dash-2), as
         applicable; and unit specific in-flight guides.
     2.4.3. Examinees will occupy the left seat for initial and requalification instrument, and
     qualification evaluations, and may occupy either seat for periodic instrument and
     qualification evaluations as determined by the FE or unit supplemental guidance.
     2.4.4. MSN Evaluations. Scenarios that represent unit taskings satisfy the requirements of
     this evaluation. Design profiles to evaluate examinee's training, flight position, special
     qualifications, and basic airmanship. Give initial mission evaluations in the unit's primary
     mission. The FE may perform pilot not flying duties and simulate student errors during this
     evaluation.
         2.4.4.1. Typical T-1A mission areas include transition, high level navigation, low level
         navigation, basic formation, formation airdrop, air refueling, and air intercept. The
         formation mission (basic formation, airdrop and air refueling) areas and requirements do
         not apply to pilots whose primary mission is CSO training. The air intercept mission
         does not apply to those pilots whose primary mission is Undergraduate Pilot or Pilot
         Instructor Training (unless certified).
         2.4.4.2. Requisites should be accomplished prior to the flight portion of the evaluation
         and, at minimum will include an EPE and a boldface examination. If the qualification and
         mission evaluation eligibility periods overlap, a single EPE may fulfill the requirement
         for both evaluations, if accomplished within both eligibility periods. A separate boldface
         examination is required for each evaluation.

  2.5.1. Qualification (QUAL). The INIT QUAL evaluation will be conducted in the aircraft.
  Conduct recurring periodic QUAL evaluations in the aircraft or simulator with the examinee
  in the right seat, FE (evaluator pilot or evaluator CSO) in the jump seat, and instructor pilot
  in the left seat. QUAL evaluations may also be administered by a certified evaluator pilot
  (EP) occupying the left seat and examinee occupying the right seat.
     2.5.1.1. Requisites should be accomplished prior to the flight portion of the evaluation
     and, at minimum, will include a boldface examination, EPE, instrument examination,
     closed-book examination, and open book examination.
     2.5.1.2. During the evaluation, check TO 1T-1A-1, TO 1T-1A-1-1, TO 1T-1A-1CL-1, or
     TO 1T-1A-1-2CL-1 (as appropriate); TO 1T-1A-1-2, as applicable; and unit specific in-
     flight guides.
  2.5.2. MSN. The INIT MSN evaluation will be conducted in the aircraft. Conduct recurring
  periodic MSN evaluations in the aircraft or simulator. Scenarios that represent unit taskings
  satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. Design profiles to evaluate the examinee's
  training, flight position, special qualifications, certifications, and basic airmanship. MSN
  evaluations will be administered by a certified evaluator CSO (EN).Administer INIT
  INSTR/MSN evaluations in the unit primary mission.
     2.5.2.1. Typical T-1A mission areas include basic navigation, air operations, and air
     intercept. Basic navigation MSN evaluations are normally associated with INIT
     INSTR/MSN evaluations conducted in unmodified T-1A aircraft during formal mission
     qualification training. Use of CSO-modified T-1A aircraft is required when conducting
     air operations or air intercept MSN evaluations.
         2.5.2.1.1. CSOs trained in air operations during formal mission qualification training
         in CSO-modified aircraft will accomplish an INIT INSTR/MSN evaluation in the air
         operations mission.
         2.5.2.1.2. ICSOs trained in air operations and certified in air intercept will
         accomplish either or both missions (at the discretion of the FE and unit guidance)
         during recurring, periodic MSN evaluations.
             2.5.2.1.2.1. FEs will be certified in the mission in which the examinee is being
             evaluated.
         2.5.2.1.3. ICSOs need not accomplish a MSN evaluation for initial certification in air
         intercept, except as required in paragraph 2.5.2.1.2 or by the MAJCOM-approved
         syllabus.
     2.5.2.2. Conduct INIT INSTR/MSN basic navigation evaluations with the examinee
     evaluated from the jump seat, the FE performing simulated student duties in the right
     seat, and instructor pilot in the left seat.
     2.5.2.3. Recurring periodic MSN/INSTR evaluations may be conducted with the
     examinee in any instructor position (determined by the FE, aircrew certifications, and
     unit supplemental guidance), with an instructor pilot occupying the left seat. For MSN
     evaluations conducted in CSO-modified aircraft, the FE will be certified in the mission in
     which the examinee is being evaluated.
     2.5.2.4. Document flight positions evaluated on the AF Form 8.
