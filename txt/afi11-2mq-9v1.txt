       tion and MAJCOM RAP guidance.
    1.2.6. Training Reports. Designed operational capability (DOC) tasked squadrons will submit a train-
    ing report to HHQ IAW MAJCOM/A3 directives. Squadrons may submit out-of-cycle reports if HHQ
    assistance is required to prepare for UTC or AEF tasking. Report only significant shortfalls or limiting
    factors (LIMFACS) that affect most or all of the squadron for prolonged periods of time. Include pos-
    sible solutions or specific assistance required if able. MAJCOM will attempt to rectify or minimize
    noted shortfalls or LIMFACS within the current training cycle.
       1.2.6.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not accomplished due to short-
       ages of equipment, munitions, ARMS software, etc. Example: unable to accomplish actual weap-
       ons release due to a shortage of training weapons. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions,
       etc. that degrade training effectiveness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons
       release is limited due to the lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may include
       support hardware and software.

       qualified, current, and prepared.

1.3. Processing Changes. Forward recommended changes to this volume to ACC/A3Y on AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. ACC/A3T will coordinate changes to this instruction
with MAJCOM OPRs, consolidate recommended changes and forward proposed interim changes to AF/
A3Y. AF/A3O is the approval authority for changes to this volume. Handle time-sensitive changes by
immediate-action message.

1.4. Training. Training is designed to progress crewmembers from Initial Qualification Training (IQT),
to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers in a basic aircraft
   position and flying duties without regard to a unit's mission. IQT is usually accomplished at a Formal
   Training Unit (FTU). There are provisions within this instruction to accomplish IQT in non-FTUs, if
   the situation necessitates.
NOTE: After successful completion of the qualification flight evaluation (an element of the IQT pro-
gram) crewmembers are considered in Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a temporary
qualification and is not specifically (or necessarily) documented, as such. Crewmembers are usually doc-
umented as in IQT or MQT status while BAQ status. BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver
authority for any crewmember, other than general officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ is MAJ-
COM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   1.4.2. MQT. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify crewmembers in a
   specific position and duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Crewmembers main-
   tain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Following completion of IQT and MQT (or formal instruc-
   tor upgrade program), crewmembers will have received training in all the basic missions of a specific
   unit, unless otherwise stated in Chapter 3. Crewmembers will then be assigned to either a Combat
   Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable position. Note: progression from MQT to CMR/
   BMC status requires a mission (MSN) evaluation IAW AFI 11-2MQ-9V2, MQ -9 Crew Evaluation
   Criteria.

    1.4.3. Continuation Training. CT is the training program for CMR/BMC-designated crewmembers.
    CT is designed to maintain a minimum level of proficiency or to increase the capability of individual
    crewmembers. There are two aspects of CT: Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) and non-RAP training
    requirements.
       1.4.3.1. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). RAP is the program designed to focus training on capa-
       bilities needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Types of training sorties and events are
       unit specific and established by the MAJCOM and unit commander. Specifics are contained in the
       RAP Tasking Message (TM) which is released, at a minimum, every 20 months and is to be filed
       at the back of this instruction.
       1.4.3.2. Non-RAP Training Requirements. These requirements ensure skills are maintained to
       safely and proficiently operate unit aircraft and associated equipment. They apply to all MQ-9
       units and generally do not change. Non-RAP sorties and events are contained in Table 4.2.
    1.4.4. CT Requirements. There are two basic designations for qualified crewmembers: CMR and
    BMC. CMR training requirements are considerably more robust than BMC requirements.
       1.4.4.1. Combat Mission Ready.
           1.4.4.1.1. Minimum training required for aircrew to be qualified and proficient in all of the
           primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
           1.4.4.1.2. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API-1 positions and fly-
           ing SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may designate other
           API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. EXCEPTION: If a unit is
           over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document
           (UMD) API -1s to CMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given
           to API-1 inexperienced crewmembers and at least 50% of the front line positions will be filled
           with inexperienced crewmembers, if available (ANG: any crewmember may be designated
           CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion).
           1.4.4.1.3. CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of
           the unit to which they are assigned/attached. CMR crewmembers must maintain currency in
           all core designated flight training, sorties and events and all ground training which affect CMR
           status.
           1.4.4.1.4. Non-CMR (N-CMR). Failure to complete CMR training or maintain these curren-
           cies results in regression to N-CMR status unless waived by appropriate authority. While
           N-CMR, pilots may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) and events in
           which they are current and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC. Crewmembers that regress
           to N-CMR status will accomplish the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.7.
       1.4.4.2. Basic Mission Capable.
           1.4.4.2.1. The minimum training required to be familiar with all (and may be qualified and
           proficient in some) of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system.
           1.4.4.2.2. All active duty wing crewmember positions that are not designated CMR positions,
           are BMC positions. BMC designations are assigned to crewmembers that have a primary job
           performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying operation. FTU
           instructors and operational test crewmembers are also assigned BMC status.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                                  9


          1.4.4.2.3. BMC crewmembers maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. They may
          also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core missions. For those mis-
          sions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC crewmembers must be able to attain
          proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC crewmembers must accomplish all mis-
          sion-related ground training designated by their assigned SQ/CC.
          1.4.4.2.4. BMC crewmembers may deploy and participate in any mission for which they are
          proficient and qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC.
          1.4.4.2.5. Non-BMC (N-BMC). Failure to complete BMC required training results in regres-
          sion to N-BMC status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will determine missions the crewmembers may
          perform and supervision required. Crewmembers that regress to N-BMC status will accom-
          plish the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.7.
      1.4.4.3. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills that are not
      required by every crewmember but are necessary to carry out the unit's assigned missions. Spe-
      cialized training is normally accomplished after a crewmember is assigned CMR/BMC status.
      Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabili-
      ties/qualifications as long as any additional training requirements are accomplished.

1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consis-
   tent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against the
   expected threat, crewmember capabilities, and safety. This instruction/volume provides training
   guidelines and policies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable flying/operations
   publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training programs when
   tasked by ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMS may submit requests for training program support to the ACC/
   A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to TRSS. Designated test units
   (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade operation test crewmembers in support of specific test
   plans. These syllabi will be approved by the TEG/CC and submitted to TRSS.
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked roles, maintain pro-
   ficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training missions should emphasize
   basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based on employment plans,
   location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Tactical training will include use of captive
   and live weapons, threat simulators, and countermeasures.
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision: Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervi-
   sion necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives include introduction to new
   tasks, or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor is generally required.
   1.5.5. Crewmembers will not be required to accomplish ground or ancillary training except as
   required by this instruction or AFI 36-2201V1, Training Development, Delivery, and Evaluation.

1.6. RAP Policy and Management:
   1.6.1. MQ-9 units are considered Low-Density/High-Demand (LDHD) and are not aligned against a
   specific AEF pair; therefore, the RAP training period is aligned with the entire 20-month AEF cycle.
10                                                                          AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


     Units will reference their MAJCOM RAP tasking message for specified training cycle and reporting
     procedures.
     1.6.2. Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number and type of RAP missions, plus spe-
     cific weapons delivery qualifications as determined by MAJCOM and unit commanders. The break-
     out of sorties and mission types is provided as a guideline; minor variations are authorized.
     1.6.3. Variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC. Qualifi-
     cation in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individ-
     ual’s capabilities.
     1.6.4. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a building
     block type mission. Each profile/mission requires successfully completing a significant portion of the
     events applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2.
     1.6.5. The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated crewmembers to CMR.
     1.6.6. CMR status requires:
        1.6.6.1. A 1-month lookback at the CMR mission rate.
        1.6.6.2. Qualification in all core missions and weapons events required at CMR.
        1.6.6.3. Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of sor-
        tie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
        1.6.6.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification.
        1.6.6.5. Squadron CC certification.
     1.6.7. Special Capabilities or Qualifications. SQ/CCs will determine and assign crewmembers that
     will train for and maintain special capabilities or qualifications. Special capability/ qualification sortie
     and event requirements are normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event
     requirements.
     1.6.8. CMR and BMC (wing-level and below) crewmembers will fly the required monthly mission
     rate. If unable, refer to Regression, paragraph 4.7.
     1.6.9. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the crewmembers experience level and quali-
     fications on the last day of the current training cycle.
     1.6.10. Units converting to another Mission Design Series (MDS) may fly crewmembers in CMR
     positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if CMR mission rates
     cannot be supported. CMR crewmembers should be flown at a CMR rate for the month prior to IOC.
     Active duty wings converting to new MDS are authorized one SQ-equivalent of additional API-6s
     during the conversion period. However, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total
     authorized for final conversion equipage.

1.7. RAP Training Mission Program Development:
     1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR and BMC
     crewmembers as well as those individuals carrying special capabilities or qualifications and are IAW
     the RAP tasking message. The requirements in Table 1.1. establish the minimum number of sortie/
     missions per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. The current RTM takes precedence
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                                   11


   over this volume and may contain an updated sortie requirement or missions, events, and currencies
   not incorporated in Table 1.1., Table 1.2., Table 4.1., Table 4.2., and Table 4.3., or in Attachment 2.
   1.7.2. Non-RAP requirements, missions, and events designed to ensure maintenance of basic crew-
   member skills are in addition to RAP requirements. Crewmembers may log non-RAP events on RAP
   sorties provided there is no effect on RAP sortie effectiveness. Unit flying programs contain sorties
   for crewmembers to accomplish their minimum non-RAP requirements.
   1.7.3. Consider collateral or cost-of-business mission requirements when developing unit flying pro-
   grams. These missions do not directly relate to combat employment or basic skills training but are
   necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations. Functional check flights and aerial dem-
   onstration support are in this category. RAP training does not require these sorties. For the 20 month
   AEF training cycle, the MAJCOM allocates units a block of sorties, adjusted for local conditions and
   circumstances, for these purposes.
   1.7.4. Unit flying programs contain a number of attrition sorties that compensate for non-effective
   training sorties. Log a non-effective sortie when not accomplishing a major portion of valid training
   for a planned RAP or non-RAP training mission due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to allo-
   cate accurate numbers of attrition sorties to unit flying programs, it is essential that units appropriately
   log non-effective sorties.

1.8. Training Records and Reports:
   1.8.1. Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
      1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1 Aircrew Training.
      1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.

      1.8.1.6. Applicable MAJCOM directives.
   1.8.2. Units will track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable):
12                                                                       AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        1.8.2.1. Ground training.
        1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties and missions types,
        and events cumulatively for the training cycle.
        1.8.2.3. Look-back: RAP mission requirements and accomplishment using 1-month, and 3-month
        running totals for look-back.
        1.8.2.4. Currencies. Sortie and event currencies required for unsupervised flight.
        1.8.2.5. Weapons employment in detail to document all employment attempts and histories.
     1.8.3. Units may fill in ARMS "NO DATE" with either the date of the last FTU sortie or the unit mis-
     sion-certification date.

1.9. Mission and Armament Recording.
     1.9.1. Crewmembers should use and assess all available training documentation, such as eight-milli-
     meter tape recorders or digital recording devices, on all missions. Individual crewmembers should
     review applicable portions of mission tapes to enhance training.
     1.9.2. As a guide, the following items should be reviewed after every mission: weapons parameters,
     accuracy, identification procedures, adherence to training rules, communications procedures and dis-
     cipline, flight discipline, and tactical employment.

1.10. Crewmember Utilization Policy:
     1.10.1. Commanders will ensure wing/group crewmembers (API-1/6s) fill authorized positions IAW
     unit manning documents and the crewmember status is properly designated. The overall objective is
     that crewmembers perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid,
     short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the fac-
     tors involved, such as level of tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced
     pilots in the first year of their initial operational assignment, supervisors will limit the non-flying
     duties to those related to combat activities.
     1.10.2. Commanders must ensure assigned duties are commensurate with their level of assignment.
     Units may assign the following duties required by various publications to CAF squadron-level crew-
     members: tactics officer, scheduler, flying safety officer, supervisor of flying, mobility/contingency
     plans officer, training officer (except ARMS documentation), SQ standardization and evaluation liai-
     son officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. Do not attach squadron-assigned
     MQ-9 crewmembers to wing/group staffs or man wing/group staff positions with squadron-assigned
     MQ-9 crewmembers unless total wing, group, and squadron MQ-9 crew manning is at least 100 per-
     cent. In some instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, units may attach squad-
     ron-assigned MQ-9 crewmembers to the wing. Commanders (CCs) will ensure wing-and-above staff
     crewmembers perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and fill positions
     authorized in UMDs.
     1.10.3. Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties which detract from their primary duties of
     training for, or performing, the unit flying mission.

1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                           13


  1.11.1. In general, inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over experi-
  enced crewmembers. Crewmember experience level definitions are in Attachment 1. Priorities for
  sortie allocation are as follows:
     1.11.1.1. Formal Training (TF-Coded) Units. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Upgrade Train-
     ing, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or Standardization/Evalu-
     ation Flight Examiner (SEFE) duties.
     1.11.1.2. Operational Units. Squadron-assigned CMR, squadron-assigned MQT, wing-assigned
     CMR, wing-assigned MQT, and wing assigned BMC.
     1.11.1.3. Test Units (CB-coded). Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required to pre-
     pare for assigned projects and tasking, BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on
     primary missions.
  1.11.2. Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
  1.11.3. For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following crew-
  members will maintain formal instructor status: WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, and OG/CD. For
  FTU-only wings, all API-6 crewmembers will maintain instructor status (optional for WG/CC. OG/
  CC and FCF crews). FTU-only wings will fly API-1/6 crewmembers as required by programmed fly-
  ing training (PFT).
  1.11.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance.
  Above-Wing-Level and test unit crewmembers will fly the BMC rate; however, are not required to
  complete BMC-specific missions and events or meet monthly lookback requirements. They will
  accomplish non-RAP requirements within their BMC number of sorties. Units should provide
  assigned crewmembers adequate resources to maintain minimum training requirements; however, the
  support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission. API 6/8 flyers will
  strive to accomplish non-RAP requirements with allotted BMC sorties. If units cannot meet attached
  crewmember requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, MAJCOM Supplement. Units
  requiring flying hour adjustments for attached crewmembers must request program changes IAW
  MAJCOM instructions.
  1.11.5. There is no maximum sortie count for CMR crewmembers. Table 1.2. defines the minimum
  and maximum sortie requirements for other crewmembers. On occasion, unique operations may
  require crewmembers to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized, however, this may
  impact training of other crewmembers. Crewmembers assigned or attached to ACC Office of the
  Inspector General (ACC/IGS) as API-6 will maintain RAP currencies/lookback per API-8 guidance.

                               INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of crewmembers into the MQ-9.
IQT includes Basic Training (B-Course), Re-qualification Training (TX-course), and Launch and Recov-
ery (L/R) Training.
   2.1.1. IQT will normally be conducted during formal syllabus courses at an FTU. When FTU training
   is not available within a reasonable time period IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW the pro-
   visions of this chapter. The following guidance applies to unit administered IQT.
   2.1.2. IQT programs will be based upon the syllabus tracks, flow programs, sorties, and events
   required in ACC Syllabus Course MQ9PSOBTX (Basic, Requalification, and Senior Pilot/Sensor
   Operator Training Courses) or MQ9PSOLRC (Remote Pilot and Sensor Operator Launch/Recovery
   (L/R) Course).
   2.1.3. Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading crewmember to complete an evaluation
   IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9, Volume 2.
       2.1.3.1. Crewmembers will not be evaluated on events in which they were not specifically trained
       or qualified.
       2.1.3.2. Completion of L/R qualification training will conclude with at least a SPOT evaluation.

2.2. Approval/Waiver for Local IQT:
   2.2.1. Gaining MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3T) is the approval authority to conduct local IQT, and
   is waiver authority (ANG: ACC/A3G) to change the formal requirements of locally conducted IQT.
   Provide a copy of local IQT programs and waivers to ACC/A3T.
   2.2.2. OG/CC is approval authority to administer local L/R training for individuals previously quali-
   fied in L/R operations.
       2.2.2.1. L/R qualification expires after 211 days from last landing (unit CCs may place additional
       requirements upon L/R qualification).
       2.2.2.2. When developing unit-level L/R IQT programs, commanders will base the program on
       provisions in paragraph 6.5. Forward copy of unit re-qualification program to MAJCOM POC
       (ANG: ACC/A3G) and ACC/A3TR.
   2.2.3. Gaining MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT
   for Colonel Selects and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.4. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.4.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training.
       2.2.4.2. Summary of individual’s flying experience.
       2.2.4.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.4.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.

2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW AFI 11-202V1, this instruction, the appropriate formal
course syllabus and Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ACC Syllabus Course
MQ9PSOBTX or MQ9PSOLRC). Individuals arriving at the FTU without all prerequisites met or waived
may be denied entry into training.

2.4. Ground Training. Ground training may be tailored to an individual’s background and experience.
Use available and current reference materials such as Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
(TTP), instructor guides, and audiovisual programs as supporting materials to the maximum extent possi-
ble. Accomplish simulator missions in an MQ-9 Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Use an approved Oper-
ational Flight Trainer (OFT) to the maximum extent possible; however, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer,
Part-Task Trainer, Cockpit Procedures Trainer (CPT), or Ground Control Station (GCS) may be used if an
OFT is not available.

2.5. Flying Training:
     2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be based upon required events from the appropriate
     formal course syllabus.
     2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the approved syllabus. Failure to com-
     plete within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to MAJCOM/A3 (ANG:
     ACC/A3G) with crewmember’s name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated comple-
     tion date.
     2.5.3. Crewmembers will fly under instructor supervision until completing the initial qualification
     (QUAL) checkride.
     2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements. The SQ/CC
     may authorize incorporation of additional training events into the program, based on student profi-
     ciency and background. Additional training due to student non-progression is available within the
     constraints of the course syllabus. SQ/CCs may add discretionary additional training sorties as
     required.
     2.5.5. Students in IQT may fly in FLAG, Weapon School support deployments, Weapon Systems
     Evaluation Programs, or equivalent type exercises under direct supervision of an instructor qualified
     in that crew position.

2.6. IQT for Senior Officers:
     2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (Colonel selects and above) will be conducted at
     the FTU unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2.
     2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus require-
     ments unless waived IAW syllabus directives. Note: paragraph 2.2. waiver authority applies only for
     local IQT.
     2.6.3. If senior officers must be trained at the unit to which they are assigned, they will be in formal
     training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice commanders until train-
     ing is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by gaining MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/
     CG).

                                              Chapter 3

                             MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. The course MQ9PSOBTX is considered a combined IQT/MQT formal training course and
is normally accomplished in the FTU (the course concludes with a combined qualification/mission flight
evaluation). Unit-developed and administered training programs to certify a crewmember CMR/BMC are
considered MQT. Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist unit CCs in developing an MQT program.
   3.1.1. A unit administered MQT program will be approved by the OG/CC (forward a copy of local
   MQT training programs to MAJCOM).
   3.1.2. Units may tailor the program for each crewmember based on experience, currency, documented
   performance, and formal training.
   3.1.3. Sorties and events for a unit administered MQT program will be based on the unaccomplished
   portion of ACC Syllabus Course MQ9PSOBTX and additional events or sorties needed to qualify a
   crewmember in the unit-specific mission and TTPs.
   3.1.4. Units will ensure events not accomplished or waived at the FTU are completed or waived
   before the individual is certified BMC or CMR.
   3.1.5. Prior to CMR certification, crewmembers must initially qualify in all CMR required weapons
   delivery events.

3.2. Ground Training:
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of training covering areas pertinent to the mission as determined by
   the SQ/CC. Training completed during IQT may be credited towards this requirement.
   3.2.2. Mission Verification. CMR crewmembers will demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the
   squadron’s assigned mission to a formal board established by the SQ/CC. Desired board composition
   is SQ/CC or DO (chairman), weapons officer, intelligence officer, and a senior instructor. Suggested
   verification briefing guides are at Attachment 3.
       3.2.2.1. CMR crewmembers will complete an initial verification within 90 days (ANG: 180 days)
       after completing MQT. Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR until the verification
       is complete.
       3.2.2.2. At the discretion of the SQ/CC, BMC pilots may accomplish an initial verification or par-
       ticipate in CT verifications to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status.
   3.2.3. Initial Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Defensive Training (NBCDT).
       3.2.3.1. Applicable crewmembers will complete training IAW AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum
       Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations and MAJCOM supplements. Initial NBCDT is
       designed to ensure crewmember proficiency in the overall use of NBC individual protective
       equipment (IPE) and to familiarize crewmembers with combat capabilities while wearing IPE.
       NBCDT is applicable to all CMR and BMC crewmembers assigned to mobility units, or tasked in
       direct support of MQ-9 operations, and deployable to chemical high threat areas (HTA) and
       medium threat areas (MTA) IAW AFI 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional
       (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.
18                                                                      AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        3.2.3.2. Ground Training. The following training will be accomplished prior to the OFT training:
            3.2.3.2.1. Physiological effects/first aid of NBC agents.
            3.2.3.2.2. Equipment orientation/fitting of full IPE.
            3.2.3.2.3. GCS entry/exit procedures.
        3.2.3.3. NBCDT OFT. Mission will be conducted in IPE and consist of correctly donning and
        checking IPE, simulated emergency procedures, basic tactical mission profile, crew coordination
        procedures, and doffing of simulated contaminated equipment.
            3.2.3.3.1. Crewmembers will be NBC certified when initial ground and OFT training is com-
            pleted.
            3.2.3.3.2. The initial NBC Defensive OFT mission may be credited towards NBC CT require-
            ments for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.

3.3. Simulator Training:
     3.3.1. OFTs will be used, if available. If an OFT is unavailable, MQT simulator requirements may be
     combined into one or more CPT missions to accomplish appropriate switchology and emergency pro-
     cedures (EP) training. MQT crewmembers should fly mission profiles that replicate wartime tasking.
     Each OFT mission will include selected critical action emergency procedures, channelized attention,
     and unusual attitude/inadvertent weather entry procedures.
     3.3.2. MQT OFT Event Requirements:
        3.3.2.1. Instruments and Emergency Procedures. Personal and mission preparation, normal
        ground operations, flight operations, navigation, published penetration and approach to any spec-
        ified alternate and home base, post-flight ground operations, Critical Action Procedures (CAP),
        and selected non-CAP EPs.
        3.3.2.2. Tactical and Weapons Anomalies. Heavyweight takeoff, jettison procedures, tactical pro-
        cedures, tactical navigation, weapons deliveries (normal and backup), weapons anomalies, emer-
        gency divert/recovery procedures, hung ordnance procedures, and selected emergency procedures.
        These missions will be accomplished using a tactical scenario.
        3.3.2.3. Tactical Mission/Emergency Procedures Evaluation. This mission will be administered
        by a SEFE IAW AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2MQ-9V2, and MAJCOM and local directives.

3.4. Flying Training. Unit MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron missions. Maximum
use of armament recording assets and actual deliveries is encouraged on all missions.
     3.4.1. Supervision. An instructor is required unless specified otherwise. The SQ/CC will determine
     the physical position of supervision unless specified otherwise.
     3.4.2. Prerequisites and Currency. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional
     review sortie may be flown before continuing the program.
     3.4.3. Tactical Mission Evaluation. This mission will be administered by a SEFE IAW AFI
     11-202V2, AFI 11-2MQ-9V2, and MAJCOM and local directives. Crews will only be evaluated on
     events in which they are trained.

                                    CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter, along with the current MAJCOM MQ-9 RTM, outlines ground and flying
continuation training requirements for BAQ, BMC, and CMR crewmembers. Crewmembers must be
qualified IAW this instruction, AFI 11-401, AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2MQ-9V2, and applicable MAJCOM
and local instructions. Crewmembers must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status; MQT (or FTU instructor
upgrade) to fly in BMC/CMR status. Refer to Chapter 6, Specialized Training, for additional training
program specifics. During CT, crewmembers will update all applicable ground and flying currencies IAW
AFI 11-202V1, this volume, and other ancillary training publications. Training terms and sortie/event def-
initions referenced throughout this chapter are found in Attachment 1 and Attachment 2, respectively.
Units will track completed training and monitor unaccomplished training using ARMS. General require-
ments for crewmembers in each category and special capability are as follows:
   4.1.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) :
       4.1.1.1. Qualification flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9V2.

       days.
       4.1.1.5. In addition, if the BAQ crewmember does not fly for 21 days (inexperienced) or 30 days
       (experienced) the next sortie must be flown with a squadron supervisor or instructor.
       4.1.1.6. Unless currently enrolled in a program to achieve CMR/BMC, BAQ crewmembers that
       remain in BAQ status for more than six months will be grounded (except general officers). Waiver
       authority is the MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
   4.1.2. Basic Mission Capable:
       4.1.2.1. Qualification flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9V2.
       4.1.2.2. Instrument flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9V2.
       4.1.2.3. Mission flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9V2.
       4.1.2.4. Currencies IAW paragraph 4.3. (as applicable).

        4.1.4.1. Specialized training IAW Chapter 6 and guiding syllabus.
        4.1.4.2. Sortie and mission requirements IAW this volume and the RAP tasking message for spe-
        cial capes missions and other requirements established by the SQ/CC.
        4.1.4.3. Certification by squadron commander (usually designated on letter of Xs).
        4.1.4.4. Failure to accomplish the requirements will result in loss of certification/qualification
        (see paragraph 4.7. for recurrency/requalification).
     4.1.5. Designated Training and Designated Test Unit Requirements:
        4.1.5.1. Crewmembers assigned or attached to TF or CB-coded units will fly, as a minimum, at
        the BMC rate and accomplish the non-RAP requirements in Table 4.2. (as noted). Formal training
        syllabus-directed missions and approved test plan missions apply to BMC rate requirements for
        TF and CB-coded units respectively.
        4.1.5.2. For instructors, failure to accomplish requirements in Table 4.2. does not affect instructor
        status, but requires additional training as determined by the SQ/CC before resuming instructor
        duties in delinquent sortie types or event(s).
        4.1.5.3. Instructors must be initially qualified in any weapons events they plan to instruct.
        4.1.5.4. Ground training as directed by the SQ/CC:
           4.1.5.4.1. There is no requirement for crewmembers assigned or attached to TF-coded or
           CB-coded units to accomplish NBCDFT or verification.
           4.1.5.4.2. There is no requirement for CB-coded units to accomplish formal intelligence train-
           ing or weapons and tactics academics. Crewmembers will be thoroughly familiar with all cur-
           rent intelligence and weapons and tactics issues affecting on-going test projects.
        4.1.5.5. SQ/CC will direct the addition of sorties if programmed syllabus or test missions do not
        provide sufficient aircrew proficiency training.
        4.1.5.6. Instrument/Qualification/Mission or Instructor flight evaluation, as applicable, IAW AFI
        11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9V2. Crewmembers assigned/attached to CB-coded units need not
        maintain instructor status.

4.2. Ground Training. Ground training requirements are IAW Table 4.1. and the RTM. Waiver author-
ity for the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive. Ground training accomplished during
IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.
Table 4.1. is a reference for crewmembers ground training only. This table does not include all Air Force
ancillary training, which will also be tracked at unit level. Where discrepancies exist, the reference direc-
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                                 21


tive takes precedence. Waiver authority is IAW the specified reference directive. Chapter 6 contains spe-
cialized programs with both flying and ground training requirements.
   4.2.1. Instrument Refresher Course. IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Pro-
   gram; AFI 11-202V2; and MAJCOM supplements.
   4.2.2. NBCDT.
       4.2.2.1. Flight NBCDT: Periodic NBCDT flights integrate operations training with other func-
       tional areas (maintenance, intelligence, security, etc.) required to conduct combat operations in
       compliance with AFI 10-2501. They are applicable to all CMR and BMC crewmembers assigned
       or deployable to chemical HTA and MTA IAW AFI 10-2602.
       4.2.2.2. Units will develop plans and scenarios for NBCDT flights based upon anticipated war-
       time tasking. When possible, conduct NBCDT flights through exercise scenarios of sufficient
       duration to simulate ability to survive and operate in threats appropriate to the anticipated areas of
       operation. Only one actual MQ-9 NBCDT flight per tour is required. An NBCDT ATD mission
       will be accomplished within 30 days prior to actual flight. Pilots and sensor operators will fly a
       tactical profile in IPE in order to adapt themselves to MQ-9 operations while in MOPP Level (3 or
       4), as appropriate to the simulated operational environment. MOPP level may be relaxed (mini-
       mum Level 1) after a crewmember has become familiar with CW environment operations. The
       following restrictions apply: Crewmembers must still complete NBC mobility training events.
       The IPE for MQ-9 flight operations is the standard groundcrew chemical ensemble. Mission-Ori-
       ented Protective Posture (MOPP) Levels should balance crew protection with ability to execute
       the mission. When a high-fidelity MQ-9 ATD is available and certified, an ATD mission may be
       substituted for all NBCDT flight requirements.
       4.2.2.3. Ground NBCDT. Units will develop procedures for operating the MQ-9 in an NBC
       environment IAW AFI 10-2501. Develop the training program using the general and functional
       NBC defense TTPs as identified in AFMAN 10-2602.
           4.2.2.3.1. NBCDT ATD. An ATD in IPE will be accomplished once each training cycle. Both
           crewmembers will wear the equipment at the same time in order to adapt to limitations to crew
           coordination. An elevated MOPP Level (3 or 4) appropriate to the simulated threat(s) will be
           maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes in the ATD.
           4.2.2.3.2. NBCDT ATD missions should complement existing ATD mission profiles and are
           not additive to ATD requirements. Units without access to an OFT may use a GCS for training.
       4.2.2.4. Aircrew Training Device (ATD):
           4.2.2.4.1. Table 4.2. depicts minimum ATD training requirements. Units will determine addi-
           tional CT training device requirements based on expected employment tasking, training
           device capabilities, and mission training objectives. Units will determine appropriate supervi-
           sion levels for ATD missions/tasks. Units will track all aircrew device training used to satisfy
           RAP and non-RAP requirements. Note: Crewmembers are not expected to have or gain profi-
           ciency in EPs in phases of flight in which they are not qualified (e.g., abort for a MCE crew-
           member).
           4.2.2.4.2. Units will develop scenarios that cover all CAP, EPs, approach procedures, and
           other scenario requirements based on expected employment tasking and training device capa-
           bilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable during daily flying activ-
22                                                                       AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


            ities. Units will review scenarios annually and update as required. Unusual attitude and
            inadvertent weather entry procedures training and unusual attitude recovery training (includ-
            ing HUD limitations) will be accomplished during all instrument or emergency procedure
            ATD training.
            4.2.2.4.3. EP OFT. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight EPs and maintain proficiency in
            applying aircraft general knowledge to abnormal situations. Specific Mission Tasks: Unusual
            attitude recoveries, spatial disorientation, inadvertent weather entry, controlled flight depar-
            ture recognition and recovery procedures, CAP, aircraft subsystem failure checklist proce-
            dures, and instrument procedures.
            4.2.2.4.4. TAC OFT. Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight malfunctions and maintain profi-
            ciency in applying tactical knowledge to combat scenarios. Specific tasks: DOC-relevant sim-
            ulated combat employment, threat recognition and counter tactics, weapons malfunctions,
            relevant CAP and aircraft subsystem failures, controllability and structural damage.
     4.2.3. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). This training is not an evaluation, but
     a review of abnormal/emergency procedures and aircraft systems operations/limitations during realis-
     tic scenarios. One crewmember should present a situation and another crewmember discusses actions
     necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical conclusion. CAP and squadron special
     interest items should be emphasized. Incorporate the following elements into the SEPT training pro-
     gram:
        4.2.3.1. SQ/CC or SQ/DO involvement in the selection of monthly SEPT topics.
        4.2.3.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using MQ-9 mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
        4.2.3.3. SEPTs should be accomplished in the best ATD available or a GCS. If an ATD or GCS is
        not available, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one, but small flight-sized groups are
        allowed if all members participate fully and share equal time responding to emergency situations.
        4.2.3.4. Discuss at least two EPs for each phase of flight qualified in during the SEPT session.
        4.2.3.5. Accomplish two SEPTs each training period with an instructor or SQ supervisor.
        4.2.3.6. Accomplish one SEPT each calendar month. Failure to accomplish by the end of the
        month will result in grounding until subsequently completed.
        4.2.3.7. The intent of the program is to accomplish 12 SEPTs per calendar year.
        4.2.3.8. Completion of an ATD EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement.
        4.2.3.9. Instructors/supervisors administering an EP ATD meet their monthly SEPT requirement.
     4.2.4. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/tactics academic train-
     ing program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required IAW Table 4.1. The program
     will require successful completion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass). Use testing to
     validate qualification to the maximum extent possible throughout the training program. Crewmem-
     bers successfully scoring 85 percent or greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT,
     where authorized by the governing publication. Audiovisual/CBT programs may be used in place of
     academic instruction.
        4.2.4.1. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates or have attended the applicable aca-
        demic portion(s) of school, if possible.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                               23


     4.2.4.2. Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but not limited to:
         4.2.4.2.1. Air-to-surface weapons: description, operation, parameters, fusing, limitations, pre-
         flight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.
         4.2.4.2.2. Capabilities, characteristics, and TTPs of other CAF assets that the MQ-9 may inte-
         grate with in theater-specific operations.
         4.2.4.2.3. AFTTP 3-1 to include, as a minimum: Volume 1, General Planning and Employ-
         ment Considerations; Volume 2, Threat Reference Guide and Counter-tactics; and Volume
         XX, Tactical Employment – MQ-9.
     4.2.4.3. Develop special training for specific weapons, tactics, mission capabilities, authentica-
     tion, wartime Rules of Engagement (ROE), and safe passage procedures, and where applicable:
         4.2.4.3.1. Counterland operations, to include Air Interdiction procedures, Close Air Support
         (CAS) procedures, Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR) procedures, and Sup-
         pression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses.
         4.2.4.3.2. Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) procedures; including both tradi-
         tional and non-traditional Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) proce-
         dures.
         4.2.4.3.3. On-Scene Commander (OSC) for Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) procedures.
         4.2.4.3.4. Combat operations lessons learned.
         4.2.4.3.5. Theater specific threat reviews.
  4.2.5. Continuation Verification.
     4.2.5.1. CT verification updates crewmembers on their squadron’s wartime mission. Each CMR
     crewmember will participate in a squadron initial or continuation training verification every train-
     ing cycle as a briefer, board member, or seminar participant. Note: to facilitate future upgrades to
     CMR, SQ/CCs should encourage BMC crewmembers to accomplish an initial verification or par-
     ticipate in CT.
     4.2.5.2. ACC crewmembers who participate in a unit deployment in a tasked theater of operations
     may receive credit for CT verification (participating in remote split operations for a period of 14
     days fulfills the unit deployment requirement).
  4.2.6. Intelligence Training. The intelligence training program will be closely aligned with the unit
  weapons and tactics training program. The focus and extent of academic training will be determined
  by the unit/CC and be aligned with projected wartime tasking, threats, and unit equipage. In addition
  to threat knowledge, crewmember training will include:
     4.2.6.1. Visual Recognition. Crewmembers must be able to:
         4.2.6.1.1. Identify aircraft (rotary/fixed-wing, including joint/allied assets) they are likely to
         encounter by name or numerical designator and determine whether the aircraft is a friend or
         for.
         4.2.6.1.2. Identify major combat ground vehicles/equipment, and determine friend or foe.
         4.2.6.1.3. Identify major categories of naval vessels.
24                                                                       AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        4.2.6.2. Collection and Reporting. Collection and Reporting training will enable crewmembers to
        initiate reports (In-Flight Report [INFLTREP], Communication Instructions Reporting Vital Intel-
        ligence Sighting, etc.) and will familiarize them with the information requirements of the intelli-
        gence-generated Mission Report and Intelligence Report.
        4.2.6.3. Current Intelligence will cover significant military/political developments (including
        threat updates), in the squadron’s mission areas of interest. Use guidance contained in AFI 14-105,
        Unit Intelligence Mission and Responsibilities, and MAJCOM supplements, to develop and man-
        age unit intelligence training programs. The unit/CC will determine testing requirements.
     4.2.7. Air Force Anti-terrorism/Force Protection : required IAW AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiter-
     rorism (AT) Standards.
     4.2.8. Crew Resource Management (CRM). CRM continuation training builds upon the basic
     cockpit management skills taught in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training and FTUs. Each crew-
     member will participate in one session every 24 months (ANG: Every other unit training cycle, not to
     exceed length of 2 x AEF cycle). Failure to attend CRM training results in grounding (waiverable by
     OG/CC). Briefings and debriefings will include the core curriculum of CRM training IAW AFI
     11-290 Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program and MAJCOM Supplements. The
     instructor CRM course satisfies the 24-month requirement.
     4.2.9. Semi-Annual Take-off/Landing/Go-around Training ( L / R q u a l i f i e d c r e w s o n l y ) .
     Semi-annually, L/R crews will review proper takeoff/landing techniques and procedures. Review will
     include crosswind landing, go-around (planned and un-planned), hard-landing, bounce and porpoise
     recovery. Training will include video review of bad techniques and procedures during mishap land-
     ings and normal landings that show good techniques and procedures. Crewmembers who lose landing
     currency will receive this training prior to re-currency training.
     4.2.10. Enlisted Sensor Operator Career Progression Training. Enlisted Sensor Operators must
     maintain core competency knowledge, skills, and abilities in their enlisted career fields. Use assigned
     Career Field Education and Training Plan or Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) to
     develop and manage Sensor Operator skill-level and continuation training. Failure to maintain career
     field training progression does not affect CMR status.
     4.2.11. Ground Training Requirements. Ground training requirements, frequencies, references,
     and affects on CMR and grounding status are IAW Table 4.1.

4.3. Flying Training. All crewmembers (except API-8 and ACC/IGS crewmembers) will accomplish
the requirements in Table 4.2. as applicable to their crew position and qualifications. Failure to accom-
plish the requirements in Table 4.2. will not affect BAQ, BMC or CMR status, but may require additional
training as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to accomplish the requirements specified in this paragraph
or the RAP tasking message may require loss of certification or qualification (recertification or re-qualifi-
cation is IAW paragraph 4.7.). In addition, crewmembers must meet the following requirements (API-8
and ACC/IGS flyers will strive to accomplish the requirements as shown in Table 4.2.):
     4.3.1. Instrument Flying Training.
        4.3.1.1. Units will develop and implement an instrument flying training program to ensure instru-
        ment proficiency. Programs will include briefings on recognition and how to deal with spatial dis-
        orientation, unusual attitude recoveries, transition between visual and instrument conditions,
        weather avoidance, and navigation procedures.
        4.3.1.2. Units will also develop theater-specific instrument academic programs for inclusion in
        their pre-deployment spin-up training programs. Units will include a course on flight operations in
        icing conditions with emphasis on the MQ-9 limitations, capabilities, and avoidance in their the-
        ater-specific instrument academic training.
     4.3.2. Pattern Proficiency Sortie (PPS) (L/R-qualified crews only). The challenging nature of
     MQ-9 launch and recovery operations mandates L/R crews maintain a high level of proficiency with
     aircraft flight procedures. A PPS is a mission to practice instrument, transition, traffic patterns, and
     emergency procedures. A PPS can be logged at the discretion of the crewmember when sufficient
     training has been accomplished. A PPS should be briefed as a standard alternate mission whenever
     possible. As reference, a PPS should consist of the following:
        4.3.2.1. Instrument and visual approaches.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                           27


       4.3.2.2. IR touch and go/landing(s).
       4.3.2.3. Nose camera touch and go/landing(s).
       4.3.2.4. SFO(s).
       4.3.2.5. Go-arounds.
       4.3.2.6. Touch and go landings require IP supervision.

4.4. Non-RAP Training Requirements. MQ-9 pilots will accomplish non-RAP requirements during the
unit training cycle IAW Table 4.2. and the RTM. Failure to accomplish requirements will not affect BAQ,
BMC, or CMR status, but may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. If any sortie/event
from Table 4.2. is subsequently converted to a RAP requirement in the RTM, failing to accomplish that
requirement may affect CMR/BMC status, as designated.

4.5. Special Categories:
     4.5.1. Flight Surgeon. Flight surgeons participate in continuation training missions as observers.
     Units will develop appropriate mission orientation programs for assigned flight surgeons.
     4.5.2. Above-Wing-Level Crewmembers (ANG: Responsibilities for API-8 staff flyers are con-
     tained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG):
        4.5.2.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for Above-Wing-Level personnel (other than that con-
        ducted in support of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit. MAJ-
        COM Division Chiefs are the reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
            4.5.2.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure maintenance of appropriate ARMS
            data and provide that data IAW AFI 11-401.
            4.5.2.1.2. Review assigned crewmember accomplishments and currencies prior to authorizing
            participation in MDT.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                                 29


          4.5.2.1.3. Provide each crewmember with written documentation specifying the authorized
          mission types and events the crewmember may fly. Above-Wing-Level crewmembers who fly
          with only one unit may receive this from their attached unit commander.
       4.5.2.2. Above-Wing-Level crewmembers maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic
       ground training and special training programs within authorized mission areas. Specific currencies
       will be provided to the host squadron and squadron supervisors will determine crewmember qual-
       ifications to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT.
       4.5.2.3. Crewmembers will:
          4.5.2.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
          4.5.2.3.2. Submit qualification and authorization documentation along with currency informa-
          tion to the supporting squadron supervisors prior to flying with that squadron.
          4.5.2.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that they do not exceed
          their ability and proficiency.
       4.5.2.4. With the concurrence of the OG/CC, instructor-qualified crewmembers may perform
       instructor duties provided they are qualified and current for the applicable missions and events.
   4.5.3. Active Duty pilots flying with ANG units:
       4.5.3.1. Wing/group air advisor rated personnel on duty with operational training units can main-
       tain CMR and may be qualified as an instructor or SEFE.
       4.5.3.2. Active duty crewmembers, other than assigned advisors, are authorized to fly with ANG
       units IAW AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG.
       4.5.3.3. Pilots on exchange programs from active duty units are authorized mission oriented sor-
       ties IAW specific operations plans that establishes the exchange. SQ/CCs may authorize their par-
       ticipation IAW their specific experience and qualification.
       4.5.3.4. HHQ staff crewmembers may participate in tactical training events. Each crewmember
       will present documentation summarizing medical status (e.g., AF Form 1042, Medical Recom-
       mendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty), currencies, flight qualifications, etc., to the
       unit where flying is performed.

4.6. Multiple Qualifications:
   4.6.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3 with A/2 coord) may authorize qualification in more than one
   MDS for crewmembers when command mission requirements direct such action and dual qualifica-
   tion is economically justifiable. MAJCOMs cannot delegate this authority. Unless required for unit
   mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission
   aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft. Individuals assigned to positions covered by para-
   graph 4.6.2. have prior ACC/A3 approval, and do not need to submit specific requests.
       4.6.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests with full justification through command channels
       to MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3 with A/2 coord). Units will provide multiple qualification
       approval to the appropriate host base flight management office. Do not authorize flight accom-
       plishments until aircraft assignment is updated in ARMS.
30                                                                       AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        4.6.1.2. Multiple qualifications approvals remain valid as long as the individual remains assigned
        to the specific position and aircraft unless rescinded by MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3).
        4.6.1.3. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with differ-
        ent types of aircraft. Wing commanders (WG/CCs) will qualify in only one MDS. Either the wing
        vice commander (WG/CV) or OG/CC should qualify in a different MDS.
     4.6.2. Multiple qualification is authorized as follows and does not require a specific multiple qualifi-
     cation authorization. SQ/CC must designate in writing crewmembers that will maintain multiple qual-
     ification and designate a primary (CMR) aircraft:
        4.6.2.1. Crewmembers assigned to CC-coded units whose Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)
        include both MQ-9 and MQ-1 MDS. May maintain BMC status in secondary aircraft.
        4.6.2.2. Crewmembers assigned to TF-coded units responsible for IQT and conversion training
        for the MQ-9 and MQ-9 MDS.
        4.6.2.3. Crewmembers assigned to CB-coded units responsible for providing Operational Test
        and Evaluation of the MQ-9 and MQ-9 MDS.
     4.6.3. OG/CC will determine which currencies/events may be satisfied in either MDS and which cur-
     rencies/events must be satisfied in both MDS.
        4.6.3.1. Crewmembers qualified in multiple MDS will fly at least once each 45/30 (EXP/INEXP)
        days in each aircraft; all other currencies/events are IAW paragraph 4.6.3., Table 4.2., and Table
        4.3.
        4.6.3.2. Crewmembers qualified in multiple aircraft will satisfy at least 50 percent of their sortie
        requirements in their primary aircraft. If CMR in more than one MDS, an equitable distribution (as
        determined by OG/CC) of sortie and event requirements will be logged.
        4.6.3.3. If dual qualified in L/R operations, crewmembers will fly an equitable distribution (as
        determined by OG/CC) of emergency patterns, instrument sorties, penetrations, and approaches in
        each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements.
     4.6.4. Crewmembers must complete MDS conversion/qualification training IAW an approved sylla-
     bus.

4.7. Currency, Recurrency, and Requalification:
     4.7.1. Currency. Table 4.3. defines currency requirements for MQ-9 crewmembers. If a crewmem-
     ber loses a particular currency, the individual may not perform that sortie or event except for the pur-
     pose of regaining currency as noted.
     4.7.2. Recurrency.
        4.7.2.1. Crewmembers must satisfy overdue training requirements before performing tasks appli-
        cable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training annotated as affecting CMR status will
        require regression to N-CMR until accomplishing appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC.
        Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR, although
        the deficiency may result in grounding until completing training. The duration of grounding and
        status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on CMR status.
        4.7.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, the SQ/CC determines recurrency supervisory requirements.

   4.7.3. Sortie Recurrency. Loss of sortie currency requires (timing starts from last sortie):
       4.7.3.1. 31-90 (46-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain sortie currency. Supervision level is an
       instructor qualified and current in the sortie or event.
       4.7.3.2. 91-135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.7.3.1., plus instructor supervised ATD including:
           4.7.3.2.1. For CMR crewmembers: tactics, normal, instrument, and emergency procedures.
           4.7.3.2.2. For BMC crewmembers: normal, instrument, and emergency procedures.
       4.7.3.3. 136-210 Days. Same as paragraph 4.7.3.2., plus qualification and tactical (if applicable)
       written examinations and EPE.
       4.7.3.4. 211 or More Days. Sorties, events, and ATDs as directed by the SQ/CC, plus quali-
       fica-tion and tactical written exams, EPE, and qualification or mission flight evaluation (as
       required).
   4.7.4. Landing (L/R Operations) Recurrency/Requalification. The following actions are required
   to regain currency or qualification. Timing starts from last landing. (Note: crewmembers may con-
   tinue to fly missions not requiring aircraft landing or L/R operations).
       4.7.4.1. 31-90 Days (46-90 for Experienced). Regain landing currency. Supervision level is a
       qualified and current instructor.
       4.7.4.2. 91 to 135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.7.4.1. above, plus instructor supervised ATD
       including normal, instrument, and emergency procedures.
       4.7.4.3. 136-210 Days. Same as above, plus L/R portion of written examinations and EPE.
       4.7.4.4. More than 211 Days. Complete L/R IQT (see para 2.2.2. and 6.5.1.).
   4.7.5. Loss of and Requalification to Instructor Status. Decertify instructors if:
       4.7.5.1. They fail a flight check. To regain instructor status, the instructor must successfully com-
       plete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MQ-9V2.
       4.7.5.2. They fail a qualification, instrument, or tactical examination. To regain instructor status,
       the instructor must successfully accomplish the written exam.
       4.7.5.3. Instructor currency expires. To regain status, see Table 4.3.
       4.7.5.4. They become non-current in any event or sortie that causes removal from CMR or BMC
       status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require de-certifi-
       cation. Instructors will not instruct in events or sorties in which they are not current.

Notes
1. Only applicable to L/R qualified crews.
2. Crewmembers may update currency or obtain recurrency in the ATD. Requires a pilot and SO crew to
perform the event. Crewmembers and instructors may update this currency or obtain recurrency once in
the ATD, then the next update must be an actual event.
3. Instructors may log this event for currency when they instruct it.
4. Supervision level for recurrency is a squadron supervisor current and qualified in the event.
5. Supervision level for recurrency is an instructor, current and qualified in event.
6. Non-currency for 91-180 days requires a recurrency flight with an instructor.
7. Must be current in this event to fly unsupervised if mission requires launch, takeoff, or landing
procedures.
8. Approach weather category increases by one for each period overdue (i.e., an experienced pilot’s
approach category increases from Cat 2 to Cat 3 after 45 days and to Cat 4 after 91 days of not
accomplishing a precision approach).
9. ANG units: 90/120

4.8. Regression:
     4.8.1. CMR and BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Use only RAP training, pattern
     proficiency sorties, and contingency operations sorties for lookback (for L/R-qualified crewmembers,
     a maximum of one PPS per month can be counted towards RAP lookback). If crewmembers do not
     meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs may regress them to N-CMR or
     N-BMC status, as applicable, remove them from a CMR manning position, or initiate action to
     remove them from active flying status.
        4.8.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP sortie lookback requires a review of the crewmember's
        3-month sortie history. If the crewmember meets the 3-month lookback, the crewmember may, at
        SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR or BMC, as applicable. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will
        result in regression to N-CMR or N-BMC status as appropriate, or the SQ/CC may place the crew-
        member in probation status for 1 month. If the SQ/CC chooses probation, the only way to remove
        a crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month look-
        back at the end of the probation period. (See Figure 4.1.)
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                               33


       4.8.1.2. Crewmembers regressed to N-CMR or N-BMC for lookback must complete a SQ/
       CC-approved re-certification program to return to CMR or BMC standards. Upon completion of
       the re-certification program, the crewmember also must meet the subsequent 1-month lookback
       requirement prior to reclaiming CMR or BMC status. Units may credit the sorties and events
       accomplished during the re-certification program toward the individual's total and type sortie and
       event requirements for the training cycle as well as for the monthly sortie requirement.
       4.8.1.3. Lookback computations begin following SQ/CC designation of the crewmember to BMC
       or CMR. The crewmember must maintain 1-month lookback until establishing a 3-month look-
       back. If a new CMR or BMC crewmember fails to meet 1-month lookback while establishing
       3-month lookback, SQ/CCs may apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1. In addi-
       tion, 1-month lookback starts the first full month of CMR or BMC status.
   4.8.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons qualifica-
   tion at the end of the training cycle will require:
       4.8.2.1. For events tasked as QUAL at CMR/BMC, regression to N-CMR/N-BMC unless waived
       by OG/CC. To regain CMR/BMC, the crewmember must re-accomplish initial qualification in the
       deficient weapons event (see paragraph 5.2.). Events accomplished for this initial qualification
       may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the training cycle.
       4.8.2.2. For events tasked as FAM at CMR/BMC, regression to N-CMR/N-BMC unless waived
       by OG/CC. To regain CMR/BMC, the crewmember must accomplish at least three weapons deliv-
       eries reviewed by a squadron supervisor or instructor. Events accomplished for this initial qualifi-
       cation may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the next
       training cycle.
   4.8.3. Unqualified Crewmember Evaluations. Handle crewmembers who fail a qualification,
   instrument, or mission flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Crewmembers will regress to N-CMR or
   N-BMC, as applicable and will remain so until successfully completing required corrective action, a
   reevaluation, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
   4.8.4. Failure to Maintain Flying Standards. If a qualified crewmember demonstrates lack of pro-
   ficiency or knowledge during CT (not related to a flight evaluation) the SQ/CC may elect to regress
   the individual to N-CMR or N-BMC, as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR or
   N-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by the SQ/CC, an evaluation if
   required, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.

4.9. End of Cycle Requirements. Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie or event requirements of
this volume by the end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and
magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.10. for proration policy. In all cases report training
shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.2.
   4.9.1. Crewmembers failing to meet the total RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at CMR or
   BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required.
   4.9.2. Crewmembers failing to meet non-RAP sortie or event requirements may continue CT at CMR
   or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required.
   4.9.3. Failure to meet RAP Sortie Requirements will result in the following:
34                                                                         AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        4.9.3.1. Regression to N-CMR or N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie type deficiency
        is significant. To regain CMR or BMC, the crewmember will complete all deficient sortie types.
        These sorties may count against the total requirements for the new training cycle.
        4.9.3.2. Continuation at CMR or BMC if the crewmember maintains total RAP sorties and look-
        back and the SQ/CC deems the sortie type deficiencies insignificant.
     4.9.4. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Qualifications will result in loss of that certi-
     fication or qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.
     4.9.5. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will result in loss
     of that qualification unless otherwise specified in this publication or the RAP tasking message. The
     SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.

4.10. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may pro-
rate all training requirements when duty not to include flying (DNIF), emergency leaves, non-flying tem-
porary duty (TDY), exercises, contingency operations, or direct combat support preclude training for a
portion of the training period (ANG: or mandatory training required by civilian employment). Do not con-
sider normal annual leave as non-availability. Units may consider extended bad weather that precludes the
unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days as non-availability. ANG crewmembers unable to fly
during their monthly availability period due to weather may prorate one month’s portion of total training
cycle RAP sorties and events. The following guidelines apply:
     4.10.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability,
     not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
     4.10.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying (to include post-deploy-
     ment comp time) during the training cycle. Use Table 4.4. to determine the number of months to be
     prorated based on cumulative calendar days of non-availability.
     4.10.3. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower
     whole number, but no requirement shall be prorated below one.
     4.10.4. Consider newly assigned or converted crewmembers and crewmembers achieving CMR or
     BMC status after the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month for prora-
     tion purposes. Crewmembers will complete prorated RAP sorties/events in CT.
     4.10.5. If IQT is re-accomplished, a crewmember’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share
     following completion of IQT/MQT training.
     4.10.6. SQ/CCs may prorate a crewmember's last month on station prior to departing permanent
     change of station (PCS) provided they do not exceed one month's proration. Units may consider indi-
     viduals departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of
     CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station.
     4.10.7. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative impact on a
     unit’s CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A potential lack of training
     opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of
     its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station. The following proration procedures are
     intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit’s CT program.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                             35


   4.10.8. Normally, all sorties flown during contingency operations will be logged as contingency oper-
   ations sorties. These sorties do not count toward annual RAP requirements but may be used for look-
   back purposes. RAP events logged during contingency operations sorties do not count toward annual
   RAP requirements but may be used to update currencies. Upon relief from contingency operations,
   units will prorate RAP sorties and events for the period of time each individual was tasked. Addition-
   ally, proration is authorized for deployment preparation and deployment recovery time where home
   station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM.
   4.10.9. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations varies considerably, OG/
   CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provide valid training to be logged as RAP sorties. Events
   accomplished on these sorties may count toward RAP event requirements, and these sorties/events
   cannot be prorated upon return to home station.
   4.10.10. Upon return from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating the sorties to
   be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of valid RAP sorties as autho-
   rized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie proration. Negative numbers equate to zero.
   Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sor-
   ties.

Table 4.4. Proration Allowance.
   Cumulative Days of Training Non- Availability                 Months of Proration Allowed

                        76 - 105                                                3
                       106 - 135                                                4
                       136 - 165                                                5
                       166 - 195                                                6
                   195-210 (225 Exp)                                            7
                211 (226 Exp) and over                                   See Para. 4.7.5.

   4.10.11. Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and attended SOS
   in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His SQ/CC authorized a
   total of two months proration from his training cycle (two months for the 73 cumulative days of
   non-availability for flying).

4.11. Regaining CMR and BMC Status:
   4.11.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end-of-cycle weapons qualifications
   requirements or end-of-cycle RAP event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 4.8.
   4.11.2. If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet sortie lookback IAW para-
   graph 4.8., the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came off CMR or BMC
   status):
36                                                                      AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        4.11.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The crewmember must complete a SQ/CC directed re-certification pro-
        gram IAW paragraph 4.8.1.2. Additionally, the crewmember must regain RAP event currencies.
        The SQ/CC may direct other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR.
        4.11.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as 4.11.2.1., plus OGV-generated qualification and tactical written
        examinations.
        4.11.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT. Sorties, events, ATDs, and ground train-
        ing as determined by the SQ/CC, plus qualification (and tactical if applicable) written exams,
        EPE, and mission flight evaluation. The individual's training cycle will start over at a prorated
        share following completion of the flight evaluation. The instrument or qualification flight evalua-
        tions must be re-accomplished only if overdue.

4.12. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Requalification Process. Captain Smith
is an experienced CMR crewmember with a 1- and 3-month lookback requirement of 4 and 10 RAP sor-
ties respectively. On February 3, Captain Smith flew a counterland sortie prior to departing for a non-fly-
ing TDY staff tour for two months. Captain Smith reported back for flight duty on 6 April. What is
Captain Smith's status throughout the TDY and on return to flying duty?
     4.12.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Captain Smith as a countable CMR crewmember for reporting pur-
     poses throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 March, Captain Smith's Flight Commander (FLT/CC) per-
     formed the mandatory 1-month lookback (February). Captain Smith only flew one RAP sortie, failing
     the 1-month lookback. The FLT/CC then performed a 3-month lookback (Dec, Jan, and Feb). This
     3-month lookback showed that Captain Smith flew only 7 sorties for the period. Had Captain Smith
     flown two more sorties, the SQ/CC could continue him at CMR. However, with 7 sorties, Captain
     Smith did not meet the 3-month lookback for a CMR crewmember. The SQ/CC could regress Captain
     Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as CMR.
     4.12.2. The SQ/CC carried Captain Smith on one month's probation. On 1 April, Captain Smith's
     1-month lookback (March) was zero sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Captain Smith to N-CMR.
     When Captain Smith returns on 6 April, the SQ/CC must place him in a re-certification program.
     Upon completing this program, Captain Smith must then re-establish a 1-month lookback by 1 May.
     Failing to re-establish a 1-month lookback by 1 May forces the unit to report Captain Smith N-CMR
     one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June.
     4.12.3. If Captain Smith had returned on 22 March and had last landed 48 days ago, he could fly a
     RAP sortie with an instructor to regain sortie currency. For CMR purposes, Captain Smith must fly 4
     RAP sorties to recapture a 1-month lookback and achieve removal from probation.
     4.12.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 June, the SQ/CC prorated two months of Captain
     Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Captain Smith was deficient in one RAP sortie
     category. The SQ/CC could regress Captain Smith to N-CMR, if deemed significant. After he accom-
     plished the tailored re-certification program (the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC re-certified Captain
     Smith to CMR. This training counts for the new training cycle.

                                                 Chapter 5

                           WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial weapons qualification and maintain-
ing qualification in the employment of Air-to-Surface weapons. Refer to "Glossary of Events" in Attach-
ment 2 for further guidance in weapons events.

5.2. Initial Weapons Qualification. Crewmembers must accomplish initial weapons qualification in
any weapons event requiring qualification at CMR or BMC. Initial qualification achieved in IQT/MQT
satisfies requirements for CT qualification, but not for CT event requirements. If not otherwise specified,
initial qualification in a weapons event is satisfied when the crewmember has achieved a minimum of
three hits out of six consecutive record deliveries.

5.3. CT Qualification/Maintaining Weapons Qualification. These criteria establish the minimum
standards for a crewmember to maintain weapons qualification in the appropriate event and do not neces-
sarily determine evaluation criteria established by other regulations or agencies (e.g., inspection or evalu-
ation teams). Qualifications are valid throughout the following training period.
     5.3.1. CT weapons deliveries (to include simulated deliveries) will be tactical deliveries simulating
     realistic employment of weapons; considering such factors as arming, safe separation, recovery, safe
     escape maneuver, egress, etc., using USAF Technical Order (TO) 1-1M-34, Aircrew Weapons Deliv-
     ery Manual (Nonnuclear) as a reference. CT weapons deliveries should simulate realistic employment
     of munitions. Maximize the use of air-to-surface tactical ranges for weapons event requirements.
     5.3.2. Weapons qualification will be maintained by completing the minimum number of record hits,
     record deliveries, and also by achieving appropriate qualification percentage during the training
     period. Periodic qualification hit rate will be no less than 50 percent. See the RTM for specific quali-
     fication criteria.
     5.3.3. At the end of the training cycle, crewmember’s weapons delivery scores will be reviewed to
     assess weapons qualification.

5.4. Failure to Qualify. Failure to qualify in one weapon series does not invalidate qualification in oth-
ers. SQ/CCs may declare a crewmember unqualified in any weapon, and invalidate all previous record
deliveries for that weapon, at any time during a training cycle without affecting other weapons qualifica-
tions. If qualification is required at CMR, failure to qualify will result in regression to N-CMR and entry
into a re-certification program until re-qualification is accomplished, unless waived by OG/CC.

5.5. Weapons Delivery. A weapons delivery event includes target acquisition, laser designation (actual
or simulated), weapons release (actual or simulated), and weapon impact (real or simulated), followed by
a tactical escape maneuver for the ordnance being delivered (or simulated). Pattern descriptions, proce-
dures, training rules, and foul criteria are contained in AFTTP 3-1V(TBD), Tactical Employment—MQ-9,
AFTTP 3-3.1, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals, AFI 11-2MQ-9V3, MQ-9 Operations Procedures, AFI
11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, and TO 1Q9(M)A-34-1-1 & TO 1Q9(M)A-34-1-1 CL-1.
     5.5.1. Weapons Employment Parameters. The event requirements and parameters listed below form
     the basic framework for weapons employment training. All weapons employment will conform to the
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                                  39


   limits established for each specific event. Pattern descriptions, procedures, training rules, and foul cri-
   teria are contained in AFI 11-2MQ-9V3 and AFI 11-214.
       5.5.1.1. Guided Munitions Events:
          5.5.1.1.1. Hellfire. A delivery initiated from a maneuver to achieve and maintain line-of-sight
          to the target(s). Acquisition, track, laser designation, and launch, or 2 seconds stable lock-on in
          "No launch" conditions, followed by a tactical escape maneuver is required. Hit criteria: Either
          actual target impact or valid, recorded simulated weapon release within launch parameters
          with stabilized target tracking. May be accomplished in a simulator.
          5.5.1.1.2. Laser Guided Bomb (LGB). An event in which a combat/training laser is employed
          to self-lase simulated/actual ordnance during an LGB delivery. Minimum recovery is safe
          escape/ fuse arm/guide time required for the ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit criteria:
          IAW AFTTP 3-1.
          5.5.1.1.3. Inertially Aided Munition (IAM). An event in which an aircraft system is used to
          determine release parameters for IAM weapons. Simulated or actual delivery of ordnance is
          required. Minimum recovery is safe escape for the ordnance being simulated/delivered. Hit
          criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.
   5.5.2. Familiarization: Familiarization for weapons does not require a hit rate when compared to total
   employment attempts. The RAP Tasking memo further defines FAM requirements based on the train-
   ing cycle.

5.6. Full Scale Inert/Live Ordnance. Full Scale Inert/Live ordnance training is essential to combat
capability. Every attempt should be made to give crewmembers the opportunity to employ as many types
of weapons on the Unit Committed Munitions List as possible.
40                                                                         AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


                                                  Chapter 6

                                        SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. General. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for special capabilities and qualifications.
Units will develop local specialized training programs based on these guidelines. SQ/CCs may tailor pro-
grams for individuals based on previous experience, qualifications, and documented performance. These
capabilities and qualifications are in addition to core missions for the unit and may not apply to every
crewmember assigned or attached to the unit.

6.2. Instructor Pilot Upgrade Training (IPUG) and Instructor Sensor Operator Upgrade Training
(ISUG). These programs establish the minimum guidelines for those pilots and sensor operators identi-
fied by the SQ/CC for IPUG and ISUG training. Upgrade candidates should be selected based on a con-
tinued display of highly proficient airmanship, communication skills, sound judgment and must meet the
criteria listed below. OG/CCs may waive selected missions and events based on previous experience of
the upgrading pilot (UIP) or sensor operator (UISO). FTU instructors must complete the formal syllabus
instructor upgrade training course.
     6.2.1. Individuals selected for instructor upgrade must have:
        6.2.1.1. Pilots :
            6.2.1.1.1. 200 MQ-9 hours, or
            6.2.1.1.2. Prior flight lead (FL) or aircraft commander and 100 MQ-9 hours or previous expe-
            rienced MQ-1 crew plus 50 MQ-9 hours.
        6.2.1.2. Sensor Operators:
            6.2.1.2.1. 500 hrs total flying time and 100 MQ-9 hours,
            6.2.1.2.2. 200 MQ-9 hours or previous experienced MQ-1 crew plus 50 hours.
     6.2.2. Training. The OG/CC is the approval authority for non-syllabus unit instructor training
     requirements. UIPs and UISOs must satisfactorily complete academic, training device, CRM and
     flight training covering all elements of instruction required in the formal training syllabus and demon-
     strate instructor proficiency in those areas during an instructor flight evaluation IAW AFI
     11-2MQ-9V2, MAJCOM, and unit requirements.

6.3. Contingency and Exercise Pre-Deployment Training. Conduct this training prior to deploying in
support of contingency operations or combat exercises. The objective of this training is to ensure crew-
members' ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.
     6.3.1. Exercises. For exercises, units are responsible for referring to appropriate exercise plans
     (EXPLAN) and contacting appropriate exercise points of contact to determine expected mission task-
     ing (COMACC EXPLANs include EXPLAN 80 for Red and Maple Flags, EXPLAN 323 for Green
     Flag West, and EXPLAN 163 for Green Flag East).
     6.3.2. Contingency Operations. For contingency operations, units are responsible for contacting
     appropriate gaining command or organizations to determine expected mission tasking. Prior coordina-
     tion ensures unit preparation for the appropriate tasking and allows the responding OG/CC to tailor
     spin-up training for the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task. The SQ/CC is then responsible
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                                 41


   for implementing spin-up training, prosecuting the required missions, and determining the specific
   requirements necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency. Units will place emphasis on training
   needed for missions not accomplished in daily operations. Conduct spin-up training IAW all applica-
   ble instructions. If deploying to a HTA or MTA (IAW AFI 10-2602) must have completed NBCDT
   ATD and mobility training.
   6.3.3. Attached and Supporting Crewmembers. Crewmembers not assigned to the supported
   squadron must receive spin-up training as determined by the supported SQ/CC. This requirement
   applies to all attached crewmembers (OG, WG, HQ staffs, etc.) and all crewmembers supporting from
   any other squadron (operational, test or FTU). The objective of this spin-up training is to ensure
   attached and supporting crewmembers are proficient to conduct all expected missions. The supported
   SQ/CC determines the amount of spin-up training required for each attached and supporting crew-
   member based on the individual's level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc. The
   supported and supporting squadron commanders will jointly agree on the administration, documenta-
   tion, and evaluation of required spin-up training.
   6.3.4. Ground Training. Crewmembers may be required to complete academic training prior to con-
   tingency operations or exercises. Units will brief contingency (or exercise) Special Instructions
   (SPINS), ROE, and Command and Control (C2) procedures. Programs will emphasize deployment
   airfield capabilities, limitations, approach procedures, and hazards. In addition, air defenses, area ter-
   rain and weather and unique operating procedures will be addressed. The local Combat Weather
   Flight can assist with weather-unique training. Local intelligence organizations may assist the unit's
   intelligence functions in the development of threat assessments, training materials, and expected col-
   lection tasking.
   6.3.5. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting crewmembers are proficient,
   current, and qualified in expected mission tasking.
   6.3.6. Responsibility. OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating crewmembers are ready
   to deploy and are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.

6.4. Conversion/Difference Training. Conversion qualification is normally associated with training
between MDSs. Difference qualification is normally conducted when training in a different series aircraft
in the same MDS. However, when the differences between series are great enough, the training is consid-
ered conversion training that requires completion of the formal school initial qualification course.
   6.4.1. Initial Cadre. Wing commanders will designate appropriately experienced personnel as the ini-
   tial cadre.
   6.4.2. The OG/CC (or equivalent) will determine which training events are applicable after examin-
   ing the training and evaluation records of initial cadre and determine if a certification is applicable or
   whether a qualification evaluation (check ride) is required. OG/CC may require crewmembers to com-
   plete a written examination prior to unsupervised flight when emergency procedures have changed;
   even if an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, flight evaluation is not required. Forward
   a copy of proposed training qualification plan to MAJCOM OPR when training requires a flight eval-
   uation.
42                                                                       AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


6.5. Launch and Recovery (L/R) Training. Normally, L/R training is conducted at the FTU through
formal course syllabus; however, special circumstances and class availability may necessitate local
upgrades.
     6.5.1. For individuals not previously qualified in L/R operations, upgrade training will follow the for-
     mal course syllabus (MQ9PSOLRC). For individuals with previous L/R operations experience, an
     abbreviated SQ/CC-approved course may be administered.
     6.5.2. Upgrade to L/R operations will be at the discretion of the SQ/CC based on standard squadron
     operations, taskings, and manning. L/R qualifications will be certified by the SQ/CC.

6.6. L/R Recurrency Training.
     6.6.1. Crewmembers whose qualification has expired IAW paragraph 4.7.4. (unit CCs may set more

Terms
Air Reserve Component—Air Force Reserve and ANG units/aircrew members, including total force,
associate and unit-equipped.
Attrition Sortie—A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP sortie, or collateral
sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE, maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish the planned
mission. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly. Improper accounting of these sorties will
result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule, and negative impacts to the quality of
unit training programs.
Basic Aircraft Qualification—A status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training
prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The member must perform at the
minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flight standards set for the weapons
system. BAQ will only be carried by pilots until completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent
qualification except for General Officers above the wing level, and any other pilots specifically
authorized by MAJCOM A3/XO. Pilots are not authorized to perform RAP-tasked combat event/sorties
without instructor pilot or SQ supervisor supervision.
Basic Mission Capable—The status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training (MQT,
FTU IPUG/ISUG) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but does
not maintain CMR status. Crewmember accomplishes training required to maintain familiarity in all, and
may be qualified and proficient in some, of the units primary missions. BMC crewmember members may
also maintain special capabilities.
Circular Error—Weapon impact miss distance expressed in radial distance from target center.
Combat Mission Ready—A status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training (MQT)
prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions, and maintains qualification

                  GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Sortie and Mission Definitions:
     A2.1.1. Sortie: The operational nature of MQ-9 requires clarification of the term sortie within the
     scope of this AFI. An MQ-9 flight is defined as initial takeoff until the full stop landing. A sortie, for
     documenting events accomplished, is the portion of the flight in which an individual crewmember is
     performing his or her assigned duties. For the purposes of this instruction the terms mission and sortie
     are synonymous.
     A2.1.2. RAP Sortie. A sortie oriented to developing basic combat skills or practicing tactical employ-
     ment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission. If training is accomplished, a RAP sortie
     may be logged. Due to the nature of MQ-9 L/R operations, pattern proficiency sorties (PPS) may be
     considered a RAP sortie. The PPS may also be included in sortie lookback.
     A2.1.3. Non-RAP Sortie. A sortie where combat skills training is not accomplished. Unless specifi-
     cally tasked, there is no requirement to log non-RAP sorties.
     A2.1.4. Logging Sorties. Normally, crew members will not log more than one type of sortie on a sin-
     gle flight, unless:
        A2.1.4.1. Specifically allowed in the sortie description (i.e. instructor sortie).
        A2.1.4.2. A crewmember is relieved by another crewmember for the purpose of accomplishing a
        sortie and then subsequently takes over the position again during the same flight.

A2.2. Specific Sortie definitions:
     A2.2.1. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) – Basic flying skills sortie. Training for proficiency
     in utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with operational and safety
     constraints.
     A2.2.2. Air Strike Control (ASC) Sortie – Sortie designed to develop proficiency in airborne forward
     air control of armed attack aircraft in support of actual or simulated ground forces. Mission elements
     include:
        A2.2.2.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning
        A2.2.2.2. Actual or simulated interface with Theater Air-Ground System (TAGS).
        A2.2.2.3. Target acquisition, identification and marking
        A2.2.2.4. Positive control of ground attack fighters employing simulated or actual ordinance
        against designated targets
        A2.2.2.5. FAC-to-fighter brief
        A2.2.2.6. Integration of ground and heliborne fire support elements (if available)
        A2.2.2.7. Identification and neutralization of enemy air defenses
        A2.2.2.8. Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and INFLTREP.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                               53


  A2.2.3. Attrition Sortie – A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP sortie, or
  collateral sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE, maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish
  the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly. Improper accounting of these
  sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule, and negative impacts to
  the quality of unit training programs.
  A2.2.4. Basic Surface Attack – Building block sortie. Training designed to achieve proficiency in day
  or night air-to-surface weapons delivery events.
  A2.2.5. Close Air Support (CAS) Sortie – Counterland mission sortie flown in support of ground
  forces under the control of a FAC (A) or JTAC. Mission elements include:
     A2.2.5.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning.
     A2.2.5.2. Mission execution against actual or simulated threats.
     A2.2.5.3. Simulated or actual weapons delivery under positive control of JTAC or Forward Air
     Controller (Airborne) [FAC(A)].
     A2.2.5.4. BDA and INFLTREP.
  A2.2.6. Collateral Sorties – These sorties do not directly relate to combat employment or basic skills
  training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations such as functional check
  flights and air shows. These sorties are not required for RAP training purposes.
  A2.2.7. Commander Option Sortie – A sortie that may be used to provide individualized training
  based on proficiency and demonstrated performance. This sortie may be allocated above the guide-
  lines in the RAP tasking message for all mission types. The intent is to use these missions as necessary
  throughout the training cycle, rather than allocating them at the beginning of the training cycle.
  A2.2.8. Contingency Operations Sortie – Sorties at a contingency location, or in support of real-world
  operations, which provide limited or no RAP training and do not count toward training cycle RAP
  requirements. Units may use Contingency Operations sorties for lookback purposes. RAP events
  accomplished during sorties logged as Contingency Operations do not count toward training cycle
  RAP requirements; however individual events can be used to update currencies.
  A2.2.9. Demanding Sortie – Sorties that task the aircrew to the extent that flying frequency and con-
  tinuity are most critical. Authorized sorties/events requiring demanding mission currency are: CAS,
  SCAR, ASC, CSAR, CFTR, JFT, instructor duties, etc. SQ/CCs may add sorties/events to the
  demanding sortie list depending on unit tasking and the individual's capabilities. Also see
  Non-demanding Sortie.
  A2.2.10. Forward Air Controller-Airborne (FAC-A) Sortie – Sortie flown to provide airborne for-
  ward air control of strike aircraft in support of actual or simulated ground forces. Mission elements
  include:
     A2.2.10.1. Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning
     A2.2.10.2. Actual or simulated interface with TAGS C2 network
     A2.2.10.3. Target acquisition, identification and marking
     A2.2.10.4. Positive control of ground attack fighters employing simulated or actual ordinance
     against designated targets
54                                                                         AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


        A2.2.10.5. FAC-to-fighter brief
        A2.2.10.6. Integration of ground and heliborne fire support elements (if available)
        A2.2.10.7. Identification and neutralization of enemy air defenses
        A2.2.10.8. BDA and INFLTREP.
     A2.2.11. Instructor Sortie – Special qualification sortie. Sortie where the IP/ISO acted in an instruc-
     tional capacity and was not able to obtain valid combat training because of instructor duties. May be
     dual-logged with RAP sorties.
     A2.2.12. Instrument Sortie – Basic skills sortie. Training designed to ensure instrument proficiency.
     RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument sortie provided accomplishment does not interfere
     with the primary goal of instrument training. Units are allocated sorties for every aircrew to accom-
     plish their minimum basic skill, non-RAP, requirements.
     A2.2.13. Night Sortie – Sortie on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight dura-
     tion or 1 hour, whichever is less, occur between the period of official sunset to official sunrise. Night
     sorties may be dual-logged with RAP sorties
     A2.2.14. Non-demanding Sortie – A sortie that provides the aircrew with the opportunity to regain
     basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that have been under used during the
     non-flying period. Authorized sorties/events flown on a non-demanding sortie are: Instruments, AHC,
     RSTA, basic weapons delivery, etc. SQ/CCs may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding sortie
     list, depending on unit tasking and the individual's capabilities.
     A2.2.15. Pilot Proficiency Sortie (PPS) – A basic proficiency sortie for practicing instrument, transi-
     tion, and emergency procedures. A minimum of 45 minutes in the pattern should be scheduled for this

A2.3. Events. An event is defined as a specific type of target acquisition or weapons employment per-
formed during a sortie or the accomplishment of a specific training element, function, or task (i.e., buddy
lasing, handover procedures, SAT, etc.). Unless otherwise specified in the event descriptions, units will
determine the necessary parameters for fulfilling and logging tasked events. Accomplishing a specific
training event is independent of the type of sortie logged. In the absence of guidance, units determine the
frequency and number of events.
   A2.3.1. Weapons Event Definitions. The following is a listing of event definitions for use in fulfill-
   ing tasked requirements. Not all events may be applicable to MQ-9 operations.
       A2.3.1.1. Weapons Delivery. A delivery event is defined as a pass at a target on which ordnance
       is expended or simulated and meets the criteria defining a specific weapon delivery. These deliv-
       ery events will be used to update weapons qualifications and currencies. Weapon events are
       defined in Chapter 5. All deliveries will be recorded, but not necessarily as a "record" delivery.
       There are two types of deliveries:
           A2.3.1.1.1. Basic Delivery. A delivery using a conventional box pattern. It may be used as a
           record event only for initial qualification. There is no restriction on the number of dry passes
           made before or during basic deliveries in a record event for initial qualification; however, only
           the first two deliveries per event may be made for record.
           A2.3.1.1.2. Tactical Delivery. A delivery using patterns and techniques that minimize final
           flight path predictability, yet allow sufficient time for accurate weapons delivery. Dry passes in
56                                                                        AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008


           the event are not permitted before or during a record event. Tactical deliveries will normally
           include recovery to egress parameters.
        A2.3.1.2. Categories. A delivery constitutes a weapons delivery event based on two categories: by
        record keeping (Record or Non-Record), and by RAP tasking (FAM and QUAL):
           A2.3.1.2.1. Non-Record. Basic or Tactical weapons delivery accomplishments not credited
           toward weapons qualification provided the aircrew declares non-record prior to beginning
           event.
           A2.3.1.2.2. Record. Conventional or nuclear delivery scored for individual weapons qualifi-
           cation. Scoring shall be accomplished by ground, air or Aircraft Video Tape Recorder scoring,
           as appropriate. A maximum of two record deliveries may be accomplished during a sortie
           from a single run-in heading. Additional record deliveries may be accomplished from head-
           ings differing by at least 90 degrees or on different targets/ranges and may not be preceded by
           non-record deliveries in the event on the same sortie. The first two deliveries will be consid-
           ered record unless otherwise declared prior to the roll-in to final. Scores will be documented
           by CEP and clock position. Additional guidelines are:
           A2.3.1.2.3. FAM. Weapons events tasked at FAM may be basic/tactical record deliveries.
           Each single pass counts as one delivery. Unless otherwise specified in the RAP tasking mes-
           sage or formal course syllabi, FAM tasking requires six weapons deliveries annually.
           A2.3.1.2.4. QUAL. Weapons tasked at QUAL must be tactical, record deliveries. QUAL task-
           ing demonstrates the aircrew's capability to put appropriate ordnance on target. Unless other-
           wise specified in the RAP tasking message or formal course syllabi, QUAL criteria is
           established for each event in Chapter 5.
     A2.3.2. Miscellaneous Weapons Delivery Definitions and Descriptions :
        A2.3.2.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended. Such dry
        passes prior to completion of record deliveries in an event are charged to the aircrew as gross error
        unless pass was dry because of safety interests, system malfunctions, basic delivery requirements,
        or directed for flight integrity purposes.
        A2.3.2.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent with
        established procedures or safety considerations. A foul will result in a gross error for that delivery.
        Verbal warnings will not be substituted for fouls. A second foul or any dangerous pass will result
        in mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during that mission and a gross error score for
        the event. A foul will be charged IAW flying directive publications.
        A2.3.2.3. Full Scale Weapons Delivery. Delivery of live or inert ordnance in a combat configura-
        tion.
        A2.3.2.4. Gross Error. A penalty score or miss assigned when a weapons delivery attempt results
        in: munitions impact outside the range scoring capability; a chargeable dry pass; a foul; an unin-
        tentional release, or exceeding tactical delivery time on final requirements.
        A2.3.2.5. Hit. Any munitions impact within the weapons criteria established for that event.
        A2.3.2.6. Multiple Release. More than one weapon released against a target on a single pass.
AFI11-2MQ-9V1 3 JUNE 2008                                                                               57


         A2.3.2.6.1. Intentional. The aircrew must advise the range officer prior to delivery and desig-
         nate which impact to be scored.
         A2.3.2.6.2. Inadvertent. Ordnance which has released without command by the aircrew.
         Impact will not be scored.
         A2.3.2.6.3. System Malfunction. An undeclared multiple release caused by a verified system
         malfunction. Score is void. If a system malfunction is not verified, unintentional rules apply.
         A2.3.2.6.4. Unintentional. Ordnance released due to aircrew error. Will be scored as gross
         error regardless of impact point.
     A2.3.2.7. No Spot. A weapons release during which no impact was observed. No score or error
     will be assigned.
     A2.3.2.8. Void Delivery. Weapons delivery not successfully completed due to: a documented and
     verified weapons system malfunction; a pass aborted for safety; no spot; or circumstances beyond
     the control of the aircrew.
  A2.3.3. Tactical Events. The following is an alphabetical listing of events to be used for fulfilling
  tasked requirements. In the absence of guidance, units will determine the content of tasked events and
  how often they may be logged. Alphanumerics in brackets identify the ARMS code associated with
  the event.
     A2.3.3.1. Buddy Lasing Procedures. Practice tactical target lock-ons for laser guided munition
     equipped strike assets using laser operational terminology and procedures to include: striker ren-
     dezvous and briefing, establishment of safe observation position, target plotting, identification,
