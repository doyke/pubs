OPR: SAF/FMCCF (Capt Rhonda L. Schneider)                   Certified by: SAF/FMC (Mr L.T. Baseman)
Supersedes AFR 173-13, 31 October 1989.                                                     Pages: 9
                                                                                     Distribution: F

This instruction implements AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics. It contains official USAF cost and plan-
ning factors that Air Force activities use to estimate resource requirements and costs associated with Air
Force force structures, missions, and activities. The instruction addresses operating and support (O&S)
cost estimates for Air Force weapon systems, primarily aircraft. The factors, which reflect Air Force and
command-unique actual or projected operations costs, are for general estimates. Replace or combine
them with more specific programming, operational, or activity data when it is available.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This is the initial publication of AFI 65-503, substantially revising AFR 173-13. Cost factors and narra-
tives previously contained in AFR 173-13 are available electronically on the Financial Management
Analysis Bulletin Board.

Section A—Functional Area Responsibilities

1. Related Publications. See attachment 1.

2. Office of the Secretary of the Air Force:
   2.1. SAF/FMC. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Cost and Economics) oversees the
   Cost and Planning Factor Program for the Air Force, including logistics, personnel, programming,
   inflation, and attrition factors.
   2.2. SAF/FMCCF. Cost Factors Division personnel develop logistics cost factors, issue guidance for
   the development of other factors, and validate factors prior to publication. Changes are published as
   required (when new information is available), but not less than once a year. Factors and detailed
   explanatory notes are available electronically on the Financial Management Analysis Bulletin Board.
   If you develop cost estimates or need to build your own cost factors follow the instructions in the
   tables on the bulletin board. For information on accessing the bulletin board, call DSN 286-5850 or
   (703) 746-5850.
   2.3. Offices of Primary Responsibilities. Attachment 2 lists several other units that develop cost and
   planning factors.
   2.4. HQ USAF, Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Report-
   ing Units (DRU) Implement Cost and Planning Factor Policy. These organizations may publish
   unique factors as supplements to this instruction. One copy of any supplement should be sent to SAF/
   FMCCF.
   2.5. Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG). The AFCAIG approves logistics cost
   factors for use by US Air Force units.

Section B—General Information

3. Operating and Support (O&S) Costs. This instruction presents cost and planning factors primarily
used to develop and estimate O&S costs or resources needed for Air Force weapon systems. The O&S
cost category is a major part of the Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) of a weapon system. Develop O&S cost esti-
mates by accumulating personnel and material costs, both of a direct and indirect nature, which the Air
Force incurs while operating, maintaining, and supporting the hardware and software of a weapon system.
Use cost factors to predict the resources needed by a weapon system for a budget year, or for a weapon
system’s economic life.
   3.1. Use of Factors. The five types of cost and planning factors can be used in a variety of studies or
   analyses; they are generally used for budget year or LCC purposes. Current Air Force policy is to use
   budget year factors over the estimated life of the program, with the exception of Contractor Logistics
   Support (CLS) as described below.
   3.2. Budget Year Factors. Use Factors**.exe file on the Financial Management Analysis Bulletin
   Board to get Budget Year logistics factors in developing the Air Force budget submission for a given
   fiscal year for the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).
   3.3. LCC Factors. O&S LCC factors attempt to account for the flow of costs throughout the eco-
   nomic life of a system. Life-cycle factors represent the cumulative average of actual prior year data,
   from initial operation through an average economic life, projected out to some future budget year.
   LCC factors are available for Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) aircraft only due to the wide fluctu-
   ations in CLS costs over the life of these weapon systems.

Section C—Cost and Planning Factors

4. Logistics Factors. Use variable logistics cost factors for programming and budgeting to increase and
decrease baseline programs when the force structure changes. Fixed and variable factors build Program
Objective Memorandums (POM) and Budget Estimate Submissions at HQ USAF. Use the detailed
instructions in each table to build your changes or estimates.

   4.2. Programming Factors. Use Programming factors when you need to identify the manpower com-
   positions of various aircraft for costing purposes. Detailed instructions on the use of these factors are
   included in these tables:

   4.3. Inflation Factors. Use the following inflation tables to generate inflation rates for the five major
   categories of funds: Procurement (PROC); Military Construction (MILCON); Research, Develop-
   ment, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E); Operation and Maintenance (O&M); and Fuel. Each rate
   reflects the particular economic characteristics of the corresponding category.

   4.4. Attrition Factors. Use attrition factors to estimate the number of aircraft remaining after a certain
   number of years of operation, thus allowing decrements over time in the number of aircraft being
   costed for operating and support purposes. Attrition factors are also used to determine initial numbers
   of aircraft needed to fulfill operational needs. Detailed instructions for using attrition factors are
   included in these tables:

   4.5. Cost Models. The Cost-Oriented Resource Estimating (CORE) model and the Systematic
   Approach to Better Long-Range Estimating (SABLE) model are two primary models which use fac-
   tors referenced in this instruction. Reference the following tables for more detail:
