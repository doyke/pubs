1. GENERAL: Organic and sustained E-3 mission critical computer software and databases,
used by the 552 ACW to accomplish the mission, must be accurate and current to ensure
worldwide capability and flight safety. The 552 ACW, in concert with other E-3 operational
software OPRs, must maintain a capability to expeditiously create or update the operations
software and databases to comply with mission requirements, military procedures and Letters of
Agreement (LOA). The timely identification, expeditious processing and appropriate feedback
of software deficiencies and software changes are essential for accomplishment of the 552
ACW’s mission. Users of this instruction should refer to Attachment 2 for a listing of mission
critical computer software, configuration manager, engineering OPR, wing focal point and
deficiency reporting methods.
2. RELEASABILITY STATEMENT: Release authority, for organic and sustained software,
will be coordinated/approved through the appropriate foreign disclosure office within 552d
Operational Support Squadron (552 OSS)/IN, HQ ACC/A8CA, and/or HQ ESC/AEW&C for
release to other agencies or countries. E-3 operational software and databases managed by other
organizations (OC-ALC, WR-ALC, 53 Wing/68 EWS Eglin, Contractors, etc.) will be released
through their release authorities.
3. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS PROCESSING:
   3.1. Requirements: For 552 ACW and OC-ALC/557 ACSS managed software the software
   user initiates the appropriate Computer Software Change Request (CSCR). There are six
   types of CSCRs: Document Error Report (DER), Program Error Report (PER), Program
   Incident Report (PIR), Database Change Request (DBCR), Trouble Incident Report (TIR)
   and a System Design Request (SDR). The initiator submits the CSCR to the appropriate
   wing agency based upon guidelines provided in this instruction. The receiving wing agency
   office will subsequently process each CSCR as required within this instruction. Attachment
   2 contains the appropriate configuration management OPRs, engineering OPRs, 552 ACW
   focal point and deficiency reporting method for organic and sustained software.
   3.2. The 552d Operations Group (552 OG) reviews Category I and II CSCRs for validity,
   duplication elimination, impact assessment, consolidated position and priority assignment of
   1 through 5 for PERs/SDRs IAW the CSCR Priority Scheme (Attachment 4). This review is
   conducted through the 552 OG Requirements Review Board (RRB) or equivalent automated
   process. The 552 OG will convene a RRB or equivalent on at least a quarterly basis for all
   outstanding routine PERs/SDRs. The 552 OG will convene an immediate level RRB, if a
   PER/SDR is a potential priority 1 or 2. PERs/SDRs approved at the RRB are forwarded to
   552 ACNS/SCXC for a wing tracking number and distribution to the responsible wing
   agency per Attachment 2. The submitted Category I and II CSCRs may subsequently be
   converted to AF Deficiency Reports for handling.
   3.3. The 552 Air Control Group (ACG) reviews all 552 ACW initiated Category III through
   V CSCRs submitted against organic software prior to submission to 552 ACNS/SCXC for
   tracking number and distribution. The review will verify validity, eliminate duplication,
   assess impact and assign priority. The 552 ACG will analyze Category I and II SDRs and
   PIRs, against organic software, subsequent to the OG review. Validated PIRs are
   resubmitted as PERs providing recommended corrective actions. SDR and PER analysis
   reports will provide an initial engineering/technical evaluation of the required software
   changes and include defined requirements, initial design analysis, proposed software
 4                                                        552ACWI63-101 31OCTOBER 2011


     requirements (timing, sizing and etc.), resource requirements and estimated impacts
     (hardware, documentation, workload and etc). 552 OSS/OSR receives the analysis to
     support build recommendations and Software Configuration Control Board (SCCB) actions.
     3.4. The 552 ACNS/SCXC, Configuration Management Section, logs all CSCRs originating
     within the 552 ACW referencing organic software in the CSCR tracking database and
     forwards to appropriate software development organization for analysis. OC-ALC/552
     SMXS logs all CSCR’s originating within the OC-ALC reference organic maintained
     software in the CSCR tracking database and forwards to appropriate software development
     organization for analysis. For software maintained outside the 552 ACW and OC-ALC/557
     ACSS refer to Attachment 2 for configuration management OPR, engineering OPR, 552
     ACW focal point and deficiency reporting method. CSCR’s established in or forwarded to
     OC-ALC will be processed according to approved configuration management governing
     directives. For 552 ACW initiated CSCR’s the goal is to complete the PIR analysis in no
     more than 45 days, measured from the date the PIR is received by 552 ACNS/SCF until peer
     review is completed. PER’s based on known errors may be completed as necessary. SDR
     analysis, with the recommended corrective action, is to be conducted and completed IAW the
     wing SCCB priority listing.       However, should the 552 ACG/CC or the 552 OG/CC
     determine any change to be of critical nature and normal resource allocation will not satisfy
     crucial operational requirements in a timely manner, the PIR or PER will be given priority
     over all SCCB items. If required, a special Consolidated Review Meeting (CRM) may be
     convened to present the analysis.        Normal results of 552 ACW initiated CSCR
     (PIR/PER/SDR/TIR) analyses will be presented at the next scheduled CRM meeting. The
     applicable Software Program Manager, 552 OSS/OSR and 552 ACW/XPR, receive an
     information copy of the CSCR.
     3.5. The E-3 System Program Director (SPD) is the Single Manager (SM) responsible for
     Configuration Management (CM) of the AWACS. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
     between ESC/AW, 552 ACW and OC-ALC/PSW delegates Configuration Control Board
     authority to 552 ACW for E-3 organic software managed by the 552 ACW, IAW the MOA.
     The 552 ACW/CV or the SCCB designee is the chairman of the 552 ACW SCCB. The 552
     ACW/CV or the SCCB designee will convene and chair a wing level SCCB annually for
     CSCRs against organic software with a semi-annual review of the prioritized list. Electronic
     SCCB may be conducted in lieu of the annual board. An immediate wing level SCCB will
     be held if a CSCR against organic software is a priority 1 or 2. The wing level SCCB will
     identify/prioritize CSCRs requiring contractor action. Representatives from the 552
     OG/ACG/MXG will attend wing level and ALC (when applicable) SCCBs. The wing SCCB
     will assign a sequential priority, validate requirements and determine build content
     requirements against organic software. Approval of the requirements analysis and software
     design is provided at the monthly Requirements Specification Reviews (RSRs) and Software
     Design Reviews during the CRM.
4. RESPONSIBILITIES: All personnel using or maintaining U.S. E-3 software are
responsible for identifying program, database, documentation incidents/errors and suggested
changes by submitting appropriate CSCRs as specified within this wing instruction. Individuals
observing a potential software problem against operational software must submit a PIR against
that E-3 software. Only programmers of the applicable software can verify a software error and
submit a PER. Individuals will submit an SDR to recommend software enhancements. It is the
552ACWI63-101 31 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 5

                           PROGRAM INCIDENT REPORT (PIR)

A5.1. PURPOSE. PIR will be used to report a program incident or suspected program error.
A5.2. INITIATION. Any individual involved in operating, maintaining or observing an E-3
software driven system may initiate a PIR. The originator must review the PIR and all
attachments for classification purposes. The PIR and attachments will be properly marked with
classification markings before being submitted. The use of acronyms and jargon should be
avoided. All Category 1 and II programs will be forwarded by the originating organization to the
wing focal point (552 OSS/OSR) for evaluation before being forwarded to 552 ACNS/SCXC.
All other PIRs will be sent directly to 552 ACNS/SCXC by the originating agency. The
completed PIR is given to the appropriate focal point who will thoroughly investigate and review
the report to assure accuracy, completeness, clarity and legibility of information supplied. Only
one problem and one program should be identified or analyzed per report.           A PIR may be
converted to a PER, SDR, DBCR, TIR or DER by the analyzing organization should further
action be necessary. If the PIR is to be converted to an SDR, the originator or appropriate focal
point of the PIR should generate the SDR.
A5.3. FORMAT. Authorized users will submit PIRs on 552 ACW IMT 6 or by electronic
message format (Figure 1) when at a deployed location and when the urgency of circumstances
precludes use of standard forms. An electronic message PIR will be followed up with a
completed 552 ACW IMT 6 and associated data as soon as possible. NOTE: It is mandatory
that the name/grade/phone number of originator, program name, version, priority and statement
of problem be completed prior to submitting the PIR. Omission of such items as date, cartridge
numbers, etc., will make analysis of the incident difficult. If the incident occurred at a deployed
location, indicate this information in the FROM block, e.g., ―961/Kadena, Deployed‖ etc., along
with home station address. PIRs should be completed in ink in a legible print style. Instructions
for completing the 552 ACW IMT 6, PIR, are as follows:
   A5.3.1. The originator will complete the following items in Section 1, Report of Incident:
       A5.3.1.1. Item 1. Date/Zulu Time. The date and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) when
       the incident occurred. Give the beginning and end times when the problem occurred.
       For the aircraft and mission simulator, the time will be computer-generated time as
       displayed on the Situation Display Console (SDC) or Digital Display Indicator (DDI).
       A5.3.1.2. Item 3. Title. Enter an abbreviated unclassified title, which is descriptive of
       the problem.
       A5.3.1.3. From. Organization and functional address symbol of the PIR originator. If

                 COMPUTER SOFTWARE CHANGE REQUEST (CSCR)

A6.1. PURPOSE. The CSCR will be used to submit either a PER or SDR. As a PER, it will be
used by Software Engineering to report a confirmed program error. As a SDR, it allows an
individual associated with the E-3 system to propose a change to improve system performance,
program design or add a new capability.
A6.2. INITIATION.
   A6.2.1. As a PER, only programmers/analysts/engineers responsible for software support
   may initiate a PER. Programmer initiated PERs must go to 552 ACNS/SCXC for assignment
   of a tracking number, then are forwarded to 552 OSS/OSR. Users will submit PIRs to report
   suspected software problems. Only after verification that a software error exists will the
   analyst open a corresponding PER. The originator must review the CSCR for classification
   purposes and properly mark with classification markings before submitting.
   A6.2.2. As a SDR, the originator will thoroughly review each SDR to ensure all information
   provided is clear and specific before forwarding it to their group focal point for review. The
   originator must review the SDR for classification purposes and properly mark with
   classification markings before submitting. The group focal point reviews each SDR to insure
   validity, suitability and clarity of statement before forwarding. All Category I and II reports
   will be forwarded by the originating organization to the 552 ACW focal point (552
   OSS/OSR) for evaluation before being forwarded to 552 ACNS/SCXC. Group or 552 ACW
   focal points will return disapproved SDRs to the originator. Approved SDRs will be
   forwarded to 552 ACNS/SCXC for control and processing. All Category III through V
   reports will be forwarded by the originating organization to 552 ACNS/SCXC for
   processing.
A6.3. FORMAT. Authorized E-3 software support personnel will utilize ACW Office Form 1
(Attachment 6), CSCR, for submitting PERs or SDRs. Instructions for completing the ACW
Office Form 1 for submission are as follows:

A.10.1. PURPOSE. The TIR is used to document Trouble Reports (TR) generated during
interoperability testing of AOCP.

A.10.2. INITIATION. A TIR is initiated by the external test section (552 ACNS/SCTE) upon
receipt of a TR from an interoperability test. This is done by forwarding the TR to the
configuration management section (552 ACNS/SCXC). The configuration management section
assigns a tracking number to the TIR and forwards to the AOCP project manager for analysis.
The external test section is the ONLY office that can initiate a TIR.

MEMORANDUM FOR 552 ACG/SCX
FROM: {Enter organization and office symbol}
SUBJECT: User Project/Work Request for {enter project name}
1. This memorandum describes a project or work to be done by the 552d Computer System
Group (552 ACG). This request describes the operational need, outlines the project, the
deliverables and any other communications made between the 552 ACG and the
{user/person/group being tasked}. [In the opening paragraph, state the formal topic of the
tasking. Discuss the in formation that is pertinent to the topic and could be useful to the
successful accomplishment of the tasking. Briefly describe the end result of the task and if
applicable, how this task fits into the larger program.]
2. Needed Operational Capability.
a. {In one or two paragraphs, describe the operational capability needed. Describe the
operational need in terms of operational requirements. Do not specify software or hardware
configurations (unless there is an ACW, ACC, or USAF requirement, or the request is a software
maintenance effort); just state the operational requirements which must be met. These
paragraphs do not serve as the requirements document - a separate requirement document will be
generated during the Requirements Analysis Phase of the project.}
b. System Operators: {State who the day-to-day operators of the system will be.}
c. Need Dates: {Enter the date the operational capability is needed.}
d. Items to be delivered: {State specifically if hardware, software, or both, is to be delivered.}
e. Initial training. Identify what initial training 552 ACG personnel must provide to the user, if
any. Will any course material or other training information be needed?
f. Support efforts. Identify who (i.e. what organization) will perform hardware and/or software
maintenance. {If system administration is needed, who will provide system administration? If
the system is using data, (e.g. a database program or other data) who will update and maintain
the data? If re-occurring training is required who will provide re-occurring training?}
3. Known Alternatives.
In this paragraph, the user/tasker should list other options that were explored to meet this
capability. {For example, are there any Commercial-Off-The-Shelf products studied? Are there
any known alternatives to meet the needed operational capability other than developing new
software, or buying new hardware?}
 44                                                         552ACWI63-101 31OCTOBER 2011


4. User Involvement:
a. The 552 ACG project team will keep the user representatives involved throughout the
development process. The user will refer to the Work Breakdown Schedule (WBS) to see when
meetings are scheduled.
b. User acceptance testing. {Should the user desire acceptance testing, state the type of testing
desired. If an acceptance test is performed, the following question must be answered, ―What
criteria will the validation of operational requirements be based on?‖ If there is a user
acceptance test, user representatives must provide written feedback on the results of the user
acceptance testing to the 552 ACG Program Manager.
Alternatively, instead of user acceptance testing, the user representatives can participate in the
552 ACG system testing.
There are numerous ways to organize a user acceptance test. For example, a one-week test to a
45-day trail period evaluation. The purpose of this testing is an operational shake-out of the
system. In User Acceptance Testing, the system should be evaluated against the project’s
requirements document(s).}
5. This section identifies how the user must support the 552 ACG project team. The user will:
a. Provide a day-to-day point of contact, called the user representative. The user representative
will work directly with the 552 ACG Project Manager and the project team. The user’s
organization should also provide a user sponsor, who is the sponsor of the project or a
management level above the day-to-day user representative.
b. Participate in developing a requirement document for the project. [For new developments
this involves a series of meetings which culminates with a project requirements document. The
user will participate in Requirements Specification Reviews (RSRs) and the Project Start Review
(PSR).
c. Participate in meetings. Have the opportunity to participate in the following reviews
throughout the project:
   1. User Project Review (UPR) - The user attends to approve the project plan and schedule.
   2. Configuration Control Boards (CCB) - The CCB meet to approve or disapprove system
   requirement changes to the baseline. The user representative is the co-chair.
   3. Preliminary Design Review (PDR) - the user attends to evaluate if the preliminary design
   will meet the operational requirements.
   4. Critical Design Review (CDR) - The user attends to evaluate that the critical design (i.e.,
   the detailed design) will meet the operational requirements.
   5. Independent Test Review (ITR) - The user attends to evaluate the system test results and
   accept or reject software to start user acceptance testing.
   6. User Release Acceptance Review (URAR) - This occurs after user acceptance testing (if
   any). The user representative meets with key 552 ACG project team members to list any
   discrepancies found during user acceptance testing. The user then approves the system for
   operational use, or requests that any discrepancies be fixed. This is documented in the user
   acceptance and release letter.
