                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Conversion Process. The Air National Guard (ANG) conversion process is the official
mechanism for unit activations, deactivations, mission and/or major equipment changes,
relocations, integrations/associations and other events which significantly alter or affect the ANG
units.
   1.1.1. The conversion process is implemented to establish new capabilities, enhance current
   capabilities and/or realign force structure to meet the requirements set forth by the
   Department of Defense (DoD), the Air Force (AF), and the respective state, District of
   Columbia, and territory.
1.2. NGB. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) is the DoD agent for force and resource
management within the ANG.
   1.2.1. The Air National Guard Readiness Center Commander (ANGRC/CC) assumes day to
   day responsibility for the management of the ANG, to include the conversion process.
1.3. NGB Air Staff. The NGB Air Staff coordinates the ANG conversion process with
appropriate DoD, Headquarters Air Force (HAF), Major Command (MAJCOM), State and/or
Territorial staffs.
   1.3.1. The NGB Air Staff manages the conversion process through a multi-phased process;
   planning, programming, and execution. In the planning phase, ideas and concepts are
   weighed against the current and future needs of the DoD, AF, and ANG. In the
   programming phase, required resources are identified and sourced through the reallocation of
   existing resources or the acquisition of new resources, normally through the established
   Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process. The execution phase begins upon
   completion of the programming phase, when a cross functional team from the NGB Air Staff
   will assist a unit in the implementation of a conversion by providing guidance, assistance,
   and resources to the affected unit.
1.4. Length of Conversions.
   1.4.1. Non-Flying units (do not own, or otherwise possess aircraft) will normally be in
   conversion for 1-2 years for the mission of record. This is to allow for proper programming
   through the POM process.
       1.4.1.1. Under special circumstances a unit may be required to remain in conversion for
       up to 3 years.
   1.4.2. Flying units (own, or share aircraft) will normally be in conversion for 2-3 years for
   the mission of record. This is to allow for proper programming through the POM process.
   1.4.3. No unit will remain in conversion for more than 3 years for a single action.
 4                                                            ANGI10-406 4 NOVEMBER 2013


                                             Chapter 2

                              PLANNING AND PROGRAMMING

2.1. Planning. An executable program is required before the first Site Activation Task Force
(SATAF) is conducted due to organizational and/or mission changes as a result of a Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action, Total Force Integration (TFI) initiative, a Strategic
Basing Action, or a programmatic action. For the purposes of this instruction, an executable
program is one where the requirement is validated and resources are identified and sourced.
Additionally, any organizational and/or mission change must be staffed and approved by
Headquarters Air Force (HAF), Director ANG (CF), gaining MAJCOM Commander, and Joint
Force Headquarters (JFHQ) - State before the first SATAF is conducted. TFI initiatives will be
approved by CSAF per AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities for Total Force Integration.
     2.1.1. NGB/A7XF must review the executable program before the first SATAF to determine
     impacts from the non-facility functional wing requirements, which could drive personnel or
     equipment facility requirements.
     2.1.2. Organizational and mission changes can either be top down or bottom up driven.
     These changes must be validated through the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS); the
     ANG Corporate Process mirrors the AFCS. The Program Element Monitor (PEM) and Unit
     Type Code (UTC) functional manager are responsible for coordinating requirements with the
     gaining MAJCOM and then preparing the proposal to establish the new ANG mission or
     missions - support capability or organizational construct. The PEM will submit the proposal
     to the ANG Panel Chair for consideration within the ANG Corporate Process and with final
     decision made by Director, ANG. The Director shall be the final approval authority for
     establishing new capabilities in the ANG, and the Director’s concurrence signifies a
     commitment that finite, future years’ resources will be realigned to the proposed capability in
     the upcoming resourcing exercises.
        2.1.2.1. Prior to the first site survey, the ANG Functional Area Manager (FAM) and/or
        Program Element Monitor (PEM) are responsible for developing and forwarding for
        coordination a description of proposed mission concepts (Lead MAJCOM CONOPs, I-
        Plan or equivalent document) which affords other staff agencies the opportunity to
        determine and advocate functional area of responsibility requirements and legal
        requirements under NEPA. CONOPs/I-Plans shall be prepared and coordinated before
        the first mission-related visit to the site.
        2.1.2.2. An introduction to the Air Force Corporate Structure and the Planning,
        Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System can be found in AFI 16-501, Control
        and Documentation of Air Force Programs. Guidance relating to the ANG Corporate
        Process is located in ANGI 16-501, Air National Guard Program Change Requests.
2.2. Basing and Bed down. All conversions must be reviewed by the ANG Basing Branch,
NGB/A8FB, to determine if the conversion must be processed through the AF Basing process.
     2.2.1. AFI 10-503, Strategic Basing, and DODD 1225.07, Reserve Component Facilities
     Programs and Unit Stationing, are the governing regulation for unit basing and beddown.
     AF/A8PB is the owner of the AF Strategic Basing Process and NGB/A8FB handles all ANG
     equities that flow through this process. A Basing Action is defined as 1) any weapon system
ANGI10-406 4 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                       5


   change (additions, subtractions, or mission design replacement), 2) any organization action
   that changes the number of AF positions at an installation by at least 35 positions, 3) a unit
   movement as described in AFI 16-403, Updating the USAF Program Installations, Units, and
   Priorities And Movement of Air Force Units, 4) a non-AF entity requesting to: move onto
   Air Force real property; or change their current mission being executed at that location, 5) a
   currently approved non-AF tenant mission manpower increase of 35 or more positions, and
   6) any special interest action as identified by AF/A8PB, regardless of size or scope.
   2.2.2. A Site Survey may be required prior to the first SATAF to validate beddown locations
   and associated costs. NGB/A3Z will be the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR); the
   Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) will normally be the Functional Area Manager
   (FAM) or the PEM. AF/A8PB is the approval authority for all Site Survey Control Numbers
   (SCNs).
       2.2.2.1. The Site Survey results are compiled into a report, produced by NGB/A3Z, and
       provided to all directorates to assist in the coordination and consideration of the program.
       All site survey requests and reports will be accomplished IAW AFI 10-503, Strategic
       Basing.
       2.2.2.2. Following the Site Survey the report will also be provided to the Joint Service
       Reserve Component Facility Board (JSRCFB) IAW DoDD 1225.07, Reserve Component
       facilities Programs and Unit Stationing by NGB/A. The JSRCFB will look at use of land
       and facilities by units of two or more components, to the greatest practicable extent for
       efficiency and economy. That shall include consideration for the acquisition, by
       purchase, lease, transfer, construction, expansion, rehabilitation, or conversion of
       facilities necessary for the proper development, training, operations, and maintenance of
       the Reserve components.
2.3. Programming. The programming phase is complex. Each new program must compete for
resources among other new (Director, ANG approved) and/or established programs. This is the
phase where the foundation is laid for program sustainability The program must be resourced to
support the organization and/or mission change.
   2.3.1. The PEM will advocate for program resourcing via programming exercises, budget
   formulation, and financial execution working groups.
   2.3.2. The first SATAF can be scheduled once NGB/A8 confirms one of the following:
       2.3.2.1. The action has been approved by the AF Basing Office.
       2.3.2.2. The action does not need to go through the AF Basing process.
       2.3.2.3. There is enough fidelity (available resources and buy in from gaining
       MAJCOM) in the program to execute followed by direction from ANGRC/CC and/or
       NGB/CF.
   2.3.3. Integrated Process Teams (IPTs). IPT chairs must ensure that NGB/A3Z is included
   in all IPT meetings.
2.4. Environmental. To ensure timely completion of the environmental analysis, the proponent
should complete AF Form 813-Section 1, submit to and coordinate with NGB/A7AM early in
the planning stages to determine the extent, cost, and time required to complete the
environmental analysis. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires

                                          EXECUTION

3.1. NGB Air Staff. The NGB Air Staff provides guidance, assistance, and resources to the
affected units for the timely implementation of the approved program. The execution phase
officially begins at a point in the conversion process where the program is deemed or directed
executable. For TFI initiatives, ‘Integration Plans’ required by AFI 90-1001 will be completed
prior to beginning this phase. Execution phase includes the following visit types: Site Survey,
Site Visit, and Site Activation Task Force (SATAF) visit.
   3.1.1. It is the responsibility of each directorate to support and fund these visits.
3.2. NGB/A3Z. The NGB Conversion Team, NGB/A3Z, is the ANG lead agency for the
facilitation of the execution phase of the conversion process and is the OPR for all conversion
related visits.
3.3. Site Survey.
   3.3.1. A ‘Site Survey’ is used to gather initial information, to identify first hand facility
   requirements, including new construction, modification of existing facilities, workarounds
   required to implement a conversion to a new weapon system, mission, or unit relocation, and
   possibly communications requirements. For flying units, availability of adequate training
   airspace and ranges should also be examined during the Site Survey.
   3.3.2. A Site Survey normally includes representatives from NGB/A7, NGB/A6, and
   NGB/A3, but can include other directorates as required.
   3.3.3. Approval Authority. All official site survey requests must be approved by HAF/A8PB
   IAW AFI 10-503. Once HAF/A8PB approves the site survey, they will issue a Site Survey
   Control Number (SCN). Intra-MAJCOM visits may be conducted without a SCN provided
   the visit is exploratory in nature and does not require any public notifications and/or
   announcements.
   3.3.4. An exception to this is an Environmental Site Survey, which is conducted by
   NGB/A7.
   3.3.5. Site Survey requests are required to be completed IAW AFI 10-503.
   3.3.6. A ‘Site Survey’ report will be compiled from the trip reports by NGB/A3Z from all
   the functional area representatives.
3.4. Site Visit.
   3.4.1. A Site Visit is conducted to validate existing data and/or to gather additional data. It
   can be used to make first contact with a converting unit and to provide a ‘vector check’ with
   on - going actions.
   3.4.2. A Site Visit normally is conducted with NGB/A3Z as the lead; the FAM, and
   representatives from other directorates as required by the conversion and specific purpose of
   the Site Visit.
       3.4.2.1. A7XF fire protection should be included on all SATAF regarding mission
       beddown, TFI, BRAC or mission change to evaluate the fire protection risk and possible
 8                                                              ANGI10-406 4 NOVEMBER 2013


        methods to mitigate. A7XF should review copies of all SATAF reports to ensure
        complete situational awareness in the non-facility environment
     3.4.3. A ‘Site Visit’ will have the following structure:
        3.4.3.1. Site Visit In-Briefing.
            3.4.3.1.1. This will provide an explanation as to why the visit is being conducted,
            schedule of the visit, and introduction of team members.
        3.4.3.2. Site Visit Working Groups.
            3.4.3.2.1. The number and make-up of the working groups will be dependent on the
            conversion and purpose of the visit.
        3.4.3.3. Site Visit Out-Briefing.
            3.4.3.3.1. This will provide an overview of what was accomplished during the visit
            and any findings. It may also establish any action items and assign an Office of
            Primary Responsibility (OPR)/Office(s) of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), as
            required.
     3.4.4. A Site Visit report will be compiled from the trip reports by NGB/A3Z from all the
     functional area representatives.
3.5. SATAF. A SATAF consists of multifunctional working groups that identify the necessary
actions needed to execute the approved program. Depending on the type of action, one or more
SATAFs may be required. The first SATAF normally occurs 12 months prior to the actual start
of the conversion (conversion manning document becomes effective), or as soon as possible after
appropriate documentation (i.e., programmatic, BRAC, TFI, etc.) is completed and funds are
available if less than 12 months. The SATAF is a dynamic process in which the SATAF team
and the field unit work together to identify timelines, shortfalls, actions, and fixes to ensure
timely completion of mission changes. This process helps bridge the funding gap between
implementation and the unit reaching an ‘Initial Operational Capability’ (IOC). The conversion
process may consist of several actions.
     3.5.1. NGB/A3Z will conduct a pre-SATAF meeting, approximately 2 - 4 weeks prior to
     execution of the SATAF. The pre-SATAF meeting is where representatives from all the
     applicable directorates will provide final coordination for the specified action. In addition,
     all program actions will be verified against the NGB/A3Z SATAF checklist (NGB/A3Z
     Form 1. Ref: NGB/A3Z Guidebook 5). Upon verification of the checklist, the SATAF may
     be conducted at the prescribed time.
     3.5.2. SATAF Objectives.
        3.5.2.1. Safe, successful, and timely conversion/relocation(s).

Terms
Action Items— Actions that must be initiated and completed at a specific time to support
programming change implementation. Action items that are critical to a particular milestone or
milestones are identified as such within each SATAF timeline.
Action Officer— For the purposes of this instruction, an action officer (AO) is an individual
assigned to the NGB Conversion Team (NGB/A3Z) who has the responsibility to organize and
conduct a SATAF, validate requirements, and to serve as the unit advocate at National Guard
Bureau.
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)— BRAC is a process that occurs periodically by the
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission to assess and recommend closure and
realignment of military installations. Once the Commission submits its final recommendation
and it is approved, the recommended actions become “must do” actions. The ANG proponent
for BRAC directed actions is the Force Planning and Basing Division, NGB/A8B.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)— An Air Force Concept of Operations delineates the
highest service—level concept comprising a commander’s assumptions and intent to achieve
desired effects through the guided integration of capabilities and tasks that solve a problem in an
expected mission area. Joint Force Commanders employ Air Force Concepts of Operations
through Air Expeditionary Forces to fight and win wars.
Critical Action— Action that must be completed and/or otherwise closed to achieve an
associated milestone. A Critical Action is also known as a “Show Stopper” if not completed.
Documented Approval Authority— Program changes require documented approval authority.
Following are the primary vehicles accepted as documented approval authority for implementing
program changes. (see BRAC, OCR, and PCR).
End of Conversion (EOC)— That period in time when a unit in conversion has met
predetermined criteria (identified at the SATAF, i.e., capable of deploying a 3 ship lead
element); or has been in conversion 3 years (AFI 10-201); or has a DOC Statement and is
reporting C-3 or better in all sub-area of SORTS; or if no DOC statement is on hand, when the
unit has C-3 equivalent in personnel, training, and equipment. This may coincide with IOC.
Field Training Detachment (FTD)— Provides hands-on maintenance training at operational
locations. FTD’s or their ‘Mobile Training Teams’ (MTT’s) are responsible for conducting the
training.
Field Training Team (FTT)— An FTT is a team of instructors from AETC who train unit
maintenance personnel for approximately 90 days at the converting unit.
ANGI10-406 4 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    23


Full Operational Capability (FOC)— FOC is when the unit is capable of reporting overall C-2
or better in SORTS, or capable of accomplishing the majority of their tasked mission. FOC
criteria and FY quarter, will be determined by the FAM prior to the SATAF, or during the
Operations Working Group.
Functional Area Manager (FAM)— The FAM is the focal point within an ANG staff agency
with unique knowledge and responsibility for specific AF Specialty Codes (AFSCs)/mission
areas, and is tasked to provide key input to and/or track a program change for that respective
functional area. Each ANG FAM should attend Functional Area Manager training provided by
AF/A5X, NGB/A3X and NGB/A3Z.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC)— IOC is when a unit can perform some but not all-of-the
mission. IOC date may be same as EOC date. IOC criteria and FY quarter will be determined
by the FAM prior to the SATAF, or during the Operations Working Group.
Milestone— A key event identified in the programming change that is essential to the
accomplishment of the scheduled programmed objective.
Organization Change Request (OCR)— An OCR is a request for an organizational action such
as a unit activation, inactivation, re-designation, association, or variation from any policy,
guidance, procedure, or standard structure depicted in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization.
Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR)— A designated staff office or field - level agency
whose input is required to facilitate an Office of Primary Responsibility's (OPR) accomplishment
of a particular programming action related responsibility.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)— A designated staff office or field-level agency that
is responsible for a particular aspect of a programming action.
Program Action Directive (PAD)— PADs are generated at the Air Staff level and are used to
direct MAJCOM development of program actions already in the PB or which are to be worked
into the PB through standard processes. In some instances, a MAJCOM may request authority to
write a PAD or be directed to write a PAD by Air Staff, but this is the exception rather than the
rule. The ANG does not initiate PADs.
Program Change Request (PCR)— Air Force program actions are authorized by the
President's Budget (PB). Formulation of the PB is a cyclic process. A PCR is a tool, submitted
by a MAJCOM or the Air Staff, which is used to initiate proposed out-of-cycle changes to
programs contained in the PB.
Program Element Monitor (PEM)— The PEM is the single point of responsibility for all
Program Element specific issues and are the experts on all aspects of their assigned program
elements. They are responsible for programming resources (equipment, personnel, facilities,
etc), scheduling implementation, and working disconnects for all actions within their programs.
Program Action— A proposal or direction for a new mission, mission change or association
that requires planning, programming and execution to implement.
Proponent— A Proponent is the ANG staff agency that has overarching responsibility for a
particular Air Force program and/or weapons system.
Site Activation Task Force (SATAF)— The SATAF process provides periodic, on site
assistance to unit level agencies to accomplish a program objective. It employs appropriate
 24                                                         ANGI10-406 4 NOVEMBER 2013


members of the National Guard Bureau (NGB)/ANG and/or supporting command staffs, under
the direction of NGB/A3Z. The SATAF structure is comprised of headquarters team members
and representation from the affected unites), which are organized into functional working groups.
Each working group has an assigned chairperson, who functions under the auspices of the
SATAF Team Chief.
Site Survey— An on-site action team led by NGB/A3Z, with representation from NGB/A7, and
other ANG staff elements as appropriate, which applies an objective approach to determining
facility requirements and estimated associated costs to implement a program change at a given
installation/location. A Site Survey can also be used for the determination of new mission
beddown requirements and feasibility. The Site Survey may be used as a tool in the decision
making process for a proposed program change, or may be conducted to facilitate planning for a
predetermined program change. The ANG office of primary responsibility for Site Surveys is
NGB/A3Z. Some Site Surveys will be multi - command and/or service. Normally the command
that owns the facility will be the lead for the Site Survey. In these cases, NGB/A3Z will still be
the ANG Team lead but will work closely with the lead command.
Site Visit— An onsite team led by NGB/A3Z, with representation from any agency, as required,
to validate existing data and/or to gather additional data. It can be used to make first contact
with a converting unit and to provide a vector check with on - going actions.
Total Force Integration (TFI)— The dynamic and effective integration of all Air Force
components to provide unparalleled air, space, and cyberspace power for the joint war fighter.
Planning guidance for TFI initiatives is outlined in AFI 90 - 1001.
Unit Conversion Officer (UCO)— Individual appointed by the unit commander to serve as the
unit - level point of contact for SATAFs. Specific duties of the Unit Conversion Officer can be
found in NGB/A3Z Guidebook 1, Unit SATAF & Unit Conversion Officer Guidebook (see
Attachment 1).
