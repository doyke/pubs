                                 REPORTING GUIDELINES

1.1. Using Report Information. The Air Force uses the information from reports produced by
each reporting system mainly for accounting and analysis. Each reporting system also gives
basic historical management information and data on equipment availability and use to all levels
of command. Use this information to:
   1.1.1. Compute the official Air Force inventory.
   1.1.2. Build the Air Force programming documents and their related budget and staffing
   requirements.
   1.1.3. Produce statistical analysis for congressional committees, the Office of Management
   and Budget, and the Department of Defense.
   1.1.4. Lead MAJCOMs establish capability goals in coordination with the Air Staff to
   include but not limited to Mission Capable (MC), Total Non Mission Capable Maintenance
   (TNMCM), and Total Non Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) rates. These goals enable HQ
   USAF to assess resource allocation funding on a quarterly basis. The MC rate goals and
   plans also go into the yearly DoD Materiel Readiness Report to Congress.
   1.1.5. Lead MAJCOM Reporting Requirements.
       1.1.5.1. Lead MAJCOMs will calculate the Aircraft Availability Standard (AAS) for
       each MDS annually using the equation in Attachment 25 of this AFI. Calculations will
       be for the subsequent two fiscal years (i.e. if current Fiscal Year (FY) is FY2013 then
       report data for FY2014 and FY2015). This information will be reported to HQ
       USAF/A4L NLT than 15 Aug of the current FY. NOTE: Remotely Piloted Aircraft
       (RPA) are exempt from using the prescribed equation but are not exempt from
       determining an AA requirement. The Lead Command will determine the AAS for RPA
       systems using other criteria (i.e. capabilities, operational requirements). AFMC aircraft
       are exempt from this reporting requirement.
   1.1.6. Compute the official Air Force Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Information.
1.2. Correct Reporting. The Air Force uses reports named in this instruction to develop and
defend the US Air Force input to the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE)
process, for this reason correct and timely reporting is critical. Errors in reporting can cause the
Air Force to lose needed funding, manpower authorizations, and supplies.
1.3. Offices of Responsibility. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for this instruction is
AF/A4LM, 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1030. Offices of collateral
responsibility (OCRs) are:

 AEROSPACE VEHICLES INCLUDING (AIRCRAFT, AERIAL TARGETS/DRONES
    (FULL OR SUB-SCALE), AND REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (RPA))
          INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 2A—Reporting System Overview

2.1. Concepts.
   2.1.1. Each aerospace vehicle is always possessed by a designated Air Force reporting
   organization at either the organizational or depot level. The possessing organization or depot
   will report:
      2.1.1.1. The hours it possesses the aerospace vehicle.
      2.1.1.2. Changes in aerospace vehicle possession.
      2.1.1.3. Status conditions that affect an aerospace vehicle's ability to perform assigned
      missions.
      2.1.1.4. Flying hours and sorties.
   2.1.2. If a contractor controls or maintains an aerospace vehicle that needs inventory, status,
   and utilization reporting, the administrative contracting officer will submit the needed reports
   or information to the agency that asks for them, unless the applicable contract states
   otherwise. Use these reports whenever it is in the best interest of the Government.
   2.1.3. The Weapon System Program Manager is responsible for ensuring CFO data elements
   (full cost and useful life) are properly reported in Reliability and Maintainability Information
   System (REMIS) in a timely fashion. The PM shall update REMIS with missing/inaccurate
   CFO reporting data elements as identified by the Aerospace Vehicle Distribution Officer
   (AVDO), as inventory items are added, removed, or adjusted as a result of modifications.
      2.1.3.1. For aircraft and RPA assets, enter the CFO reporting data elements (full cost and
      useful life) value of each asset (including the value of the GFM) IAW AFI 63-101 not
      more than 5 workdays after the AF-AVDO notifies the PM that the asset record was
      established in REMIS.
      2.1.3.2. For full-scale aerial target and sub-scale drone assets, enter the CFO reporting
      data element (full cost) value of each asset (including the value of the GFM) IAW AFI
      63-101 not more than 5 workdays after the AF-AVDO notifies the PM that the asset
      record was established in REMIS.
      2.1.3.3. For aircraft and RPA assets only, enter the CFO modification records including
      determining the value of the modification on each asset and documenting when the
      modification was completed on each asset. Capitalize only those modifications that meet
      the DoD capitalization threshold as defined in DoD Financial Management Regulation
      7000.14-R and add capability to the weapon system or extend the useful life of the
      weapon system beyond its originally planned useful life.
2.2. The Reporting System. Units process inventory, status and utilization data using an
approved Maintenance Information System (MIS). HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, Field Operating
 14                                                    AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


Agencies (FOAs), HQ AFMC, and other authorized users of the Reliability and Maintainability
Information System (REMIS) database verify accuracy of the data.
2.3. Transmitting Data. Data will be sent to the REMIS database at specified times.
2.4. Security Classification. Aerospace vehicle inventory, status, and utilization data reported
under this instruction are unclassified. Do not enter classified data into the MIS or REMIS.

       2.10.3.1. PPI code "BQ" IS NOT authorized when using an automated communication
       system (such as the AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and
       Reply Process) when the only reason for the communication with depot engineering has
       been directed by technical order or previous disposition instructions on an existing
       condition.
       2.10.3.2. "BQ" IS authorized for use when the wing has submitted a request IAW TO
       00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, or through an automated system to request depot
       assistance with an NMC condition preventing the aerospace vehicle from flying,
18                                                   AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     requesting a depot team, equipment, or funding is anticipated from MAJCOM and the
     following conditions are met:
        2.10.3.2.1. No additional field level scheduled or unscheduled NMC driver(s) are in-
        work, i.e. phase.
        2.10.3.2.2. The unit lacks capability to correct the deficiency at field level and the
        condition has been validated by Quality Assurance as a depot level repair.
     2.10.3.3. MAJCOMs shall approve the use of PPI code "BT". Use of this code should
     not exceed a total of 48 hours, however units may request additional "BT" status code
     time approval through their MAJCOM AVDO if the situation warrants.
     2.10.3.3. (AFRC) The use of purpose possession code BT is only authorized for 3
     working days preceding and 3 working days after receipt for intra-command transfers or
     scheduled PDM. Authorized periods for processing inter-command transfers is 5
     working days except for transfers to PDM. Extensions to these time limits require
     AFRC/A4OS (afrc.a4os@us.af.mil) approval. See sample Purpose Possession Identifier
     Code Change Message, Attachment 13.
     2.10.3.4. "BU" is authorized to prepare an aerospace vehicle 3 duty days prior to the start
     of depot level maintenance. "BU" is also authorized for up to 5 duty days after depot
     level maintenance for rebuilding the aerospace vehicle and completing operational
     checks. During this rebuild period, under no circumstances will parts be cannibalized
     from the aerospace vehicle while in "BU" PPI code. Prior to any cannibalization
     action(s), units will regain the aerospace vehicle in its primary PPI code.
        2.10.3.4.1. If other major field level maintenance, i.e. phase is in-work "BU" is only
        authorized for the portion of time that depot level work is actually being performed.
        2.10.3.4.2. "BU" - Repair instructions outlined in field level technical orders do not
        constitute depot level repair and use of PPI code "BU".
     2.10.3.5. "PJ" is authorized for use from the first day of crating preparation until arrival
     at new location, reassembly, and ground operational checks are completed. Upon receipt
     the aerospace vehicle may be possessed in this code no longer than 10 duty days. If an
     aerospace vehicle is not reassembled or placed in PPI code "PR" after 10 duty days, the
     aerospace vehicle will be changed back to its primary code and the current maintenance
     status will be reported (i.e. NMC).
     2.10.3.6. "PR" is authorized for attrition reserve aerospace vehicles in storage. The
     aerospace vehicle will be mission capable (FMC or PMC) prior to being placed in storage
     and maintained in an MC condition. Aerospace vehicles can move from "PJ" directly to
     "PR" provided the MC requirement was met before shipment. Units will continue to
     monitor aerospace vehicles in PPI code "PR" or "PJ" to ensure fleet health is maintained.
     If a cannibalization action that creates an NMC condition is required, the aerospace
     vehicle will be removed from PPI code "PR" and status changed to reflect the air vehicles
     current maintenance status (i.e. NMCS). Once aerospace vehicles are placed in PPI code
     "PR" or "PJ", the unit will notify the MAJCOM AVDO of the code change through
     normal AFI 21-103 message reporting channels. Aerospace vehicles in PPI code "PR" or
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                19


       "PJ" will continue to be tracked on a daily status sheet to ensure continued fleet health is
       maintained.
2.11. Criteria for Gaining or Losing Possession. Possession of an aerospace vehicle changes
when:
   2.11.1. The flight crew of the gaining organization accepts and leaves with the aerospace
   vehicle unless otherwise stated in an inter-command Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
   The time of possession change is the actual time the aerospace vehicle takes off from the
   losing organization. For aerospace vehicles moved in a "PJ" purpose identifier, the
   possession status changes at the time the Deployment and Distribution Flight (LRS) or
   Traffic Management Flight (APS) of the gaining organization accepts the aerospace vehicle.
   2.11.2. The procedures for losing possession of an aerospace vehicle depend on the type of
   asset.
       2.11.2.1. Loss of Possession Criteria for Aerospace Vehicles: The flight crew of the
       losing organization, or a neutral flight crew, delivers the aerospace vehicle. The time of
       possession changes when the engines shut down at the gaining base. NOTE: The Air
       Combat Command Air Operations Squadron (ACC/AOS) aircrew is considered a neutral
       crew if crew is not assigned to the losing or gaining unit. Because flying hour sorties and
       hours are directly tied to aerospace vehicle possession the unit that possesses the
       aerospace vehicle IAW the rules outlined above will receive flying hour/sortie credit
       unless otherwise specified in a MAJCOM approved MOA. This MOA will be
       coordinated and approved by the MAJCOM AVDO prior to the aerospace vehicle
       transfer.
   2.11.3. In the event, an aerospace vehicle is damaged or destroyed:
       2.11.3.1. The nearest base with the necessary repair or reclamation capability takes
       possession. The time of possession change is the time of landing or crash.
       2.11.3.2. Possession does not change if the parent organization does the repair,
       reclamation or termination; however the unit AVDO will initiate the proper station
       location code and possession purpose identifier changes.
   2.11.4. In the event, a transient aerospace vehicle requires maintenance lasting more than 7
   calendar days:
       2.11.4.1. The organization performing the maintenance gains possession of the aerospace
       vehicle when it is known the work cannot be completed in 7 days.
       2.11.4.2. Do not change possession if the parent organization does the maintenance. The
       unit AVDO will change the station location code and the possession purpose identifier to
       "BL".
       2.11.4.3. Do not transfer possession for AMC aircraft in-transit at bases where AMC has
       transient or enroute maintenance responsibility unless depot assistance is required.
       2.11.4.4. Do not transfer possession for KC-10 aircraft unless depot assistance is
       required.
   2.11.5. An authorized government representative accepts an aerospace vehicle from a
   contractor on behalf of the Air Force. In this situation:
 20                                                  AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       2.11.5.1. AFMC becomes the first possessing activity for the new production aerospace
       vehicle. AF-AVDO at HQ AFMC processes the gain in coordination with the respective
       System Program Office.
2.12. Criteria for Terminating Possession. Possession terminates when aerospace vehicles are
beyond economical repair, transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force
(NMUSAF) or at the time the aerospace vehicle meets the termination requirements of this
instruction and AFI 16-402. Terminate the aerospace vehicle and cease reporting if it has
permanently transferred to non-Air Force activities such as:
   2.12.1. Foreign countries, as applicable.
   2.12.2. Other DoD agencies, such as US Army or US Navy.
   2.12.3. Other Government agencies.
2.13. Criteria for Reporting Aerospace Vehicles as Deployed. When sending aerospace
vehicles for use at other locations or for specialized maintenance (other than that done by a
depot), list such movements and their possession accountability according to the criteria
contained in paragraphs 2.13.1 through 2.13.5.
   2.13.1. Satellite Operation and Detachment. An aerospace vehicle is in a satellite operation
   or detachment when it is moved to another station and the parent command unit continues to
   operate and support it. NOTE: Do not change possession accountability unless directed by
   an Operation Plan (OPLAN). The possessing command is the command to which the flying
   hours are allocated.
   2.13.2. Rotations. An aerospace vehicle is on rotation when direct responsibility for its
   operation or support changes between CONUS or overseas activities, commands, or units.
       2.13.2.1. Aerospace vehicle flying hours are allocated according to PA documents,
       MAJCOMs may not change possession accountability unless the host organization is
       within their own command.
       2.13.2.2. When the aerospace vehicle moves as a part of a total unit movement that will
       not integrate under a host control, the possessing organization stays the same or changes
       as stated in the OPLAN.
       2.13.2.3. Change in station location may be made by MAJCOM option.
       2.13.2.4. All reporting is done according to the OPLAN.
       2.13.2.5. MAJCOMs will include the time of transfer in the OPLAN describing the
       movement.
   2.13.3. Supporting Exercises.
       2.13.3.1. The OPLAN will state possession accountability for aerospace vehicles moved
       to support intra-command, inter-command, or inter-service missions.
       2.13.3.2. If the PA document uniquely allocates the flying hours or utilization for the
       aerospace vehicle, the command to which the flying hours are allocated is always the
       possessing command.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                           21


   2.13.4. Consolidated or Centralized Repair Activities. When an aerospace vehicle is moved
   for corrosion control, refurbishment, or other maintenance, normal reporting procedures
   apply unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM AVDO or Lead Command approved
   MOA.
   2.13.5. Loaned Aerospace Vehicles. Possession changes to the command and unit having
   direct responsibility for using and supporting the aerospace vehicle. The MAJCOM
   AVDO(s) or operational order directs the change.
2.14. Possession Reporting Criteria for Depot Teams. If an aerospace vehicle goes in for
maintenance by contract or depot field teams, transfer possession according to these criteria:
   2.14.1. For field teams (depot or contract) performing maintenance or modifications, the
   owning unit AVDO reports possession changes for both the owning and depot units.
   2.14.1. (AFRC) When aerospace vehicles are in HQ AFMC MTC command code
   possession, units ensure possession loss is processed in MIS and both gain & loss messages
   are sent.
       2.14.1.1. Transfer possession to AFMC in purpose identifier "DJ" when the operating
       command receives formal AFMC acknowledgment of repair responsibility per TO 00-25-
       107, but before the team starts the repair.
       2.14.1.2. Change possession to purpose identifier "DM" when the depot field team
       begins maintenance, repair, or modification on the aerospace vehicle.
       2.14.1.3. Change the aerospace vehicle possession purpose identifier to "DR" only if an
       AFMC aircrew will perform a Functional Check Flight (FCF).
       2.14.1.4. Possession returns to the proper organization if:
          2.14.1.4.1. The aerospace vehicle has received all assigned work and the required
          operational check or FCF (if part of the workload agreement) is accomplished.
          2.14.1.4.2. The host or operating organization receives, accepts, and controls the
          aerospace vehicle.
          2.14.1.4.3. The host or operating organization accomplishes a permanent inventory
          loss transaction ("TP").
   2.14.2. Other Field Teams. If an aerospace vehicle receives depot field team maintenance,
   other than stated above, the command with control responsibilities over the team doing the
   work possesses the aerospace vehicle.
       2.14.2.1. Specific responsibilities will be stated in the workload agreement.
       2.14.2.2. The host unit will do the required inventory reporting.
2.15. Notifying MAJCOMs of Possession Changes. Accurate reporting of possession changes
is essential in order for the Air Force to accurately account for the location and use of the
aerospace vehicle inventory. MAJCOMs determine procedures for reporting changes of
possession within the command. Possession change messages are required on aerospace vehicle
transfers between commands. For aerospace vehicle transfers, both reporting organizations will
use the same Zulu time and date.
 22                                                  AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


2.15. (AFRC)Notifying MAJCOMs of Possession Changes. AFRC units will include
respective NAF/A4M in all possession change messages.
2.16. Gain Message, Aerospace Equipment Possession Change Report. The unit or depot
AVDO of the organization gaining the aerospace vehicle sends a priority gain E-mail message
not later than the first workday after the possession changes. See Attachment 10 for a sample
gain message and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated emergency status code
(ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data
requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival on published
due dates.
2.17. Loss Message Aerospace Equipment Possession Change Report. The unit or depot
AVDO of the organization losing possession of an aerospace vehicle sends a priority loss E-mail
message not later than the first workday after the possession change takes place. On new
production aerospace vehicles where engines are tracked as outlined in TO 00-25-254-1 series
publications, the Air Force program office will include engine serial numbers on the loss
message. See Attachment 11 for a sample loss message and instructions for preparing it. This
report is designated emergency status code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency
conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed
or by any means to ensure arrival on published due dates.
2.18. Termination Message, Aerospace Equipment Termination Report. The unit or depot
AVDO of the organization losing accountability of an aerospace vehicle will send a priority
termination E-mail message not later than the first workday after it has been decided the
aerospace vehicle should be terminated. See Attachment 12 for a sample termination message
and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated emergency status code (ESC) C-1.
Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements
assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival on published due dates.
NOTE: If a losing organization has removed the engine(s) from an aerospace vehicle prior to
the aerospace vehicle being terminated then the aerospace vehicle termination message will state
at item 11 that no engine(s) were installed on the aerospace vehicle. For aerospace vehicles
being terminated by Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG), engine serial
numbers do not need to be listed on the termination message. The AMARG Engine Manager
will continue to report all engines according to TO 00-25-254-1/-2, Comprehensive Engine
Management System.
2.19. Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Message, Aerospace Equipment
Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Report. When changing a possession purpose
identifier, the possessing unit or depot AVDO will send a priority message, via an E-mail, not
later than the first workday after the change. See Attachment 13 for a sample possession
purpose identifier change message and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated
emergency status code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority
precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to
ensure arrival on published due dates.
2.20. Mission, Design, and Series (MDS)/Configuration Identifier Change Message,
Aerospace Equipment MDS/Configuration Identifier Change Report. The AVDO of the
organization changing the MDS or configuration identifier will send a MDS/configuration
identifier change E-mail message. Obtain proper authorization from the MAJCOM AVDO
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               23


before making the change, and send a priority message not later than the first workday after the
change. See Attachment 14 for a sample MDS/Configuration identifier change message and
instructions for preparing it. This report is designated emergency status code (ESC) C-1.
Continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal precedence. Submit data requirements
in this category as prescribed, or as soon as possible after submission of priority reports.
2.21. How To Determine Codes. Attachment 4 lists the references used in inventory reporting
under this instruction.

Section 2D—Aerospace Vehicle Logistics Status Reporting

2.22. Reporting Maintenance Status. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt
from licensing in accordance with paragraph 2.11.3. of AFI 33-324, The Information Collections
and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force
Information Collections.
   2.22.1. Use multiple status reporting to the maximum extent the MIS allows. Multiple status
   means an aerospace vehicle can be broken out for more than one condition at the same time.
   2.22.2. To determine the possession purpose identifier codes to use for calculating status
   metrics refer to TO 00-20-2.
   2.22.3. Status reporting for permanently assigned Ground Instructional Trainer Aircraft
   (GITA), Training Aid Aircraft (TAA) or RPA is not required.
2.23. Determining Maintenance Status.
   2.23.1. Attachment 2 gives a list of maintenance and condition status codes and their
   definitions, which are based on DoD Instruction 3110.05, Materiel Condition Reporting for
   Mission-Essential Systems and Equipment. These codes describe the capability of an
   aerospace vehicle to do its assigned missions, that is, a unit's specifically assigned wartime,
   training, or test missions as specified in:
       2.23.1.1. The unit's Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements.
       2.23.1.2. Unit training syllabuses.
       2.23.1.3. Test mission requirements.
       2.23.1.4. Minimum Essential Subsystems List (MESL).
   2.23.2. Report any aerospace vehicle not Full Mission Capable (FMC) with a maintenance
   status code determined by the following criteria:
       2.23.2.1. Report an aerospace vehicle that can perform at least one, but not all of its
       assigned missions as Partial Mission Capable (PMC). Report an aerospace vehicle that
       cannot perform any of its assigned missions as Non Mission Capable (NMC).
       2.23.2.2. Add the letter M (maintenance), S (supply), or B (both maintenance and
       supply) to show the reason the aerospace vehicle is PMC or NMC.
       2.23.2.3. Aerospace vehicles in status codes NMCM and NMCB also show if the needed
       maintenance is scheduled (S) or unscheduled (U).
24                                                     AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


         2.23.2.3.1. (Added-AFRC) -(MAF ONLY); F = facilities (hangar, broken doors,
         inop fire suppression, etc), I = Impounded, W = Weather, Q = Quiet Hours MX on
         hold for, T = TCTO's in work, P = Personnel lack of J - 2A6X1 (JETS), E - 2A6X6
         (E&E), I - 2A5X3 (AVIONICS), A - 2A5X1 (APG/CREW CHIEF), H - 2A6X5
         (HYD), M - 2A7X1/2/3 (METALS TECH/NDI/SHEET METAL), F - 2A6X4
         (FUELS), E = Education/Training, SE = Age/Support Equipment (Hydraulic Test
         Stand, Power Unit, etc), TE = Test Equipment (TTU-205, Fuel Quantity Tester, etc).
         Work stoppage codes will be updated in G081 using screen 9146.
     2.23.2.4. The dual status condition--Non Mission Capable Both (NMCB) or Partial
     Mission Capable Both (PMCB)--starts when an aerospace vehicle requires both
     maintenance and supplies.
     2.23.2.5. Change an existing maintenance or supply condition to the dual condition if
     discovering a second problem. For example, when an aerospace vehicle is in NMCM
     maintenance status code and a problem requiring a supply part is found (NMCS), change
     the reported status to NMCB.
     2.23.2.6. Change the dual condition when either the maintenance or the supply problem
     has been rectified. For example, if the maintenance problem is corrected before the
     supply problem, change the NMCB status code to NMCS (or vice versa from NMCB to
     NMCM when the part becomes available but maintenance is not).
     2.23.2.7. Work Unit Codes (WUC)/Logistics Control Numbers (LCN)(F-22 and F-35).
     WUCs/LCNs are an important part of the MIS status reporting. WUCs/LCNs determine
     subsystem problems and repair actions associated with a piece of equipment or a system.
     A proper WUC/LCN is required to be entered into the MIS status reporting when an
     equipment problem is discovered or repaired. If a specific WUC/LCN is not known
     initially due to troubleshooting, then a system or subsystem WUC/LCN may be used until
     the faulty component is identified. When the equipment is returned to service or when
     parts are placed on order, it is the expeditor's responsibility to provide MOC with the
     proper WUC/LCN to be used for the PMC or NMC status reporting period. The use of
     __000 and or __00 will not be used when a more specific WUC is available.
  2.23.3. Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance status stops when maintenance is completed
  according to applicable technical data using the following criteria:
     2.23.3.1. When all ground operational checks or cure checks are complete.
     2.23.3.2. If in-flight operational checks or ground checks on vertical lift aircraft which
     cannot be performed by maintenance personnel are required by technical data,
     maintenance status will stop when all actions leading up to the operational check are
     completed.
     2.23.3.3. When lack of parts which limits the mission is verified.
     2.23.3.4. If a Functional Check Flight (FCF) is required IAW TO 1-1-300, -6 FCF
     requirements, or any other applicable technical data, maintenance status will not stop
     until the FCF is completed.
  2.23.4. Supply status starts after all of these actions occur:
     2.23.4.1. The aerospace vehicle requires an essential part.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                25


     2.23.4.2. A valid demand on supply and/or depot is made. NOTE: When the Engine
     Manager makes a demand on depot for a supported replacement engine to fill an
     aerospace vehicle hole for which no serviceable or repairable asset is available at the unit.
     2.23.4.3. Maintenance verifies the part is essential.
     2.23.4.4. Maintenance and supply together verify that the needed part (serviceable or
     repairable and not awaiting parts) is not available on base (does not apply to Contract
     Logistics Support (CLS) or Contract Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS)
     provided parts).
  2.23.5. Supply time stops when maintenance receives the part(s). If maintenance cannot
  accept the part(s) when available, supply status time stops at the time supply attempts to
  deliver the part(s). NOTE: Supply time will continue if a part is received from LRS supply
  activities, but will be sent off-base to a contractor facility/depot for additional
  adjustments/configuring/programming/drilling, etc. In this instance, the supply time will
  stop when the part is returned to maintenance from off base.
  2.23.6. When an aerospace vehicle discrepancy is identified during flight, maintenance
  status starts at the time the aerospace vehicle returns to its parking spot/engine shutdown.
  2.23.7. When an aerospace vehicle discrepancy is identified during ground operation,
  maintenance status starts at the time the discrepancy was found.
     2.23.7.1. It is imperative that aerospace vehicle status accurately reflects the capability of
     the aerospace vehicle to perform its assigned missions. While the majority of red X
     discrepancies require an aerospace vehicle to be reported in a non mission capable
     condition, some red X entries do not. These entries do not necessarily affect the status or
     the mission capability of the aerospace vehicle and do not require a maintenance repair
     action. Examples of red X entries that do not affect the status and mission capability are:
         2.23.7.1.1. External tanks/pylons ejector cartridges removed.
         2.23.7.1.2. Openings/panels taped/covered prior to and during a wash.
         2.23.7.1.3. Protective covers installed.
         2.23.7.1.4. Ejection seats de-armed for static display/training.
         2.23.7.1.5. Reconfiguration/installation/removal of Primary Mission Equipment
         (PME). This is not intended to be an all encompassing list as there may be other red
         X entries that fall into this category. NOTE: Impounded aircraft/equipment are not
         considered mission capable.
  2.23.8. When maintenance places an MC aerospace vehicle into scheduled maintenance on
  the printed flying schedule/maintenance plan, the status changes only if it is determined that
  maintenance cannot, and will not return the aerospace vehicle to a MC status within 2 hours.
     2.23.8.1. If maintenance performs Planned Scheduled Maintenance on an otherwise MC
     aerospace vehicle and can and will return, or is scheduled to return, the aerospace vehicle
     to MC status within 2 hours, do not report the aerospace vehicle as NMC.
     2.23.8.2. Additionally, if a discrepancy is found during scheduled maintenance which
     causes the aerospace vehicle to be declared NMC, and maintenance will need more than
 26                                                   AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


      2 hours to return the aerospace vehicle to MC status, NMC status starts when the
      discrepancy is found.
   2.23.9. Aerospace vehicles entering phase, periodic, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program
   (ASIP), or isochronal inspections will be coded NMC using the support general work unit
   code (WUC) for the look phase portion of the inspection. The NMC time using the support
   general WUC will start when the work cards are initiated and continue through the look
   phase portion of the inspection. Normal NMC driver WUC reporting applies after the look
   phase portion of the inspection is complete.
   2.23.10. Management uses certain groupings of status codes to perform summaries,
   analyses, briefings, and so on. These groupings show total supply and maintenance
   limitations. A complete list of these groupings is in Attachment 2.
2.24. Pacing Items.
   2.24.1. Units will report the WUC for the mission limiting condition that will take the
   longest for maintenance to correct on an aerospace vehicle in PMC and NMC status. Units
   will use a minimum of the 3 digit WUC when reporting the driving NMC condition. All
   maintenance status codes are defined and associated with a condition status code as shown in
   Attachment 2. NOTE: For aerospace vehicles with systems awaiting operational check,
   units will report the status of the next highest NMC/PMC driver (if another mission limiting
   system is reported). Status reported will not be below that of system requiring operational
   check. When all mission limiting conditions are corrected, the unit will then report the
   system requiring operational check as the system driver.
   2.24.2. When accomplishing single/multiple status reporting, use the following order of
   precedence, from most severe to least severe:
Non-Airworthy: NMCB(B), NMCB(A), NMCS(E), NMCM(D), NMCM(C).
Airworthy: NMCB(L), NMCB(K), NMCS(P), NMCM(M), NMCM(N), PMCB(F), PMCS(H),
PMCM(G), FMC.
2.25. Minimum Essential Subsystems List (MESL).
   2.25.1. MESLs lay the groundwork for reporting the status of aerospace vehicle capability.
   MESLs list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that must function on an
   aerospace vehicle for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or other
   missions. The MESL brings together the Full Systems List (FSL) and the Basic Systems List
   (BSL).
   2.25.1. (AFRC) AFRC units will use the Minimum Essential Subsystems Listing (MESL)
   developed by the lead command for the weapons system. AFRC units operating/maintaining
   the WC-130H will use the C-130E-H MESL located on the AMC web site
   (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4m/hello.html).
   Recommended changes to a lead command MESL will be forwarded to HQ AFRC/A4M
   (afrc.lgm@us.af.mil) and A4OS (afrc.a4os@us.af.mil) for inter-MAJCOM coordination.
      2.25.1.1. The BSL lists a unit's specifically assigned wartime, training, and test missions
      and the systems and subsystems that must function for a unit to accomplish those
      missions.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              27


       2.25.1.2. The FSL lists all systems and subsystems needed for Full Mission Performance.
       It lists the essential systems and subsystems that must function to do all BSL missions
       (specifically assigned unit wartime, training, or test missions), and other kinds of unit
       sorties such as Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) delivery flights, aerospace
       vehicle transfer flights, cross country flights, or other training sorties units fly.
   2.25.2. The MESL allows for comparison of aerospace vehicle systems, subsystems, and
   components, by WUC, against the FSL and BSL across the page. In each column, mark the
   equipment that must function with an "X".
   2.25.3. A system may have an "X" in the FSL column only or in the FSL column and any or
   all of the BSL columns.
       2.25.3.1. If there is an "X" in the FSL column only, the equipment does not have any
       specifically assigned unit wartime, training, or test mission. The equipment may have
       other kinds of unit sorties or missions to fly such as those listed in paragraph 2.25.1.2.
       2.25.3.2. If there is an "X" in the FSL column and any or all of the BSL columns, the
       equipment must be operational for the mission identified by the column heading.
       2.25.3.3. If any system or subsystem with an "X" in the FSL column only is not
       functioning, put the aerospace vehicle in maintenance status code PMC.
   2.25.4. If any system or subsystem with an "X" in the FSL and all BSL columns is not
   functioning, the aerospace vehicle cannot do any mission and is status code NMC. If any
   BSL column does not have an "X" for the inoperative system, the status code is PMC.
   2.25.5. Determine the adverse impact of non-functioning components within listed systems
   or subsystems on a case by case basis. Components may appear on a MESL if the
   component is the only part of the subsystem that must be operational.
   2.25.6. For degraded system performance evaluations, decide whether the overall system or
   subsystem can still support applicable mission requirements.
   2.25.7. Units with aerospace vehicles not equipped, and/or not programmed to be equipped,
   with a listed system or subsystem should not report status on that equipment, unless the
   MESL states otherwise.
2.26. Developing the MESL. MESLs will be developed in accordance with AFPD 10-9. Lead
Command’s will ensure MESLs list only the minimum essential aerospace vehicle systems or
subsystems that must function in order for a unit to accomplish its mission. A sample MESL is
shown in Figure 2.1.
   2.26.1. Units can fly missions and sorties other than specifically assigned wartime, training,
   or test missions. Since the FSL is an all inclusive list, build it to include all systems and
   subsystems on any or all BSLs and those required for sorties and missions not specifically
   assigned to that unit by the DOC, aircrew training, or flight test taskings.
   2.26.2. The MESL does not portray the role these "other" type missions and sorties may
   play. The aerospace vehicle status will be PMC if an inoperative system or subsystem is on
   the FSL only because of the limitation to full mission performance.
   2.26.3. MESL BSL columns show standard mission codes for specific wartime, aircrew
   training, and test missions assigned to a unit. Lead Command’s may build and use additional
 28                                                 AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


      unique mission codes when needed as long as the codes are standardized. Standard MESL
      mission codes are listed in Attachment 3.
      2.26.4. HQ AFMC has sole responsibility and authority to develop and implement MESLs
      for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) missions and aerospace vehicles
      in support of RDT&E.

8. F-15B and F-15D will be external ECM pod capable.
9. Strip lighting required as a minimum.
2.27. Determining Aerospace Vehicle Maintenance Status and Capability.
   2.27.1. The MESL does not determine airworthiness or "safety-of-flight": Technical data,
   maintenance crews and aircrew judgment alone determine airworthiness. Do not use the
   MESL to gauge "go/no-go" decisions.
   2.27.2. The maintenance status NMC Airworthy (Condition status codes K, L, M, N, P) will
   be used when an aerospace vehicle cannot accomplish the units wartime, training or test
   mission, but is still Airworthy (safe for flight).
   2.27.3. A NMC Airworthy aerospace vehicle may be deployed as long as it can be returned
   to MC status (FMC or PMC) at an employment site.
   2.27.4. An aerospace vehicle is FMC if:
       2.27.4.1. All systems, subsystems, and components having an "X" in the FSL column are
       functioning (the aerospace vehicle can perform all of its assigned missions).
       2.27.4.2. A system, subsystem, or component having an "X" in the FSL column or any
       BSL column is degraded, but is still capable of full mission performance.
   2.27.5. An aerospace vehicle is PMC if:
       2.27.5.1. One or more systems, subsystems, or components are not functioning and have
       an "X" in the FSL column only (the aerospace vehicle can do all BSL missions, but is not
       fully equipped or capable of full mission performance).
       2.27.5.2. Systems, subsystems, or components that are not functioning and are not
       needed for a unit's specifically assigned wartime missions, but are needed for safe
       aerospace vehicle operation during peacetime.
       2.27.5.3. One or more systems, subsystems, or components are not functioning and have
       an "X" in the FSL column and in at least one, but not all, BSL columns (the aerospace
       vehicle can do at least one, but not all, of its BSL missions).
       2.27.5.4. A system, subsystem, or component is degraded and has an "X" in the FSL
       column and all BSL columns, but can support some of its BSL missions.
   2.27.6. An aerospace vehicle is NMC if:
 30                                                  AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       2.27.6.1. One or more systems, subsystems, or components having an "X" in the FSL
       column and all BSL columns are not functioning (the aerospace vehicle cannot do any
       BSL missions).
       2.27.6.2. The aerospace vehicle is "grounded" (not flyable).
       2.27.6.3. The aerospace vehicle cannot fly any of the unit's BSL missions. NOTE: The
       engineer at the ALC may approve the aerospace vehicle for a one-time flight to a
       maintenance facility.
   2.27.7. Use the Aerospace Vehicle Maintenance Status Code Flow Chart in Table 2.1 to
   help determine the proper aerospace vehicle maintenance and condition status codes to
   report.

Section 2E—Aerospace Vehicle Utilization Reporting NOTE: Not Applicable to RPA's, Full-
Scale Aerial Targets and Sub-Scale Drones

2.28. Flying Hour Program. Tracking and reconciling is the responsibility of the
AVUM/depot-level equivalent, with the Director of Operations/depot-level equivalent being
responsible for reporting. However, Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) debrief section/depot-
level equivalent is responsible for entering flying hours from the AFTO Form 781, ARMS
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document into the MIS. Guidance for completing the AFTO Form
781 can be found in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance, Inspection,
Documentation, Policies, and Procedures; AFI 11-401, Aviation Management; AFI 21-101,
Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management and this instruction.
   2.28.1. Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) PS&D and OG AVUM will develop and
   implement policies and procedures to validate sorties and hours flown daily. Additionally,
   Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) personnel will reconcile uncompleted sorties daily in
   the MIS. Operations Squadron (OS) monitor will validate total sorties/hours flown and total
   sorties/hours flown for the month to date. Units may use the daily sortie reconciliation aspect
   of Maintenance Scheduling Application Tool (MSAT), instead of the printed daily copies of
   the Aircraft Utilization Report (AUR). Mobility Air Force (MAF) units may use equivalent
   G081 screens.
   2.28.1. (AFRC) For the purpose of this instruction, Maintenance Operations Squadron
   (MOS) also means Maintenance Operations for AFRC units.
   2.28.2. The MOS PS&D will send a daily electronic copy of the MSAT product or the AUR
   to the AMU debrief section, and OS monitors. Debrief sections and OS monitors will
   reconcile sorties and hours flown on the AUR. If a disparity exists, the debriefer/OS monitor
   will annotate the difference on the AUR with the debriefer correcting the MIS. If an
   agreement cannot be made on the disparity, MOS PS&D will coordinate with the OG AVUM
   for appropriate action. A signed copy of the agreed upon daily AUR (signed by debrief) will
   be maintained by the OS monitor for three months. OS monitors will send the final AUR to
   the OG AVUM and AVDO upon closing out the month.
       2.28.2.1. The OG AVUM and AVDO will compare the flying hours in the MIS (REMIS
       or GCSS Air Force Data Services) with flying hours in the MAJCOM sanctioned flying
       hour program database monthly to ensure the data in the MIS represents hours flown.
 32                                                    AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       MIS flying hour data is the official reporting source, completeness and accuracy of flying
       hours is a joint endeavor.
   2.28.3. The OG AVUM will submit a monthly flying hour report to the MAJCOM for the
   previous month's flying hours. The monthly flying hour report is due to the MAJCOM
   AVUM NLT the 5th calendar day of each month.
       2.28.3.1. The monthly flying hour report will only include those hours that were reported
       and reconciled in the MIS as 2400 on the 4th calendar day of the following month. Any
       hours or changes reported after that will be included as late time in the following months
       report.
       2.28.3.2. The AVUM and AVDO will compare the flying hours in the MIS (REMIS or
       GCSS Air Force Data Services) with flying hours in the MAJCOM sanctioned flying
       hour program database monthly to ensure the data in the MIS accurately represents the
       hours flown.
   2.28.4. The AVUM will submit a monthly flying hour report to the MAJCOM for the
   previous month's flying hours. The monthly flying hour report is due to the MAJCOM
   AVUM NLT the 5th calendar day of each month.
       2.28.4.1. The monthly flying hour report will only include those hours that were reported
       and reconciled in the MIS as of 2400 on the 4th calendar day of the following month.
       Any hours or changes reported after that will be included as late time in the following
       month's report.
2.29. Aerospace Vehicle Utilization Reporting Concept. Report unit or depot flying hours
and sorties by Program Element Code (PEC) and mission symbol for each possessed aerospace
vehicle. This data helps determine future inspection and modification requirements including the
Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) and Reliability and Maintainability programs. MIS
data will be input no later than midnight on the fourth calendar day of the following month. Any
flying time reported after the fourth calendar day will be reported in the next month's data in the
MIS. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance with
AFI 33-324.
   2.29.1. Each MAJCOM's utilization data automatically updates REMIS. If the possessing
   unit is not in the command allocated the hours to be flown, the MAJCOM AVDO will credit
   the hours to the assigned command by using the "L" (loan) indicator in REMIS.
       2.29.1.1. The utilization monitor in the MAJCOM will credit the hours to the assigned
       unit.
   2.29.2. The reporting period is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The first day of the
   new GMT month, the flying hours are reported for the new month.
       2.29.2.1. If the base or MAJCOM is reporting flying hours on aerospace vehicles at
       locations other than where the aerospace vehicles are possessed, the base or MAJCOM
       will direct how hours will be forwarded to the MIS reporting location. The base or
       MAJCOM may use interim reporting means such as phone, fax, or message via E-mail.
       Avoid duplicate reporting when the aerospace vehicle returns to its possessed location
       and process the original AFTO Form 781.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              33


          2.29.2.1.1. The utilization monitor in the MAJCOM will provide instructions on how
          to get the hours to the possessed location.
       2.29.2.2. When an AFMC contractor or depot field team possesses an aerospace vehicle
       and an AFMC aircrew will fly the FCF, the reporting base submits utilization data using:
          2.29.2.2.1. A "DR" possession purpose identifier.
          2.29.2.2.2. PEC 0708211F.
          2.29.2.2.3. Program Element Identification (PEID) "I" (INDIA).
          2.29.2.2.4. Command code "MTC" for the field team.
          2.29.2.2.5. Field Team organization.
   2.29.3. In aerospace vehicle movements such as rotations and deployments, the MAJCOM
   AVDO should consider ease of reporting and flying hour accountability in deciding whether
   to transfer possession to the operating location.
       2.29.3.1. If the movement involves more than one MAJCOM, MAJCOM AVDO(s) will
       agree on the inventory reporting changes to make sure utilization is reported to the
       desired MAJCOM. MAJCOM AVDO(s) will issue inventory reporting instructions
       before aerospace vehicle movement unless the movement is urgent.
          2.29.3.1.1. The MAJCOM utilization monitor will make this determination and
          coordinate with the MAJCOM AVDO.
2.30. What to Report. Utilization reporting is required for all aerospace vehicles except those
in possession purpose codes "XU", "XY", and "NY".
2.31. Multiple Utilization Reporting. This capability is only currently available in the REMIS
and G081 MIS.
   2.31.1. Multiple utilization reporting allows sorties to be divided in segments or legs. A leg
   is a portion of a sortie that may have a different mission number or PEC / Utilization Purpose
   Code (UPC) / Type Utilization Code combination.
   2.31.2. Time overlaps or gaps between sortie legs are not allowed and all flying time will be
   entered in Zulu time.
   2.31.3. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code may be used to designate
   from/to locations on each sortie leg. ICAO codes will be edited against the ICAO code table.

Section 2F—Accountability, Termination, and Delivery Procedures

2.32. Aerospace Vehicle Accountability.
   2.32.1. AF-AVDO maintains accountability on AFMC Form 1026, Aircraft Accountability
   Record, for all Air Force aerospace vehicles. The AF-AVDO assigns voucher numbers for
   terminated aerospace vehicles and records them on AF Form 3131, General Purpose (used as
   a manual register of all assigned voucher numbers).
   2.32.2. Accountability begins when Wide Area Workflow Receiving Report (WAWF RR) or
   DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is signed.
 34                                                  AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   2.32.3. Account for aerospace vehicles as long as assets are assigned to a US Air Force, Air
   National Guard, or US Air Force Reserve activity. Accountability ends on receipt of a
   termination message and/or DD Form 1149, AFTO Form 290, Aerospace Vehicle Delivery
   Receipt, DD Form 250 or WAWF RR with termination transactions input to the appropriate
   MIS.
   2.32.4. AF-AVDO will maintain an electronic continuity book.
2.33. Final Termination Accountability.
   2.33.1. The possessing unit AVDO initiates termination of accountability with a termination
   message and inputs the termination into the appropriate MIS if:
      2.33.1.1. Loss or disposition is due to crash damage or major maintenance beyond
      economical repair.
      2.33.1.2. For aerospace vehicles to be reclaimed, terminate upon receipt of save list.
      2.33.1.3. All excess aerospace vehicles are considered for reclamation. Excess
      serviceable or economically repairable aerospace vehicles are screened IAW AFI 16-402
      and DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, August 1997. AF/A8PB
      will issue disposition instructions using an AF Form 913 prior to execution of a
      reclamation. Save lists are part of a reclamation and will be completed IAW AFMAN
      23-110, USAF Supply Manual or waived by HQ AFMC.
   2.33.2. For crash damaged aerospace vehicles, the possessing unit AVDO initiates and sends
   a termination message without waiting for mishap investigation board findings after the
   Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC), or equivalent, with System Program Manager
   (SPM) coordination determines the aerospace vehicle is completely beyond repair. If the
   decision is beyond the MXG/CC's capability, refer to the System Program Manager for
   engineering determination. The unit AVDO terminates possession upon receipt of
   determination via message. The possessing unit AVDO terminates possession, citing the
   MXG/CC's decision with SPM coordination or the SPM's engineering determination message
   and reports using Aerospace Equipment Termination Report, along with MIS input. NOTE:
   Prior to terminating an aerospace vehicle from the MIS, archive all records.
      2.33.2.1. Report abandoned aerospace vehicle wreckage to the nearest Defense Property
      Disposal Office for sale or formal abandonment.
      2.33.2.2. Crashed aerospace vehicles considered for termination will be placed in
      possession code "XW" until the MXG/CC, equivalent, or SPM determines the
      appropriate termination code.
   2.33.3. The unit AVDO sends a copy of the termination message to the unit engine manager
   with responsibility for the engines. This message gives the engine manager the authority to
   dispose of the engines according to the applicable AFI.
      2.33.3.1. After the engine manager has disposed of or terminated the engines, the unit
      AVDO terminates the aerospace vehicle using the applicable termination code.
   2.33.4. HQ USAF may authorize the termination of aerospace vehicles that cannot be
   terminated using standard procedures. In such cases, the possessing unit processes the
   termination citing the HQ USAF notification as authority.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               35


   2.33.5. Disposition of aerospace vehicle historical records. After release of an aerospace
   vehicle's historical records by the accident investigating board and/or termination from the
   Air Force Inventory, retain the records for three months, then destroy IAW the AF Records
   Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS, https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims, Table
   21-6, Rule 3.
2.34. Delivering Aerospace Vehicles to Agencies Outside the Air Force.
   2.34.1. Start these assignments according to AFI 16-402. Fill out DD Form 1149, as shown
   in Attachment 9 or AFTO Form 290.
   2.34.2. Have the recipient sign the completed DD Form 1149 as soon as the aerospace

     2.35.3.8. Numbers Placed on Aerospace Vehicle or Missile by Releasing Organization,
     column B (the numbers of listed items placed on each aerospace vehicle). NOTE: List
     all Confidential, Secret, and/or Nuclear Weapon Related Materiel (NWRM) equipment
     installed on the aerospace vehicle in the space provided. Enter "none" in the "classified
     material installed on aircraft" block of the AFTO Form 290 if the aerospace vehicle has
     no classified material/NWRM installed.
     2.35.3.9. The authorized representative at the delivering organization will accept the
     aerospace vehicle from delivery and will accept responsibility for the paperwork and
     equipment listed in column B of the check-list by signing the delivery receipt in the space
     provided. The representative will check each item received in column C. When the
     check is complete, the representative will initial at the bottom of the column.
     2.35.3.10. The delivery organization will not accept the aerospace vehicle until the items
     listed in column B match those on the aerospace vehicle.
     2.35.3.11. If the authorized representative of the delivering organization is the pilot or
     transporter, fill out the AFTO Form 290 just before the aerospace vehicle actually
     departs.
     2.35.3.12. Delivery control or transportation officers at the factory or modification center
     will check the items listed and sign AFTO Form 290.
  2.35.4. At the factory or modification center, the delivery control or transportation officer
  may not have guards to keep close watch over received aerospace vehicle. Instead, a
  contractor, or other agency will provide these services.
     2.35.4.1. In these cases, the delivery control transportation office is not responsible for
     items listed on AFTO Form 290.
     2.35.4.2. The delivery pilot or transporter of the delivery control or transportation officer
     will personally check all items and promptly sign a receipt for them on AFTO Form 290
     in the "Transportation/Ferrying Organization Receipt" section before the aerospace
     vehicle departs.
  2.35.5. AFTO Form 290 provides space in columns D through I for up to three intermediate
  stops. Use this space when the pilot or transporter is not staying with the aerospace vehicle
  and does not want to be responsible for the items on the checklist.
     2.35.5.1. If the aerospace vehicle makes more than three intermediate stops, the pilot or
     transporter will use an additional set of forms and attach them to the first form.
     2.35.5.2. At these intermediate activities, the commander authorized representative will
     take responsibility for the items after check-in.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                37


      2.35.5.3. The authorized activity representative and the pilot or transporter will check the
      items immediately after the aerospace vehicle arrives.
      2.35.5.4. If all items in column B match those on the aerospace vehicle, the activity
      representative will check the first open intermediate activity check-in column and initial
      the bottom of the column.
      2.35.5.5. If an item is missing, the representative will enter the correct figure in the
      check-in column. The pilot or transporter will initial the corrected figure and explain any
      discrepancies in the remarks section of the form. After all items are checked, the activity
      commander is responsible for the equipment and papers.
      2.35.5.6. The pilot or transporter will check the items in the checklist before the
      aerospace vehicle leaves. The pilot or transporter will check the proper intermediate
      activity check-out column and initial the bottom of the check-out column. The activity
      representative will also initial the column. The activity representative will explain any
      discrepancies in the remarks section of the form, giving his or her grade and signature.
   2.35.6. When the aerospace vehicle arrives, if the items in column B match those on the
   aerospace vehicle, the authorized representative of the recipient organization checks column

      2.35.7.5. Copy 5 -- Defense Plant Representative Office (DPRO) where the contractor
      facility is located, marked for the property administrator (if aerospace vehicles are
      delivered to the contractor facility).
   2.35.8. The commands should coordinate with each other to reduce the number of copies
   needed.

Section 2G—Valuation of Aerospace Assets

2.36. Aircraft, Full-Scale Aerial Targets, Sub-Scale Drones and RPA Asset Values.
   2.36.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing the CFO
   reporting data elements (full cost and useful life) in REMIS for each delivered aircraft and
   RPA asset. Full-scale aerial target and sub-scale drone assets will provide (full cost) data
   only.
 38                                                    AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


      2.36.1.1. The value must include all installed subcomponents purchased on a separate
      contract and all GFM.
      2.36.1.2. The PM records both full cost and useful life data for aircraft and RPA assets
      and full cost data only for full-scale aerial targets or sub-scale drones in REMIS not more
      than 5 workdays after the AF-AVDO notifies the PM that the asset record has been
      established in REMIS.
      2.36.1.3. Since the full-scale drone costs are determined in phases, the Weapon System
      Program Manager will enter the initial cost (fly away cost from AMARG) and then
      update the cost as the other costs are reported to that office. AMARG and any other
      organic or commercial organization involved in creating the drones must provide this
      information to the Weapon System Program Manager in a timely manner.
   2.36.2. A copy of the documentation supporting the CFO reporting data elements (full cost
   and useful life) should be maintained in the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of
   the weapon system plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the
   program office must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site
   (other than the location of the Weapon System Program Managers).
2.37. Aircraft and RPA Asset Modification Value.
   2.37.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing CFO
   modification records including determining the value of the modification on each asset and
   documenting when the modification was completed on each asset.
      2.37.1.1. This CFO requirement applies to aircraft and RPA assets only. The full-scale
      aerial targets and sub-scale drones do not have to record modifications for CFO reporting.
      2.37.1.2. Capitalize only those modifications that meet the DoD capitalization threshold
      as defined in DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R and add capability to the
      weapon system or extend the useful life of the weapon system beyond its originally
      planned useful life.
      2.37.1.3. Establish the applicable modification records with the modification cost once
      the contract is awarded or when the contract price is known and add the completion date
      once the modification is completed on each asset.
      2.37.1.4. The modification records should be established in REMIS not more than 5
      workdays after the qualified modification contract was awarded or when the contract
      price is known. In addition, the modification completion date should be entered in
      REMIS not more than 5 workdays after the modification was completed on the specific
      asset.
   2.37.2. A copy of the documentation supporting the modification information should be
   maintained by the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of the weapon system plus
   5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the program office must ensure
   that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site (other than the location of the
   Weapon System Program Managers).

                 INVENTORY AND STATUS REPORTING OF MISSILES

Section 3A—Reporting System Overview

3.1. Concepts.
   3.1.1. Each aerospace vehicle is always possessed by a designated Air Force reporting
   organization at either the organizational or depot level. The possessing organization or depot
   will report:
       3.1.1.1. The hours it possesses the aerospace vehicle.
       3.1.1.2. Changes in aerospace vehicle possession.
       3.1.1.3. Status conditions that affect an aerospace vehicle's ability to perform assigned
       missions.
   3.1.2. If a contractor controls or maintains uninstalled Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
   (ICBM) missile motors, assembled ICBM downstages, or Propulsion System Rocket Engines
   (PSRE) that requires inventory, status, and utilization reporting, the contractor must submit
   the needed reports or information to the agency that requests them, unless the applicable
   contract states otherwise. Use these reports whenever it is in the best interest of the
   Government.
3.2. Security Classification. Missile inventory, status, and utilization data reported under this
instruction is unclassified. Do not enter classified data into the MIS, Integrated Missile Database
(IMDB) or REMIS.

Section 3B—Reporting Responsibilities

3.3. Base and Depot Level Activities. Reporting starts at base or depot-level.
   3.3.1. Group Commanders or depot maintenance directorate responsibilities:
       3.3.1.1. Ensure personnel maintain, correct, and report all data using the procedures in
       AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting,
       and Termination and this instruction.
       3.3.1.2. Appoint a primary and alternate AVDO to report inventory status for the unit or
       depot. Via E-mail message, provide the MAJCOM AVDO the name, grade, duty phone,
       E-mail address, and office symbol of the primary and alternate AVDO annually at the
       beginning of each fiscal year and as changes in personnel occur.
   3.3.2. Unit and Depot AVDO appointees:
       3.3.2.1. Perform duties as the primary POCs for ICBM inventory and status reporting
       within their organization.

      3.3.2.4. Ensure equipment loads to MIS for aerospace vehicles contain correct current
      operating time prior to performing gain transactions.
      3.3.2.5. Initiate inventory transactions and movement reports as required.
      3.3.2.6. Send messages as required by this instruction and MAJCOM supplements.
          3.3.2.6.1. E-mails are the standard format to transmit messages. Unclassified
          messages will be sent through official NIPR E-mail and are required to be digitally
          signed and encrypted using the Common Access Card Public Key Infrastructure.
          Classified messages will be sent through official SIPR E-mail.
      3.3.2.7. Follow procedures in AFI 16-402.
      3.3.2.8. Ensure DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, is
      completed and sent as required (See Attachment 9).
      3.3.2.9. Distribute assigned ICBMs as required.
      3.3.2.10. Prior to processing MIS data and sending gain/loss messages, verify inventory
      transaction dates and times (Zulu) with corresponding units, depots or contractors to
      ensure they match.

Section 3C—Reporting ICBMs

3.4. Types of Reporting.
   3.4.1. Physical Accountability and Valuation. Air Force reports accountability of the ICBM
   All Up Round (AUR) as military equipment through the MIS and REMIS. Air Force reports
   accountability of the uninstalled ICBM missile motors, the assembled ICBM downstages and
   the Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE) as operating material and supplies (OM&S)
   through the Integrated Missile Database (IMDB). While the MIS, IMDB and REMIS
   maintain information on all aspects of the ICBM inventory, it is critical that the ICBM
   System Program Office (SPO) communicate ownership and location to the Transportation
   Management Specialist/AVDO to update IMDB and the MIS and provide
   Gain/Loss/Possession messages to the MAJCOM AVDO to update REMIS in a timely
   manner. In addition, the ICBM SPO must ensure that the MIS, IMDB and REMIS are
   reconciled to the actual ICBM inventory as follows:
      3.4.1.1. Movement of any uninstalled assembled ICBM downstage, PSRE or uninstalled
      ICBM missile motor must be reconciled monthly with the ICBM SPO provided IMDB
      documents. In addition, movement of any assembled ICBM downstage or uninstalled
      ICBM missile motor must be reconciled monthly with REMIS/MIS, and movement of
      PSREs must be reconciled monthly with the MIS.
      3.4.1.2. Destruction of an ICBM AUR or an assembled ICBM downstage is to be
      reconciled with the MIS/REMIS and ICBM SPO provided IMDB documents monthly.
      Destruction of any PSRE or uninstalled ICBM missile motor must be reconciled monthly
      with ICBM SPO provided IMDB documents.
      3.4.1.3. Ownership and asset condition codes must be reconciled as follows:
          3.4.1.3.1. ICBM AURs must be reconciled quarterly with the MIS/REMIS.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                         41


         3.4.1.3.2. Assembled ICBM downstages, PSREs and uninstalled ICBM missile
         motors must be reconciled quarterly with ICBM SPO provided IMDB documents.
         3.4.1.3.3. Assembled ICBM downstages, not installed in a silo must be reconciled
         quarterly with the MIS/REMIS.
     3.4.1.4. Complete physical accountability (i.e. actual assets compared to ICBM SPO
     provided IMDB documents and IMDB documents to actual assets) of uninstalled ICBM
     missile motors, uninstalled, but assembled ICBM downstages and uninstalled PSRE’s
     must be conducted annually (Date of report will be 31 August with 30 days to inventory
     and reconcile reports with the OO-ALC AVDO). In addition, a complete physical
     accountability of uninstalled but assembled ICBM downstages must also be conducted
     against the MIS/REMIS information. ICBM AUR physical accountability will be
     performed during Re-entry System installation. Part number/serial number information
     from each missile stage, the missile tail number, Missile Guidance Set and PSRE will be
     recorded using a MIS generated Work Unit Code and submitted to the unit AVDO for
     reconciliation with the MIS.
     3.4.1.5. The ICBM AUR and assembled ICBM downstages financial information is
     maintained in REMIS. Uninstalled ICBM missile motors and PSRE financial
     information is maintained in IMDB. The ICBM SPO is responsible for establishing and
     maintaining the CFO reporting data elements (full cost and useful life) of an ICBM AUR,
     uninstalled ICBM missile motors (both individual and in an assembled ICBM downstage)
     and PSRE (See Section 3D). In addition, the ICBM SPO must establish and maintain
     qualified modification records against an ICBM AUR. The ICBM SPO will reconcile the
     valuation of the ICBM AUR, uninstalled ICBM missile motors, assembled ICBM
     downstages and PSREs at least annually (Date of report will be 31 August with 30 days
     to inventory and reconcile reports).
  3.4.2. Inventory and Status Reporting. ICBM reporting includes inventory and status
  reporting on ICBM AURs, uninstalled ICBM missile motors, assembled ICBM downstages
  and PSREs at all depot level locations (including contractors) and assigned to units by HQ
  USAF and MAJCOMs for specific missions. The AVDO records this information and sends
  it to the MAJCOM, (excluding uninstalled ICBM missile motors) and OO-ALC AVDO who
  updates IMDB. Reporting begins when:
     3.4.2.1. The uninstalled ICBM missile motor in IMDB, the assembled ICBM downstage,
     and/or PSRE are accepted by a (field or depot level) location in the MIS/REMIS.
  3.4.3. Possession Reporting. Possession is the actual acceptance or designation of
  responsibility for an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM downstage, PSRE or
  ICBM AUR. When the unit takes possession of an ICBM, the unit starts reporting according
  to this instruction and applicable systems instructions.
     3.4.3.1. Units and depot level locations report all uninstalled ICBM missile motors and
     PSRE gains, losses and relocations to the ICBM AVDO to update IMDB. Units input all
     assembled ICBM downstage gains, losses and relocations into the MIS with confirmation
     notification to the OO-ALC AVDO. Depot will send assembled ICBM downstage gains,
     losses and relocations to the OO-ALC AVDO.

      3.4.3.2. The unit or depot-level location (including contractors) processing ICBM assets
      will report the gain or loss as it occurs.
      3.4.3.3. Units will report ICBM AUR. An ICBM is classified as an All Up Round when
      in the launch facility, with MGS, PSRE and RS, and possessed in Possession Purpose
      Code "CC".
3.5. Possession Gain, Loss, Termination and Relocation Criteria.
   3.5.1. An organization gains possession of an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled
   ICBM downstage or PSRE when the gaining organization accepts the asset.
   3.5.2. Possession terminates when the ICBM asset is destroyed (demilled, launched,
   destructive Aging/Surveillance testing), or is transferred to another responsible organization.
   Terminate the ICBM asset in IMDB which will cease reporting if the asset has permanently
   transferred to non-Air Force activities.
   3.5.3. For uninstalled ICBM missile motors, assembled ICBM downstages or PSRE moved
   in "PJ" code, possession changes when the Traffic Management Flight (TMF) of the gaining
   field unit accepts the vehicle or when the 581 MMXS/MXDPB (Missile Maintenance
   Support Flight) accepts the asset at the depot (OO-ALC) or a contractor accepts the asset at
   their facility (for repair or use).
      3.5.3.1. This is accomplished when the TMF of the gaining organization, 581
      MMXS/MXDPB or the authorized contractor accepts the uninstalled ICBM missile
      motor or assembled ICBM downstage at the gaining station location code. The crews
      that move the missiles by truck are treated as "neutral" crews and therefore do not affect
      gain/loss reporting.
      3.5.3.2. The OO-ALC AVDO will also be informed of the gain to maintain proper
      accountability in IMDB.
   3.5.4. Possession terminates when an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM
   downstage or PSRE becomes a training aid or is transferred to the National Museum of the
   United States Air Force or at the time the aerospace vehicle meets the termination
   requirements of this instruction and AFI 16-402. For accountability purposes, uninstalled
   ICBM missile motor fired cases, GTM’s, hot-fired PSREs and other training assets at the
   depot will be tracked in IMDB, but will not be included on directed uninstalled ICBM
   missile motor inventories. Terminate the ICBM asset and cease reporting if the asset has
   permanently transferred to non-Air Force activities that may include but are not limited to:
      3.5.4.1. NMUSAF Programs.
      3.5.4.2. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition
   3.5.5. Depot relocates an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM downstage or
   PSRE when the asset is moved between buildings or to a contracted organization location
   supporting depot functions/programs. An organization relocates an assembled ICBM
   downstage or PSRE when the asset is moved from the support base or another launch facility
   (LF) and the asset is installed at a new LF. An organization relocates an assembled ICBM
   downstage or PSRE when the asset is returned from the LF to the support base. All shipping
   documents for relocation/movement of assets need to be provided to the OO-ALC AVDO
   within 5 business days.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                43


3.6. Notification Procedures. Accurate reporting of possession changes is essential in order for
the Air Force to accurately account for the location and use of the uninstalled ICBM missile
motors, assembled ICBM downstages, PSREs and ICBM AURs. Possession change messages
are required on all ICBM asset transfers between locations. Both reporting organizations must
use the same Zulu time and date.
   3.6.1. Gain Message, ICBM Asset Possession Change Report. The AVDO of the
   organization gaining the uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM downstage or
   PSRE must send a priority gain E-mail message not later than the 5 workdays after the
   possession changes. See Attachment 18 for a sample gain message and instructions for
   preparing the message.      Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority
   precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means
   to ensure arrival.
   3.6.2. Loss Message ICBM Asset Possession Change Report. The AVDO of the
   organization losing possession of an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM
   downstage or PSRE must send a priority loss E-mail message not later than the first workday
   after the possession change takes place. See Attachment 19 for a sample loss message and
   instructions for preparing the message. Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
   priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any
   means to ensure arrival.
   3.6.3. Termination Message ICBM Asset Termination Report. The unit or depot where the
   ICBM asset was destroyed or sent to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition must
   send a priority termination E-mail message not later than five working days after the action
   has occurred. The unit shall provide a signed termination letter or equivalent containing
   how, when, where, serial number and the date the asset was destroyed. The OO-ALC AVDO
   will file the termination letter and update IMDB accordingly. See Attachment 20 for a
   sample termination message and instructions for preparing the message. Continue reporting
   during emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this
   category as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival.
   3.6.4. Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Message, ICBM Asset Possession
   Purpose Identifier Code Change Report. When changing a possession purpose identifier, the
   AVDO must send a priority message, via an E-mail, not later than the first workday after the
   change. See Attachment 21 for a sample possession purpose identifier change message and
   instructions for preparing the message. Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
   priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any
   means to ensure arrival.
   3.6.5. Configuration Identifier Change Report. The AVDO of the organization changing the
   configuration identifier of an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM downstage,
   PSRE or ICBM AUR must send a configuration identifier change E-mail message. Obtain
   proper authorization from the MAJCOM AVDO before making the change, and send a
   priority message not later than the first workday after the change. See Attachment 22 for a
   sample MDS/Configuration identifier change message and instructions for preparing the
   message. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal precedence. Submit data
   requirements in this category as prescribed, or as soon as possible after submission of priority
   reports.

   3.6.6. Relocation Message, ICBM Asset Location Change Report. The AVDO of the
   organization relocating an uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM downstage or
   PSRE must send a priority relocation message via E-mail to the depot AVDO not later than
   the first workday after the asset's location changed. See Attachment 23 for a sample
   relocation message and instructions for preparing the message. Continue reporting during
   emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category
   as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival on published due dates. A relocation
   message does not require USAF AVDO or MAJCOM AVDO notification but requires
   notification of the transportation management specialist (for an IMDB update).
   3.6.7. Change in Asset Condition Code. The ICBM SPO is responsible for changing the
   condition code of the uninstalled ICBM missile motor, assembled ICBM downstage, PSRE
   or ICBM AUR and must send a priority asset condition code change message, via E-mail, not
   later than the first workday after the change. This priority message is sent to the OO-ALC
   AVDO to update IMDB. See Attachment 24 for a sample relocation message and
   instructions for preparing the message.
   3.6.8. How to Determine Codes.       Attachment 4 lists the references used in inventory
   reporting under this instruction.
3.7. ICBM Accountability.
   3.7.1. AF-AVDO maintains accountability for ICBMs on the AFMC Form 1026. The AF-
   AVDO assigns voucher numbers for terminated ICBMs and records them on AF Form 3131,
   General Purpose (used as a manual register of all assigned voucher numbers).
   3.7.2. For all assembled ICBM downstages or PSREs assigned to an Air Force activity,
   accountability begins when the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, or
   WAWF RR is signed.
   3.7.3. Accountability ends upon receipt of a termination message and DD Form 1348-1,
   when applicable.

Section 3D—Air Launched Cruise Missiles

3.8. Air Launched Cruise Missiles Reporting. Units will report all Air Launched Cruise
Missile, Advanced Cruise Missile, and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile inventory
gains, losses and terminations (using the same procedures for aerospace vehicles outlined in
paragraphs 2.9 thru 2.21 of this instruction). Units possessing Air Launched Cruise Missiles
will perform a semi-annual reconciliation (with at least one reconciliation occurring in August)
of all assigned/possessed cruise missile inventories with IMDS and MAJCOM provided REMIS
products.

Section 3E—Valuation

3.9. Operating Material & Supplies (OM&S) Asset Value – RSLP and Uninstalled ICBM
Missile Motors, Assembled ICBM Down Stages and PSRE.
   3.9.1. The Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing the CFO
   reporting data elements (full cost and useful life) of the uninstalled ICBM and RSLP missile
   motors and the PSRE. This data is normally derived from the acquisition/procurement
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              45


   contracts, however, in the absence of these contracts (for the older weapon systems), the cost
   may be derived from other means (i.e. like items). Procedures for reporting of RSLP are
   contained in Chapter 11 of this instruction.
   3.9.2. The cost data of the assembled ICBM downstage is the sum of the ICBM missile
   motors used in the assembly.
   3.9.3. A copy of the documentation supporting the CFO reporting data elements (full cost
   and useful life) should be maintained with the Weapon System Program Manager for the life
   of the weapon system plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the
   program office must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site
   (other than the location of the Weapon System Program Managers).
3.10. ICBM AUR and Cruise Missile Asset Value.
   3.10.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing the complete
   CFO reporting data elements (full cost and useful life) in REMIS for each delivered ICBM
   AUR and cruise missile.
      3.10.1.1. The value must include all installed subcomponents purchased on a separate
      contract and all GFM.
      3.10.1.2. The PM records full cost and useful life data in REMIS not more than 5
      workdays after the AF-AVDO notifies the PM that the asset record was established in
      REMIS.
   3.10.2. A copy of the documentation supporting the CFO reporting data elements (full cost
   and useful life) should be maintained in the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of
   the weapon system plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the
   program office must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site
   (other than the location of the Weapon System Program Managers).
3.11. ICBM AUR Modification Value.
   3.11.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing CFO
   modification records including determining the value of the modification on each asset and
   documenting when the modification was completed on each asset.
      3.11.1.1. This CFO requirement applies to ICBM AURs only.
      3.11.1.2. Capitalize only those modifications that meet the DoD capitalization threshold
      as defined in DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R and add capability to the
      weapon system or extend the useful life of the weapon system beyond its originally
      planned useful life.
      3.11.1.3. Establish the applicable modification records with the modification cost once
      the contract is awarded or when the contract price is known and add the completion date
      once the modification is completed on each asset.
      3.11.1.4. The modification records should be established in REMIS not more than 5
      workdays after the qualified modification contract was awarded or when the contract
      price is known. In addition, the modification completion date should be entered in
      REMIS not more than 5 workdays after the modification was completed on the specific
      asset.

                                           Chapter 5

           MRAP INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 5A—Reporting System Overview

5.1. Concepts.
   5.1.1. Each MRAP is always possessed by a designated Air Force reporting organization at
   either the organizational or depot level. The possessing organization or depot will report:
       5.1.1.1. Possession and possession changes.
       5.1.1.2. Status conditions that affect ability to perform assigned missions.
       5.1.1.3. Configuration and configuration changes.
       5.1.1.4. Utilization data.
   5.1.2. Contractor Reporting. For contractor-controlled or maintained equipment/system(s),
   the possessing organizations still retains the responsibility to ensure inventory, status,
   utilization, and configuration reporting is accomplished. The organization owning the
   contract maintenance requirement or designated official shall be responsible for ensuring the
   contract contains the necessary requirements for the contractor to provide the required
   inventory and status reporting information to affected users. The organization requiring the
   contract controlled maintenance shall work with the contracting officer to ensure inventory
   and equipment status reporting requirements are accurately captured in contract documents.
   5.1.3. Deployed Asset Reporting. Deployed units will coordinate with the appropriate Lead
   Command on processes to follow for gathering applicable reporting data while minimizing
   impact to the warfighter.
   5.1.4. Units without access to an automated Maintenance Information System (MIS) will
   work with their command headquarters to determine alternative procedures.
5.2. The Reporting System. Units process inventory, status and utilization data using an
approved MIS. HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), HQ AFMC, and
other authorized users of the Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS)
database monitor the data and may extract reports to control MRAP inventory, status, and
utilization. Any records dispositions or IT Systems that need to be updated/deleted/added in the
AF RDS must be accomplished by following the guidance in Chapter 11 of AFI 33-364. Contact
your local records professional for additional guidance.
   5.2.1. Units collect and input the data as shown in the applicable MIS user's manual. Data is
   electronically transmitted at specified times to the REMIS database.
   5.2.2. HQ USAF, HQ AFMC, MAJCOMs, and other authorized users may extract reports,
   data, and information from an automated accounting system database to monitor and control
   MRAP inventory, status, and utilization.
5.3. Reporting Accuracy. Inventory, status, and utilization reports are the basis for justifying
and defending plans, programs, budgets, and to support the AF's CFO statement. Accurate and
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                            51


timely reporting is critical. Errors in reporting can result in the loss of required funding,
manpower authorizations, and supplies.
5.4. Security Classification. MRAP inventory, status, and utilization data reported under this
instruction are unclassified. Do not enter classified data into the MIS/REMIS or an automated
accounting system database.

Section 5B—Reporting Responsibilities

5.5. Unit-Level Activities. All reporting starts at unit level.
   5.5.1. The unit designated POC ensures that MRAP inventory, status, and utilization
   reporting is accurate and timely. To accomplish this the unit designated POC:
       5.5.1.1. Ensures the unit correctly maintains and reports applicable inventory,
       maintenance status, utilization, and configuration data on all MRAPs assigned to their
       organization.
       5.5.1.2. Coordinates with MAJCOMs, ALCs, and contractor field teams to verify
       inventory, status, and utilization reporting.
5.6. MAJCOMs.
   5.6.1. Coordinate with other MAJCOMs, ANG, Air Force Reserve, and non-USAF
   organizations to move, ship, or transfer MRAPs and send applicable movement reports.
   5.6.2. Ensure that MRAPs selected for transfer meet the specified configuration
   requirements and are prepared for transfer in accordance with Technical Orders and other
   transfer inspection requirements, as applicable.
5.7. MAJCOM POCs.
   5.7.1. Validate that their respective reporting units ensure MRAP inventory, status,
   utilization, and configuration appears in the REMIS database.
       5.7.1.1. (Added-AFRC) The command OPR for Security Forces is HQ AFRC/A7S
       Readiness Requirements Branch (afrc.sf@us.af.mil).
   5.7.2. Ensure units take action to correct any reporting discrepancy or other problem.
   5.7.3. Perform tasks in conjunction with the units as stated in paragraph 5.6.1 of this
   instruction.
   5.7.4. Assist other MAJCOM agencies in retrieving MRAP inventory, status, and utilization
   data from the REMIS database.
5.8. System Sustainment Manager (SSM).
   5.8.1. Is responsible for managing all MRAP equipment inventory, configuration and matrix
   tables.

Section 5C—Inventory Reporting

5.9. Assignment, Possession, and Termination Procedures. Inventory reporting starts when
an MRAP is accepted into the Air Force inventory. Possession, changes to possession, and
 52                                                    AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


termination will follow procedures as outlined in Chapter 2, Section 2C, of this AFI, and
associated Lead MAJCOM supplements.

Section 5D—Status/Utilization Reporting

   5.10.1. Full Mission Capable (FMC): Equipment/system functioning as required in TO
   specifications and is capable of performing all of its assigned missions.
   5.10.2. Partial Mission Capable (PMC): System or equipment functioning in such a way that
   it can perform at least one, but not all of its assigned missions; functions impaired but usable.
   Systems with redundant capabilities will be coded PMC when redundancy is lost, even
   though the system is fully capable of supporting all of its assigned missions.
   5.10.3. Non Mission Capable (NMC): The system or equipment does not meet the TO
   specifications; therefore, cannot accomplish any of its assigned missions or functions.
5.11. Work Unit Codes (WUC). WUCs are an important part of the MIS status reporting.
WUCs determine subsystem problems and repair actions associated with a piece of equipment or
a system. A proper WUC is required to be entered into the MIS status reporting when an
equipment problem is discovered or repaired. If a specific WUC is not known initially due to
troubleshooting, then a system or subsystem WUC may be used until the faulty component is
identified. When the equipment is returned to service or when parts are placed on order, the
proper WUC should be used for the PMC or NMC status reporting period. The use of __000 and
or __00 will not be used when a more specific WUC is available.
5.12. MRAP Utilization Reporting Concept. Report utilization data for each possessed
MRAP. This data assists in determining future inspection and modification requirements. MIS
data must be input no later than midnight of the fourth calendar day of the following month.
Any utilization data reported after the fourth calendar day will be reported in the next month's
data in MIS.
5.13. Mission Status Reporting Tool (MSRT).
       5.13.1.1. Lead Command Addendums to this publication give a list of maintenance and
       condition status codes and their definitions which are based on DoDI 3110.05, Material
       Condition Reporting for Mission-Essential Systems and Equipment. These codes
       describe the capability of the MRAP vehicle to perform its assigned missions as specified
       in:
       5.13.1.2. The unit's Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements.
       5.13.1.3. Unit training syllabuses.
       5.13.1.4. Test mission requirements.
       5.13.1.5. Mission Status Reporting Tool (MSRT).
   5.13.2. MSRTs lay the groundwork for reporting the status of MRAP capability. MSRTs list
   the minimum systems and subsystems that must function for the MRAP to perform
   specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or other missions.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              53


      5.13.2.1. The NMC lists all systems needed for full mission performance for specifically
      assigned wartime, training, and test missions. The systems and subsystems that must
      function for a unit to accomplish those missions, and if not functional, that MRAP cannot
      be used for any of its missions.
      5.13.2.2. The PMC lists all systems and subsystems needed for partial mission
      performance. It lists the essential systems and subsystems that must function to do partial
      missions (specifically assigned unit wartime, training, or test missions). If these systems
      or subsystems are not functioning the MRAP can be used to fulfill one or more of its
      assigned missions, but can still perform at least one of its assigned missions.
      5.13.2.3. The FMC lists all systems and subsystems that are not needed to perform any
      assigned mission.
      5.13.2.4. The MSRT allows you to compare MRAP systems, subsystems, and
      components, by WUC, against the NMC, PMC and FMC across the page.
      5.13.2.5. MSRTs will be reviewed annually for currency by the operational user
      functional managers in coordination with the Lead Command MRAP WST.
      5.13.2.6. Report any MRAP that is not Full Mission Capable (FMC) with a maintenance
      status code determined by the following criteria:
      5.13.2.7. Report an MRAP that can perform at least one, but not all of its assigned
      missions as Partial Mission Capable (PMC). Report an MRAP that cannot perform any
      of its assigned missions as Non Mission Capable (NMC).
      5.13.2.8. Add the letter M (maintenance), S (supply), or B (both maintenance and
      supply) to show the reason the MRAP is PMC or NMC. See paragraph 2.24 for
      additional guidance on using status codes.
      5.13.2.9. Operational users Group Commander or equivalent may down grade NMC
      conditions after risk assessment is accomplished.
      5.13.2.10. Operational users Group Commander or equivalent may modify MSRT as
      mission dictates provided risk assessment has been accomplished.

Section 5E—Financial Accountability

5.14. Asset Value. The SSM records full cost and useful life data in REMIS not more than 5
workdays after the AF-AVDO notifies the PM that the asset record was established in REMIS.
The SSM will:
   5.14.1. Establish the CFO reporting data elements (full cost and useful life) of each asset
   (including the value of the GFM).

                                           Chapter 6

      COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT STATUS AND INVENTORY REPORTING

6.1. Purpose.
   6.1.1. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance
   with paragraph 2.11.3. of AFI 33-324. Base activities enter transactions via IMDS and
   transmit them to REMIS on a near real-time basis.
   6.1.2. REMIS provides managers with worldwide information and the capability to extract
   data on in-use Air Force systems. This MIS:
       6.1.2.1. Helps managers identify trends and clear up problems.
       6.1.2.2. Helps in developing replacement systems, spare parts, and equipment
       modifications.
       6.1.2.3. Ensures that managers know the equipment status on critical communications
       equipment.
   6.1.3. For the purpose of this instruction communications equipment as it relates to AFSPC
   includes Space Command and Control (C2) systems.
6.2. Terms/Status Definitions.
   6.2.1. Green - Full Mission Capable (FMC): Equipment/system functioning as required in
   TO specifications and is capable of performing all of its assigned missions.
   6.2.2. Amber - Partial Mission Capable (PMC): System or equipment functioning in such a
   way that it can perform at least one, but not all of its assigned missions or functions; system
   is impaired but usable. Systems with redundant capabilities will be coded PMC when
   redundancy is lost, even though the system is fully capable of supporting all missions.
   Equipment will reported as Amber when a part is ordered with a status of partially mission
   capable supply.
       6.2.2.1. Equipment in this category usually supports minimum mission requirements
       with deficiencies in range, quality, and speed of service. Further loss of redundancy,
       spare equipment, channels, circuits, frequencies, etc. will cause the equipment to be
       reported as Red (NMC). Equipment reported as Amber for the sole purpose of ordering
       parts at a higher priority is not authorized.
   6.2.3. Red - Non Mission Capable (NMC): The system or equipment does not meet the TO
   specifications; therefore, cannot accomplish any of its assigned missions or functions.
   Unusable (neither in-use nor available for use). The equipment will reported as Red when a
   part is ordered with a status of non mission capable supply.
       6.2.3.1. Condition does not apply if the equipment is in-use, available for use, or was
       turned off by the user at their option. Equipment Notice to Airmen (NOTAMed) out is
       considered Red (NMC) until it is NOTAMed back in.
   6.2.4. Mission status: Status hours required for operation of mission set equipment. NOTE:
   Mission status reporting is optional within IMDS; however MAJCOMs/FOAs can define
   mission status reporting procedures in MAJCOM/FOA supplements, if required.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                            55


   6.2.5. Status Codes: Are used in REMIS to determine the condition status of the equipment
   at the point in time the status is being reported and have the same meaning as downtime code
   in IMDS. See Table 6.2 for list of status codes.
   6.2.6. Reason Codes: Are used in REMIS to help explain when equipment is placed in the
   "Other" (NMCO) status code condition and have the same meaning as delay codes in IMDS.
   See Table 6.3 for list of reason codes.
   6.2.7. Downtime Codes: The codes provide the cause for C-E equipment downtime and are
   used in reporting status. See Attachment 5 for list of downtime codes.
   6.2.8. Delay Codes: The codes listed reasons for C-E equipment delay time and are used in
   reporting status.
   6.2.9. Active Equipment: Equipment installed and commissioned to perform an operational
   mission or requirement. (Does not include cold spares or off-line equipment.)
   6.2.10. Inactive Equipment: Equipment not commissioned or installed to perform an
   operational mission or requirement. Includes equipment in storage, tactical and combat
   communications equipment not deployed or setup and operational for training, mockups,
   procured/identified training equipment, and equipment not being utilized to perform a
   specific mission.
6.3. Security Exemption.
   6.3.1. Do not report or enter classified data into IMDS. Report equipment or mission status
   information as directed by the maintaining command or as specified in the commands
   security classification guide.

AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                              57


       6.4.5.8. Ensure the HDBM processes the Communications Status Summary Report
       (SSR) monthly, using formats 1 and 4 on separate IMDS GENRUNs. Other formats can
       be produced as necessary. See AFCSM 21-560, Volume 2, for specific instructions.
       6.4.5.9. Maintain and update the EIL with information provided from the work center.
       6.4.5.10. Reconcile all Red/Amber jobs using the Open Incident List (OIL).
       6.4.5.11. Provide work centers with an Open Incident List (OIL) weekly for
       reconciliation of all Red/Amber jobs.
       6.4.5.12. Ensure updates provided by the work center are entered into the ESR system
       through IMDS.
       6.4.5.13. Be familiar with using TRIC "STI" (IMDS 230 NFSB80, Status Inquiry) so the
       job status of new or existing jobs may be reviewed during the duty day for accuracy.
       6.4.5.14. Perform checks and balances to ensure ESR is current and accurate.
   6.4.6. The work center will:
       6.4.6.1. Appoint a work center ESR point of contact (POC) if the work center has ESR
       reportable equipment. The ESR POC can be the work center supervisor or any individual
       within the section. The ESR POC will review and provide updates/corrections to the
       CFP weekly.
       6.4.6.2. Review the OIL to ensure each job against the work center is current and correct.
       6.4.6.3. Contact the CFP when problems are discovered and provide updates on a timely
       basis so the job status can be updated.
       6.4.6.4. Be familiar with using TRIC "STI" (Status Inquiry) so the job status of new or
       existing jobs may be reviewed during the duty day.
       6.4.6.5. Account for or remove all reportable equipment end items from Air Force
       Equipment Management System (AFEMS) or Asset Inventory Management (AIM)
       records before requesting the CFP to add the reportable equipment to the EIL.
6.5. What is Reportable. Report all communications equipment (Type Equipment "C" or "R")
that is assigned a standard reporting designator (SRD), as listed in the IMDS/REMIS SRD Table.
This requirement exists even when bases are undergoing closure, systems will be reported until
deactivated or the base is closed. Use Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) QBC, Program
NFSU10, Screen 127 or TRIC QCC, Program NFS840, Screen126 to view the SRD table.
   6.5.1. Report equipment inventory in IMDS for all equipment (including in-garrison
   deployable equipment) assigned a SRD to include items that do not require maintenance data
   collection (MDC) as indicated on the REMIS SRD table (IMDS reporting level P or Y).
       6.5.1.1. Report inventory only for COMSEC equipment (SRD category U and IMDS
       report level P).
   6.5.2. Report equipment status for all equipment (including in-garrison deployable
   equipment) that is authorized MICAP as indicated on the REMIS SRD table (IMDS
   reporting level Y). NOTE: Do not report status against embedded equipment (items
   installed on a higher level end item) (i.e. GRC-171 can be used as a standalone item in a
 58                                                  AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   Ground to Air Transmitter-Receiver (GATR site) or as an embedded part of the TYQ-23.
   Since the GRC-171 has an SRD both will be loaded to the inventory, however when the one
   embedded in the TYQ-23 breaks, the status is documented against the TYQ-23 using the
   WUC of the embedded item.
      6.5.2.1. Report classified equipment status on Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and
      Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) equipment (SRD category Q) as directed by
      AFISRA. SRD category Q will only be used by AFISRA units. MAJCOMs are not
      authorized to use SRD category Q unless permitted by AFISRA.
   6.5.3. Report local status only on non-reportable equipment, provided the reporting level is
   set to local only (IMDS reporting level R). Status reported on equipment with IMDS report
   level R will remain at the local (base level IMDS) database.
   6.5.4. MAJCOMs/FOAs, or Higher Headquarters determine what mission reporting is
   required (IMDS reporting level Y). MAJCOM/FOA supplements define specific reporting
   and non-reporting requirements.
   6.5.5. Contractor Reporting. For contractor controlled or maintained equipment/system(s),
   the possessing organizations still retains the responsibility to ensure inventory, status,
   utilization, and configuration reporting is accomplished. The organization owning the
   contract maintenance requirement or designated official shall be responsible for ensuring the
   contract contains the necessary requirements for the contractor to provide the required
   inventory and status reporting information to affected users. The organization requiring the
   contract controlled maintenance shall coordinate with the contracting officer to ensure
   inventory and equipment status reporting requirements are accurately captured in contract
   documents. For example, the contracting quality assurance evaluator (QAE) may have to
   enter the inventory and equipment status reporting in IMDS.
   6.5.6. Weather Meteorological Equipment. See Attachment 15 and Attachment 16 for
   specific guidance on status and serial number reporting of Weather Meteorological
   equipment.
   6.5.7. Deployable Communications Equipment Status Reporting.
      6.5.7.1. Deployable communications equipment poses a challenge for reporting
      purposes. Unlike its fixed base counterpart, much of the equipment is in storage (in-
      garrison). Even when it is being utilized, it is seldom used in close proximity to an
      established base. The following procedures apply:
      6.5.7.2. Reporting Criteria: Report equipment status as per paragraph 6.3 when the
      equipment is deployed. Local deployed reporting procedures will be developed no later
      than 14 days after deployment to ensure data is recorded on a reoccurring basis.
      6.5.7.3. Requirement for real time outage reporting (when the equipment is deployed and
      operational) will be determined by appropriate reporting agency.
6.6. Equipment Status Reporting Procedures.
   6.6.1. Follow the instructions for TRIC COX, Screen 996, Program NFSJR0 and TRIC
   EUC, Screen 997, Program NFSJQ0, in AFCSM 21-560, Volume 2.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                           59


     6.6.1.1. TRIC COX (Communications Status Load and Maintenance Scheduling) will
     not process action/request if the start date is greater than 33 days in the past from the
     current date.
     6.6.1.2. TRIC EUC (Status Update and Close) will not delete, or update a status or delay
     in which the start date/time is greater than 33 days in the past from the current date.
  6.6.2. Unless specified in a MAJCOM supplement, do not report:
     6.6.2.1. Outages of less than 5 minutes.
     6.6.2.2. Frequency changes, crypto reset, or runway change outages that last less than 15
     minutes.
     6.6.2.3. Adjustments or alignments performed during scheduled maintenance such as
     PMIs, TCTOs and TCIs. These actions are documented during the outage.
     6.6.2.4. Generator run-ups that are scheduled. However, Red time associated with
     generator failures during scheduled run-ups if over 5 minutes will be reported using
     Down Time Code (DTC) "N".
  6.6.3. Use the downtime codes listed in Attachment 5 to describe the reason for the outage.
  6.6.4. Use the delay codes listed in Attachment 6 to describe any maintenance delay that is
  keeping the equipment from being returned to operational status.
  6.6.5. Use ESR sequence codes to upgrade or downgrade status. Do not change the
  condition code on the original status unless it was wrong when loaded. Change sequence
  codes as needed to allow more than 26 delays or comments.
  6.6.6. Work Unit Codes (WUC). WUCs are an important part of ESR reporting. They
  determine subsystem problems and repair actions associated with a piece of equipment or a
  system. A proper WUC is required to be entered into ESR when an equipment problem is
  discovered or repaired (except for DTC of "U"). It is the technician's responsibility to
  provide CFP with the proper WUC when the equipment is returned to service, when parts are
  placed on order or when the source of the outage is known. Use the lowest assembly WUC
  when possible and do not use the highest assembly (i.e. AB000) WUC. The lowest level
  WUC is used to identify specific components causing equipment downtime. NOTE: The
  use of **000 will not be used when a more specific WUC is available.
     6.6.6.1. Always report status against the highest level end item when reporting a Red or
     Amber status condition against an embedded end item. Do so by using the WUC within
     the highest level end item's WUC table that best describes the lower level embedded end
     item and is the closest to the component in need of repair. Never downgrade the status of
     work unit coded associated equipment if maintenance is not required for higher or lower
     assemblies.
     6.6.6.2. Refer to MAJCOM supplement of mission reporting requirements for associated
     equipment status reporting.
  6.6.7. Reporting Procedures. CFP will report changes in equipment status as they become
  aware of them. This is accomplished by user notification or from the work center. The
  following procedures apply:
60                                                   AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


     6.6.7.1. Status Times. Use the notification time the outage was reported. Do not
     backdate times to previous days. Not Applicable (N/A) to AFSPC when status of outages
     is considered classified. Time logged to put equipment back into service will be used to
     close the job.
     6.6.7.2. Downtime Codes. Initial downtime code (DTC) of "U-Unknown" will be
     entered until such time as maintenance can determine the exact problem, then change the
     DTC to the one best describing the reason for the outage. DTC definitions are found in
     Attachment 5 of this instruction and AFCSM 21-560, Volume 2, Attachment 1.
     6.6.7.3. Delay Codes. Use Delay Codes (DC) when maintenance is not working on the
     problem. Use the code which best describes the delay. Close the delays upon return of
     maintenance on the job, reason for the delay no longer exists, or a change in situation
     occurs. Researching parts is not a delay unless it exceeds 30 minutes. DC definitions are
     found in Attachment 6 of this instruction and AFCSM 21-560, Volume 2, Attachment 1.
     6.6.7.4. Comment requirements:
        6.6.7.4.1. Enter comments against the status and delay codes as required. Do not add
        comments to codes not requiring them unless an adverse circumstance warrants it.
        Keep comments short and concise but ensure there is enough information to describe
        the problem or situation.
        6.6.7.4.2. Enter comments against the status and delay codes that require one. Do
        not add comments to codes not requiring them unless an adverse circumstance
        warrants it. Keep comments short and concise but ensure there is enough information
        to describe the problem or situation. Example: 125/TACAN INOP; AA -
        125/AWAITING DOWN-TIME.
     6.6.7.5. Comments against the STATUS:
        6.6.7.5.1. Initial status comments may not provide the exact reason for an outage.
        Use the words given by the user for the first comment. Example: 125/WSA MM3
        CONSTANT ALARM.
        6.6.7.5.2. Once maintenance has determined the problem cause, an actual reason for
        the outage will be entered. Example: 125/ALARMS CAUSED BY FAULTY
        WIRES.
        6.6.7.5.3. When the problem is corrected, enter the corrective action. Example:
        128/CE REPLACED EXTERIOR BUILDING WIRES.
        6.6.7.5.4. Other comments pertinent to the status of the equipment can be entered as
        they are known.
        6.6.7.5.5. Enter the Julian date followed by a slash and then the comment. Example:
        A336/.
        6.6.7.5.6. Initials may be used if required. If initials are used, they will be placed one
        space after the comment. Using an entire line for initials will be avoided. No work
        center or agency names will be used. Units using initials will develop a local format
        for entering requirements. Example: 111/RADIO WEAK RX NM/OP.

          6.6.7.5.7. Comments against delays will include an estimate of when maintenance
          will return to work on the problem. The Estimated Time Return to Operation
          (ETRO) will be entered at the end of the comment. If the ETRO expires, an update
          comment and ETRO will be entered. Example: 003/AWAITING DOWN-TIME
          ETRO 004D/1200 BB/DF.
          6.6.7.5.8. Abbreviations may be used if common to all levels of command. Example:
          224/123.1 RX INOP.
          6.6.7.5.9. Comment lines will only contain pertinent information pertaining to the
          job. Do not enter extra characters (i.e. dots, dashes, etc.) to fill up the comment line.
6.7. Inventory Records. To load communication equipment to IMDS follow the instructions
for TRICs CEL, IMDS Screen 800, Program NFSE20 and MCR, Program NFSK60, in AFCSM
21-560, Volume 2. IMDS TRIC Code "EIL" Equipment Inventory List (EIL) is used to extract
equipment inventory records.
   6.7.1. CEL is the source program for up channel and local reporting for communication
   equipment. This includes but is not limited to: Job Data Documentation (JDD), Equipment
   Status Reporting (ESR), Deficiency Reporting (DR), Time Compliance Technical Order
   (TCTO), and Enterprise Solutions Supply (ESS).
   6.7.2. Only communications equipment which possesses an AF level or local SRD being
   maintained by a unit or by a contractor overseen by the communication unit will be entered
   on the EIL.
      6.7.2.1. Not all equipment maintained by the unit is communications equipment. Items
      such as vehicles, tool boxes, etc. will not be listed on the EIL. There are trainers, support
      equipment, and test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE), which are loaded
      on other IMDS subsystems. These other subsystems have separate inventory lists which
      require different IMDS equipment loads.
      6.7.2.2. Contractor-supplied and maintained equipment can be reported or tracked using
      a local SRD.
      6.7.2.3. Gain equipment (enter it into the inventory) when a unit accepts maintenance
      responsibility and it has been accounted for in AFEMS and AIM.
      6.7.2.4. Lose equipment (place it in "inventory loss condition") when a unit no longer
      has maintenance responsibility, or when it has been decommissioned and removed from
      AFEMS and AIM.
      6.7.2.5. When adding reportable equipment and missions to the inventory, ensure the
      correct data elements and codes (obtained from SRD Table requested with IMDS screen
      126) are used. These data elements are important for status and inventory reporting.
      6.7.2.6. Change the equipment from active to inactive status as required. Combat
      Communications, tactical, and stored equipment will be reported as inactive until
      deployed, powered up, conducting PMIs, or maintenance, etc. (Operating time is
      calculated from active times as reported on possessed inventory).

       6.7.2.7. Equipment Designator: Use the equipment designator as indicated on the
       IMDS/REMIS SRD table (screen 126). The system will not accept equipment
       designators that differ from the IMDS/REMIS SRD table.
       6.7.2.8. Serial Number: Use the actual equipment serial number from the equipment
       data plate. If the number is longer than fifteen characters, use the last fifteen characters.
       If the equipment has no serial number, assign one in accordance with AFMAN 23-110.
       If a duplicate serial number is found, verify the number and contact the applicable
       MAJCOM/FOAs IMDS Functional for assistance.
           6.7.2.8.1. Care will be taken to ensure that "0, O" and "1, I" are not confused when
           recording the serial number. If the equipment does not have a data plate or does not
           have a number in the serial number block, a message will be sent to the MAJCOM for
           serial number assignment to prevent duplication of SNs in REMIS. A system made
           up of several components will use the SN of the control unit or main component.
       6.7.2.9. Requiring Command: Enter the MAJCOM that the equipment supports. This is
       the command that is the customer for the equipment. See AFCSM 21-556, Volume 2,
       Introduction to the Core Automated Maintenance System, Attachment 1 or use IMDS
       screen 127, for a list of command codes.
       6.7.2.10. Overhaul/Install Date. When the equipment is initially loaded, use the date the
       equipment was accepted by the unit or equipment overhaul date. Do not change this date
       unless the original acceptance date was entered in error.

6.8. Organization Record.
   6.8.1. The IMDS system identifies an organization by number, kind, type, geographic
   location and detachment number. There are two organizational fields; IMDS and AFI 21-
   103.
       6.8.1.1. The AFI 21-103 organization is used for up channel reporting to REMIS of
       status and inventory and follows the "G" Series Special Orders. Notify MAJCOM or
       FOA Functional's before making the change.
       6.8.1.1. (AFRC) The command OPR for Communication Equipment is HQ AFRC/A6O
       (afrc.scf2@us.af.mil).
       6.8.1.2. The IMDS organization is used for local identification. In most cases the IMDS
       and AFI 21-103 organizations should be the same.
   6.8.2. Assign a 4 digit organizational identification (ORG ID) only to actual units,
   detachments, and operating locations (OLs). Report equipment and missions (if required) at
   unmanned sites and locations under the organization that has the maintenance responsibility
   for the asset. To change the organization record within the same MAJCOM the inventory
   will be lost and regained.
       6.8.2.1. The first two positions of the ORG ID are the 2 digit command code which is up
       channel reported to REMIS as a 3 digit command code.
       6.8.2.2. The last two positions of the ORG ID are "00" for the basic (parent) unit; for
       example, use "1C00".
       6.8.2.3. For detachments or OL, the last two positions of the ORG ID are the detachment
       number or operating location letter. For example: For Detachment 2, use "1C02"; For
       OL "A" use "1C0A".
       6.8.2.4. For an OL of a detachment, use the detachment and the OL letter; for example,
       "1C2A".
6.9. Organization Changes.
   6.9.1. Organization Record (OGT). The OGT is the IMDS record identifying the unit
   locally and when data is transmitted off base. The OGT record will not be updated unless
   specifically instructed to do so. Entering the wrong codes will prevent data from being
   passed to REMIS and other MISs. MAJCOM/FOA or Higher Headquarters will provide
   specific instructions when a change to this record is required.
   6.9.2. The MAJCOMs/FOAs Functional's will make organization changes in REMIS prior to
   any AFI 21-103 organization change made in IMDS to avoid up channel reporting errors in
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                         73


  IMDS. Notify the applicable MAJCOM/FOA Functional's prior to loading or changing
  organizations.
  6.9.3. Make organization changes in IMDS using TRIC OGT, Program NFSD80.
  6.9.4. Communications units will ensure any required deactivation and/or transferring of
  organizations within IMDS are accomplished to ensure all status and inventory of equipment
  is properly transferred or lost.

AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT (ATE) INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION
                          REPORTING

Section 7A—Reporting System Overview

7.1. How and What To Report.
   7.1.1. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance
   with paragraph 2.11.3. of AFI 33-324. Report ATE through the appropriate MIS. Data is
   maintained in REMIS.
   7.1.2. For the purposes of this instruction, ATE includes:
       7.1.2.1. Test stations.
       7.1.2.2. Tester replaceable units (TRUs).
   7.1.3. The Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories only report the inventory and
   status of ATE systems that are unique to a weapon system and mission essential systems that
   do not have manual backup.
7.2. Basic Reporting Concept.
   7.2.1. Each item of ATE is possessed by an Air Force training or maintenance organization
   (to include organizational, intermediate, or depot level).
   7.2.2. The possessing unit reports:
       7.2.2.1. Possession and changes in possession.
       7.2.2.2. Conditions that change the ability of the ATE to do its mission (condition
       status).
       7.2.2.3. Configuration.
       7.2.2.4. Daily utilization.
7.3. Contractor Reporting. For contractor controlled or maintained equipment, report the
inventory, status, utilization, and configuration on ATE Government Furnished Equipment
(GFE) for contracts initiated after 1 October 1993. The administrative contracting officer sends
the needed reports to the agency that asked for them, unless the contract states otherwise.
7.4. The Reporting System. Data is processed at the unit level and at the REMIS processing
sites. MAJCOMs, HQ AFMC, HQ USAF, and other authorized users of the REMIS database
monitor the data.
   7.4.1. Unit's collect and input the data as shown in the applicable MIS user's manual. Data is
   electronically transmitted at specified times to the REMIS database.
   7.4.2. HQ USAF, HQ AFMC, MAJCOMs, and other authorized users may extract reports,
   data, and information from REMIS to monitor and control ATE inventory, status, and
   utilization.
7.5. Security Classification. Do not report classified data under this instruction.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               75


Section 7B—Reporting Responsibilities

7.6. Unit-Level Activities. All reporting starts at the unit level.
   7.6.1. The designated ATE POC will ensure that ATE inventory, status, and utilization
   reporting is accurate and timely.
   7.6.2. A maintenance official (usually the ATE section or shop supervisor):
       7.6.2.1. Ensures that the unit correctly maintains inventory, maintenance status,
       utilization, and configuration data.
       7.6.2.2. Ensures that the unit reports data on all ATE at their work center (using the
       procedures in this instruction), including:
       7.6.2.3. Initial station or equipment inventory or changes.
       7.6.2.4. Initial TRU inventory or changes.
       7.6.2.5. Station or equipment status changes.
       7.6.2.6. Station or equipment utilization time.
       7.6.2.7. Checks the error file daily and corrects all ATE errors with help from the unit or
       host database manager (DBM) as needed.
       7.6.2.8. Coordinates with MAJCOMs, ALCs, or contractor field teams to verify
       inventory, status, and utilization reporting.
   7.6.3. Units without access to an automated MIS coordinate with their command
   headquarters to determine alternative procedures.
7.7. MAJCOMs.
   7.7.1. Coordinate with other MAJCOMs, ANG, Air Force Reserve, and non-USAF
   organizations to move, ship, or transfer ATE and send applicable movement reports.
   7.7.2. Ensure that ATE chosen for transfer meets the desired configuration requirements and
   is made ready for transfer in accordance with TO 00-20-1, Preventive Maintenance program
   and other transfer inspection requirements, as applicable.
   7.7.3. Assist other MAJCOM agencies in pulling ATE inventory, status, and utilization data
   from the REMIS database.
7.8. MAJCOM POCs.
   7.8.1. Verify unit reporting to ensure that ATE inventory, status, utilization, and
   configuration appear in the REMIS database.
   7.8.2. Ensure that unit's take action to correct any reporting discrepancy or problem.
   7.8.3. Coordinate with the unit's as stated in paragraph 7.6.1 of this instruction.
7.9. SE/ATS-PGM.
   7.9.1. Is responsible for managing all ATE equipment inventory, configuration and matrix
   tables.

                                             Chapter 8

     SPACE VEHICLE INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 8A—Space Vehicle Reporting

8.1. Purpose. The purpose for tracking satellites is to have a single tracking tool within the AF
to show an accurate status of AF satellite assets. With the exception of asset accountability and
valuation reporting the reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in
accordance with paragraph 2.11.5. of AFI 33-324. Each Space Wing and Product Center owning
space assets reports on their systems through IMDS and REMIS. The possessing unit reports
their satellite inventory and status of those assets. Space Operational Unit personnel will collect
and process the information.
8.2. What is Reportable. Report the existence and valuation of all AF satellite systems through
REMIS. Satellite systems will include the satellite as a whole. When AF takes possession of the
satellite (even if the constellation is incomplete) the Weapon System Program Manager will
ensure the information on the satellite is sent to the AF-AVDO so the record can be established
in REMIS. Also, when a satellite becomes completely non-operational (cannot perform any of
its missions), the Weapon System Program Manager will send a termination notice to the AF-
AVDO to terminate the satellite in REMIS. Finally, the Weapon System Program Manager will
record the full cost and useful life data of each satellite once the satellite record is established in
REMIS. The full cost must include all costs to produce the satellite and the costs associated with
launching the satellite.
8.3. Reporting Accuracy. All AF owned satellites must be reported in REMIS within 5
workdays of the AF taking possession of the satellite (even if the constellation of satellites is
incomplete). All satellite terminations must be reported in REMIS within 5 workdays of the
satellite becoming non operational. The CFO reporting data elements (full cost and useful life)
of each satellite must be recorded in REMIS within 5 workdays of the satellite record being
established in REMIS. Reports specified in this procedure are the basis for justifying and
defending AFSPC plans, programs, the budget, and to support the AF's CFO statement.
Accurate and timely reporting is critical, errors in reporting can result in the loss of required
funding, manpower authorizations, and supplies.
8.4. Status Definitions.
   8.4.1. Green (Full Mission Capable (FMC)): DoD owns the system and has declared the
   system operational.
   8.4.2. Amber (Partial Mission Capable (PMC)): DoD owns the system. It has been
   functionally turned over (DD Form 250 or WAWF RR) from contractor to DoD, but has not
   been declared operational. This is a transitional status and not indicative of satellite health
   (i.e. pending launch or on-orbit checkout).
   8.4.3. Red (Non Mission Capable (NMC)): The system is a contractor asset. It is not under
   control of the DoD.

Section 8B—Space Vehicle Responsibilities
 78                                                    AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


8.5. Security Exemption.
   8.5.1. The classified status or locations of each satellite will not be entered in unclassified
   data systems. However, the official serial number of each satellite will be entered and
   maintained in REMIS along with the satellite's status (i.e. active in orbit, in storage at
   location XYZ or terminated) and CFO reporting data elements (full cost and useful life).
   8.5.2. Specific data about satellite and constellation degradation is reported through secure
   operational means.
8.6. Inventory Reporting. Inventory reporting begins when a satellite transfers to AF
ownership (versus contractor owned). Physical accountability reporting is initially accomplished
by the applicable Program Office at the Product Centers until the constellation is fielded and
declared operational. At that time satellite reporting transfers to the operating Space Wing/unit.
   8.6.1. The Program Office will establish a mission design series for each satellite program
   once the program is funded and provide this information to the AF-AVDO. This shall be
   completed within 180 days of the satellite program being funded and must be in place prior
   to the AF taking possession of the first satellite in this program.
   8.6.2. The Program Office will establish an official serial number for each satellite delivered
   to the AF and provide this information to the AF-AVDO when the AF takes possession of
   each satellite.
   8.6.3. The Program Office must send the first page of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection
   and Receiving Report or WAWF RR and a launch confirmation memo (if acceptance is at the
   time of launch) to the AF-AVDO. The AF-AVDO will use these documents to enter the
   satellite's existence information into REMIS.
       8.6.3.1. The launch date will be used as the placed in service date for all satellites in
       orbit. The DD Form 250 or WAWF RR date will be used for all satellites accepted by
       the AF and held in storage.
       8.6.3.2. The Program Office will enter the total cost of the satellite (including all launch
       costs) within 5 workdays of the satellite entry being established by the AF-AVDO.
       8.6.3.3. If an AF owned satellite (originally in storage) is put in orbit, the Program Office
       will enter a single modification entry in REMIS against that satellite with the cost of
       making the satellite functional plus the launch cost. The Program Office will use the
       launch date as the date of that modification.
   8.6.4. The Program Office will identify a primary and alternate CFO focal point. These
   individuals will be responsible for reviewing CFO information in REMIS, submitting any
   corrections and attesting to the information in REMIS as required.
   8.6.5. Gain and Loss Criteria. The AF gains a satellite (in REMIS) when it takes possession
   of it (normally at the time of launch) even if the constellation is incomplete. The AF will
   lose a satellite (in REMIS) when the satellite's operation transfers to an organization outside
   of the AF or the satellite becomes non-operational (terminated). All satellites will be
   accounted for as long as they are assigned to an Air Force activity under Air Force
   operational control.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                                   79


   8.6.6. Validation Documents. The Program Office will maintain documents that will
   support the existence of all of their satellites, as well as, the CFO reporting data elements
   (full cost and useful life) of each satellite for as long as the specific satellite program exists.
8.7. Status Reporting. Follow the instructions for TRIC COX, Screen 996, Program NFSJR0
and TRIC EUC, Screen 997, Program NFSJQ0, in Air Force Computer Systems Manual 21-560,
Volume 2. Use local time (24-hour clock) for start and stop times.
8.8. Organization Record.
   8.8.1. The IMDS system identifies an organization by number, kind, type, and detachment
   number. There are two organizational fields; IMDS organization and AFI 21-103.
       8.8.1.1. The AFI 21-103 organization is used for up channel reporting to REMIS of
       status and inventory and follows the "G" Series Special Orders. Notify MAJCOM or
       FOA DBA before making the change.
       8.8.1.2. The IMDS organization is used for local identification. In most cases the IMDS
       and AFI 21-103 organization should be the same.
   8.8.2. Assign a 4 digit organizational identification (ORG ID) only to actual units,
   detachments, and OLs. Report the equipment and missions at unmanned sites and locations
   under the organization that has maintenance responsibility. To change the organization
   record the inventory will be lost and regained.
       8.8.2.1. The first two positions of the ORG ID are the 2 digit command code which is up
       channel reported to REMIS as a 3 digit command code.
       8.8.2.2. The last two positions of the ORG ID are "00" for the basic (parent) unit; for
       example, use "1C00".
       8.8.2.3. For detachments or operating locations (OL), the last two positions of the ORG
       ID are the detachment number or operating location letter. For example, for Detachment
       2, use "1C02"; for OL "A" use "1C0A".
       8.8.2.4. For an OL of a detachment, use the detachment and the OL letter; for example,
       "1C2A".
8.9. Organization Changes.
   8.9.1. The MAJCOMs or FOAs will make organization changes in REMIS prior to any AFI
   21-103 organization change made in IMDS to avoid up channel reporting errors in IMDS

      AEROSPACE VEHICLE AND MISSILE EQUIPMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
                             PROGRAM

Section 9A—General Information

9.1. Aerospace Vehicle and Missile Equipment Accountability Program. The reporting
requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance with paragraph 2.11.10. of
AFI 33-324.
   9.1.1. The Air Force maintains a program for MAJCOM Headquarters and their units to
   manage and control aerospace vehicle and missile assets (those assets listed in the -21
   Technical Order [TO]).
   9.1.2. The owning MAJCOM Headquarters manages these assets.
   9.1.3. The unit inspects, maintains, and controls these assets.
   9.1.4. Lead Commands may supplement this instruction in order to provide guidance to the
   units on how to meet command requirements.
9.2. Need for Management and Control Procedures.
   9.2.1. The management and control procedures in this instruction allow Lead Commands
   and Air Logistics Center Program Offices to control -21 items. Lead Commands and Air
   Logistics Center Program Offices need this control to meet normal peacetime operations and
   to make sure the Air Force can meet contingency plan reallocations from home to overseas.
   9.2.2. Lead Commands and Air Logistics Center Program Offices will be aware of the total -
   21 TO inventories to better plan for replacement items and to plan intra-command and inter-
   command transfers of items.
   9.2.3. Lead Commands will ensure that base level units account for -21 TO items to meet
   daily peacetime, war, and mobilization plan requirements.
   9.2.3. (AFRC) All units must maintain enough Aerospace Vehicle Equipment to satisfy all
   requirements in their DOC statement.
9.3. Aerospace Vehicle and Missile Equipment Inventory.
   9.3.1. The -21 TO lists all items authorized for each aerospace vehicle or missile mission,
   design, and series (MDS). The manufacturer prepares the -21 TO and reviews or changes it
   as equipment is modified.
   9.3.2. Do not change the -21 TO without MAJCOM and AFMC Program Manager approval.
       9.3.2.1. The -21 TO is divided into three sections covering the three categories of
       equipment:
       9.3.2.2. Section I, Maintenance Safety and Protection Equipment (MSPE) used to protect
       the aerospace vehicle or missile from damage and/or to make it safe for maintenance.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                             81


      9.3.2.3. Section II, Alternate Mission Equipment (AME), used to configure an aerospace
      vehicle or missile for one of its operational missions. It can be installed and removed
      quickly.
      9.3.2.4. Section III, Crew and Passenger Support Equipment (CPSE), used for life
      support and comfort of crew and passengers.
   9.3.3. At unit level, automated products usually control inventories, divided into custody
   accounts. To build these accounts add selected items listed in the -21 TO and command
   supplements into Allowance Standards (AS).
      9.3.3.1. (Added-AFRC) The C-40 does not have a -21 technical order. The 932 AW
      manages and controls aerospace vehicle assets using local inventory control procedures
      and the AF Form 2692 Aerospace Vehicle/Missile Equipment Transfer/Shipping Listing.
   9.3.4. Use manual records (AF Form 2691, Aircraft/Missile Equipment Property Record) for
   some items, such as communications security (COMSEC) equipment, prototypes, or
   specialized equipment too few in number to be listed in automated products (See
   Attachment 7).
      9.3.4.1. (Added-AFRC) -(MAF Units) Use AF Form 4076, Aircraft Dash 21
      Equipment Inventory, to reflect specific aerospace vehicle configurations and identify -21
      equipment installed on the aerospace vehicle. This form provides the means to control
      and reconcile onboard quantities of -21 equipment for aerospace vehicles during off-
      station missions. An automated AF Form 4076 is authorized. The AF Form 4076, or AF
      Form 2692 (transfers) will be used for aerospace vehicles on OCONUS missions (except
      for C-40 aircraft), or when aerospace vehicles are to be chopped or deployed with
      aerospace vehicles from other units. Maintenance personnel will inventory -21 equipment
      loaded on the respective aerospace vehicle and reconcile any differences with the on-site
      maintenance supporting unit prior to the aerospace vehicle returning to home station.
   9.3.5. Squadron Commanders of units that need COMSEC materials will ensure that a
   COMSEC Responsible Officer (CRO) is appointed IAW AFI 33-201 Volume 2,
   Communications Security. Units without sufficient safeguards/storage space within their
   area may maintain or store COMSEC equipment IAW AFI 33-201 Communications Security
   at another approved location until sufficient safeguards/storage space is acquired within the
   squadron. All COMSEC equipment is accountable and units will ensure that the location and
   status of their COMSEC equipment is known at all times.
9.4. Lead Command Supplements to AFI 21-103 regarding -21 TOs.
   9.4.1. Lead Commands may supplement weapons system -21 TO to show items unique to an
   MDS and MAJCOM, such as specialized communications, reconnaissance, weapon delivery,
   and guidance systems.
      9.4.1.1. Coordinate with applicable Lead Commands weapons system managers for
      changes required in -21 technical orders and command peculiar equipment.
      9.4.1.2. Owning Lead Commands account for installed specialized or classified
      equipment.
   9.4.2. Include items (other than standard configuration items) listed on MESLs in the
   MAJCOM supplement to the -21 TO if the items are not in the basic -21 TO.
 82                                                   AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


       9.4.2.1. List standard configuration items that may be removed for alternate missions in
       the Lead Command supplement to the -21 TO as AME. When AME is treated as
       standard configuration items, the number per aerospace vehicle authorized is the largest
       number that can be installed.
       9.4.2.1. (AFRC) -(AFSOC-gained units) will use applicable AFSOC -21 supplemental
       TO guidance (e.g., TO 1C-130A-21/AFSOC SUPPLEMENT 1).
9.5. Equipment not included in -21 TOs. These items are not included in -21 TOs:
   9.5.1. Fixed or installed components are part of the basic aerospace vehicle and needed for
   normal operation.
   9.5.2. Consumable items other than safety items (such as publications, forms, or relief bags).
   9.5.3. Maintenance and servicing equipment in the AS or the -4 TO.
9.6. Asset Categories.
   9.6.1. The -21 TO lists all assets authorized for an aerospace vehicle or missile MDS. Items
   are defined and coded (using expendability, recoverability, and reparability category (ERRC)
   codes) as either:
       9.6.1.1. Equipment.
       9.6.1.2. Reparable items.
       9.6.1.3. Expendable items.
   9.6.2. The MAJCOMs, AFMC Air Logistics Centers or Product Centers, or Defense
   Logistics Agency (DLA) with management responsibility for the item determine its
   definition.
   9.6.3. The management and control method is different for each category of items. Maintain
   accountability files IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 8.
       9.6.3.1. Mark the "Remarks" column to show the management and control method by
       item definition.
   9.6.4. MAJCOMs and AFMC Air Logistics Centers or Product Centers identify items
   managed and controlled as equipment (ERRC NF and ND).
       9.6.4.1. Mark the -21 TO or Lead Command supplement to show which AS lists the
       equipment.
       9.6.4.2. The maintenance activity uses the management and control methods of the Air
       Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS).
       9.6.4.3. The record vehicles are the Custody Account (CA) or Custody Receipt Listing
       (CRL) and AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request.
   9.6.5. MAJCOMs or AFMC Air Logistics Centers or Product Centers identify items
   managed and controlled as reparables (ERRC XD and XF).
       9.6.5.1. Mark the -21 TO to show the maintenance activity will manage the asset as a
       reparable.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               83


      9.6.5.2. The maintenance activity uses the management and control methods of the Air
      Force Recoverable Assembly Management Process (RAMP).
      9.6.5.3. Send a Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) listing
      to the appropriate work center to identify numbers on hand.
      9.6.5.4. The record vehicle is the DD Form 1348-1A, DoD Single Line Item
      Release/Receipt Document, or AF Form 2692, Aircraft/Missile Equipment Transfer,
      Shipping Listing.
      9.6.5.5. Accountable individuals monitor expendable (XB3) assets identified in Sections
      I, II and III of the applicable -21 technical order to ensure on hand quantities are
      sufficient to meet unit needs. Use AF Form 2691 to maintain visibility of these items.
      Maintain one AF Form 2691 for each applicable line item in the -21 technical order.
      Accomplish and document annual inventories by placing the date in Block A and writing
      "INV" in Block E. Adjust quantities and locations accordingly. Units may place selected
      expendable assets on bench stock to serve as spares if consumption data warrants.
      Annotate levels established for bench stock items in Block J. Actual on hand level in
      bench stock need not be updated. Expendable assets placed in bench stock are exchanged
      on a one for one basis. -21 items locally manufactured to replace -21 technical order
      items reference the same line item number as listed in the technical order. Additional
      locally manufactured items maintained, but not listed in the -21 technical order, reference
      local line item numbers, i.e. L-1, L-2, etc. Units develop local procedures to identify all
      locally manufactured items, accountable agency and appropriate line item number.
      Disposal of excess quantities of serviceable armament/munitions -21 assets requires Lead
      Commands approval.
      9.6.5.6. Follow procedures listed in applicable -21 TOs to control, report, and manage air
      launched missile -21 assets.
   9.6.6. MAJCOMs, AFMC Air Logistics Centers or Product Centers or DLA identify items
   managed and controlled as expendables (XB3).
      9.6.6.1. Mark the -21 TO to show the maintenance activity will manage the items as
      expendables.
      9.6.6.2. As a rule, maintenance does not manage or control these items once issued.
      9.6.6.3. Some items defined as expendables may require specific management
      procedures. For example, maintenance will have the right number of cables on hand for
      ejector rack operation. MAJCOMs may choose to manage these items like the end item.
          9.6.6.3.1. Calculate total quantities authorized using quantities listed in applicable -
          21 technical orders multiplied by the number of assigned unit aerospace vehicles.
          Units manage all weapons related -21 equipment using AF Form 2691 and supporting
          documentation. Variances in the authorized versus on hand quantities of armament -
          21 equipment requires Lead Command approval.

9.7. Using Command. Each Lead Command may supplement this instruction or the -21 TO for
assigned weapon systems, or both, or issues separate command instructions. The using
command:
   9.7.1. Appoints an OPR to focus management attention on -21 assets and informs AF-
   AVDO.
   9.7.1. (AFRC) HQ AFRC/A4M (afrc.lgm@us.af.mil) is OPR for -21 management and
   reporting. HQ AFRC/A4O (afrc.a4o@us.af.mil) is OPR for -21 policy and procedures.
   9.7.2. Develops a control system to make sure base level accounting of items is accurate and
   tailored to unique MAJCOM requirements. Authorized -21 levels will not be greater than the
   number of assigned aerospace vehicles without prior MAJCOM and AFMC approval IAW
   paragraph 9.11.
   9.7.2. (AFRC) -(MAF Units) Conditions may occur (e.g., equipment is lost, replaced, and
   then later recovered) that result in overages of assets. These overages can go undetected by
   the -21 item manager until the annual inventory is accomplished (refer to this supplement
   paragraph 9.3.4.2); therefore, -21 equipment sections may have overages during unscheduled
   inspections, audits, and inventories. All -21 sections, or equivalent, may have on hand up to
   10 percent over the total authorized level of ERRC NF, ND, XD, XF and XB3 assets. The
   intent of this overage allowance is to compensate for fluctuations of on-hand equipment
   between inventories. It is not intended to authorize units to arbitrarily increase equipment
   authorizations.
   9.7.3. Reallocates -21 items within the command.
   9.7.4. Coordinates with program and item managers and gaining commands to reallocate -21
   items as part of inter-command aerospace vehicle transfers.
   9.7.5. Identifies the base level organization responsible for overseeing daily asset
   management and control. Armament Flight exercises daily control and management for all
   armament related suspension equipment. Other items listed in paragraph 9.9.2 will be
   managed by other specified organizations.
   9.7.5. (AFRC) Maintenance Group Commander (MXG/CC) assigns responsibility for
   overseeing daily asset management and control.
   9.7.6. Coordinates with subordinate units and other MAJCOM Headquarters to resolve
   equipment shortages according to paragraph 9.14 or to locate equipment removed from
   transient aerospace vehicles according to paragraph 9.15.
   9.7.7. Annually reviews -21 TOs for asset requirements of assigned weapon systems in
   coordination with program and item managers and redistributes or adjusts items as
   appropriate.
   9.7.7. (AFRC) HQ AFRC/A4M weapons systems managers conduct annual reviews of each
   weapon system -21 technical order. Ensures authorizations are adequate to support
   employment roles and identifies changes required in authorizations. In addition, they review
   each unit's -21 asset levels and reallocate assets within AFRC as required. HQ AFRC
   weapons system managers notify HQ AFRC/A4OP for required updates to this supplement.
9.8. AFMC.

   items with (ERRC XF) such as LAU-129 missile launchers will be tracked and controlled
   using the R25 SPRAM listing. Aircraft Maintenance Squadrons will account for and track,
   chaff/flare/ALE-50 magazines and AME items managed under the two level maintenance
   concept. B-1 units (Armament Flights) will account for chaff and flare magazines only
   (ALE-50 is managed by defensive avionics), using the R25 SPRAM listing. SPRAM
   custodians will establish an accounting method in an OI that allows for immediate action
   identification of assets stored or used outside the owning work center. Aircraft Maintenance
   Squadrons will account for all aerospace vehicle travel pods through appropriate equipment
   management documents and serially track all aerospace vehicle travel pods in the applicable
   MIS. Propulsion Flight will account for all engine trailers through appropriate equipment
   management documents and serially track all trailers in the applicable MIS. Fuels Systems
   Section within the Accessories Flight will account for all external fuel tanks to include in-use
   items, spares and WRM through appropriate equipment management documents and serially
   track all external fuel tanks in the applicable MIS.
       9.9.2.1. The R25 SPRAM listing will be the accountability/asset inventory document for
       all repairable coded XD2 assets. XD2 assets are defined as fault isolation spares, shop
       standard spares, training spares, -21 TO spares, alternate mission equipment, test station
       spares, and stand alone spares. The CA/CRL listing is the asset inventory for equipment
       coded assets (ERRC NF/ND). Maintain AF Form 2691 to provide unit visibility over
       XF3 and expendable XB3 assets in sections I, II, and III of applicable aerospace vehicle -
       21 TOs. Units need not maintain an AF Form 2691 for XF3 assets controlled on the R25

       9.9.4.4. (Added-AFRC) -(MAF Units) Equipment Identification. Owning organization
       must clearly mark -21 equipment (using stencils) to inventory and maintain control of
       these assets, and to help identify the owning organization in order to facilitate equipment
       return if removed off station due to mission requirements. Place the stencil in a
       conspicuous location so that it is readily identifiable when installed on the aerospace
       vehicle to preclude from removing or disassembling the item. If equipment is too small to
       be marked (i.e., too small to stencil with black paint or vinyl lettering), mark with a black
       permanent marker or an engraver. If the item is too small for a marker or engraver,
       (example: Tie down rings), then disregard marking it. HQ AMC/A4M (Active Duty and
 88                                                   AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013

AVIONICS POD SYSTEM INVENTORY, STATUS AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 10A—Reporting System Overview

10.1. Description of Pods. Electronic combat pods and other avionics pods are self-contained
systems, designed to be externally carried, and are interchangeable among the general class of
bomber, fighter, interceptor, strike, and reconnaissance aerospace vehicles. Pods are modularly
constructed to provide capabilities specific to aerospace vehicle mission requirements for
training, self-protection against enemy radar controlled weapons threats, airborne threats,
navigational and target illumination, instrumentation, and communications (telemetry and data
link).
10.2. Description of RAMPOD. RAMPOD is an integrated weapons management information
system that collects, reports, and maintains real-time reliability, availability, maintainability,
configuration, warranty, system on-time, inventory, performance, sortie, and engineering
parametric data for externally carried electronic combat pods and other avionics pods. AF/A4L
and SAF/FM have designated RAMPOD as the inventory and financial accountability system for
all AF externally carried pods, including leased pods. Financial reporting to Defense Finance
and Accounting Service (DFAS) for all AF externally carried pods is accomplished via
RAMPOD. The RAMPOD financial module is generally compliant with the Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) Act of 1990, the Chief Information Act of 1996 and the Federal Managers
Integrity Act of 1996. As a result of diverse pod configurations and new technologies,
RAMPOD may track internal mounted pods as directed by MAJCOM or SPO. Also, other
systems may be reported in RAMPOD as directed by MAJCOM or SPO and approved by
AF/A4L in their capacity of Maintenance Systems Portfolio Owner.
10.3. How and What to Report.
   10.3.1. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance
   with paragraph 2.11.3. of AFI 33-324.
   10.3.2. As the accountability system, RAMPOD maintains accountability for all AF
   externally carried pods. RAMPOD will account for pod assets possessed by Air Force, Air
   National Guard, or US Air Force Reserve activities. Accountability begins when DD Form
   250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, or WAWF RR is signed. All pod program
   offices are required to forward a DD Form 250 or WAWF RR to RAMPOD for any new
   pods within 5 workdays of the date title passes to the government. Accountability ends on
   receipt of a termination message and/or DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping
   Document. Deletions of pods from the active inventory or any in-transit actions will be
   reported to RAMPOD within 5 workdays.
   10.3.3. The cost of any improvements (modifications) to pods will be reported in RAMPOD.
   Cost data for modifications or copies of DD Form 250 or WAWF RR will be forwarded to

       INVENTORY AND STATUS REPORTING OF ROCKET SYSTEM LAUNCH
                   PROGRAM (RSLP) ROCKET MOTORS

11.1. Inventory and Status Reporting.
   11.1.1. Reporting includes inventory and status reporting on RSLP System Program Office
   (SPO) owned uninstalled rocket motors at all locations (Depot, contractor facilities), through
   end of life (i.e. launched, disposed/demilled, transferred ownership). Air Force reports
   accountability of RSLP owned uninstalled rocket motors as operating material and supplies
   (OM&S) through the Integrated Missile Database (IMDB). The RSLP SPO assigns an
   IMDB Point of Contact and assumes responsibility for all rocket motors in possession of the
   RSLP program. It is critical that the IMDB Point of Contact annotate ownership, asset
   condition code and location within IMDB in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, the
   IMDB Point of Contact must ensure the IMDB is periodically reconciled to the actual RSLP
   inventory. Specifically, the RSLP IMDB Point of Contract is responsible to:
       11.1.1.1. Update IMDB for movement of rocket motors (i.e. change in physical location,
       receipt from contractor, transfer from other organization, etc.), no later than five working
       days after the event occurs.
       11.1.1.2. Update IMDB for termination of rocket motors (i.e. launch, static fire, Aging
       and Surveillance/motor dissection, etc.), no later than five working days after the action
       occurs.
       11.1.1.3. Coordinate with receiving program office (i.e. OO-ALC AVDO/Point of
       Contact, etc.), prior to transferring ownership of a rocket motor to the other program
       office.
          11.1.1.3.1. Ensure the physical asset is properly reconciled with IMDB (i.e. location
          of the actual asset and IMDB record match), and the operational status is updated in
          IMDB prior to transferring the asset.
          11.1.1.3.2. The gaining Program Office will become responsible for the
          accountability of the rocket motor once the transfer is complete.
       11.1.1.4. Reconcile all movements and terminations of rocket motors to IMDB on a
       monthly basis.
       11.1.1.5. Reconcile ownership and asset condition codes to IMDB on a quarterly basis.
       11.1.1.6. Complete physical accountability (i.e. actual assets to IMDB information and
       IMDB information to actual assets) of all rocket motors must be conducted annually
       (Date of report will be 31 August with 30 days to inventory and reconcile reports).
          11.1.1.6.1. Financial information is maintained in IMDB. The RSLP Program Office
          is responsible for establishing and maintaining the CFO reporting data elements (full
          cost and useful life) of each rocket motor (See Section 11.5).
          11.1.1.6.2. Valuation of all rocket motors must be reconciled at least annually.
11.2. Possession Reporting.
AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013                                                               101


   11.2.1. Possession is the actual RSLP SPO acceptance or designation of responsibility for
   the rocket motor. When the SPO takes possession of the rocket motor, the IMDB Point of
   Contact starts reporting according to this instruction and applicable systems instructions.
   RSLP shall use the DD Form 1149 Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, as the
   documentation for receipt or transfer of assets.
      11.2.1.1. Rocket motor technicians, storage facility, and motor maintenance personnel
      will provide confirmation notification to the Transportation Management Specialist (to
      update IMDB) on all RSLP asset relocations. The Transportation Management Specialist
      will notify the RSLP program office of the relocation. RSLP Program Office will
      perform semi-annual reconciliation of its assets located at storage facilities, contractor
      facilities, and depot locations.
      11.2.1.2. Possession terminates when the RSLP asset is destroyed (demilled, launched,
      destructive Aging/Surveillance testing), or is transferred to another responsible
      organization. Terminate the RSLP asset in IMDB which will cease reporting if the asset
      has permanently transferred to non-Air Force activities.         However, maintain
      documentation in IMDB showing the rocket motor history and associated transfer
      actions.
11.3. Notification, Termination, and Relocation Procedures.
   11.3.1. Accurate reporting of possession changes is essential in order for the Air Force to
   accurately account for the location and use of the RSLP assets. RLSP SPO ensure personnel
   maintain, correct, and report all data using the procedures in AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle
   Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination and this instruction.
      11.3.1.1. The IMDB Point of Contact shall notify the Transportation Management
      Specialist of a location change of an RSLP asset when depot does not provide the means
      of transportation/handling.
      11.3.1.2. Change in Asset Condition Code.              The designated individual of the
      organization changing the condition code (i.e. serviceable, unserviceable, or obsolete) of
      the RSLP asset must send a priority asset condition code change message to the RSLP
      program office. IMDB Point of Contact shall notify the Transportation Management
      Specialist, via E-mail, to update current asset status not later than five working days after
      the change.
   11.3.2. Termination Message, RSLP Asset Termination Report. The unit or depot where the
   RSLP asset was destroyed or sent to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition must send
   a priority termination E-mail message not later than five working days after the action has
   occurred. RSLP shall provide a signed termination letter or equivalent containing how,
   when, where, serial number and the date the asset was destroyed. IMDB RSLP Point of
   Contact shall upload the termination letter into IMDB, attach it to subject asset, and notify
   the Transportation Management Specialist to update current asset status in IMDB.
   11.3.3. Relocation Message, RSLP Asset Location Change Report. The designated
   individual of the organization relocating RSLP assets must send a priority relocation message
   to the RSLP program office not later than five working days after the asset's location
   changed. When a relocation message is received by RSLP, the IMDB Point of Contact shall
 102                                                  AFI21-103_AFRCSUP_I 18 JUNE 2013


   notify the Transportation Management Specialist to update current asset status in IMDB and
   validate that the change has occurred.
11.4. Training Devices, Inert Rocket Motors, and Static Displays.
   11.4.1. For accountability purposes, inert rocket motors, rocket motor fired cases, static
   displays, and GTMs will be tracked in IMDB but will not be included on directed rocket
   motor inventories. Terminate the rocket motor and cease reporting if the asset has
   permanently transferred to non-Air Force activities that may include but are not limited to:
       11.4.1.1. NMUSAF Programs.
       11.4.1.2. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition.
11.5. RSLP Asset Valuation.
   11.5.1. The RSLP SPO is responsible for establishing the value of uninstalled RSLP owned
   rocket motors. This value is normally derived from the original weapon system CFO
   reporting data elements (full cost and useful life) however, in the absence of this information
   (for the older weapon systems), the cost may be derived from other means. For example,
   retired ICBM weapon system booster costs established by the ICBM SPO.
   11.5.2. A copy of the documentation supporting the CFO reporting data elements (full cost
   and useful life) should be maintained with the Weapon System Program Manager for the life
   of the weapon system plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the
   program office must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site
   (other than the location of the Weapon System Program Managers).

                AIRCRAFT AVAILABILITY STANDARD CALCULATION

NOTE: MAJCOMs will use the following equation to calculate Aircraft Availability Standard.
(Equation 1 N/A to MAF. For MAF units, MCRS requirement = Operational Requirement (OR).


Equation 1 - Operational Requirement Equation

The following is a list of terms and their definitions:


Sorties/Missions required by Ops (contingency and training) – (So), (St) number of sorties
established by A3 needed to complete all aircrew contingency (So) and training (St) mission
requirements for a given time period. Sortie requirements may also be alternatively calculated by
dividing given Flying Hours (FH) by the established Programmed Average Sortie Duration
(ASD).

Flying Hours (contingency and training) – (FHo), (FHt) number of hours, established by A3,
needed to complete all aircrew contingency and training mission requirements for a given time
period.

Programmed Average Sortie Duration (contingency and training) – (ASDo), (ASDt) average
number of expected flying hours consumed during each contingency and training sortie.

Days Available to Fly (operational/contingency and training) – (Fdo), (Fdt) number of days
available during the FY to execute the flying training mission.

Turn Rate – (Tu) calculated by dividing the total number of flying sorties for a given flying
period by the number of "first go" lines on the flying schedule.

Attrition Rate – (a) expected rate of mission losses for a given year, expressed as a percentage of
total flying hours/sorties.

Ground Schedule Requirement – (G) number of aircraft required for executing any ground
training or static mission requirements (i.e. firefighter, maintenance, weapons load training or
static displays).

Spare Requirement – (S) number of aircraft required by wing level or higher plans to provide
backup to the schedule mission lines for the flying window.

Alert Requirement – (A) number of aircraft required to meet any mission alerts.

ARC Requirement – (R) number of aircraft to meet the mission requirements of reserve/guard
units, who fly active unit possessed aircraft.

Aircraft Tail Requirement – (ATo), (ATt) number of individual aircraft needed to complete all
aircrew contingency and training mission requirements. If this variable is used in place of sorties
or flying hours, the Days Available to Fly variable is set to 1 day.


The resulting AA standard would be:

Equation 2 - Aircraft Availability Requirement Equation

The OR equation is primarily derived using projected sorties (missions). Flying hours can also
be used if that is the data projected by the applicable unit. The projected flying hours are
converted into projected sorties by dividing by programmed average sortie duration as seen in
Equation 3 below. This is done for both projected operational and training hours.



                        Equation 3 - Flying Hour to Sortie Conversion

The distribution of the variables So and St can vary depending on the forecasted operational
requirements for the given time period. Maximum or Peak AA requirements can be determined
calculating the maximum number for So and St as defined by the A3 community.
