SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Title of publication was
changed from Management of Personal Wireless Communication Systems (PWCS) to Management of
Cellular Telephone/Smartphone Devices. Removed Attachment 2, Customer Briefing and Accountabil-
ity Receipt and Attachment 3, Cellular Telephone Justification for Dobbins ARB. Added the term smart-
phone to describe devices connected to the network. Updated references in Attachment 1, Glossary of
References and Supporting Information.


1. Cellular Telephone/Smartphone (CT) Use Policy.
   1.1. Acquisition of new CT devices. The use of cellular phones is restricted to commanders, vice
   commanders, deputy commanders, key and/or standby personnel who require communications of an
   immediate nature that cannot be satisfied through the use of pagers or LMRs. CTs will not be used for
   command and control. Commanders, division chiefs, and organizational management are responsible
2                                                                       94AWI33-106 1 AUGUST 2006


    for ensuring oversight of CT assets, and periodic checks of CT management. CTs are to be used for
    administrative purposes only. The contracting office will not establish CT service policy without 94
    CF coordination.
    1.2. Air Force provided CTs are to be used for official and authorized purposes. Personnel are autho-
    rized to use CTs to make short infrequent personal calls when appropriate under the circumstances.
    Examples of appropriate calls include notifying family members of changes in schedules, checking on
    medical, school, or childcare appointments, and inquiring as to car repair status. Emergency calls are
    always authorized. Examples of inappropriate calls include obscene or harassing calls, calls for com-
    mercial gain, or personal calls that generate more than minimal charges to the government.
    1.3. Use a regular (corded land line) telephone as a first priority when and where available.
    1.4. Telephone Monitoring and Recording.
       1.4.1. The Air Force uses unsecured telecommunications systems such as telephones, CTs, radios,
       facsimile, pagers, computer networks and other wired or wireless electronic devices to conduct
       day-to-day official business. Adversaries can easily monitor unsecured systems that could provide
       information on military capabilities, limitations, intentions and activities. See AFI 33-219 for fur-
       ther information.
       1.4.2. When a CT is issued, personnel are required to sign the attached form (See Attachment 2)
       that includes the following notice and consent statement: “Do not transmit classified informa-
       tion over unsecured telecommunications systems. Official DoD telecommunications systems
       are subject to monitoring. Using this telecommunications system or device constitutes con-
       sent to monitoring.” The signed forms will be retained by the 94 CF/SCXR office issuing the
       device until 6 months after the device is returned. Every CT will have a DD Form 2056 (miniature
       version) attached. These forms can be obtained from the Base TCO or unit appointed TCO.
    1.5. Each Unit TCO will validate their unit’s itemized CT bill(s) monthly. These validations will be
    performed in accordance with paragraph 4. below prior to the GPC holder paying the CT bill(s).

2. Requesting Cellular Telephone Services:
    2.1. All CT requests must be submitted with complete justification and appropriate documentation in
    advance of purchase.
    2.2. CT requests are made by completing an AF IMT 3215, IT/NSS Requirements Document. The
    AF IMT 3215 must document the communications requirement, not the specific need for a CT. The
    request must provide sufficient justification as to why a mobile communications asset is needed. The
    AF IMT 3215 must be signed by the Unit Commander in the requester approval authority block and
    coordinated through appropriate Group Commander or appropriate division chief. All AF IMT 3215
    requests without a unit commander signature will be returned to the originating organization without
    action. All initial smartphone (Blackberry, TREO, etc.) requests will be approved by the 94 AW Com-
    mander as Host Base Approval Authority. All initial requests for standard CT’s will be approved by
    the Group Commanders as the Host Base Approval Authority. AF IMT 3215s will be submitted to 94
    CF/SCXA, Communications & Information Contractor. The 94 CF will process the AF IMT 3215 and
    will contact the customer upon finalization action (approval or disapproval), technical solution and
    costing. Requirement disapprovals can be appealed to the 94 AW Commander by routing the original
    AF IMT 3215 and the disapproval documentation through the 94 CF/CC, the appropriate Group com-
94AWI33-106 1 AUGUST 2006                                                                                3


   mander or division chief to the 94 AW Commander. A copy of the original AF IMT 3215 CT request
   must be kept on file by the unit TCO until the phone is upgraded or turned in.
   2.3. Before requesting a CT, ensure operational security (OPSEC) considerations are identified and
   considered.
       2.3.1. If the using organization identifies a functional requirement to communicate sensitive
       unclassified or classified information, a completed operations security (OPSEC) analysis docu-
       ment and certification of risk acceptability (see AFI 10-701, Operations Security) must accom-
       pany the original Requirements Document.
           2.3.1.1. If OPSEC determination is disputed, the issue will be elevated to 94 MSG/CC.
       2.3.2. The CSO will review the completed package and will recommend whether the requiring
       commander should accept the risk and fund the requirement.
   2.4. The AF IMT 3215 is also used to upgrade or terminate a CT account. The AF IMT 3215 does not
   need to be signed by the unit CC in this case; however, it must be signed by the Unit TCO for the
   requestor and submitted to 94 CF/SCXA. Any CT upgrades to the original AF IMT 3215 CT request
   must also be kept on file. A smartphone upgrade request can be approved at the group commander
   level as the Host Base Approval Authority.
   2.5. When a CT account is terminated, the old CTs will be turned in to 94 CF/SCMR for possible
   reutilization or proper disposal to DRMO. Presently, the only accepted disposal option for assets with
   memory capability, such as the smartphones, is destruction. If a smartphone is turned in, a destruction
   report will be provided to the losing unit for historical records and kept on file for a minimum of 3
   years after turn in or destruction.
   2.6. Use of personally owned or contractor owned smartphones for the processing of official business
   within the 94 AW is prohibited. The synchronization of personally/contractor owned smartphones
   using any wired or wireless method with government purchased PCs or workstations is prohibited.
   There is currently no method to sanitize smartphones in the event of accidental download of classified
   information. Inability to sanitize could necessitate the destruction of personal/contractor property. If
   individuals have a requirement to use a smartphone on the Air Force network, they must request issu-
   ance of a government-owned device.

3. Billing for Unofficial Calls.
   3.1. All personal calls, as described under paragraph 1.2., made on government CT that cause the CT
   bill to exceed the established monthly-allotted usage charge will be reimbursed by the user.
   3.2. Unit TCOs will be responsible for monitoring CT bills to determine if toll charges for unofficial
   calls are being incurred. Identified users will be directed to take appropriate action to reimburse the
   government.
   3.3. AFI 33-111, explains how to recover unofficial call costs. The TCO reviews all telephone data
   and informs the 94 CF/SC, and the unit’s resource advisor when there is abuse. Unit resource advisors
   will be responsible for collection of unauthorized CT usage fees via a DD Form 1131.

4. Monthly Requirements.
4                                                                        94AWI33-106 1 AUGUST 2006


    4.1. A monthly validation of CT bills must be performed prior to payment of the bill. The monthly
    validation process is initiated by the Base TCO by sending a CT validation letter to unit TCOs with
    CT accounts (see Attachment 3). This monthly validation requires the unit TCO and Government
    Purchase Card (GPC) holder check the CT bill(s) to ensure billing plans are adequate to cover
    monthly plan, no tax is being charged, no insurance charges are being made, and to determine if unof-
    ficial call costs are being incurred. Upon validation of the bill, the unit TCO will sign their name and
    date under the stamped or written words, “VALIDATED BY”, on the very first page of the bill to sig-
    nify validation. The CT validation letter will then be signed and returned to the Base TCO (94CF/
    SCMT) within 15 days of receipt of the bill. If abuse is detected by the unit TCO, the Base TCO
    should be notified immediately. The Base TCO will provide the unit TCO with the appropriate
    action(s) to be taken. Unit TCOs will maintain a copy of this CT monthly verification letter for at least
    3 years. Any CT additions or deletions will also be annotated on the unit TCO’s CT inventory sheet
    and a new updated copy will be sent back with the monthly validation letter to the Base TCO. The
    Base TCO will maintain these validations for each unit for a minimum of 3 years. In addition, unit
    TCOs will monitor option fees and taxes to identify internet/e-mail activation and prevent unneces-
    sary charges on the CT bill.

5. Annual Requirements.
    5.1. The Base TCO will send an annual AF IMT 3131, General Purpose to each Unit TCO (see
    Attachment 4 ) for revalidation of CT’s. This spreadsheet will be utilized to inventory and validate all
    CT’s within the unit. The unit TCO will send the completed revalidation spreadsheet back to the Base
    TCO for compilation of the base’s complete wireless communication inventory. Units failing to meet
    the inventory deadline will be denied new work orders until the inventories are submitted. The Base
    TCO will maintain the base-wide wireless communication inventory file.
    5.2. IMT’s Adopted. DD Form 2056, Telephone Monitoring Notification Decal
    5.3. IMT’s Prescribed. AF IMT 3131, General Purpose and AF IMT 3215, IT/NSS Requirements

                        CELLULAR TELEPHONE (CT) USER AGREEMENT
1. The using organization is billed for each individual CT number. Our service providers, Nextel, AT&T,
Cingular, and Verizon bill Dobbins ARB at a government rate; personal calls should be kept to an abso-
lute minimum, and should not overrun plan minutes even if you are willing to reimburse the government.
A regular telephone (corded land line) shall be used as a first priority when and where available. Bills are
reviewed carefully for unofficial or questionable charges. You will be asked to validate to your unit
Telephone Control Officer that all CT charges to your number were for official purposes or for
appropriate personal calls of short duration.
2. CTs are not to be used for operational communications, i.e., those which may be considered sensitive
or For Official Use Only. The weak CT signal is susceptible to jamming, intrusion, interference and mon-
itoring.
3. All Smartphones must be password protected.
4. I will register my Smartphone with my local equipment custodian for local accountability.
5. I understand that the process for sanitizing sensitive and classified information from the Smartphone
may result in its destruction.
6. As required by AFI 33-219, Atch 3, I have read and understand the following consent to telecommuni-
cations monitoring.
