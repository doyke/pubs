                           C-130J DEBRIEFING CHECKLIST

                                      INTRODUCTION
The C-130J debrief will be conducted using the Removable Memory Module (RMM) card and
Ground Maintenance System (GMS) station in accordance with instructions contained in section
three of T.O. 31S5-4-6197-1 and this checklist. (NOTE: Aircrew are required to remain in
debrief section until the GMS download is complete in order to validate Nuisance Faults
that are/are not revealed on the GMS download.) This debriefing checklist will be used by
the maintenance debriefer in conjunction with T.O. 1C-130J-2-00FR-00-1, 1C-130J-2-00FR-00-
2 and 1C-130J-2-00FR-00-3 to ensure all pertinent information on each system malfunction is
included on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Use of
AMC IMT 278, Debriefing and Recovery Planis mandatory when MIS is unavailable or not used
(See AFI). The checklist is not intended to replace systems knowledge or common sense.
Debrief personnel are charged with the responsibility of questioning the aircrew to make sure
that all symptoms of a malfunction are known and recorded on the AFTO Form 781A.
Remember, this is the only information the technician will have to determine the source of the
problem.

Forward recommended changes to this form through channels to HQ AMC/A4M.
I. Instructions: Prior to debriefing:

       A. The debriefing team members will review past debriefing forms, logs, or files
       to acquaint themselves with any previous repeat/recurring discrepancies.

       B. The appropriate maintenance specialty should be represented at the debriefing
       to help clarify discrepancies.

II. Debriefing Procedures.

       A. The debriefing team leader will take charge of the debriefing and debrief the
          aircrew, utilizing this checklist as a guide.

       B. Review all AFTO Form 781A for the mission(s). Make special note of
          repeated, recurring or discrepancies which may cause aircraft impoundment.

       C. Debrief all discrepancies as clearly as possible.

       D. Check adequacy of corrective action on all cleared discrepancies. If necessary
          consult with the on-duty Production Superintendent and Specialist to validate
          questionable corrective actions. This is the responsibility of the SMO
          Maintenance Superintendent, Production Superintendent, Expeditor, and Lead
          Technicians.

       E. Determine if aircraft was flown low level over salt water and act as necessary
          to comply with T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapon System Cleaning and
          Corrosion Control.

       F. Ensure ALL locations where the aircraft stopped and was chemically
          disinfected for Foot and Mouth Disease, and that an entry is made in the
          781A’s. Debriefers will document this information in G081, using screen
          9051, with work unit code 02400 to create the Foot and Mouth
          Decontamination discrepancy; G081 will automatically enter this information
          in the aircraft history. Report this information to HQ AMC/A4MJS
          DSN 779-2622 / Commercial 618-229-2622. Due to the potentially damaging
          long term effects of the decontamination on sensitive aircraft parts, accurate
          tracking is essential.

       G. Using GMS download and
          T.O.’s 1C-130J-2-00FR-00-1, 1C-130J-2-00FR-00-2
   and 1C-130J-2-00FR-00-3, ensure all open descriptions of the discrepancies
   are as complete and comprehensive as possible prior to MIS input. (NOTE:
   Aircrew must remain in debrief section until the download is complete in
   order to validate Nuisance Faults that are/are not revealed on the GMS
   download.)

I. Determine if aircraft was flown through predicted areas of low volcanic ash, an
   entry is made in the 781A’s. Debriefers will document this information in
   GO81 using screen XXXX, with work unit code XXXX to create the
   volcanic ash discrepancy; G081 will automatically enter this information in
   the aircraft history.
