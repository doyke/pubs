SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. OPR updated,
paragraphs 1 and 2 revised; paragraph 3 added, and attachments added.

1. GENERAL. 81 TRW/PA is responsible for three electronic marquees. Rotating messages
are posted on all marquees on a daily basis. The 81 TRW commander reserves the right to limit
or curtail routine messages on any of the marquees for mission-essential information or
distinguished visitor welcomes. Two of the marquees are double-sided, making a total of five
areas of display:

1.1. Gate 1E (inbound) and Gate 1W(outbound) are located at the Meadows gate entry/exit.

1.2. Gate 3 marquee is located at the main gate.

1.3. Gate 7E (inbound) and Gate 7N (outbound) are located at the Pass Rd gate entry/exit.

2. PURPOSE. The purpose of the base marquee is to serve, first and foremost, as an official
avenue of disseminating mission-essential information from Keesler leaders to the base working
2                                                 Keesler AFB Instruction 34-101   19 April 2004


and resident population. A secondary purpose is to provide Keesler personnel with information
on events that are pertinent to the majority of the base.

3. PROCEDURES. Message(s) displayed on the marquee is limited to one screen for it to be
viewed in its entirety by passersby, and to allow more messages to be displayed and read on the
same day. The marquee manager will determine if a message must be expanded to two message
boards to ensure understanding of the message. Two-board messages will be the exception and
not the norm.

3.1. Scheduling the Electronic Marquee.

3.1.1. Other than for command-directed mission-essential information and DV welcomes, the
81st Training Wing Public Affairs Office is the primary user of the marquee. Units/organizations
requesting to have information posted on the marquee will complete the marquee request
(Attachment 2) or email marquee@keesler.af.mil.

3.1.2. Requests must be legible. Illegible requests will not be accepted. Information will not be
taken over the phone.

3.1.3. Requests can be sent by e-mail to marquee@keesler.af.mil, dropped off at building 2816,
81 TRW Headquarters, room 106; or faxed to 7-3940.

3.1.4. Requests must arrive at Public Affairs no later than two duty days prior to the desired
posting date.

3.1.5. Each message is limited to four lines of 13 characters including spaces per line (see
Attachment 2).

3.2. Marquee Prohibitions.

3.2.1. The marquee will not be used for items or services for sale, except for wing-level
organizational clubs (e.g., 81 TRW Top Three) special events and other based-sanctioned
fundraisers, such as the Air Force Assistance Fund and Combined Federal Campaign.

3.2.2. Commercial advertisements for events not sponsored by the 81st Mission Support Group
Services Division will not be accepted.

3.2.3. Political messages will not be accepted.

3.2.4. Retirement messages will be accepted for personnel in the grades of colonel or above for
officers and chief master sergeant for enlisted.

3.3. Marquee Posting Procedures. Upon receipt of a marquee request the marquee manager
will use the following procedures:
Keesler AFB Instruction 34-101     19 April 2004                                             3


3.3.1. The Marquee Manager will log all requests into a marquee book located in the main PA
office administrative section on a daily basis.

3.3.2. Unless otherwise specified messages will be posted to begin around 0700 for the
following day and not exceed more than three days.

3.3.3. Messages will be on a rotational display, not to exceed more than eight messages daily,
with each message displayed for 1.5 seconds, longer if needed, before changing to the next
message. Priority messages may be displayed more than three days.

3.3.4. Messages may include the name of the event, date, time, place and applicable telephone
numbers. Use uppercase primarily for acronyms and general officer names.

3.3.5. The marquee manager may edit, cut and prioritize messages according to mission
requirements. Regularly scheduled services-type messages may be replaced by those designated
as priority, especially during 0700 and 0900 and 1500 to 1700 hrs.

3.3.6. 81 TRW Protocol may request that a welcome message be temporarily frozen for
appropriate distinguished visitors. During the freeze no other messages will be displayed.

3.3.7. Energy, security and safety messages may be used during the observation periods and as
filler information when there are few other messages scheduled.

3.3.8. Before the marquee messages are transmitted, they should be reviewed for accuracy and
spelling errors.

3.4. Marquee Maintenance Agreements. All agreements hereunder are subject to change
during the annual review of this document.

3.4.1. The Marquee Manager is responsible for the data entry, operation, routine maintenance,
and initial troubleshooting of the marquee systems.

3.4.2. The 81 TRW lead working group manager (WGM) or Public Affairs WGM will provide
additional technical support to the Marquee Manager.

3.4.3. The 81st Communications Squadron (CS), 7-0066, will ensure the signs have network
connectivity and will provide additional technical assistance when requested by the 81 TRW lead
WGM.
