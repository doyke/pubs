This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. It applies
to all HC-130N/P ACC units. This Addendum applies to Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Maintain records created as a result of prescribed pro-
cesses in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the
AF Records Disposition Schedule found at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting record manag-
ers as required for approval. Send recommended changes or comments on AF Form 847, Recommenda-
tion for Change of Publication, to HQ ACC/A4Y, 130 Douglas St., Suite B-210, Langley AFB VA

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground work for
reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that
must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test, or other mis-
sions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of Resources and Training Systems
reporting only and denotes Mission Capable aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mis-
sion in accordance with Commander Air Combat Command (COMACC) OMNIBUS Plan.
   1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded mis-
   sion systems such as suspension equipment.
   1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully Mission
   Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission
   Capable aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and generated to
   MRA status at an employment site.
   1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major Command
   (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another MAJCOM

    theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource the differences in support/mission
    equipment.

2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit code (WUC)
against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL) across the page. Each
unit’s Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns. The air-
craft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft; therefore, it is important to compare only those col-
umns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit’s assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC
(wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related
to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
only the FSL and TNG columns, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status
using only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported
using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
