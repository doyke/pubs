                                            Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. Scope. This Air National Guard Instruction (ANGI) outlines the basic guidance for
     training BCC unit intelligence personnel. With the complementary references cited, this
     publication prescribes procedures to attain and maintain the qualifications and currencies to
     support BCC unit operations. These training requirements are the minimum and can be
     supplemented by additional unit-level written guidance. Unit-level written guidance may
     expand upon these basic procedures, but in no case will it be less restrictive.
     1.1.2. References. The primary references for BCC intelligence operations are ANGI 14-
     2BCC, Volume 2, BCC Intelligence Evaluation Criteria, ANGI 14-2BCC, Volume 3, BCC
     Unit Intelligence Procedures, AFI 13-1BCC, Volume 1, Battle Control Center (BCC)
     Training, AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide, Threat Reference Guide and Countertactics Manual, and
     this instruction.
1.2. Waivers. NGB/A2 is the waiver authority for this publication. Submit waivers to NGB/A2.
NGB/A2 will courtesy copy AF/A2DFM and NGB/A3YG on all waiver correspondence.
     1.2.1. Coordinate T-1 compliance waivers with lead commands to ensure awareness of
     training issues faced by other MAJCOMs in order to make informed programmatic decisions.
     See AFI 33-360 for details on compliance waiver requirements.
1.3. Internal Training. Internal intelligence training is a venue intended to facilitate achieving
and maintaining currency status for all intelligence personnel. Training received during internal
training is achieved via skills practice/demonstration during exercises or special events, group
academics or as otherwise devised by the Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO). The internal
intelligence training plan will include all identified training requirements for the training cycle.
(T-2)
1.4. Qualification Training. Qualification training programs are designed to progress
intelligence personnel from Initial Qualification Training (IQT) through Mission Qualification
Training (MQT) to qualify them to perform duty position tasks and achieve Combat Mission
Ready (CMR) status. Continuation Training (CT) ensures individuals maintain proficiency and
currency. ST qualifies individuals to perform specialized functions. Qualification training
can/should be conducted in conjunction with skill-level upgrade training. For a detailed
explanation of IQT, MQT, CT and Specialized Training (ST), refer to AFI 14-202, Volume 1
and the ensuing chapters of this instruction.
     1.4.1. Qualification Status. Intelligence personnel must be CMR to support real world
     operations. (T-1)
        1.4.1.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR). The status of intelligence personnel who have
        satisfactorily completed Qualification Training (QT) and maintain qualification and
        currency in the mission qualification tasks and knowledge outlined in this instruction.
ANGI14-2_BCCV1 4 DECEMBER 2014                                                            5


      1.4.1.2. To attain CMR, an individual must complete a written qualification exam based
      on the specific BCC master question file (MQF), complete a unit specific cell-level
      qualification, and gain approval of the SIO. (T-2)
      1.4.1.3. CMR personnel must maintain currencies by completing designated tasks within
      the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 5, Table 5.1 for currency requirements.
      1.4.1.4. Regression. The SIO may direct an intelligence crewmember to regress to non-
      CMR (NCMR) status for not meeting currency requirements throughout the training
      cycle. While NCMR, the individual may support real-world operations only through the
      performance of those individual tasks in which they are current and certified. As with
      Basic Qualification (BQ) status, NCMR status is temporary and will not be used to
      circumvent CMR requirements.
1.5. Documentation. The trainee’s performance and progress through each MQT and ST
training item will be documented on the AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet.
 6                                                      ANGI14-2_BCCV1 4 DECEMBER 2014

                                            Chapter 3

                          IQT/MQT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General. This chapter outlines initial qualification training (IQT) mission qualification
training (MQT), continuation training (CT) and specialized training (ST) and certification
requirements for BCC team personnel.
3.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT for intelligence personnel begins after initial
skills training (e.g., the Air Force Specialty Code awarding courses) and concludes with
successful completion of the Intelligence Formal Training Unit (IFTU). Since there is no IFTU
for BCC, personnel will conduct concurrent IQT/MQT at the gained unit.
3.3. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT provides intelligence personnel the
training needed to perform in their assigned duty positions supporting BCC missions/operation.
Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist SIOs in developing and executing their MQT
program for all individuals. MQT execution will take into account the assigned duty position,
current qualifications, prior experience and training, currency, documented performance and/or
formal training achieved by each individual. MQT can be accomplished through one-on-one
instruction from a qualified trainer, external courses, or other training opportunities that satisfy
the requirements for MQT. Applicable portions of MQT will be used to create a requalification
program for personnel who are non-CMR or BMC status.
   3.3.1. MQT begins within 90 days of the individuals’ first duty day at the gaining unit or
   immediately after completion of IQT. MQT will be completed within 120 days with
   seasoning days. If no seasoning days are available, MQT will be completed within 365
   calendar days, or the execution of one year's cycle of Inactive Duty for Training and Annual
   Training, whichever is earlier.
   3.3.2. Personnel are qualified CMR upon successful completion of MQT, a successful
   Initial Mission Qualification Evaluation (INIT MSN) IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2; ANGI
   14-2BCC, Volume 2; and SIO endorsement. Refer to ANGI 14-2BCC Volume 2 for a more
   detailed explanation of evaluations.
   3.3.3. All intelligence personnel will complete BCC-1 through BCC-8 Blocks of Instruction
   (BOIs) as listed in Table 3.1. Units are not required to complete training BOIs sequentially.
   Units will develop unit-specific team training materials.

4.1. Specialized Training (ST). This section outlines specialized qualifications necessary to
achieve specific unit mission requirements. Not all intelligence personnel are required to
complete ST. This ST program is intended to provide SIOs the minimum qualifications and may
be tailored for intelligence personnel with current qualifications, prior experience, currency,
documented performance or formal training. Unless governed by a formal syllabus, these
programs will consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios. The trainer will ensure ST is
recorded on AF Form 4381 and IAW AF/A2 guidance and approved processes regarding online
documentation.
   4.1.1. Mission Planning Cell (MPC). Intelligence personnel that are selected will attain
   MPC-level ST qualification after completing BCC-9. Table 4.1 details the additional
   knowledge and task training events for the Mission Planning Cell. For knowledge training
   events, trainers will provide academic instruction. Trainees will demonstrate comprehension
   of each topic via written test, verbal review or other method as determined by trainers. For
   task training events, trainers will provide hands-on-training and demonstration for each
   performance measure. Trainees will demonstrate proficiency in performing the task
   unassisted. Units may add additional training requirements.

   evaluators may conduct unsupervised intelligence evaluations to grade standardization and
   evaluation criteria. Evaluators may conduct unsupervised intelligence evaluations to grade
   standardization and evaluation criteria. Table 4.2 details the additional knowledge and task
   training events for the IE. Intelligence personnel identified by the SIO for progression to IE
