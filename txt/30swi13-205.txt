This instruction implements and extends guidance from AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management,
dated 30 September 2001, and designates a single point of contact for all requests to enter the restricted
airspace over Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) and ocean surface Danger Zone 4 offshore from
VAFB. The restricted areas and Danger Zone 4 were established as security measures to prevent the
close-in observation of missile activities. Recognizing that some requesters have legitimate reasons for
entering the restricted areas and Danger Zone 4, this instruction explains 30th Space Wing (30 SW) policy
to enter these areas. This instruction applies to all 30 SW organizations and provides guidance for other
agencies requesting permission to fly in the restricted airspace or enter surface Danger Zone 4. Refer rec-
ommended changes and questions about this supplement to 2 ROPS/DON, 1602 California Blvd, Suite

1. Responsibilities:
    1.1. All 30 SW organizations will promptly forward all requests to enter restricted airspace over Van-
    denberg AFB or surface Danger Zone 4 to the 2d Range Operations Squadron Airspace and Offshore
    Management Flight (2 ROPS/DON).
    1.2. 30th Space Wing Commander (30 SW/CC) has delegated 2 ROPS/DON as the approval author-
    ity for all requests to enter the restricted airspace over Vandenberg AFB or Danger Zone 4. 2 ROPS
    will ensure the use of the restricted areas and Danger Zone 4 is in keeping with the purpose for which
    they were established. It will review and coordinate with the appropriate offices on entry requests and
    prepare a response memorandum per both 30 SW policy and operational considerations.
    1.3. The 30th Space Wing Operations Security Office (30 SW/CCH) will have the option to review
    photographs taken by any agency that is given permission to overfly restricted airspace or enter Dan-
    ger Zone 4.
    1.4. The 2d Range Operations Officer (2 ROPS/DO) is responsible for the real-time management of
    all range operating areas.
    1.5. The 2d Range Operations Squadron Scheduling Flight (2 ROPS/DOS) ensures all operations in
    the restricted areas and Danger Zone 4 are properly approved and authorized before they are assigned
    an operation number and the requested entry is scheduled.

2. General Provisions. There are several airspace restricted areas and offshore danger zones associated
with Vandenberg AFB. Restricted Area 2517 is not opened to outside agencies (exclusive to 30 SW)
unless specific written entry permission is given. The stopping or loitering of vessels is expressly prohib-
ited within Danger Zone 4, unless prior permission is obtained from 30 SW/CC. The purpose of these
restricted areas and Danger Zone 4 is to contain hazardous operations and enhance security by preventing
“close in” observation of launch facilities. Therefore, during range operations, airspace and selected dan-
ger zones are closed (as appropriate), and at other times entry is controlled for safety and security reasons.
There are nine danger zones extending from Point Sal to Point Conception which are selectively closed at
frequent and irregular intervals for hazardous range operations.

3. Restricted Area and Danger Zone 4 Entry Policy. 2 ROPS/DON will approve requests for opera-
tions in restricted area airspace and surface Danger Zone 4 as long as they comply with the purpose for
30SWI13-205 2 OCTOBER 2006                                                                                 3


which the restricted areas and Danger Zone 4 were established. Requests will be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis and approved on their individual merits in conjunction with the status of military oper-
ations activities. In emergency cases involving immediate threat to life, limb, or safety of flight, authori-
zations for immediate passage through restricted areas may be granted by Frontier Control, Vandenberg
Control Tower, Santa Barbara TRACON, or Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC).

4. Procedures.
   4.1. 30 SW organizations will refer entry requests to restricted areas or danger zones to 2 ROPS/
   DON, Bldg. 7025, 1602 California Street, Suite 144, Vandenberg AFB CA 93437-5233. Submit
   requests, in writing, at least 10 duty days before the requested entry. The requests should identify a
   point of contact, contain the purpose of the entry request, and indicate the date and time for which
   entry is requested.
   4.2. 2 ROPS/DON will:
       4.2.1. Review all requests to enter restricted airspace and surface Danger Zone 4.
       4.2.2. Coordinate incoming requests, as required, with 30 SW/CCH, 2 ROPS/DOS, and 2 ROPS/
       DO.
       4.2.3. Draft an appropriate outgoing response memorandum and forward with the corresponding
       instruction sheet, to the requesting agency. Attachment 2, Sample Overflight Request Memoran-
       dum and Attachment 3, Sample Danger Zone 4 Entry Request Memorandum are example
       response memorandums. Attachment 4, Vandenberg AFB Danger Zone Information and Attach-
       ment 5, Restricted Area Flight Instructions, are the instruction sheets.
       4.2.4. Coordinate the response memorandum with all appropriate agencies.
       4.2.5. Ensure the response memorandum is properly distributed.
   4.3. 30 SW/CCH will expedite review of all entry requests involving photography.
   4.4. 2 ROPS/DON will:
       4.4.1. Coordinate with Vandenberg Control Tower to ensure they only clear properly authorized
       and scheduled operations into the restricted areas and Danger Zone 4.
       4.4.2. Coordinate with Vandenberg Control Tower to ensure overflights which affect other con-
       trol agencies are properly coordinated, as appropriate.
       4.4.3. Ensure the operations associated with the entry approval comply with the conditions in the
       entry approval.
   4.5. 2 ROPS/DOS will:
       4.5.1. Schedule properly approved restricted areas and surface Danger Zone 4 operations on a
       noninterference basis to range mission operations.
       4.5.2. Schedule operations that enter the restricted areas and surface Danger Zone 4 only after
       approval and according to the restrictions and conditions contained in the approval memorandum.

                      VANDENBERG AFB DANGER ZONE INFORMATION

A4.1. The closure areas shown on the reverse of this notice are designed for the protection of life and
property and the preservation of security for national defense missile programs. The full cooperation of all
small craft operators is requested.

A4.2. Zone closure information will be broadcast by the 2d Range Operations Squadron at Vandenberg
AFB, call sign “Frontier Control”. This information will be broadcast on 156.3 MHz (Marine Channel 6)
and 156.8 MHz (Marine Channel 16) at 0900 hours and 1200 hours, local time, daily except Saturday,
Sunday, and holidays.

A4.3. The hazardous zones are established in conformance with provisions of the Code of Federal Reg-
ulations, Title 33, and Part 334.1130. The zones as published should be considered primarily as guide-
lines for hazardous surface operations. In many instances, the hazardous conditions will exist seaward in
excess of the 3-mile limit. As a general rule, when a zone is indicated as being hazardous to surface oper-
ations, boat operators should not assume that the area adjoining the zone to seaward is safe from fall-out
of missile debris.

A4.4. The stopping or loitering of vessels is expressly prohibited within Danger Zone 4 unless prior writ-
ten permission is obtained from the Airspace and Offshore Management Office, 2d Range Operations
Squadron, Vandenberg Air Force Base.
