2.5. Closed Portions of the Airfield. The extension of Taxiway A, west of Taxiway H, near
building 127.
2.6. Aircraft Arresting Systems. Robins AFB arresting systems are designed for tail hook
equipped aircraft only.
     2.6.1. Bidirectional Barrier Arresting Kit (BAK)-9 arresting systems are installed 37 feet
     into the south overrun and 48 feet into the north overrun.
     2.6.2. Bidirectional BAK-12/14 arresting systems are installed 1,651 feet from the approach
     end of Runway 33 and 1,926 feet from the approach end of Runway 15. The arresting
     system at the south end of the field near Taxiway A will be referred to as “South BAK-12.”
     The arresting system at the north end of the field between Taxiway C and Taxiway D will be
     referred to as “North BAK-12.” The BAK 12/14 are controlled by Robins Tower, and will
     remain in the down position except when required for maintenance or aircra ft operations.
     The departure end BAK-12/14 will be raised anytime a tail hook equipped aircraft departs,
     lands, or when requested. Note: A request to raise a barrier or hook cable means the barrier
     or cable on the departure end of the runway. If an approach end engagement is required, the
     pilot or military authority will specifically request that the approach end cable be raised.
     2.6.3. Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) is the focal point for all arresting system
     activity and will coordinate with the appropriate agencies to request maintenance assistance.
     2.6.4. During normal duty hours, Barrier Maintenance (CE Power Production Flight) has
     primary responsibility for arresting system maintenance and inspections, and will
     immediately notify AMOPS of any known changes in the barrier status.
     2.6.5. During non-duty hours the Fire Department is delegated inspection duties (IAW T.O.
     35E8-2-5-1). Note: Barrier Maintenance shall respond after duty hours reference any
     maintenance requests by AMOPS.
     2.6.6. Arresting systems will be inspected daily (0600L-0800L), after all barrier
     engagements, after minor repairs, when it is suspected an aircraft has landed on the cable,
     and at other times when Barrier Maintenance deems necessary. Inspection results will be
     reported to AMOPS. Runway operations will be suspended at the discretion of the Tower
     Watch Supervisor or AMOPS. If runway operations are suspended, AMOPS shall conduct a
     FOD check of the runway prior to resuming runway operations.
     2.6.7. Arresting System Procedures.
        2.6.7.1. Barrier Maintenance will advise tower when in position        (holding short of
        runway) and ready for cable maintenance/inspection/runway change.      Traffic permitting,
        tower will provide runway/overrun access until advised by Barrier      Maintenance their
        work is complete. All coordination concerning the operational status   of the barriers will
        include the terms “in-service” or “out-of-service” exclusively.
        2.6.7.2. For runway changes during normal duty hours, Barrier Maintenance will retract
        the departure end BAK-9 prior to placing the approach end (new departure end) BAK-9
        in-service. After disconnecting the departure end BAK-9 cable, Barrier Maintenance will
        usually exit the runway, at which time the Tower Watch Supervisor may allow normal
        operations to the changed runway.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            9


     2.6.7.3. Outside of normal duty hours, when a runway change is determined, the Fire
     Department will disconnect the departure end BAK-9. After disconnecting the departure
     end BAK-9, Fire Department will exit the runway and normal operations may resume to
     the changed runway. Upon arrival, Barrier Maintenance will respond to the new
     departure end and place the appropriate BAK-9 in-service. After completion, Barrier
     Maintenance will usually exit the runway, and traffic permitting and upon request, tower
     will provide runway/overrun access to the approach end (disconnected) BAK-9 for
     additional checks/inspection.
     2.6.7.4. To ensure a redundant barrier is available, the departure end BAK-9 will not be
     disconnected prior to placing the new BAK-9 in service if either BAK-12/14 system is
     out-of-service. In the case one or both BAK-12/14s is out-of-service, the Fire
     Department will not disconnect the departure end BAK-9.
  2.6.8. Arresting System Engagement Procedures.
     2.6.8.1. The Fire Department senior responder is the Incident Commander (IC) of all
     activities concerning the aircraft until the Senior Fire Officer (SFO) terminates the
     emergency. If hydrazine is involved, the aircraft will not be moved until the spill is
     contained and mitigated according to Robins AFB Installation Emergency Management
     Plan (IEMP) 10-2. Aircraft movement will be approved by the Fire Protection Branch
     (78 CEG/CEF). If the aircraft is damaged during landing, it will not be moved until
     released by the installation Flight Safety Office. Additionally, the organizations listed
     below have the following specific responsibilities: NOTE: No personnel shall enter the

                                GENERAL OPERATIONS

3.1. Runway Selection/Change Procedures.
   3.1.1. The Robins Tower Watch Supervisor (WS) is responsible for selecting the active
   runway. Runway 33 is the primary instrument runway and will normally be used when the
   surface wind velocity is less than 5 knots. Aircraft requiring a Runway 15 departure should
   make their request to Robins Ground Control prior to taxiing out of parking.
   3.1.2. Robins Tower will coordinate with Atlanta TRACON and Macon Tower prior to
   changing the runway in use. Additionally, Robins Tower will advise AMOPS and Weather
   Flight of the runway in use.
3.2. Aircraft Taxiing and Towing.
   3.2.1. Aircraft Engine Start and Taxi. Personnel shall contact Robins Tower for permission
   before starting engines or taxiing an aircraft. Personnel operating aircraft not capable of
   radio communications prior to engine start shall coordinate through AMOPS. Aero Club
   aircraft may be repositioned (taxied or towed) in the immediate vicinity of the Aero Club
   ramp without approval (for example, parking spot to fuel area, parking spot to hangar, and so
   forth). F-15 aircraft may be repositioned in the vicinity of building 131 and the F-15
   functional test ramp without approval. HMLA-773 helicopters may be repositioned in the
   vicinity of the HMLA-773 hangar and ramp without approval. HMLA-773 helicopters and
   F-15 aircraft do not have APUs and are authorized to start engines prior to contacting Ground
   Control. C-27 aircraft that require ground taxi training shall use the following notification
   procedures in lieu of a flight plan. C-27 Operations shall contact AMOPS and provide the
   call sign, location, and requested operation. AMOPS will pass that information to Robins
   Tower. The C-27 aircraft will then contact Ground Control for engine start and taxi and
   advise when the ground taxi operation is terminated.
   3.2.2. Aircraft Tows. Prior to towing any aircraft on the active taxiways, contact Robins
   Tower and maintain two-way radio communication during the towing operation. If two-way
   radio communication cannot be maintained between Robins Tower and the towing vehicle,
   an escort vehicle with two-way communication capability is required in order to tow aircraft
   through the active taxiways. Tows that do not enter active taxiways need not contact Robins
   Tower prior to or during tow.
   3.2.3. Standardized Taxi Routes. Base-assigned aircrews may be issued the following
   standard taxi routes in lieu of progressive taxi.
      3.2.3.1. “Depot (Bravo/Golf).” For Runway 33, taxi via (Bravo/Golf), Hotel, Alpha.
      For Runway 15, taxi via (Bravo/Golf), Hotel, Charlie, Juliet, Delta.
          3.2.3.1.1. “Strike Eagle West.” For Runway 33, taxi via Hotel 1, Hotel, Alpha. For
          Runway 15, taxi via Hotel 1, Hotel, Charlie, Juliet, Delta.
          3.2.3.1.2. “Cherokee West.” For Runway 33, taxi via Charlie 2, Charlie 1, Charlie,
          Hotel, Bravo. For Runway 15, taxi via Charlie 2, Charlie 1, Charlie.
 18                                                    ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


             3.2.3.1.3. “Georgia West.” For Runway 33, taxi via Juliet, Charlie, Hotel, Alpha.
             For Runway 15, taxi via Juliet, Delta.
             3.2.3.1.4. “Georgia East.” For Runway 33, taxi via Echo, Foxtrot. For Runway 15,
             taxi via Echo, Delta.
3.3. C-5 High Speed Taxi Operations.
      3.3.1. Aircrews shall:
         3.3.1.1. File flight plan (with AMOPS) 2 hours prior to taxi and include “high-speed
         taxi” in the remarks. If the taxi time slips, update AMOPS as soon as possible.
         3.3.1.2. Before engine start, inform Robins Ground Control of high-speed taxi operation
         and include approximate time needed on the runway.
      3.3.2. AMOPS shall:
         3.3.2.1. Pass the high-speed taxi message to tower.
         3.3.2.2. Perform a runway FOD/safety inspection after the high-speed taxi is complete.
         Suspend/resume runway operations as deemed necessary.
3.4. Control of Aircraft and Ground Vehicular Traffic.
      3.4.1. Controlled Movement Area. The CMA is defined as the runway; overruns; Taxiway
      E (south of C); Instrument Critical Areas, Precision Obstacle-Free Zone (POFZ); and those
      portions of the airfield within 100 feet of the runway pavement’s edge. Approval from
      Robins Control Tower is required prior to entry into the CMA and two-way radio contact
      must be maintained at all times within the CMA.
      3.4.2. All other taxiways and parking ramps are nonmovement areas (not controlled by
      ATC).
      3.4.3. The Assistant Airfield Manager is the installation OPR for the Airfield Driving
      Program. All personnel driving on the flightline and industrial area must be qualified IAW
      RAFBI 13-213, Control and Operation of Vehicles on Robins AFB Airfield, and possess a
      valid AF IMT 483, Certificate of Competency.
3.5. Precision Approach Critical Areas.
      3.5.1. Instrument critical areas are protected by means of establishing a CMA or physically
      separating the critical area for vehicular travel routes in order to prevent vehicles of all types
      from interfering with the radiation pattern emitted by the antennae. Even the smallest
      interference can cause a significant deviation in the radiation pattern and affect the course of
      flight for landing aircraft.
      3.5.2. Instrument critical areas are part of the CMA (See Figures A5.1 and A5.2) and are
      designated by instrument hold lines located on Taxiways J, D East, the south end of E, F1,
      and A. All aircraft and vehicles shall hold short of the instrument hold lines and request
      permission from Robins Tower prior to entering the instrument critical area.
      3.5.3. Subsequent to Robins Tower permission to proceed on Taxiway E CMA, aircraft and
      vehicles may proceed into the southeast instrument critical area located on the southern
      portion of E without additional permissions. The instrument critical area is protected when
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             19


   reported ceiling is less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles. Robins Tower shall
   instruct aircraft and vehicles to hold short of instrument critical area as required.
3.6. Quiet Hours.
   3.6.1. The 78 ABW/CC is the approval authority for all quiet hours at Robins AFB. 78
   OSS/OSA (Airfield Operations) is the OPR for all quiet hours. When planning permits,
   project officers for ceremonies must initiate coordination at least 2 weeks in advance
   (preferably 30 days). Coordinate all quiet hour requests via the following email address:
   78oss.workflow@robins.af.mil.
      3.6.1.1. The request must state the quiet hours requested, date and time of window for
      quiet hours, name and rank of the individual for whom the ceremony/event is being
      performed, justification, location of the ceremony/event, and quiet hours POC.
      3.6.1.2. Airfield Operations will coordinate and notify all affected organizations prior to
      seeking approval from the 78 ABW/CC. Short notice requests will be followed up via
      telephone by Airfield Operations. Exceptions to approved quiet hours will be approved
      at the discretion of the 78 ABW/CC as they occur.
   3.6.2. Once approved by the 78 ABW/CC, Airfield Operations will notify the following base
   agencies: affected Group Commanders, flying units, Command Post, AMOPS, Robins
   Tower, Aero Club, and the Maintenance Operations Centers (MOCs) and advise them of the
   quiet hours and the specific restrictions.
   3.6.3. Pre-Approved Quiet Hours. Quiet hours are pre-approved for: WR-ALC/CC change
   of command, 78 ABW/CC change of command, Tattoo Ceremony, and Camellia Gardens
   Memorial Service. During these periods, departures, arrivals, engine runs, and auxiliary
   power units (APUs) are not authorized. Although pre-approved, ceremony POCs must
   coordinate with 78 OSS Airfield Operations IAW paragraph 3.6.1.
   3.6.4. Since quiet hours impact airport operations, the time window for quiet hours should be
   minimized to the maximum extent possible (ideally, not to exceed 30 minutes). Additionally,
   the following factors should be considered:
      3.6.4.1. The requesting agency should consider the effects of allowing local aircraft to
      takeoff and/or full-stop land only. Such exceptions should be included on the request.
      3.6.4.2. If quiet hours are no longer needed prior to the expiration of the time window,
      the requesting agency will notify AMOPS at 468-2114/2115 or the following email
      address: 78oss.workflow@robins.af.mil. AMOPS will notify Airfield Operations and
      Robins Tower that quiet hours have been terminated. Note: Robins Tower may authorize
      priority aircraft to conduct essential operations as defined per FAA JO 7110.65 (e.g., AIR
      EVAC/MED EVAC aircraft declaring medical priority, LIFEGUARD, etc.) in which
      case, Robins Tower will notify AMOPS immediately. Military aircraft carrying
      Distinguished Visitors (Code 7 or higher) may also land or depart as an exception during
      quiet hours.
3.7. Noise Abatement.
   3.7.1. Noise abatement is in effect at Robins AFB daily from 2200L to 0600L. Multiple
   approaches are not permitted during this period, except for locally assigned aircraft.
 20                                                   ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


      3.7.2. All departing or arriving aircraft shall avoid over-flying base housing areas at all
      times.
      3.7.3. Public Affairs (78 ABW/PA) keeps the base and community populations advised of
      flight operations conducted at Robins AFB and explains measures taken to minimize noise
      and other disturbances associated with aircraft operations.
         3.7.3.1. When an F-15 files a Macon Echo profile the pilot will specify supersonic or
         non-supersonic. Robins AMOPS will inform 78 ABW/PA when an F-15 is performing a
         supersonic check and the approximate time for the sonic boom. This time will be
         estimated as take-off time plus 30 minutes.
      3.7.4. 78 ABW/PA tracks incidents of noise complaints and will attempt to determine the
      unit involved. 78 ABW/PA will provide inputs regarding noise complaints to the Airfield
      Operations Flight (78 OSS/OSA) for resolution and inclusion in the quarterly Airfield
      Operations Board (AOB).
3.8. Weather Information/Severe Weather Procedures.
      3.8.1. Pilot Reports (PIREP). Robins Tower will relay all PIREPS to the Base Weather
      Observer. Pilots may report PIREPs directly to Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV; 349.85
      MHz). Base Weather shall ensure Robins Tower is informed of PIREPs.
      3.8.2. Lightning Warnings. When the Robins weather station broadcasts a lightning warning

         should seek shelter in a vehicle, aircraft, or structure immediately after notification until
         the lightning warning has expired.
         3.8.2.2. Arriving aircraft shall be allowed to land, but the crew and passengers should
         expect to remain on board the aircraft until the lightning warning has expired. Crews will
         not receive any ground support during the warning period. Note: Robins Tower shall not
         deny departing aircraft taxi or departure clearances based only on severe weather
         warnings, watches, or advisories.
3.9. Severe Weather Hangar Procedures.
      3.9.1. Upon notification of a severe weather watch, AMOPS shall:
         3.9.1.1. Notify Fuels Service Center (POL) (468-4403), TA, and broadcast weather
         details via the Ramp Net.
         3.9.1.2. When advised of a severe weather watch (via AtHOC, a network-centric
         emergency mass alert notification system), MOC will determine the availability of space
         in hangars 50, 54, 89, and 131 for possible use by transient and/or Aero Club fueled
         aircraft and advise AMOPS of the locations and number of spaces.

   3.14.3. Restrictions During Reduced Capability. Using Figure A8.1, OG/CCs, MXG/CCs or
   equivalent, respectively, will determine which activities, if any, will be curtailed during the
   period of reduced capability.
   3.14.4. The 78 ABW/CC (may be delegated to 78 OSS/CC) will determine which
   restrictions, if any, will be imposed on transient aircraft and Robins Aero Club operations
   during the period of reduced capability and notify 78 OSS for dissemination.
   3.14.5. 78 ABW/CC has authority to close the airfield/stop operations and will do so through
   the 78 OSS via NOTAM.
   3.14.6. Coordination. When crash and rescue capability changes, 78 CEG/CEF will notify
   AMOPS personnel, who will, in turn, inform the agencies listed in paragraph 3.14.2. of the
   change.
3.15. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Procedures. In the event the primary SOF vehicle is
inoperative, Robins Tower may be designated as an alternate location. This plan is only
applicable to local flying unit SOFs.
   3.15.1. Robins Tower is solely responsible for control of aircraft within the Robins Class D
   airspace. The SOF is responsible for providing assistance to aircraft experiencing system
   difficulties, weather problems, etc.
   3.15.2. Robins Tower shall:
      3.15.2.1. Provide the SOF a position with the capability to monitor local, ground, and
      flight data control positions, one tunable UHF radio with transmit/receive capability.
      3.15.2.2. Advise the SOF of any known condition that could affect the safe recovery of
      aircraft at Robins AFB.
   3.15.3. SOF shall:
      3.15.3.1. Advise Robins Tower before reporting to the tower to conduct alternate SOF
      operations.

         3.15.3.3. Relay information requests, directions, and questions to controllers through the
         WS.
         3.15.3.4. Coordinate with the WS prior to transmitting on any ATC frequency (including
         Guard/Emergency).
         3.15.3.5. Not perform ATC functions nor transmit ATC instructions or clearances to
         aircraft. Note: IAW AFI 13-204V3, a person who commandeers an ATC frequency
         assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft.
3.16. Airfield and Restricted Area Photography. Photography is categorized as official or
unofficial.
      3.16.1. Official Photography. Photographs taken for government purposes are considered
      official. Unit security managers or unit/aircraft commanders and superintendents, can
      determine if the photo is for government purposes. These photos are normally taken by
      audiovisual services, public affairs personnel, or escorted personnel.        Government
      contractors may be authorized to take photos in connection with a government contract;
      however, these photos require prior approval. Official photography does not require written
      permission; however, advance notification to the monitoring agency, 78th Security Forces
      Squadron (SFS), normally prevents delays or interruptions of photographers to verify
      authorization.
      3.16.2. Unofficial Photography. Unofficial photography is not permitted on the flightline or
      any restricted area. Employees and guests are prohibited from photographing classified
      material, information, or components. If in doubt about an item's classification, it should not
      be photographed. Aircraft carrying a Protection Level 3 or higher and transient aircraft
      should not be photographed without first being cleared with the aircraft commander.
      3.16.3. The respective Controlled Area Monitor may authorize photography within a
      controlled area.
      3.16.4. Photography of other areas of Robins AFB is permitted without approval; however,
      photographers taking pictures of restricted areas from inside or outside the restricted area
      boundary may be stopped, questioned, and have their identity verified by SFS personnel.
      3.16.5. News media personnel must be escorted by public affairs personnel at all times while
      on the installation.
      3.16.6. All personnel are responsible for detecting and reporting any violation of these
      photography procedures. Personnel detecting unauthorized photography should notify SFS.
      SFS personnel may confiscate film or digital cameras to determine content. Note: Any costs
      associated with determining content will be at the photographer's expense.
3.17. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedures. All transient aircraft inbound to Robins
AFB shall contact AMOPS to receive a PPR number no earlier than 72 hours prior to their
arrival as published in the IFR Supplement.
3.18. Grass Mowing and Sweeper Operations.
      3.18.1. Sweeper Operations. Airfield sweepers are in constant operation at Robins between
      the hours of 0745L to 1545L. The sweeper shall maintain radio contact on the Ramp Net
      with Robins Ground at all times.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              25


       3.18.1.1. During off hours (1545L-0745L) sweeper crews are on recall by CE Customer
       Service in the event of emergencies.
   3.18.2. Grass Mowing. Grass maintenance on the airfield will be performed IAW the PWS
   of the current contract.
3.19. Local Radio Frequencies and Checks.
   3.19.1. Robins AFB radio frequencies may also be found in both the Airport Facilities
   Directory (AFD) and Flight Information Publication (FLIP).
       3.19.1.1. Emergency: UHF 243.0 or VHF 121.5.
       3.19.1.2. Local Control: UHF 257.975 or VHF 133.225.

       3.19.1.10. AFRC Command Post: UHF 327.175
       3.19.1.11. ALC MOC: UHF 225.925
   3.19.2. Maintenance       personnel    with    an     available   MOC       should     conduct
   operational/functional radio checks with their MOC. Do not contact Robins Tower to
   functionally test radios without operational need as extraneous radio calls present a hazard to
   airfield and flying safety.
3.20. Runway Incursions. When an unauthorized entry into the CMA occurs, Robins Tower
shall attempt to make contact with the violator and notify AMOPS to respond and investigate.
   3.20.1. Information identifying the perpetrator and duty section/employer will be obtained
   for inclusion onto a USAF Hazard Report (AF IMT 457) or Hazardous Air Traffic Report
   (HATR; AF IMT 651).
   3.20.2. Procedures for disposition of personnel involved in a runway incursion are defined in
   RAFBI 13-213, Control and Operation of Vehicles on Robins AFB Airfield.
3.21. Foreign Aircraft Landings at Robins AFB. Handling of foreign aircraft will be IAW
AFI 10-1801, Foreign Government Aircraft Landings at USAF Installations; RAFBI 16-201,
Foreign Disclosure Visits and Disclosure of Military Information; and Robins Integrated
Defense Plan 31-101.
   3.21.1. Periodically, foreign aircraft request/require permission to land at Robins Air Force
   Base (RAFB) for a variety of reasons, e.g., pick up parts from product directorates under
   Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreement, gas and go, or remain overnight (RON). Under
   increased force protection conditions (FPCON), it is essential aircraft be approved in advance
   and positive control of subject aircraft, crew, and passengers be provided.
 26                                                 ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


      3.21.2. In order for a foreign government aircraft to land at an Air Force base, the aircraft
      must have: (1) a diplomatic clearance issued by the State Department; (2) an Aircraft
      Landing Authorization Number (ALAN) issued by USAF/XOO-CA; and (3) a Prior
      Permission Request (PPR).
3.22. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) Values. AMOPS will report RSC IAW AFI 13-
204V3. The AFM or designated representative is responsible for determining the RSC and
reporting the information to the applicable agencies.
3.23. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Values. Since the region in which Robins AFB is
located has little or no record of snow accumulation, AMOPS is not required to maintain a
decelerometer or report RCRs IAW AFI 13-204V3.
3.24. Snow Removal. Robins AFB does not have snow removal procedures due to its
geographical location.
3.25. Airfield Tobacco Use Policy. Tobacco use is prohibited in all Robins Air Force Base
airfield facilities. Tobacco use is prohibited within 50 feet of hangars, aircraft, warehouses,
repair docks, paint and dope shops, petroleum oil lubricants, vehicle maintenance shops, gasoline
dispensing operations, bulk oxygen storage facilities, areas where bituminous or plastic coatings
are being applied, flammable liquid or gas handling storage areas, and aircraft parking areas.
Tobacco use is restricted to Designated Tobacco Areas only, and all personnel are subject to the
restrictions prescribed in AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force, and RAFBI 32-2001, The
Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program.
3.26. Aircraft Engine Runs. All engine runs, other than preflight, are to be completed by
2200L. Maintenance crews will request the time, location, and duration of the engine run
through the MOC prior to starting engines. Upon request, MOC will advise and coordinate the
engine run through AMOPS. AMOPS will then notify Robins Tower.
      3.26.1. Aircraft parking spots F1-F4 are restricted to C-130 engine runs. Transient aircraft
      must coordinate with AMOPS for engine runs.
      3.26.2. During the noise abatement period (2200L-0600L), engine runs above idle speed are
      prohibited unless approved by the appropriate authority. For all ALC units, the 402
      AMXG/CC or designated representative is the approval authority. For all mission partner
      units, the unit’s Wing or Group Commander or Vice Commander/Deputy is the approval
      authority. If the mission partner's Wing or Group Commander or Vice Commander/Deputy
      is unavailable, the 78 ABW/CC or CV is the approval authority. For transient aircraft, 78
      ABW/CC or CV is the approval authority.
         3.26.2.1. Hold after hours engine runs of this nature to an absolute minimum. Once the
         requesting maintenance control center has received approval from the appropriate
         authority, they must advise AMOPS of the time, reason, duration and location of the
         engine run prior to running engines and give the name of the approving authority.
         AMOPS will notify Robins Tower.
         3.26.2.2. During noise abatement hours, engine runs conducted at idle do not require
         WG/GP CC or CV/CD approval. However, coordination with AMOPS is still required.
      3.26.3. Engine Run Communications.        Engine run crews must comply with the
      communications and operating provisions contained in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                           27


  Movement on the Ground. All maintenance crews will contact Robins Ground Control prior
  to starting engines, monitor ground control frequency for the duration of the engine run, and
  advise Robins Ground when the run has been terminated.
  3.26.4. When the Robins Tower Watch Supervisor determines the noise level is affecting
  flight safety, crews will be advised to terminate the engine run.
 28                                                   ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


                                              Chapter 4

                                        AIR OPERATIONS

4.1. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Minima.
      4.1.1. VFR weather conditions at Robins are defined as a ground visibility of at least 3 miles
      and a ceiling of 1,000 feet or greater. Pilots filing VFR into or out of Robins AFB are
      advised to additionally check Macon/Middle Georgia Regional Airport weather (ATIS
      120.775) to ascertain the Class D airspace condition status.
4.2. Radar Service/IFR Operations.
      4.2.1. Normal IFR Procedures. Maximum use of the IFR system will be utilized on all
      flights. Aircraft departing IFR from Robins AFB will normally receive a radar vector from
      Atlanta TRACON.
      4.2.2. All departures should expect a 3,000-foot altitude restriction on departure unless
      otherwise coordinated with ground control/clearance delivery (e.g. an unrestricted climb to
      15,000’ by an F-15).
      4.2.3. Standard climb-out for Runway 33. Turn right heading 110°, within 1.5 NM of the
      departure end of the runway, maintain 3,000’ MSL.
      4.2.4. Standard climb-out for Runway 15. Turn left heading 050°, maintain 3,000’ MSL.
      4.2.5. Multiple Approach Procedures. Multiple touch-and-go, stop-and-go, and low
      approaches may be accomplished at the discretion of Atlanta TRACON and Robins Tower
      based upon workload and traffic/weather conditions.
      4.2.6. Unless multiple approaches have been previously coordinated, an instrument approach
      normally terminates in a full-stop landing or low approach followed by entry into the VFR
      pattern.
4.3. Protection of the 360 Overhead Pattern. Anytime aircraft are in the overhead pattern,
tower shall restrict departures to 1,300 feet MSL until the departure end of the runway.
4.4. VFR Terminal Area Procedures.
      4.4.1. Arrivals. All VFR arrivals, if able, will contact Atlanta TRACON for initial
      sequencing and advisories at least 20 NM from Robins AFB.
      4.4.2. Pattern Descriptions. (See Figures A4.1, A4.2, and A4.3)
         4.4.2.1. Helicopter Pattern. Pattern altitude is 800’ MSL. Whenever the reported ceiling
         is less than 1,000’ AGL or visibility is less than 3 miles the helicopter pattern will not be
         flown.
         4.4.2.2. Rectangular Pattern. Pattern altitude is 1,800’ MSL for fighter type aircraft and
         1,300’ for all other aircraft. Whenever the reported ceiling is less than 2,000’ AGL
         (fighters) or 1,500’ AGL (all others) or visibility is less than 3 miles, the rectangular
         pattern will not be flown.
         4.4.2.3. Initial/Overhead Pattern. Pattern altitude is 1,800’ MSL. Unless Robins Tower
         directs or approves otherwise, all aircraft will break over the approach end of the runway.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 29


       Whenever the reported ceiling is less than 2,000’ AGL or visibility is less than 3 miles,
       the overhead pattern will not be flown.
       4.4.2.4. Unless approved by Robins Tower, all turns are made to the east (i.e. Runway
       33: right turns; Runway 15: left turns).
4.5. Threat Avoidance Arrivals and Departures (TAA/D). Threat avoidance arrivals and
departures support formal training at Robins AFB and are only authorized for E-8C and C-27J
aircraft.
   4.5.1. Restrictions: All maneuvering will be IAW Visual Flight Rules and flown in Visual
   Meteorological Conditions. Aircraft will operate single-ship only. Procedures are identical
   for day and night operations, to include Night Vision Device (NVD) operations. Aircraft will
   avoid the airspace west of the Runway 15/33 centerline below 2,500’ MSL unless permitted
   by a specific arrival or departure procedure, or directed by Robins Tower. Aircraft will avoid
   low altitude overflight of Robins AFB built up and industrial areas unless permitted by a
   specific arrival or departure procedure or directed by Robins Tower. If directed to enter the
   published VFR pattern, expect a climb to 1,300’ MSL at which time tactical maneuvering is
   canceled. Tower can terminate tactical maneuvering for safety or higher priority traffic at
   anytime. Note: Aircraft on downwind to Runway 15 will use caution for civilian traffic in
   the vicinity of Macon/Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), located 3.1 NM northwest
   of Robins AFB.
   4.5.2. Arrivals.
       4.5.2.1. Tactical Beam Arrival (C-27J aircraft only): Upon contact with Atlanta
       TRACON request "Tactical Beam Arrival to (active runway)". When approval is
       received, pilots will proceed direct to the VFR beam point "ALEX" (N32 41.600W083
       30.000 KWRB 060/5.6NM) which is located abeam Interstate 16, at 900’ MSL. If unable
       contact with TRACON, contact Robins Tower at least 5 minutes before arrival. Pilots
       will call "POINT ALEX" crossing Interstate 16 inbound on a 240 magnetic heading
       toward midfield. The water tower located on the 116 ACW complex east of the runway
       is a visual reference for approximately midfield. The pilot will cross the runway and turn
       to enter a west side downwind for the runway in use. Note: Point “ALEX” is a locally
       defined reference point.
       4.5.2.2. Tactical Straight In Runway 33 (C-27J aircraft only): The tactical straight in
       Runway 33 allows arrivals from a 30 degree sector southeast of the airport bounded by
       the inbound course to Runway 33 (325 degrees) counter clockwise to an inbound course
       of 295 degrees. Upon contact with Atlanta TRACON request "Tactical Straight-In
       Runway 33". When approval is received pilots will proceed inbound and report over or
       abeam RUUDE (MCN R-141/11.3) at 800’ MSL. If unable to contact Atlanta TRACON,
       contact Robins Tower at least 5 minutes before arrival.
       4.5.2.3. Tactical Straight-In Runway 33, Teardrop 15 (C-27J aircraft only): Procedures,
       flight path, and radio calls are identical to the Tactical Straight-In with the exception that
       the pilot will request "Tactical Straight-In Runway 33, Teardrop 15". Prior to crossing
       the approach end of Runway 33, the pilot will maneuver east of the airport for a left base
       to Runway 15.
30                                                  ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


        4.5.2.4. Tactical Steep Descent (C-27J aircraft only): This maneuver is a spiraling
        descent from overhead the airport. Pilots will contact Atlanta TRACON and request
        "Tactical Steep Descent" at least 5 minutes prior to arrival to allow coordination with
        Robins Tower. Initial altitude will be 9,500’ MSL or as requested. Maneuver will start
        from overhead the approach end of landing runway, aligned with runway heading.
        Aircraft will remain within the lateral limits of Robins Class D airspace.
        4.5.2.5. Random Steep Approach (E-8C aircraft only): Aircrew will request (on initial
        contact with Atlanta TRACON) a "Random Steep Approach" to the active runway. Once
        cleared, the aircraft will establish a position overhead the field at 6,000' MSL and begin a
        30-degree bank descending turn in the direction of the planned final turn. The aircrew
        will plan to rollout on a normal downwind at 1,800' MSL and accomplish a normal final
        turn and landing. No aircraft will overfly the west side of the runway at an altitude lower
        than 2,500' MSL. Aircraft will remain within 5 NM of the airport. If unable, coordinate
        with TRACON as soon as possible.
        4.5.2.6. Curvilinear Approach (E-8C aircraft only): The curvilinear approach is designed
        to be flown from a random position and altitude. Due to proximity of the Macon/Middle
        Georgia Regional Airport and the city of Warner Robins, curvilinear approaches will not
        be flown to or from the west side of the runway, and will be flown as a circling maneuver
        or as a VFR entry to VFR downwind. Aircrew will request on initial contact with
        TRACON either an instrument approach with a circle to land on the active runway, or a
        VFR entry to downwind. If a VFR entry to downwind is requested (and approved) the
        aircraft will proceed (from the east) toward the airport and make a turn to enter
        downwind terminating with a normal final turn and landing.
     4.5.3. Departures.
        4.5.3.1. Tactical Departure Low (C-27J aircraft only): The remarks block of DD Form
        175 shall contain the words "Request Tactical Departure Low". The first point in the
        VFR flight plan shall be a radial/DME off of the MCN VORTAC. Pilots will request
        "Tactical Departure Low" upon initial contact with Robins Ground. From Runway 33,
        climb runway heading to 500’ AGL then turn right to heading of 060° and proceed VFR
        eastbound until clear of the Class D airspace. From Runway 15, climb runway heading
        to 500’ AGL, turn left heading 060° and proceed VFR eastbound until clear of the Class
        D airspace. Pilots desiring VFR flight following will request it prior to taxi.
        4.5.3.2. Spiral-Up Departure (C-27J aircraft only): The Spiral-Up Departure is a
        climbing spiral over the airport to 5,000' MSL. The remarks block of the DD Form 175
        shall contain the words "Request Spiral Up Departure". If an altitude other than 5,000'
        MSL is desired, this will also be annotated (example: Request Spiral-Up Departure to
        070)". The first point in the VFR flight plan shall be a radial/DME off of the MCN
        VORTAC. Pilots will request "Spiral Up Departure" upon initial contact with Robins
        Ground. After passing 400' AGL, start the tactical maneuver with a turn to the east.
        Aircraft will remain within the lateral limits of Robins Class D airspace.
        4.5.3.3. Spiral-Up Departure (E-8C aircraft only): The remarks block of the DD Form
        175 shall contain the words "Request Spiral-Up Departure." If an altitude other than
        5,000' MSL is needed, this will also be annotated (example: Request Spiral-Up
        Departure to 070). Upon initial contact with Robins Ground, the aircrew will inform the
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                           31


       controller of the request for the maneuver. When airborne, the crew will climb and
       maintain 5,000' MSL. After passing 400' AGL, start the tactical maneuver with a turn to
       the east. Continue maneuvering east of the runway (do not overfly the west side of the
       runway lower than 2,500' MSL) to position the aircraft over the airport, on desired
       departure heading at 5,000' MSL.
4.6. Helicopter Operations.
   4.6.1. At the discretion of Robins Tower, helicopters may be directed to the landing area
   without entering the standard traffic pattern.
   4.6.2. Taxi Operations. Landing and departing helicopters should hover/air taxi on/over
   paved areas to the maximum extent possible.
   4.6.3. HMLA-773 helicopters are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 4.6.2. and are
   authorized to operate on the Red Dog Mat, an area located on Taxiway E just south of the
   Fire Lane Road. The Red Dog Mat is the primary VFR takeoff and landing area for HMLA-
   773 helicopters. (See Figure A4.3)
4.7. Civil Aircraft Use of USAF ATCALS.
   4.7.1. Practice Approaches. Civil aircraft may use Robins AFB navigational aids or traffic
   pattern for practice low approaches only.
   4.7.2. Robins Tower Watch Supervisor may cancel civil practice approaches if service to
   military users is likely to be degraded because of traffic volume or other factors. Note: 78
   ABW/CC will cancel civil practice approaches during FPCON Bravo or higher.
   4.7.3. Landing. Only civil aircraft authorized by the provisions of AFI 10-1001, Civil
   Aircraft Landing Permits. With exception to aircraft experiencing emergency conditions,
   AMOPS makes the final determination on authority to land at Robins AFB.
4.8. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). Robins AFB will provide ATIS
broadcasts 24/7. The ATIS provides basic airport information and is broadcast on 233.4 and
119.475. For departing aircraft, pilots and aircrew will check ATIS for current aerodrome
information prior to requesting taxi with ATC. Arriving aircraft will check ATIS for current
aerodrome information prior to initial contact with ATC.
4.9. Local Aircraft Priorities. These priorities are established to facilitate mission
accomplishment. When feasible, Robins Tower shall provide priority service in the order listed
below. These priorities shall not take precedence over the priorities listed in FAA JO 7110.65.
   4.9.1. DV/HHQ operations.
   4.9.2. IFR full stop landings.
   4.9.3. IFR departures.
   4.9.4. Aerial Flight Test missions.
   4.9.5. Ground Flight Test missions to include C-5 High Speed Taxi Checks.
   4.9.6. Base-assigned practice IFR approaches.
   4.9.7. Transient practice IFR approaches.

      4.9.9. Civil Aircraft practice approaches.
4.10. Go-Around Procedures.
      4.10.1. Under VFR aircraft will be instructed to go around and maintain 1,300’ MSL and
      should expect closed traffic with Robins Tower or climb out to Atlanta TRACON. When
      instructed by Robins Tower to go around, offset east of the runway unless otherwise
      instructed. Go-around instructions will be, “Go Around, (reason), maintain 1,300’ MSL.”
      4.10.2. Under IFR, aircraft shall execute published missed approach procedures unless
      directed otherwise by Robins Tower/Atlanta TRACON.
4.11. Intersection Departures. Pilots may request, or controllers may initiate, a departure from
a runway intersection to expedite movement.
      4.11.1. Locally, the 339 FLTS commander has approved for all unit-assigned aircraft,
      intersection A for Runway 33, and intersection C for Runway 15.
      4.11.2. Aero Club aircraft transiting from the Aero Club ramp normally use Taxiway C for
      Runway 15 and Taxiway B (via Taxiway H) for Runway 33 departures.

Table 4.1. Distances Remaining for Intersection Departures
            Intersection                      Runway 33                     Runway 15

             Taxiway B                     6,700 ft available            5,300 ft available
             Taxiway C                     3,900 ft available            8,100 ft available

4.12. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) Standards. HQ AFMC authorizes the use
of RSRS standards based on 78 ABW/CC established procedures. The following defines RSRS
standards that may be used at Robins AFB, and applied between USAF aircraft only.
      4.12.1. Transient aircrews, not assigned to USAF, may not participate in RSRS unless a
      LOA approved by HQ AFMC/A3 is in effect. Note: Deployed units hosted by a local flying
      unit at Robins AFB will adhere to the same reduced runway separation standards as their host
      unit unless written notice is received by the 78 OSS.
      4.12.2. Conditions for application of RSRS standards. Note: 116 ACW aircraft will not
      participate in RSRS operations.
         4.12.2.1. Air traffic controllers must be able to see the aircraft involved and determine
         distances by reference to suitable landmarks for daytime and nighttime.
         4.12.2.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight
         may be jeopardized. Pilots must inform Robins Tower as soon as possible if RSRS
         cannot be accepted so Robins Tower can adjust sequencing as necessary. When refused,
         normal FAA JO 7110.65 standards apply.
         4.12.2.3. Aircraft will not overfly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation
         rests with the pilot.
         4.12.2.4. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
         separation or operating under VFR. Controllers must provide appropriate cautionary
         wake turbulence advisories in these cases.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                33


       4.12.2.5. Same aircraft means same airframe (i.e., F-15 behind F-15, C-5 behind a C-5,
       etc.).
       4.12.2.6. All other fighter and trainer type operations mean not the same airframe (i.e., F-
       15 behind F-16, F-16 behind A-10, etc.).
   4.12.3. RSRS standards are NOT authorized under the following situations:
       4.12.3.1. Any situation involving an emergency aircraft, civil aircraft or air evacuation
       aircraft.
       4.12.3.2. Touch-and-go behind full stop.
       4.12.3.3. Low approach behind a touch-and-go.
       4.12.3.4. Any situation involving aircraft “cleared for the option” or “cleared stop and
       go”.
       4.12.3.5. When the runway condition is reported as ice or snow.
       4.12.3.6. When braking action reports of poor or nil are reported.
   4.12.4. RSRS between formation full stops (holding hands) are authorized provided all
   aircraft involved are the same type aircraft (all F-15s, all F-16s, etc.). Separation is measured
   between the trailing aircraft in the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the trailing
   formation.
   4.12.5. Robins Tower will control formation flights as a single aircraft and does not apply
   RSRS standards between aircraft within the same formation. Separation between aircraft
   within the formation is the responsibility of the pilots.

4.13. Opposite Direction Take-Offs and Landings.
      4.13.1. Coordination for opposite direction operations shall include the phrase, “opposite
      direction departure or arrival, runway (number).”
      4.13.2. Opposite direction operations will be approved when an operational necessity exists
      (traffic permitting). When opposite direction operations are requested for training, Robins
      Tower Watch Supervisor will approve or disapprove based on traffic conditions, required
      separation, controller training, etc., and whether or not it will impede operations to the
      runway in use.
      4.13.3. Unless tower applies visual separation criteria, the following separation standards for
      opposite direction operations shall be used:
         4.13.3.1. Arrival versus Arrival. The succeeding aircraft will be no closer than 10 mile
         final until the proceeding aircraft crosses the landing threshold.
         4.13.3.2. Departure/Low Approach versus Arrival. A departing or low approach aircraft
         must be airborne and turned to a 45 offset heading prior to the arriving aircraft reaching a
         point no closer than 7 mile final.
      4.13.4. Opposite direction operations may be discontinued at the discretion of air traffic
      controlling agencies.
4.14. Unusual Maneuvers. ATC cannot approve pilot requests to conduct unusual maneuvers
unless the maneuver is essential to performance of flight. Unusual maneuvers include
unnecessary low passes, unscheduled fly bys, practice instrument approaches to altitudes below
specific minimums, fighter demonstrations, etc. All requests to conduct an unusual maneuver,
specifically maneuvers where a waiver is required, must be coordinated through 78 OSS/OSA
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                35


and approved by the wing commander or designated representative NLT 60 days prior to the
event. Simulated flameout/practice precautionary approaches are not authorized at Robins AFB.
Note: This does not apply to F-15 Landing Gear Inspection procedures in paragraph 5.17.
4.15. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification Procedures.
   4.15.1. Responsibilities. Each host base and Mission Partner organization expecting a DV
   will furnish all known information concerning the visit to Robins Command Post,
   Commander’s Action Group, Office of Public Affairs, Protocol, and 78 OSS Airfield
   Operations. Note: DVs are O-7, SES, and higher positions. Lower grades/positions (IG
   Teams, etc.) may be included if approved by Protocol.
   4.15.2. Commander’s Action Group will contact AMOPS daily in the morning and at the
   end of normal workday to advise of any DV expected at Robins within the next 48 hours.
   4.15.3. Robins Tower will:

       4.15.3.2. Taxi all DV aircraft in and out of the ramp via Taxiway G unless otherwise
       specified by AMOPS.
   4.15.4. AMOPS will:
       4.15.4.1. Check the online DV flight schedule at the start of each shift. If any DVs are
       scheduled to arrive or depart Robins AFB that day, the information will be transferred to
       that day’s events log. When an inbound message concerning an aircraft carrying a DV is
       received over the AISR, all information will be logged on the Distinguished Visitors Call
       List, and the DV information will be passed to Robins Tower, Robins Command Post,
       and TA.
       4.15.4.2. Activate the DV conference net anytime notification is received of a visiting
       General Officer or equivalent from any branch of service actually inbound to Robins
       AFB. This call will be made even if the General Officer is a thru passenger or
       crewmember. As needed, ask Command Post to notify WR-ALC/CC & 78 ABW/CC.
       4.15.4.3. Pass name, rank, branch of service, aircraft call sign, type of aircraft, estimated
       time of arrival (ETA; Local Time), point of departure, and any other known information
       over the DV conference net. In the case of a thru DV, AMOPS will ensure that they pass
       the anticipated ground time.
       4.15.4.4. Poll the DV call list and post initials to ensure each station received the
       information. During normal duty hours if a station does not answer the DV conference
       net, call that station on a normal landline and pass the information.
       4.15.4.5. AMOPS will not activate the DV conference net for Robins AFB assigned
       General Officers. When WR-ALC/CC is inbound during normal duty hours, AMOPS
       will notify the General Officer's office. After normal duty hours notify the Robins
       Command Post. When notification is received that a HQ AFRC assigned General Officer
       is inbound, notify the Air Force Reserve Command Center.
       4.15.4.6. Responsible Protocol offices must e-mail approved welcome and farewell
       messages to be placed on the electronic marquee for visiting DVs at least 48 hours prior
       to DVs arrival along with the times the message should be displayed. Email marquee

         net.
         4.15.4.9. When an aircraft is inbound to pick-up a DV, call Robins Command Post and
         Protocol for visiting DVs or the appropriate office for base assigned DVs on a normal
         landline and pass all known information.
         4.15.4.10. Unless pre-coordinated or unusual conditions exist, park all DV aircraft on the
         red carpet. If there are multiple DV aircraft, park the aircraft carrying the highest-ranking
         DV on the red carpet.
      4.15.5. TA will:
         4.15.5.1. Provide “Follow-me” service to DV aircraft from the intersection of Taxiway G
         and the ramp unless otherwise specified by AMOPS.
         4.15.5.2. Coordinate changes in aircraft parking location and route with AMOPS.
         4.15.5.3. Notify the Fuels Service Center (468-4403) to have a fuel truck standing by at
         aircraft’s block time.
         4.15.5.4. Ensure appropriate power units, heating and cooling units, unloading stands,
         fire bottles and stairs (if needed) are available to provide optimum service.
         4.15.5.5. Notify AMOPS immediately of any known problems concerning movement or
         handling of the DV aircraft.
4.16. Aeromedical Airlift Support. AMOPS will notify Robins Tower, Fire Department, and
78th Medical Group of any inbound aeromedical aircraft. Robins Tower will relay any support
requirements received from the aircrew to AMOPS.
4.17. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. NVD operations are defined as: conducting
flight operations with the aid of night vision devices in conjunction with reduced airfield
lighting. NVD operations schedulers shall, to the maximum extent possible, de-conflict NVD
flight operations with other base assigned units. Flying units will note "NVD Operations at
WRB" in the remarks section on the flight plan.
      4.17.1. NVD operations may continue normally when the Certified Tower Radar Display
      (CTRD) is out of service. Robins Tower will notify aircrews that the CTRD is out of service.
      4.17.2. Intersection departures are authorized during all NVD operations.
      4.17.3. Instrument approaches are authorized during all NVD options however; approach
      lights and PAPIs will not be available.
      4.17.4. Aircraft experiencing radio failure (NORDO) shall discontinue NVD use as soon as
      practical to allow reception of Tower light gun signals.
      4.17.5. AMOPS shall issue a NOTAM advertising the NVD training period and that “no
      approach light minima” applies.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              37


   4.17.6. Aircraft lighting. NVD aircraft position/strobe lights will remain on IAW AFI 11-
   202, Vol 3 and FAR Part 91.209. NVD aircraft may use either covert or overt (visible)
   landing lights, as the situation warrants.
   4.17.7. NVD Taxi routes. Aircraft will follow normal taxi routes during NVD operations.
   4.17.8. NVD Traffic Patterns. Aircrews may request rectangular, overhead, or Threat
   Avoidance Arrival/Departure traffic patterns while conducting NVD operations, and will
   follow standard traffic patterns/altitudes as described in Chapter 4. Crews must inform
   Robins Tower in a timely fashion when requesting other than standard pattern altitudes (to
   ensure proper coordination/spacing/sequencing).
   4.17.9. Airfield lighting. Robins Tower is authorized to modify airfield lighting to the
   runway to include the PAPIs, REILs, approach lights, and runway/taxiway lights when
   requested by aircraft conducting NVD operations.
   4.17.10. There are two types of NVD lighting operations available to NVD aircraft:
   Minimum Lighting and Blacked Out. These procedures supplement FAA JO 7110.65 and
   AFI 13-204V3. Note: Air traffic controllers will not, at any time, utilize NVDs. Robins
   Tower will maintain the lowest practical interior light setting.
       4.17.10.1. Tower shall turn off airfield lighting only after all non-NVD aircraft have
       departed the Class D airspace.
       4.17.10.2. By definition, when aircrew request:
“MIN LIGHTING”: PAPIs and approach lights will be turned off and runway lighting will be
turned down to its lowest level.
“BLACKED OUT LIGHTING”: PAPIs and approach lights and runway lighting will be
turned off. Infra-Red AMP-3 lighting will be turned on to the runway in use.
Note: Minimum Lighting and Blacked Out Lighting are available between sunset and sunrise,
traffic and weather permitting. The availability of Blacked Out Lighting is contingent on user-
installation of Infra-Red AMP-3 lighting on the airfield.
       4.17.10.3. Upon transfer from Atlanta TRACON or at any time within the VFR pattern,
       pilots will use the following phraseology when requesting NVD operations:
“ROBINS TOWER, BOXCAR 20 REQUESTING MIN LIGHTING/BLACKED OUT
LIGHTING FOR NVD OPERATIONS.”
After acknowledging approval, ground and local control shall issue the following:
“ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, NVD OPERATIONS IN EFFECT.”
Additionally, the following ATIS advisory will be broadcast until operations are terminated:
“NVD OPERATIONS IN EFFECT. NON-NVD AIRCRAFT CONTACT ROBINS GROUND
ON 275.8 OR 121.85 FIFTEEN MINUTES PRIOR TO ARRIVAL TIME.”
       4.17.10.4. All taxiway lighting will normally remain on during NVD operations. Upon
       request from aircrews, taxiway lights may be turned off if taxiways are not in use.
       However, the rotating beacon will remain on at all times.
 38                                                  ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


      4.17.11. NVD operations shall be terminated or suspended and airfield lighting returned to
      the appropriate normal/overt nighttime settings prior to an arriving non-NVD VFR aircraft
      entering the Class D surface area, or a non-NVD inbound IFR aircraft reaching the final
      approach fix (FAF) or 6 NM, and will remain on until the aircraft has exited the runway.
      Tower shall broadcast an advisory on all frequencies (except 121.5 and 243.0) and allow
      approximately 1 minute for aircrew to transition from NVD to regular nighttime operations
      as required. Reduced airfield lighting shall be terminated because of, but not limited to, the
      following: Unsafe airfield conditions, emergency response, or non-participating aircraft
      departure or arrival. Robins Tower and/or the aircrew have the authority to terminate
      reduced lighting. Controllers will transmit the following:
“NVD OPERATIONS WILL BE TERMINATED IN ONE MINUTE FOR (reason).”
Robins Tower shall wait 1-minute and return all airfield lighting to normal/overt. Note:
Aircrews may continue to use NVDs IAW applicable regulations; however, termination of NVD
operations indicates that NVD operations are suspended/cancelled and normal air traffic control

                                EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

5.1. Responsibilities During Emergencies. An emergency includes any situation which places
an aircraft in danger, uncertainty, or distress. The pilot, ATC facilities, or officials responsible
for the operation of the aircraft may declare an emergency involving aircraft on the ground or in
the air. Any delays or reluctance on the part of the pilot to declare an emergency could result in
emergency vehicles and support agencies not responding in time to save lives or property. Base
and depot activities will deal with emergency situations according to RAFB IEMP 10-2,
Installation Emergency Management Plan.
   5.1.1. When Robins Tower receives information concerning an aircraft accident, emergency,
   bomb threat, etc., the PCAS shall be activated and AMOPS shall activate the SCN, both IAW
   with this instruction. Note: It is imperative that Robins Tower and AMOPS have knowledge
   of any airfield emergency, whether or not an aircraft is involved, in order to ensure that
   proper protective measures can be implemented. Anyone observing an incident that could be
   classified as an emergency should immediately contact AMOPS and/or Robins Tower by the
   most expeditious means.
       5.1.1.1. Robins Tower personnel should (when applicable) plot aircraft/incident area
       coordinates using the Base Grid Map and relay information to appropriate agencies when
       requested.
   5.1.2. Crash recovery support from TA. Crash recovery support will be IAW RAFBI 21-
   115, Crashed, Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR). TA is the CDDAR
   Coordinator and serves as the on-scene focal point for the coordination of 78 ABW support
   agencies, equipment and other services needed for recovery operations. The CDDAR
   Coordinator reports directly to the IC. TA will also provide escorts to and from active
   taxi/runway.
5.2. Off-Base Mishap Response Procedures. Aircraft mishaps occurring off base will be
handled IAW RAFB IEMP 10-2, Installation Emergency Management Plan, RAFB Plan 91-1,
Aircraft Mishap Response Plan, and locally established checklists.
5.3. Activation of the Primary Crash Alarm System.
   5.3.1. The PCAS will be activated by Robins Tower for all aircraft emergencies, airfield
   accidents, or at other times deemed appropriate. Such times include, but are not limited to:
       5.3.1.1. Emergency bailout/jettison.
       5.3.1.2. Controlled bailout/jettison.
       5.3.1.3. Hot brakes (actual or suspected).
       5.3.1.4. Emergency Power Unit (EPU) activation or suspected hydrazine leak.
       5.3.1.5. Emergency civil aircraft landing.
       5.3.1.6. Airfield attack (actual or simulated).

5.5. Aerodrome Closure/Suspension of Runway Operations.
      5.5.1. The AFM is the primary authority to close and open the airfield.
      5.5.2. Robins Tower Watch Supervisor, AFM, or AFM designated authority may suspend
      runway operations when a hazard exists on or near the runway or in the immediate approach
      area. Runway operations will be suspended by the Watch Supervisor after an emergency
      aircraft lands as determined by the nature of the emergency.
      5.5.3. Runway operations shall remain suspended until a runway check is completed by
      AMOPS.
      5.5.4. Crash/rescue and other emergency responding vehicles shall request permission from
      Robins Ground prior to entering the runway.
5.6. Robins Tower and AMOPS Evacuation Procedures.
      5.6.1. Robins Tower will be evacuated when:
         5.6.1.1. Wind speeds reach 60 knots either sustained or in gusts.
         5.6.1.2. A tornado is observed, visually or on radar, and the movement is such that it will
         pass in close proximity to the airport.
         5.6.1.3. A fire, observed or reported, which could endanger personnel in Robins Tower.
         5.6.1.4. A bomb threat has been received and the AOF/CC, CCTLR, or other competent
         authority has directed evacuation.
         5.6.1.5. Whenever the AOF/CC, CCTLR or Watch Supervisor deems it necessary.
      5.6.2. During Robins Tower evacuation, the airfield will be uncontrolled and Robins Class D
      airspace will revert to Class E airspace. Robins Tower does not have an alternate location.
      5.6.3. Upon returning to Robins Tower, the Watch Supervisor will accomplish the facility-
      opening checklist. After the opening checklist is completed, the Watch Supervisor will
      advise the appropriate facilities that Robins Tower has returned to service and is operational.
      At that time, normal air traffic control operations will resume.
      5.6.4. When AMOPS is evacuated the following will occur:
         5.6.4.1. AMOPS will activate the SCN.
         5.6.4.2. AMOPS will inform OSS personnel in building 110 that AMOPS is evacuating
         (state reason).
         5.6.4.3. The designated evacuation facility is Building 2045.
         5.6.4.4. Once AMOPS is at its evacuation facility, AMOPS will activate the SCN via
         conference call to inform agencies of their new location, phone number(s), and fax
         number. Recording capability of AMOPS communications is not available at alternate
         facility.
         5.6.4.5. Prior to returning to building 110, AMOPS will activate the SCN to inform
         agencies of its relocating to building 110. Once located at building 110, AMOPS will
         activate the SCN to inform agencies that they are back to normal operation.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              43


5.7. Emergency Bailout/Jettison Procedures. (See Figure A6.1)
   5.7.1. Controlled Bailout Procedures. The controlled bailout area is located on the MCN
   120° radial from 8 to 10 DME. Aircrews should approach the area on a 120° heading at a
   minimum altitude of 2,000’ MSL. If able, bring throttles to idle and initiate ejection passing
   8 DME. If unable, aircrews will attempt to bail out at a location that is optimum for crew
   survival and minimizes damage from aircraft-ground impact.
   5.7.2. Controlled Jettison Procedures. The recommended external stores jettison area and
   cargo jettison area are located southeast of the field along the extended centerline of Runway
   33. The zone is approximately 1.5 NM long, 1 NM wide and is centered on the MCN
   VORTAC 138 degree radial between the 6.5 and 8-mile DME fixes. When possible, pilots
   will use ILS with radar assistance from Atlanta TRACON for jettisoning stores/cargo.
   5.7.3. Pilots jettisoning stores in VFR or IFR weather conditions will contact Atlanta
   TRACON for radar vectors. Approach control will provide vectors to the Runway 33 final
   approach course at the appropriate altitude, clear the aircraft for an approach, and advise the
   pilot when aircraft are entering and leaving the approximate location of the jettison area. The
   jettison is made immediately upon entering the area at an altitude not above 1,500 feet MSL.
   5.7.4. If the weapons fragmentation pattern for the stores being jettisoned requires a higher
   altitude, coordination with ATC is required. When radar is not available or communications
   cannot be established, the jettison will be made inbound on the 138 degree radial off of the
   MCN VORTAC immediately after passing the 8-mile DME fix.
5.8. Fuel Dump Procedures.
   5.8.1. Only emergency aircraft are authorized to jettison fuel.
   5.8.2. Each flying unit’s OG/CC or designated representative is the approval authority for
   fuel jettisoning.
   5.8.3. Advise Atlanta Center prior to and upon completion of fuel jettisoning.
   5.8.4. The primary fuel dump area is on the Colliers (113.9 IRQ) 217 radial between the 25
   NM and the 50 NM fixes at or above FL210, holding southwest (right hand pattern). DO
   NOT depart the holding pattern until dumping is complete.
5.9. Hot Brake Procedures. IAW paragraph 2.11.3., all hot brake situations, potential and
confirmed, will be handled as emergencies. Robins Tower will activate the PCAS. AMOPS will
activate the SCN.
5.10. Hydrazine Procedures. IAW paragraph 2.11.4., aircraft which have activated the
emergency power unit or are suspected of having a hydrazine leak, will be directed to taxi to
Taxiway D West or Taxiway F. The PCAS will be activated for all suspected and confirmed
hydrazine leaks.
5.11. Hazardous/Dangerous Cargo Procedures. AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for
Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials, and AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials
for Military Air Shipments, outline handling and precautionary measures for aircraft carrying
hazardous material.
   5.11.1. Routine use of Robins AFB by transient, explosives-loaded aircraft carrying DoD
   Class/Division 1.1 or 1.2 munitions and/or Department of Transportation (DoT) Class A/B
 44                                                   ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


      poisons is discouraged. However, Robins AFB can support mission essential movements of
      munitions or hazardous cargo destined for Robins AFB, and/or in-flight emergencies when
      required.
      5.11.2. If the pilot of an explosives loaded aircraft or a hazardous cargo aircraft declares an
      in-flight emergency and requires landing at Robins AFB, Robins Tower shall activate the
      PCAS and, in addition to the information in para. 5.3.3., relay the following information:
         5.11.2.1. Hazardous material on board (DoT or DoD Class/Division).
         5.11.2.2. Aircraft position.
         5.11.2.3. Net Explosive Weight (NEW).
      5.11.3. Upon landing, aircraft will be instructed to proceed to the Hazardous Cargo Pad or
      designated parking spot, IAW paragraph 2.11.5.
      5.11.4. If Maintenance Control/Command Post receives notification (by means other than
      the SCN) of an in-flight emergency involving an explosives-loaded aircraft or an aircraft
      with hazardous cargo aboard, they shall relay all information to Robins Tower. Robins
      Tower will then activate the PCAS.
      5.11.5. The AFM or designated representative will ensure the DoT class of hazardous
      material on board is passed if Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) is notified of
      an overdue or missing aircraft. The AFM is also responsible for alerting all required base
      support activities and ensuring notification and coordination requirements are completed and
      complied with according to the requirements and procedures of AFJI 11-204, Operational
      Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials.
      5.11.6. Base support activities include:
         5.11.6.1. Robins Tower.
         5.11.6.2. Air/Passenger Terminal, building 127, when staffed.
         5.11.6.3. Fire Protection.
         5.11.6.4. Security Forces Operations.
         5.11.6.5. Disaster Response Force as required.
      5.11.7. Base and mission partner activities receiving or having information on arrival or
      departure of aircraft carrying hazardous materials shall immediately notify AMOPS.
5.12. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Procedures.
      5.12.1. When an ELT signal is received on frequencies 121.5 and/or 243.0, Robins Tower
      will contact AMOPS. AMOPS will respond according to AMOPS Operating Instruction.
      5.12.2. The PCAS should not be activated routinely when a beacon signal is received
      because inadvertent activations occur frequently with these beacon systems. Initially, notify
      AMOPS via direct line. AMOPS is designated as the control coordinator for unscheduled
      ELT signals. AMOPS personnel will notify required local agencies and initiate search
      actions to locate and silence signals caused by inadvertent activation. Life Support will assist
      AMOPS in search actions as needed. If there is evidence the signal is being received from a
      downed aircraft, the PCAS will be activated and Atlanta Center will be notified.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                            45


   5.12.3. Conduct ELT tests during the first five minutes of each hour, limited to no more than
   three audible sweeps.
5.13. Hot Gun/Hung Ordnance Procedures. Aircrews experiencing hot gun/hung ordnance
(weapons or flares) will advise Atlanta TRACON or Robins Tower on initial contact of the
situation, declare an emergency and request routing to avoid populated areas.
   5.13.1. Upon notification of an aircraft with hot gun/hung ordnance, Robins Tower will:
      5.13.1.1. Activate the PCAS and pass all known information.
      5.13.1.2. Taxi the aircraft to the primary hot gun/hung ordnance parking area. If the
      primary location is not available coordinate with AMOPS for an alternate location. Note:
      Hung chaff is not considered hung ordnance. Such aircraft will recover via normal
      recovery and parking procedures.
5.14. Unauthorized/Unannounced Aircraft Arrivals. Handling of unauthorized/unannounced
aircraft arrivals will be IAW Robins Integrated Defense Plan 31-101.
   5.14.1. No flight plan arrival with radio contact.
      5.14.1.1. When Robins Tower receives notification through the ATC system of the
      arrival of a military aircraft for which a flight plan has not been received, Robins Tower
      will:
          5.14.1.1.1. Pass to AMOPS the aircraft call sign, type, and estimated time of arrival
          (ETA).
          5.14.1.1.2. Allow the aircraft to land.
      5.14.1.2. When Robins tower receives notification through the ATC system of the arrival
      of a civil aircraft for which a flight plan has not been received, Robins Tower will:
          5.14.1.2.1. Contact AMOPS via direct line to determine whether a flight plan has
          been filed/received.
          5.14.1.2.2. Request the pilot contact AMOPS on pilot-to-dispatch (PTD) frequency
          134.1. If the pilot is unable to contact AMOPS, relay the following information to
          AMOPS by direct landline:
              5.14.1.2.2.1. Aircraft identification and type.
              5.14.1.2.2.2. Departure and destination point.
              5.14.1.2.2.3. Type flight plan (VFR or IFR).
              5.14.1.2.2.4. DV/cargo/passenger information.
              5.14.1.2.2.5. Intentions.
              5.14.1.2.2.6. Prior Permission Required number.
      5.14.1.3. When notified by Robins Tower of a “no flight plan” arrival with which
      communication has been established, AMOPS will:
          5.14.1.3.1. Attempt to verify flight plan via FAA, Flight Service Station (FSS),
          calling departure point, etc.
 46                                                    ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013


             5.14.1.3.2. Grant or deny landing approval, according to current instructions.
             5.14.1.3.3. Notify base support units to provide special handling, security, medical
             support, etc.
      5.14.2. No flight plan arrival without radio contact.
         5.14.2.1. If an aircraft lands without having filed an inbound flight plan and without
         previous radio contact, Robins Tower will immediately:
             5.14.2.1.1. Activate the PCAS and give pertinent details, such as aircraft type,
             landing runway, position, taxi routing, or suspicious actions. If the aircraft starts
             taxiing toward the east side of the airfield, immediately advise emergency response
             vehicles (due to time required for security interception).
             5.14.2.1.2. Attempt to establish communications with the aircraft. If contact with the
             aircraft is made, direct the pilot to Taxiway C west adjacent to Taxiway J. Attempt to
             determine the point of departure, intentions, original destination and if a flight plan
             has been filed.
         5.14.2.2. After activation of the PCAS, AMOPS will:
             5.14.2.2.1. Immediately respond to the scene to intercept and assist the SFS with the
             aircraft and crew.
             5.14.2.2.2. Activate the SCN.
5.15. Lost Communications Procedures. All aircraft experiencing radio malfunctions or with
no radio (NORDO) communications capability will handle the situation IAW the Aeronautical
Information Manual and FAA JO 7110.65.
      5.15.1. Aircraft experiencing radio malfunctions prior to leaving the parking area shall
      ensure the equipment is repaired prior to taxiing for departure. If radio malfunction occurs
      after departing the parking area, watch the tower for a light gun signal or monitor tower
      frequency.
      5.15.2. Attracting attention of Robins Tower. To attempt contact with Robins Tower, pilots
      should turn on a landing light and taxi the aircraft into a position, clear of the active runway,
      with its light visible to the tower. During night time operations, the pilot should flash landing
      lights towards the tower. Comply with the appropriate light gun signals received from
      Robins Tower. (See Figure A7.1)
      5.15.3. Acknowledging Robins Tower broadcasts. Between sunrise and sunset, fixed-wing
      aircraft on the ground will acknowledge Robins Tower broadcasts or light gun signals by
      moving the ailerons or rudder. If the aircraft is in flight, acknowledge transmissions by
      rocking wings back and forth. Between sunset and sunrise, acknowledge Robins Tower
      broadcasts by flashing navigation or landing lights. Ensure the aircraft is positioned where
      the landing light is visible to Robins Tower. Between sunrise and sunset, helicopters will,
      while hovering, either turn the helicopter toward the controlling facility and flash the landing
      light or rock the tip path plane. While in flight, helicopters will either flash the landing light
      or rock the tip path plane. Between sunset and sunrise, helicopters will flash landing light or
      search light.
ROBINSAFBI13-204 21 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               47


5.16. Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft.
   5.16.1. Procedures.     RAFB PLAN 13-207, Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, outlines
   responsibilities and specific procedures for base and depot activities regarding aircraft theft
   and hijack. Also see AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijack) for
   further guidance. Robins Tower will safeguard against, and handle acts of unlawful seizure,
   as follows:
   5.16.2. Anti-theft. AMOPS authorizes all aircraft ground taxi movement. Aircraft taxiing or
   requesting permission to taxi without prior notice will be delayed by Robins Tower until
   approval is obtained. If the aircraft continues the unauthorized operation, Robins Tower will
   make one broadcast in the blind for the aircraft to hold position. If the aircraft fails to
   respond, Robins Tower will activate the PCAS giving pertinent situation details, aircraft
   type, tail number, and position.
   5.16.3. Hijack. Report known hijacking situations via the PCAS to AMOPS. Robins Tower
   will attempt to have the pilot taxi to the Hazardous Cargo Pad as appropriate, restrict other
   taxi movements in the area, assist the IC with communications as necessary or directed, and
   remain vigilant for detection of hijack signaling codes heard or observed.
5.17. F-15 Landing Gear Inspection Procedures. F-15 aircraft experiencing hydraulic or
landing gear malfunctions may be required to fly by Robins Tower and/or F-15 Functional Test
Maintenance (Bldg. 131) for visual confirmation of landing gear/gear door position to determine
whether a barrier engagement is required.
   5.17.1. When available, visual inspection from another airborne F-15 is preferred over visual
   inspection from tower/ground based personnel.
   5.17.2. Pilots shall advise Robins Tower as soon as possible when a landing gear inspection
   is required.
       5.17.2.1. Pilots requesting to fly the below procedures will use the term “Landing Gear
       Inspection Procedure.”
          5.17.2.1.1. Controllers shall acknowledge the request for the Landing Gear
          Inspection Procedure (traffic permitting) with “Landing Gear Inspection approved” or
          “Proceed as requested, use caution uncontrolled area” (controllers shall not “clear”
          aircraft for this procedure).
          5.17.2.1.2. Controllers shall not approve the requested procedure when aircraft are
          taxiing/being towed on Taxiway H. Note: Taxiway H is a nonmovement area.
          5.17.2.1.3. Controllers shall broadcast via the Ramp Net and Ground Control
          frequencies, “Attention all vehicles and aircraft, use caution, F-15 commencing low-
          level flight east of Taxiway H at 100 feet.”
   5.17.3. Landing Gear Inspection Procedure. Pilots will configure aircraft and set up for the
   inspection pattern via published traffic pattern procedures. Upon approval for the Landing
   Gear Inspection Procedure, pilots will fly parallel to Taxiway H, offset slightly east to remain
   over the infield grass, and pass abeam Robins Tower cab at no lower than 100’AGL. Pilots
   will reenter the VFR pattern as directed by Robins Tower.

     5.17.3.1. Controllers conducting landing gear inspection should focus on confirming that
     all three landing gear are down and not cocked sideways. Additionally, the controller
     may be required to verify the status of the main landing gear forward doors (open or
     closed). Controllers shall use phraseology IAW FAA JO 7110.65 when relaying their
     observations to the pilot “Landing gear appears (up/down), doors appear (open/closed)”.

          Emergency

       LEVEL A: Firefighting and Rescue capability is adequate to manage common
       emergencies involving aircraft and structures. No vehicle or manpower limitations
       exist beyond built-in acceptable risk. Continue normal activity.

       LEVEL B: Firefighting and Rescue capability are less than optimum to assure
       successful aircraft firefighting and rescue involving large aircraft or structural fire
       suppression. Consider curtailing hazardous maintenance activities such as fuel
       systems work in facilities without properly installed fire protection systems.
       Consider reducing large aircraft movements.

       LEVEL C: Firefighting and Rescue capabilities are minimal. Vehicle and
       manpower limitations will prevent successful firefighting and rescue from any
       aircraft when fire is beyond its incipient stages. Consider stopping all aircraft
       maintenance activities performed inside, all fuel cell repairs, and all aircraft
       movements that are not mission essential.

       LEVEL D: Firefighting and Rescue capability are almost nonexistent. Vehicle
       and manpower limitations are expected to prevent successful firefighting or rescue.
       All activities that create or contribute to increased fire risk should cease, including
       all aircraft movements and maintenance.
