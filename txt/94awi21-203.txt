1. General. Aircraft hangar doors can be extremely dangerous if operated by unqualified
personnel. In addition, personnel in the vicinity of hangar doors can be injured or killed if not
aware of proper hangar door practices and procedures.
2. Responsibilities. Supervisors will ensure only properly trained and qualified personnel
operate hangar doors.
3. Operation of Hangar Doors. Only qualified personnel, approved by the squadron
commander or designated representative, shall be authorized to operate hangar doors. Operators
shall be thoroughly familiar with operating instructions and precautions necessary for safe
operation. Written operating procedures outlining all safety precautions to operate the doors are
posted next to the operating controls on the hangar doors.
4. Safeguards. The following safety items must be thoroughly understood and accomplished by
personnel authorized to operate hangar doors.
     4.1. Prior to door movement, the operator will:
        4.1.1. Check inside and outside of doors as well as door pockets for personnel or
        equipment. Ensure there are no personnel or equipment in the 5 feet minimum clear zone
        outlined by yellow or yellow and black line marking, interior and exterior.
        4.1.2. Ensure all personnel doors are latched closed and locked (if equipped) prior to
        operating the hangar door.
        4.1.3. Warn all nearby personnel of hangar door movement.
     4.2. The operator will ensure that personnel, vehicles and equipment are not moved through
     the doorway when the door is in motion. (Exception: Emergency response personnel,
     vehicles and equipment when responding to an emergency.)
     4.3. Doors will be operated only after the operator ascertains that it is safe to do so. The
     operator will ensure that the door-warning signal is working properly. NOTE: Warning
     devices will sound for a minimum of five seconds before door begins to move.
     4.4. The operator will immediately stop the procedure whenever improper door operation or
     any unsafe condition is observed or suspected. Unsafe or improper door operation and/or
     illegible safety markings must be immediately reported to your supervisor, safety
     representative or facility manager.
     4.5. Under normal conditions, powered hangar or shelter doors shall be opened at least 10
     feet. For special operations, such as during extreme weather conditions, the door may be
     opened less than 10 feet only if the door control switch is locked off or out until the door can
     be opened to 10 feet or more, or be closed. Each door may be opened independently but the
     door must be opened to the minimum safe distance of 10 feet which is marked on the floor
     with a red line. This is the safe opening distance to prevent injury or death to personnel in
     the event of an abnormal event.
     4.6. No one will be permitted to pass between hangar doors when they are opened less than
     10 feet. Failure to comply could result in injury or death.
     4.7. The tail door and horizontal doors will be in their fully opened position while aircraft
     are towed into or out of a hangar. Hangar doors will be opened to allow at least 10 foot
94AWI21-203 8 APRIL 2014                                                                        3


   wingtip clearance on either side. If hangar construction does not permit such clearance, the
   doors shall be opened to the maximum limit.
   4.8. All roll-up doors will be opened to their full open position before motor vehicles or
   personnel enter or exit through them. Roll-up doors may be partially opened for ventilation
   as long as there is a barricade to ensure personnel or vehicles do not pass through the
   opening.
5. Training.
   5.1. Supervisors will ensure all personnel, within their control, are properly trained prior to
   working around or operating hangar doors. There are two types of hangar door training:
   Hangar Door Awareness training and Hangar Door Operator training.
   5.2. Hangar Door Awareness training. Workers who routinely work in hangars or require
   access through hangar doors shall receive Hangar Door Awareness training, both an initial
   training program and annual refresher course. Courses shall include, at a minimum, door
   hazards, emergency procedures (including manual door operation) and safe operation.
   Refresher training will be conducted annually covering door hazards, emergency procedures
   and safe operation. Hangar Door Awareness Training will be conducted as follows:
      5.2.1. For 94 Maintenance Group (MXG) personnel, Hangar Door Awareness training
      will be conducted annually using the approved plan located on the MXG public Training
      server. The work center supervisor or authorized trainer(s) shall conduct the Hangar
      Door Awareness training.
      5.2.2. For all personnel other than 94 MXG, Hangar Door Awareness training will be
      conducted annually using the approved plan maintained by the Facility manager. Units
      will document the annual training.
   5.3. Hangar Door Operator training. Hangar Door Operator training is one-time training
   required for all personnel who operate electric and manual hangar doors and is specific
   training related to each individual type of hangar door. Training will be documented for each
   type of hangar door. As a minimum, qualification training will include hangar door hazards,
   operation, and emergency procedures. Hangar Door Operator training will be conducted as
   follows:
      5.3.1. For 94 MXG personnel, Operator training is hands-on training taught only by
      personnel listed on the Hangar Door trainer letter. Hangar door trainers will be trained by
      94 MXG Quality Assurance (QA) and listed on the letter that will be signed by the 94
      MXG/CC or equivalent. Hangar door trainers will use the approved training materials
      provided by 94 MXG QA for each type of hangar door.
      5.3.2. For all personnel other than 94 MXG, Operator training is hands-on training taught
      only by personnel trained by 94 MXG QA. Personnel trained by 94 MXG QA will be
      listed on a letter maintained by 94 MXG QA. Hangar door trainers will use the approved
      training materials provided by 94 MXG QA for each type of hangar door. Units will
      document the Operator training.
   5.4. Facility managers will maintain the Hangar Door Operator training plan for the specific
   type(s) of doors installed as well as the Hangar Door Awareness training plan. The training
   plans will be managed and developed by 94 MXG QA office. Facility managers will

     coordinate with 94 MXG QA if the plans require revision due to hangar door changes. The
     plans will be reviewed annually by 94 MXG QA and distributed to the facility managers via
     a folder on the public server where the hangar door training plans are stored. Trainers will
     use the approved training plans to ensure personnel are adequately trained.
     5.5. Documentation of hangar door training for Maintenance Group personnel will be
     tracked in the G081 system using the following course codes:
        5.5.1. Hangar Door Awareness – SAFE 1101
        5.5.2. Hangar Door Operator Bldg 838 – DBNS 0838

     operators for each type of hangar door.
