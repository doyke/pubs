        outlined in this instruction for instructor duty.
1.3. Training Progression.
     1.3.1. Personnel must be entered into training per prescribed timelines outlined ins AFI 14-
     202 Volume 1, Intelligence Training.
     1.3.2. Qualification training progresses students from initial qualification through mission
     qualification and appropriate evaluations and/or certifications. There are three types of
     qualification training: IQT, MQT, and Specialized Training. Once an intelligence
     crewmember is trained and qualified via an initial mission evaluation, he or she achieves
     CMR status. Note: If there is no entry level position at unit for an Air Force Specialty Code
     (AFSC) and appropriate entry-level crew position IQT is unavailable, obtain Group CC-
     approved waiver for the individual to complete DGS 101 and local system training required
     for an entry-level crew position and then proceed to next tier position training.
        1.3.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT provides the initial training necessary
        to qualify students for basic duties in the weapon system and initial crew position without
        regard to a specific unit mission. IQT is addressed in Chapter 2 of this instruction.
        1.3.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT provides the training necessary to
        qualify personnel to perform tasks in support of AF DCGS assigned missions. AF DCGS
        personnel achieve Combat Mission Ready or Basic Mission Capable (BMC/CMR) status
        upon completion of a successful Initial Mission evaluation (INIT MSN). MQT is
        addressed in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
        1.3.2.3. Concurrent IQT/MQT. MQT should typically begin upon completion of IQT;
        however, when determined appropriate by the unit commander, intelligence personnel
AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                   9


       may begin MQT before completion of IQT, if training events and timelines make this
       option more practical. Member must complete IQT before fully completing MQT.
       1.3.2.4. Specialized Training. Specialized training is any skill necessary to carry out the
       unit’s assigned missions that are not required for every intelligence unit member. For AF
       DCGS units and for purposes of this instruction, specialized training outlines instructor
       and intelligence evaluator training requirements. Specialized training is addressed in
       Chapter 6 of this instruction.
1.4. Intelligence Personnel Status.
   1.4.1. Regression to Non-BMC/CMR (N-BMC/N-CMR). Once BMC/CMR status is
   awarded, failure to complete the required BMC/CMR CT and/or evaluation requirements will
   result in regression to N-BMC/N-CMR status. N-BMC/N-CMR personnel will accomplish
   required training and evaluation and be upgraded to BMC/CMR before performing
   operational duties.
   1.4.2. Proficiency Advance. Personnel may be accelerated through all standard qualification
   training requirements based on demonstrated proficiency or previous experience. The Unit
   Training Office will determine a training plan for students to move through qualification
   training while staying within policy guidelines.
   1.4.3. Remedial Training. Individuals who fail evaluations or do not maintain the required
   CT requirements will undergo remedial training. Remedial training will include the items
   identified as deficient in an evaluation or not completed during CT. Remedial training may
   culminate in an evaluation IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2, as supplemented.
1.5. Training Folders and Reports.
   1.5.1. Units will document and maintain personnel training folders IAW AFI 36-2201 and
   AFI 14-202 Volume 1.
   1.5.2. AF DCGS FTU will forward formal school records to the gaining unit.
   1.5.3. Crewmembers departing Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Permanent Change of
   Assignment (PCA) will hand-carry their AF DCGS training folder to the gaining unit if the
   folder is unclassified. Classified training folders will be forwarded to the gaining unit via
   appropriate channels.
   1.5.4. Training Folder Requirements. The Unit Training Office is responsible for the
   disposition and management of AF DCGS crew position training folders. Training will
   ensure complete, accurate, and timely documentation of each training event.
   1.5.5. Electronic training folders will be maintained in accordance with AF/A2 direction.
   1.5.6. The Training Task List (TTL), captured on an AF Form 797, Job Qualification
   Standard Continuation/Command JQS prescribes tasks required for operation and
   employment of the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) AN/GSQ-272 SENTINEL
   weapon system and applies to all units training and certifying AF DCGS crewmembers.
   TTLs define training requirements for skill set development that support the operational
   duties necessary for each crew position. TTLs are the basis for creating syllabi and training
   programs that develop the required knowledge and skill sets necessary for weapon system
   employment. The TTL includes all tasks in each functional area requiring training, and will

    be used as a management tool for developing, performing and documenting training, as part
    of the overall Qualification Training Package (QTP) for each crew position or certification.
    1.5.7. The QTP is a set of instructional documents designed for use at the unit level to
    qualify/certify an individual. A QTP includes or provides references to all documents and
    materials necessary to successfully train personnel on a given crew position or certification.
    It is composed of training objectives, references, the Job Qualification Standard (JQS), TTL,
    study guide, and training syllabus.
1.6. Waivers. AFISRA/CC is the waiver authority for this publication, authority can be
delegated. Submit waivers through appropriate training channels to AFISRA/A3T. Copies will
be in message or memo format. Note: HQ AFRC and ANG unit waivers will be coordinated
with their respective A2 prior to submission to AFISRA.
    1.6.1. The chart below depicts AFISRA/CC delegated waiver authority. All waivers
    approved lower than AFISRA will be forwarded up the appropriate chain of command to
    AFISRA/A3T in message or memo format quarterly.

                          INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines IQT for AF DCGS entry-level crew positions. IQT for
intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed (i.e., the AFSC-awarding
courses) and will take place at the AETC AF DCGS FTU. Formal training and a successful INIT
QUAL meets the criteria for crewmembers to achieve Basic Qualification (BQ) status.
2.2. Waivers. AFISRA will generate a waiver for in-unit IQT due to FTU non-availability for
Active Duty (AD) units. AFRC and NGB/A2 are the waiver authority for AFISRA-gained ARC
units and will forward all waiver requests regarding FTU waivers to AFISRA for review.
2.3. In-Unit IQT.
   2.3.1. Units are required to use AF DCGS FTU QTP.
   2.3.2. IQT Timeline. Students must complete in-unit IQT within the time limits specified in
   the QTP not to exceed 90 calendar days from IQT start date (120 calendar days for AFISRA-
   gained AFRC and ANG units). If training exceeds established time limits, the unit
   commander is the waiver authority and may grant a 30-day extension. Units must notify
   appropriate channels with the individual student’s name, rank, mission position, reason for
   delay, and an action plan. If a second 30-day extension is necessary it must be approved by
   the Group Commander. If a third extension is necessary, it must be approved by the Wing
   Commander. Further extensions will require appropriate headquarters approval.
   2.3.3. Personnel in IQT will not perform crew mission duties without direct instructor
   supervision.
   2.3.4. Personnel completing IQT will be evaluated IAW AF DCGS FTU standards for
   QUAL evaluation. Personnel attending in-unit IQT will be evaluated according to the same
   standards used by AF DCGS FTU for the end of course QUAL evaluation.
   2.3.5. Personnel approved to attend in-unit IQT will maintain a copy of the approved waiver
   and have their training performance documented in their training folder.
2.4. Refresher Training. For in-residence FTU graduates, unit commanders may authorize up
to 10 days for refresher training before the student is placed in MQT. Unit Training Office will
document the training in the individual’s training folder.
2.5. Formal Course Changes. Changes to IQT and QTP formal requirements can only be
made by AETC in coordination with AFISRA and will be determined at the TPT.

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel in an assigned
position to perform the unit mission. MQT execution will take into account the assigned crew
position, current qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented performance and/or
formal training achieved by each individual. MQT can be accomplished through internal
training sessions, external courses, or one-on-one instruction from a qualified instructor. At the
completion of MQT, applicable mission certifications, and a successful evaluation, individuals
are BMC/CMR for the applicable crew position. Applicable portions of MQT will be used to
create a re-qualification program for personnel who are in N-CMR or N-BMC status.
   3.1.1. Locally Developed Syllabi for MQT. When specific formal courseware is not
   published, units will forward locally developed syllabi for in-unit training through proper
   channels and forward to AFISRA for review, validation and approval prior to use in the field.
   Only AFISRA-approved syllabi are authorized for use in MQT.
3.2. MQT Timelines. MQT will be completed within the time limits specified below.
   3.2.1. For individuals completing in-unit IQT, the first MQT training event must be
   completed within 45 calendar days from the completion of IQT (including AFISRA-gained
   ANG and AFRC units). If entry into MQT is delayed, the Unit Commander may grant a 30-
   day extension and must be notified with individual’s name, rank, mission position and reason
   for delay. If a second 30-extension is necessary it must be approved by the Group
   Commander. If a third extension is necessary, it must be approved by the Wing Commander.
   Further extensions will require appropriate headquarters approval.
   3.2.2. Students must complete MQT within the time limits delineated, not to exceed 90
   calendar days (180 days for AFISRA-gained AFRC and ANG units). If training exceeds the
   prescribed time limits, the Unit Commander must be notified with the individual’s name,
   rank, mission position and reason for delay. If a second extension is necessary it must be
   approved by the Group Commander.
   3.2.3. Personnel in MQT may only perform primary crew position duties under the direct
   supervision of an instructor for that crew position. The instructor is responsible for all
   actions and intelligence data derived by the personnel in MQT under their supervision.
   3.2.4. Upgrade Training. Upgrade training provides MQT for Tier 1 and Tier 2 positions
   identified in Table A2.1
       3.2.4.1. Fast Track. Personnel identified by the unit commander with previous
       experience that directly translates to an AFISRA Mission Design Series (MDS), weapon
       system, intelligence function, or specific activity mission position can be placed into Fast
       Track status. Personnel placed into Fast Track status must complete IQT for an entry-
       level position and then must complete the MQT for Tier 1 upgrade mission position.
       3.2.4.2. Crew position prerequisites and progression requirements are shown in Table
       A2.2.

          position or obtain the appropriate waiver.
       3.2.4.5. Upgrade Training Timelines. Students must complete upgrade training within 90
       calendar days. If training exceeds established time limits, the unit commander is the
       waiver authority and may grant a 30-day extension. Units must notify appropriate
       channels with the individual student’s name, rank, mission position, reason for delay, and
       an action plan. If a second 30-day extension is necessary it must be approved by the
       Group Commander. If a third extension is necessary, it must be approved by the Wing
       Commander. Further extensions will require appropriate headquarters approval.
       3.2.4.6. Personnel must sit with an instructor for that crew position, until qualified. The
       instructor is responsible for all actions and intelligence data derived by the personnel in
       upgrade training under their supervision.
       3.2.4.7. Upgrade Training Knowledge and Task Training. For upgrade training, units
       will use applicable Qualification Training Packages (QTP). Common area instruction
       and performance-based academics will include all pertinent core tasks for each trained
       crew position.
          3.2.4.7.1. Locally developed syllabi for upgrade training. When specific formal
          courseware is not published, units will forward locally developed syllabi for in-unit
          training through proper channels and forward to AFISRA for review, validation and
          approval prior to use in the field. Only AFISRA approved syllabi are authorized for
          use in upgrade training.
       3.2.4.8. At the completion of upgrade training, and a successful INIT MSN, individuals
       achieve BMC/CMR for the applicable crew position.
       3.2.4.9. Upgrade Training Documentation. All upgrade training will be documented on
       an appropriately annotated AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
       Continuation/Command JQS. These forms will remain in the individual’s folder while
       assigned to an AF DCGS weapon system.

                               CERTIFICATION TRAINING

4.1. Certification Training. The process of training used for special capabilities, procedures
and rules to supplement qualification training. Certifications are attained through methods other
than qualification training and are verified by an instructor.
   4.1.1. Certifications.
       4.1.1.1. Enterprise-level certifications will be developed and maintained by a Subject
       Matter Expert (SME) wing/center/bureau, and approved and published by AFISRA.
       4.1.1.2. Units may develop unit-level certifications, as required. Forward copies to
       Higher Headquarters (HHQ) through appropriate channels for review.
       4.1.1.3. Initial Cadre. Initial personnel developing or receiving difference training will
       form the initial cadre for the new feature, variation capability or procedure and will be
       responsible for training and qualifying/certifying additional crews.
   4.1.2. Tabletop Certifications.
       4.1.2.1. Tabletop Certification is a tool available to Squadron/Detachment Commanders
       or their equivalents to expedite certification of crewmembers in a new mission area when
       there is insufficient time to certify via pre-existing methods.             Additionally,
       Squadron/Detachment Commanders or their equivalents may use Tabletop Certification
       to certify crewmembers on mission tasks that cannot be performed in a live-mission
       environment without adversely affecting safety or negatively impacting mission
       operations (e.g., CRITIC testing, emergency procedures, etc). The purpose of Tabletop
       Certification is to convey to the Commander that the crewmember(s) is/are prepared to
       perform the tasks safely and successfully.
           4.1.2.1.1. Tabletop Certification for a new mission area must include training and
           review of basic Area of Responsibility (AOR) information to include maps, major
           locations, OB, geographical features, and target weapon systems. Tabletop
           Certification for a mission task must include training, review and simulated execution
           of the mission task.
           4.1.2.1.2. Tabletop certifications will be documented in personnel training folders.
           4.1.2.1.3. Tabletop certifications expire after 120 days and must be replaced by
           formal certification methods if the mission continues.
   4.1.3. Certification Types. Certifications can include system upgrades or additions, AOR,
   mission specific functions, and are necessary supplements to certain weapon system
   qualifications. All certifications will be accomplished by completing open and/or closed-
   book written examinations and/or a positional/task performance ability assessment to the
   satisfaction of an instructor.
       4.1.3.1. Sensor certification.   Training conducted for changes to collection sensor
       capabilities.
AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                  21


      4.1.3.2. System certification.    Training conducted on changes to weapons system
      configurations.
      4.1.3.3. Mission Specific Certification.    Training conducted to meet unique mission
      support requirements.
      4.1.3.4. Enterprise-wide Certifications will be determined at TPT working groups.
      4.1.3.5. AOR Certifications. Training conducted to meet AOR specific operational
      requirements. AOR certifications will be accomplished annually by completing an open-
      book test with a minimum passing score of 85%. Failure to meet 85% on an AOR
      recertification will require an instructor review of items missed and retest on deficient
      subject areas within 48 hours.
          4.1.3.5.1. 480 ISRW is responsible to ensure the production of AOR certification
          material to include study guides and test banks IAW the provisions of AFI 14-202
          Volume 1, Intelligence Training, as supplemented, and this instruction.
          4.1.3.5.2. 480 ISRW is responsible to review and update AOR materials annually.
          4.1.3.5.3. AFISRA retains oversight responsibility and is the final authority of all
          published AOR certification training materials.
      4.1.3.6. AOR and mission specific certification training may be performed
      simultaneously with MQT or upgrade training when appropriate.
   4.1.4. Multiple Certifications. Personnel may hold multiple certifications. Certification
   assessments may be combined during a single mission event provided all required grading
   areas for each certification are covered. Closed-book portions may be combined into a single
   test/assessment covering all applicable certifications.
   4.1.5. Certifications expire on the last day of the 17th month following the month in which
   the certification was successfully completed and can be done in conjunction with applicable
   periodic evaluation.
   4.1.6. Certification Documentation.     All certification training, to include tabletop
   certifications, will be documented on AF Forms 797 and 623a and tracked on the Letter of
   Xs.
4.2. Difference Training.
   4.2.1. Difference Training (DT) is required for qualified/certified crewmembers when a new
   feature, variation, capability or procedure is initially introduced into the AF DCGS
   Enterprise, when an existing feature is introduced to a field site, or upon PCS or TDY to a
   new/different field site.
      4.2.1.1. Initial Introduction into DCGS Enterprise-Wide Feature Application
      4.2.1.1.1. When a new feature, variation, capability or procedure is initially introduced
      to the weapon system, it requires new certification for each applicable crew position. The
      OG/CC will identify, and Wing/CC will approve the initial cadre, which is responsible to
      develop initial training materials. Units will use these materials to conduct this type of
      difference training and award certifications to all applicable crew positions for successful
      mission execution.
22                                                      AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013


     4.2.1.2. Existing Feature Introduced to a field site Location
     4.2.1.2.1. DT is required when an existing feature, variation, capability or procedure is
     introduced to a field site that didn’t have it previously. That location will identify an
     initial cadre that will obtain training and training materials from a designated field site
     that operates with that feature.
     4.2.1.3. PCS/TDY to another field site
         4.2.1.3.1. Local area procedures for each field site may be different, and emergency
         area procedures for each field site will be different. When a qualified crewmember
         operates at another field site, that individual will require locally created DT prior to
         performing mission duties. Initial cadre is not necessary for this difference training
         type.
  4.2.2. DT may be incorporated into qualification and/or certification standards, as
  appropriate. Incorporation of difference training will be determined at the TPT.
  4.2.3. Units will use applicable AFISRA approved DT materials for enterprise-wide
  changes.
  4.2.4. Difference Training Timelines. Personnel that enter DT must accomplish the training
  within 60 calendar days (90 days for AFISRA-gained AFRC and ANG units) from the date
  entered into training.
  4.2.5. Difference Training Documentation. All enterprise-wide DT will be documented.
AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                 23


                                           Chapter 5

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

5.1. Continuation Training (CT). This chapter outlines intelligence CT requirements for CMR
and BMC AF DCGS personnel. CT maintains the knowledge, skills and abilities of intelligence
personnel at their assigned qualification status. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists
of knowledge tasks, typically delivered in unit internal training venues. These training topics
ensure familiarization with unit responsibilities, intelligence skills and AF DCGS capabilities.
The second consists of performance tasks outlined in the Ready Intelligence Program (RIP),
which intelligence personnel must accomplish and document completion of tasks for mission
essential events with sufficient frequency to maintain currency defined for CMR and BMC.
CMR and BMC intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks at the specified
intervals and successfully accomplish periodic mission qualification evaluations (MSN) in
accordance with AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 2 to maintain currency
and qualification in each mission crew position.
   5.1.1. CT items. AF DCGS units will have these items on their annual CT plan:
       5.1.1.1. Emergency/Safety Procedures.
       5.1.1.2. Crew Resource Management.
       5.1.1.3. AOR
       5.1.1.4. RIP items (see paragraph 5.4)
5.2. Local Training. Local training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable
advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to crewmembers to enhance their skill
and job knowledge. The intent of local training is to ensure crewmembers are knowledgeable
about squadron-specific, local area procedures, local systems, related procedures, and local
directives. Units are responsible for developing and tracking local training events.
5.3. Refresher Training. Refresher Training is optional training which occurs when a
crewmember reports to their operational unit of assignment to review FTU trained items and can
also occur after return from a lengthy TDY or leave of absence. Squadron training POCs will
determine what refresher training is required and assign an instructor to crewmembers when
deemed necessary.
5.4. Ready Intelligence Program (RIP). The intent of RIP is to ensure BMC/CMR mission
crewmembers perform specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain
proficiency in assigned duty positions. RIP guidance applies to all AF DCGS AD, reserve
component and distributed mission sites.
   5.4.1. RIP is considered an integral part of CT for crewmembers because, when they go
   beyond the specific time interval for any RIP event or task, they are considered non-BMC or
   non-CMR and enter into a phased training status for the overdue event or task. The different
   levels of training required to regain BMC or CMR status are based on the amount of time the
   crewmember is overdue.
   5.4.2. AFISRA establishes and publishes AF DCGS RIP requirements.
 24                                                    AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013


      5.4.2.1. RIP Task definitions are provided in Attachment 3, Table A3.1 and minimum
      RIP requirements are contained in Attachment 4, Table A4.1.
      5.4.2.2. Additional or modified RIP definitions and tasking will be developed and
      updated by AFISRA. AF DCGS RIP Tasking Messages will be sent out by AFISRA/A3T
      identifying additional or modified RIP tasks.
   5.4.3. RIP tasks should primarily be conducted in the course of real-world missions. For
   those RIP events or tasks that cannot be completed during a real-world mission, other
   methods will be used. These methods include but are not limited to shadowing a live mission,
   using pre-recorded or simulated mission data, performing a scripted mock event with one or
   more associated crewmembers, or performing an academic review with a qualified
   crewmember, preferably in the same crew position, or supervisor.
   5.4.4. Logging RIP events. Supervisors and individual crew members are responsible for
   ensuring documentation of RIP task completion IAW local instructions.
   5.4.5. Unit Training Office is responsible to provide a quarterly RIP status report to unit
   commander.
   5.4.6. Mission crew members must complete RIP tasks for each crew position in which they
   are qualified.
      5.4.6.1. For crewmembers qualified on two or more positions, RIP tasks shared between
      crew positions, if similar, can be applied to each applicable position’s currency
      requirements.
      5.4.6.2. Mission crew members will not log RIP events for duty positions which they are
      not qualified.
      5.4.6.3. Instructors may log crew duty tasks and instructor RIP requirements on any
      mission event in which they perform instructor duties.
      5.4.6.4. Evaluators may log crew duty tasks required for their mission crew
      qualifications as they evaluate the tasks. There are no evaluator-specific RIP
      requirements.
   5.4.7. Failure to meet RIP requirements for any given event (as calculated from the date the
   event was last accomplished) will result in loss of currency for the overdue event and
   regression to N-BMC/N-CMR status for that crew position. Members failing to meet RIP
   requirements will be supervised by a qualified crewmember until the delinquent RIP events
   are complete as outlined in Table 5.1. Loss of instructor currency does not affect currency
   for mission crew positions in which the instructor is qualified.

6.1. General. Specialized Training encompasses AF DCGS instructor and intelligence
evaluator required training. This chapter establishes the minimum requirements for AF DCGS
instructor/evaluator candidates and the required training.
   6.1.1. Documentation. Specialized training for AF DCGS Instructor will be recorded IAW
   AF/A2 and AFISRA directed documentation sources. Specialized training should also be
   documented appropriately IAW AF/A2 guidance and approved processes regarding on-line
   documentation.
6.2. AF DCGS Instructor. Instructors are experienced crewmembers who have been qualified
to instruct trainees. Instructors serve as the primary planner and task certifier in approved
training documentation and can open/close tasks and request evaluations. Instructors will be
designated in writing by the Unit/CC or designated individual.
   6.2.1. Instructor Qualification Prerequisites. This program establishes the minimum
   guidelines for those personnel identified to qualify as an instructor. Personnel selected for
   instructor must:
       6.2.1.1. Attain unit commander approval.
       6.2.1.2. Maintain BMC/CMR status with a minimum Q1 on the latest evaluation in the
       crew position(s) for which they will instruct and have the following crew position
       experience:
          6.2.1.2.1. Complete a minimum of 400 mission hours in the initial crew position for
          which they hold a qualification and 200 mission hours for each subsequent crew
          position.
              6.2.1.2.1.1. Mission time conducting similar duties other than on AF DCGS may
              be considered toward instructor hours, at the discretion of the unit Commander,
              when it is determined too few missions are assigned to the unit to allow timely
              Instructor progression.
          6.2.1.2.2. Meet Air Force trainer requirements IAW AFI 36-2201 and be awarded 5-
          skill level (enlisted personnel only).
   6.2.2. Instructor Training Requirements.
       6.2.2.1. Receive formal instructor training through the AFISRA-approved course.
       6.2.2.2. Successfully complete instructor training as detailed below and an instructor
       evaluation IAW AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 2.
          6.2.2.2.1. Qualified instructors are not required to repeat the instructor qualification
          process (instructor specialized training and instructor evaluation) for subsequent
          positions provided they meet the minimum mission hours.
   6.2.3. Loss/Recovery of Instructor Status. Unit commanders will remove an individual’s
   instructor status when one of the following conditions exists:
AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                27


     6.2.3.1. The individual fails an evaluation on the crew position in which they are
     instructing. Instructors must successfully complete additional training assigned and/or
     successfully complete a new performance check to regain instructor qualification.
     6.2.3.2. Instructors who fail a written examination must successfully re-accomplish the
     written exam to regain instructor status.
     6.2.3.3. Individuals fail to maintain currency that results in removal of BMC/CMR
     status. If an instructor status becomes N-CMR/N-BMC, they cannot instruct on that
     position until all currency requirements have been completed.
     6.2.3.4. If the unit commander determines an instructor is no longer capable of
     performing instructor duties, a commander-directed downgrade will be documented IAW

Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS)—A distributed, network-
centric, global system designated as the AF AN/GSQ-272 SENTINEL intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system, AF DCGS consists of ground stations, mission sites,
collaborative work centers and remote entities connected in a network-centric data and
information distributed system. AF DCGS takes advantage of AF, sister service, national and
coalition sensors in the air, on land, in space, and at sea, spanning multi-INT disciplines. It
provides tailored, correlated information to those who need it at all levels across the globe, in
peace and in combat. It is scalable and comprised of fixed & deployable total force components
capable of forward-based activities & robust, full-scale reachback operations. AF DCGS is a
component of the larger DoD DCGS enterprise.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of AF DCGS mission crewmembers who have
satisfactorily completed MQT, are qualified in the unit mission, but do not maintain CMR status.
 36                                                       AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013


Basic Qualification (BQ)—Mission crewmembers who have satisfactorily completed IQT and
are qualified to perform basic duties, but may not perform mission duties unsupervised. BQ is a
prerequisite for all personnel to enter MQT. BQ is not a long term qualification status.
Certification—The status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training prescribed
to maintain the knowledge and skills necessary to supplement qualifications. Certifications are
attained through methods other than evaluation and are verified by an instructor.
Collection Minimization—Procedures established to ensure adherence to national, AF and local
directives regarding restrictions to collection when performing crew mission duties.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily
completed MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the appropriate tasks and knowledge
required by this document.
Continuation Training (CT)—Continuation Training provides the volume, frequency, and mix
of training necessary for mission crews to maintain proficiency in their assigned qualification
level. It consists of local and difference training and the Ready Intelligence Program (RIP). CT
is separate from skill level upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill level upgrade
training requirements.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure mission crews maintain a minimum level of proficiency in a given
event.
Difference Training (DT)—Training for new features, variations, capabilities, and/or
procedures (to include local procedures).
Direct Reporting Organization—Units that are outside of the normal AF organizational
structure, lacking a parent Group and/or Wing. For these units, any requirements normally
satisfied at the Group or Wing level moves up to the first available organization in the chain.
Enterprise Level Certification—Certification applicable across all AF DCGS units.
Fast Track— Training, qualification or certification process for personnel, identified by the unit
commander, that have demonstrated exceptional skill in a crew position. While still responsible
for all training and qualification requirements for each position through the tier progression, they
may be signed off on many/most items and evaluated more quickly than normal training
timelines.
Formal Training Unit (FTU)—A unit with a primary mission to train crew personnel according
to approved syllabi.
In-unit IQT—Training provided by unit in lieu of that provided at the FTU in-residence
courses.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Initial training necessary to qualify AF DCGS mission
crews in a basic AF DCGS crew position without regard to a squadron’s specific mission. IQT
includes AF DCGS Formal Training Unit (FTU) in-residence courses as well as in-unit training
using FTU materials, when waivered.
Instructor—An experienced crewmember qualified to instruct others in operations, academics
and positional duties. Instructors can certify training completion on appropriate mission
documentation.
AFISRAI14-153V1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                37


Intelligence Evaluator (IE)— Current and qualified (BMC or CMR) AF DCGS instructor
personnel who has completed the IE training and certification. IEs must be current and qualified
in the events they evaluate. Only IEs may conduct intelligence qualification (mission or
specialized) evaluations (initial or periodic).
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training needed to qualify mission crewmembers to
perform their specific squadron mission in an assigned position. This training is a prerequisite
for CMR or BMC status.
Proficiency—The quality of having competence and a command of the fundamentals derived
from practice and familiarity. A measure of how well a task is completed. An individual is
considered proficient when he/she can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed,
accuracy, and safety.
Proficiency Advance— Process reserved for personnel with demonstrated and documented skill
in a particular crew position, and identified by the unit commander. Individual is advanced past
lower tier position requirements, only completing the requirements for the selected higher-tier
position.
Qualification Training Packages (QTP)—Formal Training Unit formal courseware provided to
units conducting secondary method training.
Ready Intelligence Program (RIP)—A component of CT which is designed to focus on
capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. RIP events are specific to the
AF DCGS weapon system. BMC and CMR intelligence personnel must complete appropriate
RIP tasks identified in this document.
Refresher Training—Optional training provided by the local unit to AF DCGS FTU graduates
upon reporting to their operational unit of assignment. Refresher training is a review of FTU
trained items in sufficient depth and breadth to ensure the crewmember retains knowledge and
task area proficiency at the basic qualification level.
Remedial Training—Training provided to members receiving a qualification level 3 (Q-3)
during an initial, SPOT, or recurring evaluation, or for crewmembers who fail to complete CT
requirements and regress to non-CMR/non-BMC status.
RIP Tasking Message—Higher Headquarters message that establishes Ready Intelligence
Program event and frequency requirements in addition to events contained in this instruction.
Supervised Status—The status of a member who must operate under the supervision of an
instructor. BQ and BMC (unless waived) crewmembers are normally in supervised status during
operational missions.
