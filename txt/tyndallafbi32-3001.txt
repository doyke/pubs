SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision requires 325 FW/CC or CV approval for EOD assistance to local authorities as
directed in AFJI 32-3001 and DODD 3025.18.
1. GENERAL.
   1.1. Primary responsibility for providing EOD assistance to civil authorities on the land mass
   rests with the Army. Air Force EOD teams are responsible for providing EOD support to
   their base of assignment.
2. DIRECT RESPONSE SITUATIONS.
 2                                               TYNDALLAFBI32-3001 12 OCTOBER 2012


     2.1. The responding EOD team must have approval of the 325 FW/CC or designated
     representative for military and non-military explosive ordnance. If approved, the EOD team
     will be dispatched within 4 hours from the time of their initial notification.
     2.2. EOD will provide off-base support during the following situations:
        2.2.1. Incidents/accidents involving military munitions which are in the possession of the
        United States Air Force (USAF) at the time of the first event leading to the
        incident/accident when Tyndall AFB (TAFB) is the nearest installation.
        2.2.2. Incidents/accidents involving military explosive ordnance not in the possession of
        the USAF, when TAFB is the nearest installation and response is required are in the
        interest of public safety.
        2.2.3. Transportation accidents involving federally owned or controlled explosive
        ordnance; an EOD team must respond within 4 hours.
     2.3. EOD will not respond to bomb threat situations until a suspect device is found. At no
     time will EOD personnel participate in any search.
3. EOD RESPONSE TO INCIDENTS INVOLVING MILITARY EXPLOSIVES. Air
Force EOD units will respond to incidents involving military explosive ordnance subject to the
following limitations:
     3.1. Response must be approved by the 325 FW/CC or designated representative.
     3.2. Routine pickup of military explosive ordnance, the EOD team will respond alone.
     Routine responses do not involve EOD render safe procedures, i.e. removal of flares or drone
     parts that wash ashore. After arrival on scene it is determined that the situation is more
     serious (e.g., property has already been damaged or EOD procedures could cause injury or
     damage to property), EOD will request further assistance through 325 FW/CP. In these more
     serious situations, the EOD team may request the 325 FW/JA provide legal support.
     3.3. Non-routine situations involving military ordnance, the 325 FW/CC or designee
     qualified to make required on-scene command and risk decisions may accompany the EOD
     team to the incident site to act as Incident Commander (IC).
        3.3.1. The escorting IC must carefully consider all factors involved before exposing
        EOD personnel to unnecessary risk of injury or loss of life. This risk decision must be
        based on a joint assessment of the incident by the senior EOD representative and the
        responsible officer.
        3.3.2. If determined necessary by the 325 FW/CC or designated representative, after
        consultation with 325 FW/JA, a legal representative may also accompany the EOD team
        to the incident site.
4. EOD RESPONSE TO INCIDENTS INVOLVING NONMILITARY OR UNKNOWN
EXPLOSIVES.
     4.1. Rendering safe and disposal of non-nuclear improvised explosive devices (IEDs),
     nonmilitary commercial explosives or similar dangerous articles reported or discovered in
     areas outside Department of Defense (DoD) installations, are normally the responsibility
     of civil authorities. Air Force EOD assistance, in the form of EOD action or advice,
TYNDALLAFBI32-3001 12 OCTOBER 2012                                                            3


   may be provided to civil authorities when the 325 FW/CC, CV or designated representative
   determines EOD assistance is required or desired for safety.
   4.2. DoD policy does not permit the use of installations for the storage or the disposal of
   non-DoD owned hazardous or toxic material. This policy, however, does not apply to
   emergency lifesaving assistance to civil authorities for the temporary storage or disposal of
   all explosives, except fireworks, and for formal agreements that may exist with other federal
   agencies.
   4.3. Air Force EOD units may respond subject to the limitations below:
      4.3.1. Response must be approved by the 325 FW/CC or designated representative.
      4.3.2. Full consideration must be given to possible degradation of the base EOD
      capability.
      4.3.3. The 325 FW/CC or designee qualified to make the required on-scene command
      and risk decisions must accompany the EOD team to the incident site to act as IC.
      4.3.4. Each EOD incident will be categorized according to the threat it poses to critical
      combat resources/facilities or by the resultant destruction potential should the explosive
      ordnance detonate, in accordance with AFJI 32-3002, Interservice Responsibilities for
      Explosive Ordnance Disposal, paragraph 9.
      4.3.5. The escorting OSC must carefully consider all factors involved before exposing
      EOD personnel to unnecessary risk of injury or loss of life. This risk decision must be
      based on a joint assessment of the incident by the senior EOD representative and the
      responsible officer.
      4.3.6. If determined necessary by the 325 FW/CC or designated representative, after
      consultation with 325 FW/JA, a legal representative may also accompany the EOD team
      to the incident site.
      4.3.7. The Bay County Sheriff’s Office Bomb Squad will be notified of the incident. If
      they arrive prior to incident termination, the IC will consult with the senior EOD
      representative to determine when it will be safe to turn the incident over to the Bay
      County Sheriff’s Office Bomb Squad. EOD involvement may still be necessary in an
      advisory capacity because of knowledge gained from EOD procedures completed prior to
      incident turn over.
5. PROCEDURES. The following is a list of procedures for the 325 FW/CC or designated
representative, 325 FW/CP, 325 FW/JA and EOD to follow during a request for EOD assistance
by civil authorities:
