SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated paragraphs 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 11.
1. Responsibilities: Squadron commanders/superintendents, with input from Flight/Section
Chiefs, are responsible for management of the CTK program within their squadron. Each
individual is responsible for ensuring the CTK Program is effective and assures the best tool
control possible. The main responsibility for CTK custodial control lies with the Flight/Section
Chiefs and designated CTK custodians. This instruction is not all inclusive: rather supplements
responsibilities in AFI 21-101
 2                                                          403WGI21-105 4 OCTOBER 2012


2. Security, Control, and Accountability of Tool and Equipment:
     2.1. The Flight/Section Chiefs designate in writing primary and alternate CTK custodians to
     manage and control assets located in the tool room and designate individuals permitted to
     gain access to the CTK secure storage location. Designated CTK custodians are responsible
     for tool procurement, Hazardous Material (HAZMAT), equipment accountability, and
     control within their respective areas.
     2.2. All tools and dispatchable CTK’s are maintained in a lockable, enclosed secure area or
     cabinet. This area is secured at all times and access is permitted only by the Flight/Section
     Chiefs, appointed maintenance supervision, and authorized personnel. It is the sole
     responsibility of those authorized to ensure items issued are properly accounted for in
     accordance with the instructions and directives outlined in this instruction.
     2.3. All units will use the TC MAX system.
     2.4. AFRC Forms 174,175,177 or TCMAX generated products may be used to track tools.
        2.4.1. Use AFRC Form 174, Lost Tool/Object Report, to annotate each lost tool/object
        unless the item is immediately recovered. When a tool is reported missing or lost,
        indicate the date and time lost tool procedures were initiated. The CTK custodian
        maintains AFRC Form 174 on suspense. Destroy the suspense report when the item is
        recovered or not found within 1 year.
        2.4.2. Use AFRC Form 175 Missing/Removed Tools Equipment, to annotate all
        removed/missing tools and equipment, and all actions taken on these items. This form
        will be signed and dated when a tool is replaced. A separate AFRC Form175 is
        maintained in each aircraft CTK. When the AFRC Form 175 is full, a new form is
        initiated and all open entries are transcribed to the new form.
        2.4.3. Use AFRC Form 177, Consolidated Tool Kit Inventory and Control Log, for
        accountability and control of CTKs, and tools. This form remains in the designated tool
        room or work center. A separate AFRC Form 177 is maintained for each CTK designator
        series and aircraft CTK.
        2.4.4. AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt: is to be completely filled out and
        handed to the Flight/Section Chief or CTK custodians for accountability of issued
        tools/equipment. When tools or equipment are returned to the tool room, the AF Form
        1297 is returned to the individual for disposal.
        2.4.5. TCMAX generated forms may be used.
        2.4.6. Chits are not authorized to be used.
3. Inventory Requirements:
     3.1. At least annually, a comprehensive inventory of all tools, equipment, and CTKs will be
     accomplished by the Flight/Section chief. The Flight/Section Chief signs and dates the CTK
     Master Inventory Listing (MIL) certifying this yearly requirement was accomplished. When
     the CTK custodian changes, the old and the new CTK custodians perform a thorough,
     documented inventory before transition of responsibility occurs. Changes made to the CTK
     MIL are approved and documented by the Flight/Section Chiefs.
403WGI21-105 4 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   3


  3.2. All CTK, tools, and equipment are accounted for at the beginning and the end of every
  shift. CTKs present during tool room shift inventories do not need to be opened. This
  inventory is documented daily using TCMAX or AFRC Form 177, if TCMAX is inoperative.
  3.2.1. Electronically back up the respective TCMAX database at least once a month. The
  backup must be kept separate from the computer that houses the tool control database.
  3.3. CTKs are inventoried when issued for use (using either TCMAX or AFRC Form 177)
  and become the responsibility of the individual who signed out the CTK. CTKs are
  inventoried at the completion of a job or task, between breaks in a job where the box is
  locked and left unattended, and when returned to the tool room. A CTK inventory is
  accomplished prior to operation of any aircraft or equipment when maintenance actions were
  performed.
  3.4. Toolboxes sub located to an aircraft will have keys controlled by the tool room. When
  the toolbox key has been issued from the tool room, the Aircraft toolboxes must be
  inventoried at the beginning and end of every shift using the AFRC Form 177 within the
  toolbox.
  3.5. Aircraft off station with an accompanying crew chief will have all tools accounted for,
  at a minimum, prior to each flight. The crew chief will inventory and annotate AFRC
  Form 177 prior to each flight. Exception: Engine run on/off load (EROs) and quick-turns
  during which no maintenance was performed. Standard procedures still apply: toolboxes
  must be inventoried and AFRC Form177 annotated before and after each use.
  3.6. All CTKs are arranged to ensure contents are clearly visible and easily inventoried.
  CTK contents are standardized to the maximum extent possible within the functional
  elements of a squadron which maintain similar Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft.
     3.6.1. Each tool will be identified by inlay cuts, shadowed layout, or silhouette. Storage
     cabinets will be labeled to identify the contents and location of each item for quick
     inventory.
     3.6.2. All tools and equipment (this includes shop equipment) must have a designated
     storage location established. This includes dispatchable and nondispatchable tools,
     equipment, and common accessories (waveguides, attenuators, fittings, cables, and
     adaptors) that are not part of the CTK.
     3.6.3. All other dispatchable support equipment (i.e. kits, bags, pans, crates) must have a
     designated storage location established and will be controlled using TCMAX or AFRC
     Form 177.
  3.7. Single-Person Tool Inventory Accountability:
     3.7.1. When a technician is alone, the following CTK sign-in procedure is followed.
         3.7.1.1. The technician performs a thorough inventory of all items contained in the
         CTK.
         3.7.1.2. The technician annotates on AFRC Form177 the current military time and
         signs their name in the “IN” block.
         3.7.1.3. At the next possible opportunity the affected CTK will receive another
         thorough inspection/inventory by a separate technician, before it is used again. If all
 4                                                             403WGI21-105 4 OCTOBER 2012


            items are accounted for, the individual who accomplished the 2nd inspection will
            initial by the original signature.
            3.7.1.4. If an item is missing or lost, take the appropriate steps as outlined in this
            instruction.
4. Dispatchable CTK On-Site Transfer Procedures:
     4.1. When additional dispatchable CTKs are available within a shop, technicians sign-out
     their own CTK, therefore, an on-site transfer will not occur.
     4.2. When additional CTKs are not available within a shop, or a situation does not allow a
     technician to obtain their own CTK, technicians adhere to the following procedures for on-
     site transfer:
        4.2.1. When the relieving technician arrives on site, a complete inventory of the CTK is
        performed by both individuals.
        4.2.2. Once the inventory is completed and all items are accounted for, the technician
        taking over at the job site issues an AF Form1297 to the technician that signed out the
        dispatchable CTK. The relieving technician assumes responsibility for the CTK and its
        contents.
5. Lost/Missing Tool Procedures:
     5.1. When a tool cannot be found, the Expeditor/Production Superintendent or their
     representative (if unavailable, contact any supervisor), is notified so appropriate action can be
     taken IAW AFI 21-101.
        5.1.1. AFRC Form 174 will be completed for each lost/missing tool.
        5.1.2. If the item is lost/missing in or around an aircraft, a Red X will be placed on(?) the
        aircraft forms with a description of the item and last known location.
        5.1.3. Only authorized individuals may clear the Red X.
6. CTK Content Management:
     6.1. Flight/Section Chiefs are authorized to maintain limited quantities of replacement,
     expendable, and consumable tools, as long as they are kept in a lockable, secured location.
        6.1.1. Access to these resources remains exclusively with the Flight/Section Chiefs
        and/or their designated representative.
        6.1.2. A complete inventory is accomplished quarterly using TCMAX or AFRC Form
        177 to ensure positive control of these assets.
        6.1.3. Replacement items are not issued without receipt of the unserviceable tool and
        documentation of the AFRC Form 175, or documentation indicating the tool is lost and
        has been reported lost IAW the lost tool procedures outlined in this instruction.
        6.1.4. Industrial shop machinery accessories/attachments (blades, arbors, etch.) are
        maintained using the same procedures listed in this section, but are not assigned to a
        CTK.
        6.1.5. Items stored in a CTK which contain hazardous materials are managed IAW local
        HAZMAT procedures.

   contracts with warranty tool vendors (e.g. Snap-on). Units establishing a Warranty Tool
   Program coordinate with Base Supply and Contracting. Detailed management procedures are
   contained in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. Tools that are purchased through local
   contracts, the Flight/Section Chief retains contractual paperwork on warranty tools during the
   warranty period. Direct contact with local contractors will be maintained for replacement of
   broken and lost tools only.
   7.2. Flight/Section Chiefs and/or assigned CTK custodians are responsible for the ordering,
   purchasing, and management of tools required in their work centers.
8. Rag Control:
   8.1. Flight/Section Chiefs have overall responsibility for implementing the unit’s Rag
   Control Program. Work centers requiring rags for maintenance will establish a control
   center, typically the same area as the CTK issue area. The Flight/Section Chief will
   designate points of contact for the sections Rag Control Program.
   8.2. Rags of uniform size and color are used to facilitate control procedures (such as those
   available through GSA and commercial contract suppliers). A unique rag color differentiates
   rags from different work centers.
   8.3. Each work center will establish a standard quantity of rags to be issued for use and place
   them in zip lock or equivalent bags. Rags not part of a CTK are inventoried and accounted
   for when signed out, before operation of any engine or equipment in which maintenance was
   performed, before leaving the job site, or when signing them back into their storage
   locations. For work centers desiring to add a “bag-of-rags” to a dipatchable CTK, these rags
   will be on the inventory list for that CTK and inventoried in the same manner as the tools
   within. Rags will be marked with a TCMAX number.
   8.4. Each work center that requires usage of rags will:
      8.4.1. Maintain documentation to show the amount of rags received and released for
      cleaning, disposal and replacement.
