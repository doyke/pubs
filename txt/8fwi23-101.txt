     Materiel Management Flight, Inspection Element (LGRMI), Chief Inspector as the 8 FW
     PMRP Monitor.
2.2. All activities involved in the PMRP are required to maintain a current copy of the
applicable publication. There will be no exceptions to this requirement.
     2.3. The 8 FW PMRP Monitor is responsible for the following:
        2.3.1. Maintain a list of each organization‟s PMRP monitor/alternate name, phone
        number, location, type of recovery equipment, precious metals generated, and precious
        metals used.
        2.3.2. Ensure activities receiving, issuing, and using fine precious metals items having a
        high content of precious metals that are assigned Controlled Item Code (CIC) “R” (fine
        precious metals/high contents of precious metals) appoint an individual in writing to
        receipt for and issue these items. Additionally, the PMRP Monitor will develop and
        process a local computer program to produce a quarterly listing identifying National
        Stock Numbers (NSN) against which a Precious Metal Indicator Code (PMIC) requiring
        monitoring is assigned. Distribute a copy of the list to each agency identified as
        producing Precious Metals (PM) with a cover letter, to be indorsed by the receiving
        agency and returned to the 8 FW PMRP monitor within 14 days. This letter will be filed
        in a PMRP jacket file.
