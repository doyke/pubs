                          CLINICAL ALARMS.

2.1. Clinical alarm systems are those alarms that are triggered by physical or physiologic
monitoring of the patient or by variations in measured parameters of medical equipment
directly applied to the patient.
   2.1.1. These alarms are intended to protect the patient or alert the staff that the patient is at
   increased risk and needs immediate assistance.
   2.1.2. Examples include cardiac monitor alarms, apnea alarms, elopement/abduction alarms,
   infusion pump alarms, medical gas alarms, and duress alarms.
2.2. Regular preventive maintenance and testing of clinical alarm systems will be
accomplished to ensure the alarms function appropriately and are audible.
   2.2.1. The staff will not defeat any clinical alarm or prevent it from being audible in the
   healthcare setting.
   2.2.2. Exception: Oftentimes it is necessary to temporarily silence an alarm while
   responding to the cause of the alarm.
