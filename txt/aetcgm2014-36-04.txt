SUBJECT: AETC Guidance Memorandum for Assignments

RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

1. By Order of the Commander, Air Education and Training Command, this AETC Guidance Memorandum
immediately implements changes to AFI 36-2110, Assignments (dated 22 September 2009). This guidance
memorandum supersedes HQ AETC Policy Memorandum, AETC Controlled Tours, 6 Jan 11. Compliance with this
memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the
information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

2. The current controlled tour policy applies to recruiters, educators and instructors. For enlisted (SMSgt and
below), the 4-year controlled tour Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 50 policy applies to all J and T prefix,
8B1XX, 8B2XX, 8RXXX, 8TXXX enlisted instructors, recruiters and educators. As an exception, 8B000, Military
Training Instructors will serve a 42-month maximum controlled tour. Enlisted aircrew instructors and other non-
instructor educators and recruiter support personnel are exempt from this policy. Any consideration for an enlisted
member (SMSgt and below) to stay up to a 5th year must be approved by the wing commander and processed
through HQ AETC/A1, with final approval determination residing with the AFPC assignment OPR. Any extension
past the 5th year must be endorsed by the wing and NAF commanders, processed through HQ AETC/A1 and
approved by AETC/CV, with final approval determination residing with the AFPC assignment OPR.

3. For rated officers below the rank of O-5, tour length performing flight instruction will remain unchanged at 3
years plus training (AAC 50). This also applies to First Assignment Instructor Pilots. In addition, T prefix officer
instructors and educators with an 81TX or 82AX AFSC will be coded with a 3-year tour from their date arrived
station.

4. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air
Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

5. If you have any questions about this guidance memorandum, please contact HQ AETC/A1KA at DSN 487-7716.

6. This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon
publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication, whichever is earlier.
