This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-20, Accession of Air Force Military
Personnel, and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designa-
tion and Assignment in Professional Categories -- Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force.
It establishes policy and procedures for the 302d Airlift Wing (AW) Non-Extended Active Duty
(Non-EAD) Commissioning Program. This instruction applies to all members assigned to 302d AW and
serviced units.


1. Non-EAD Commissioning Program.
   1.1. General Guidance. The program is designed to commission deserving airmen to fill valid
   non-rated and line officer unit vacancies. The objective of the wing selection board is to nominate the
   best candidate for commissioning while recognizing all interested and qualified individuals.
   1.2. Vacancies. Positions available for Non-EAD Commissioning Program are dependent upon
   vacancies that exist within the 302d AW. These vacancies must have been designated by the unit com-
   mander as available for application.
       1.2.1. Letters designating a position for Non-EAD Commissioning Program will be forwarded by
       the unit commander to Military Personnel Flight (MPF) Employments Section. Positions will be
       posted in the Reserve Management Vacancy System (RMVS) and advertised in the Front Range
       Flyer when time permits. Announcement letters will have, to a minimum, the unit, organizational
       structure code, grade of position, position number, date of the board, and point of contacts along
       with their contact information.
   1.3. Eligibility. Members must meet commissioning eligibility criteria as defined in AFI 36-2005.
   Only those individuals who clearly demonstrate outstanding potential are considered for wing nomi-
   nation into the Non-EAD Commissioning Program. Selection is an honor reserved for the most quali-
   fied, motivated and deserving individuals.

    within the same organization. However, the wing commander may grant an exception to this policy.
    Unit commanders wishing to recommend a candidate from the unit with a vacancy will forward their
    request for exception through their group commander.

tionally, effective on the Academy of Military Science class start date, incentive bonus future installments
are suspended. If commissioned, entitlement to any future installments is also terminated. The suspension
is lifted if the airman is not commissioned. If reenlistment occurs more than 3 months prior to current
ETS, selectees are not entitled to sell leave.
