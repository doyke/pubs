    responsible for the technical execution of project construction and performs the duties of the
    contracting officer (CO). For Air Force MILCON projects, the DA/CA is either U.S. Army
    Corps of Engineers (USACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), or, for
    approved projects, AFCEE. The AFCEE Waterbeach office is the DA/CA for the United
    Kingdom.
    1.4.7. MAJCOM. The Requiring/Using MAJCOM has the overall responsibility for
    requirements identification and preparation of programming documents. MILCON
    requirements and siting for projects programmed or planned by other organizations must be
    coordinated by the host base MAJCOM (refer to AFI 32-1021, Planning and Programming
    Military Construction (MILCON) Projects). The following are definitions/ roles and
    responsibilities for MAJCOM programming and execution of MILCON projects:
       1.4.7.1. Requiring/Using MAJCOM. The Requiring/Using MAJCOM is the command
       responsible for executing the specific mission being supported by a MILCON
       requirement. Requiring/Using MAJCOMs are responsible for programming, funding and
       for pre-coordinating with Host MAJCOMs during the Program Objective Memorandum
       (POM) process. The Requiring/Using MAJCOM is either a host or tenant unit on an
       installation. A tenant unit is commonly referred to as the ―receiver‖ in host-tenant support
       agreements and receives base support from the Host MAJCOM. Requiring/Using
       MAJCOMs are responsible for validating the functional requirements during MILCON
       project programming.
       1.4.7.2. Host MAJCOM. The Host MAJCOM is the command that provides base
       support on an installation and is commonly referred to as the ―supplier‖ in host-tenant
       support agreements. The Host MAJCOM oversees the installation where the mission and
       MILCON are being executed. Host MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring appropriate
       siting, architectural, environmental, and master plan integration are completed as
       necessary during project programming and execution. In addition, Host MAJCOMs may
       be asked to program MILCON projects on behalf of the Requiring/Using MAJCOM.
    1.4.8. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The AFRC develops additional policy
    unique to AFRC construction programs and oversees management of those programs.
AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010                                                                        7


  1.4.9. Base Civil Engineer (BCE). BCEs are responsible for initiating planning and
  programming for MILCON projects at their installations.
  1.4.10. Host-Tenant Responsibilities. Manage intra-service situations per AFI 25-201,
  Support Agreements Procedures. By agreement of host and tenant, the tenant organization
  may fund design and construction.
     1.4.10.1. DoD Components or Federal Agencies. Refer to AFI 65-601 V1, Budget
     Guidance and Procedures, for situations involving other DoD components or federal
     agencies.
     1.4.10.2. Joint Basing. Where two or more Service Component installations have
     merged into zone installation and one Component has been appointed as the lead, the
     supporting Component is responsible for providing Installation Support (IS) to the Joint
     Base (JB). The supported Component(s) transfers installation management to the
     supporting Component.
        1.4.10.2.1. Except as provided below, the supporting Component's policies,
        procedures, and guidance shall govern facilities planning, acquisition, sustainment,
        modernization, and disposal actions at Joint Bases.
            1.4.10.2.1.1. To the extent it does not conflict with the supporting Component's
            criteria, the supported Component's unique planning, architectural and/or design
            criteria shall be used.
            1.4.10.2.1.2. To the extent required to provide unique mission capabilities, the
            supported Component's unique planning, architectural and/or design criteria shall
            be used, even when conflicting with the supporting Component's criteria.
        1.4.10.2.2. Except as provided below, the supporting Component's DA/CA shall be
        used for all military construction at Joint Bases.
            1.4.10.2.2.1. For supported Component projects actively in design, under
            construction, or pending final acceptance, the supported Component's assigned
            construction agent shall maintain responsibility for the construction project
            through final completion, at which point the supporting Component shall conduct
            the final acceptance transaction.
        1.4.10.2.3. Programming New Construction. The component generating a new
        construction requirement is responsible for programming the necessary planning,
        design, construction, and sustainment funding. The Component generating an
        increase to the Joint Base population is responsible for any new construction needed
        to expand installation support facilities to accommodate the population increase. In
        all cases, reuse of existing facilities is the preferred approach over new construction
        whenever feasible.
        1.4.10.2.4. Demolition and Disposal. The supporting Component is responsible for
        facilities demolition and disposal at the Joint Base, except for demolition of facilities
        that are no longer needed because of new construction. In those cases, the
        organization requiring the new construction is responsible for demolition. In all
        cases, demolition of facilities no longer needed as a result of new construction shall
        be accomplished in a timely manner.

1.5. Planning:
     1.5.1. Base General Plan. Base General Plans, which include specific Area Development
     Plans, are required at Air Force installations. The Base General Plan is a summary document
     that provides information at an appropriate level of detail for the installation, the command,
     and other decision-makers to understand the character and structure of the installation, and its
     development potential. Refer to AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning which
     provides responsibilities and requirements for comprehensive planning and describes
     procedures for developing, implementing, and maintaining the Base General Plan.
     1.5.2. Area Development Plan (ADP). An ADP is developed for a specific area and/or
     functional use. The ADP provides the vision necessary to assess the project and outline
     mitigation for future use with a special focus on the area facility use and mission capacity.
     Refer to AFPAM 32-1010, Land Use Planning for requirements on an ADP.
     1.5.3. Requirements Document (RD). The purpose of the RD is to provide a basis for
     understanding the project requirements. The BCE initiates part 1 of the RD (RD-1),
     involving as many of the project delivery team (PDT) as practical (at a minimum, including
     user and all installation-level stakeholders). Next, the BCE and MAJCOM engage the PDT to
     complete the RD Part 2 (RD-2), including as many PDT/stakeholders as possible. This
     document may also be referred to as a Customer Concept Document (CCD). Note: for NAF
     projects, the funding organization is included in the PDT and plays a role in determining the
     execution strategy.
     1.5.4. Project Management Plan (PMP). The PMP presents the strategic decisions on
     design, acquisition, and construction methods that are agreed upon by the project
     stakeholders. The DM/CM will take the lead in preparing the PMP.
     1.5.5. Project Siting. Project siting will comply with the installation commander’s
     approved General Plan and applicable ADP.        Refer to AFI 32-7062, Air Force
     Comprehensive Planning, and AFI 32-1021.
     1.5.6. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). If the project management plan is of
     sufficient maturity that meaningful NEPA analysis can be conducted, refer to paragraph
     2.2.2.2 for guidance on the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP).
1.6. Program Oversight:
     1.6.1. Goals and Metrics. The Air Force management tool for performance measurement
     of the MILCON program is a set of ―cradle-to-grave‖ metrics to provide accountability and
     program management capability from planning through financial closeout. It is intended to
     measure performance of all members of the PDT, especially DM/CMs, DA/CAs, and project
     programmers. The goals and metrics are codified in the Air Force Military Construction
     Program Management Plans published by USACE and NAVFAC. AFCEE/CM manages the
     program and is responsible for managing data during Design and Execution.
     1.6.2. Automated Civil Engineering System-Project Management (ACES-PM). ACES-
     PM is the Air Force management information system used by Air Force Civil Engineering to
     manage planning, design, and construction programs. It is used to provide management
     assessments of project cost, major milestones, and to provide an indicator for Air Staff to
     position construction funds with the CA. Timely, accurate ACES-PM data entry is essential

  through the course of the project life. The DM/CM will be the primary person that manages
  and updates ACES-PM during Design and Execution. The DM/CM will update and track
  NAF projects in ACES-PM.

                                            Chapter 2

                                   DESIGN PROCEDURES

2.1. Scope: This chapter addresses design procedures and directives for Air Force MILCON
projects. It also describes the design management process, Design Instructions (DIs),
Engineering Technical Letter (ETLs), guidance for Unspecified Minor Construction (P-341)
projects, authorities for funding, cost controls, reprogramming and change orders.
2.2. Applicable Directives:
   2.2.1. General. The objective for all Air Force facilities is to enable mission execution and
   enhance occupant safety and quality of life by providing sustainable facilities. The
   application of asset management principles to include space optimization, energy efficiency
   and similar efforts to reduce facility life cycle costs is critical to long term value for the Air
   Force. Excellence in design is a primary goal for all MILCON projects. In addition to the
   guidance below, designers must also comply with installation architectural compatibility and
   facilities excellence standards. Site adaptation and modular construction techniques should
   be considered where appropriate.
       2.2.1.1. Functional and Flexible Design. Air Force facilities shall be designed to meet
       mission requirements with the flexibility to accommodate changes in use with a
       minimum expenditure of resources. Functional and flexible aspects shall be defined in the
       RD.
       2.2.1.2. Design for Accessibility. Comply with the most recent DoD accessibility policy
       when providing for people with disabilities.
       2.2.1.3. Cost Management. Use life-cycle cost analysis and value engineering (VE) to
       manage projects costs. Cost control requires continual systematic cost management
       beginning at design and continuing throughout the life of the facility. The working
       estimate, cost-benefit analysis, and life-cycle cost analysis are methods for evaluating
       project cost effectiveness.
          2.2.1.3.1. Life-Cycle Cost. Programming and design decisions for all types of
          construction will be based on life-cycle cost of the facility. Use the present value
          discounting approach described in AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, and AFMAN 65-
          506, Economic Analysis, unless otherwise specified. NAF funded projects may use a
          different decision-making process; contact the funding organization for further
          information. All life-cycle cost analyses, as defined by Title 10 Code of Federal
          Regulations Part 436, Federal Energy Management and Planning Programs, will use
          the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 135, Life-Cycle
          Costing Manual for the Federal Energy Management Program, and the Annual
          Supplement to Handbook 135, Energy Price Indices and Discount Factors for Life-
          Cycle Cost Analysis.
          2.2.1.3.2. Value Engineering (VE). VE is a method for optimizing facilities where
          designers and constructors can show savings through process efficiencies and use of
          alternative and equitable materials with similar performance characteristics. An
          informal (in-house, Agent) VE analysis, incorporating VE principles/guidelines, will
AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010                                                                       11


        be done for all projects over $2 million. A formal, 3rd party, VE study is required for
        each project with a programmed amount (PA) over $10 million, with the exception of
        1) projects executed by design-build, or 2) classified projects or projects in classified
        areas. Implementation of VE analysis recommendations shall not compromise the
        functional and quality requirements of the facility. A VE study should not eliminate
        features used to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
        requirements or certification per the most current Air Force policy. A VE study shall
        not eliminate features required to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Act
        (OSHA) standards. See paragraph 2.2.1.14.
     2.2.1.4. A-E Selection. The A-E selection process must be conducted in accordance
     with FAR 36.6 and all other applicable laws and regulations. A-E services are described
     below:
        2.2.1.4.1. Title I: These services are related to a specific construction project and
        consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data and
        preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates.
        2.2.1.4.2. Title II: These services are related to a specific or proposed construction
        project and consist of supervision and inspection of construction.
        2.2.1.4.3. Base Comprehensive Plans (BCP): These services consist of conducting
        field surveys and investigations to obtain data and producing base development plans.
        2.2.1.4.4. Other A-E Services: These services are design and construction-related
        services, but are not connected with a specific construction project. The services
        consist of developing design criteria, fact finding studies, surveys, investigations, and
        the performance of environmental projects involving prevention, compliance, and
        restoration when the services of registered architects or engineers are required.
        Excluded are services that need not be performed by a registered engineer or architect
        such as providing design and construction equipment or computer programs.
        2.2.1.4.5. Authorities. Title 10 United States Code Sections 2807(a), Architectural
        and Engineering Services and Design, Title 10 United States Code Section 9540(a),
        Architectural and Engineering Services, and the Defense Federal Acquisition
        Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.606-70 authorize contracting for and
        administration of A-E services for project design. Title 10 United States Code,
        Sections 4540, 7212 and 9540 limit the portion of the A-E’s fee for producing
        contract plans and specifications to six percent of the estimated cost of the
        construction project. This does not include site investigations, studies and surveys.
        Title 40 United States Code, Sections 1101 – 1104, or commonly called the Brooks
        Act, provides the authority, definitions, and basic procedures for Federal
        Government’s selection of A-E firms for professional services on facility projects.
        Title 10 United States Code, Section 2855(a) applies the Brooks Act to military
        construction (however the Brooks Act is not applicable to NAF contracting). For
        additional guidance, refer to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
        (DFARS) Subpart 236.6, Architect-Engineer Services and Air Force Federal
        Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), Part 5336, Construction and
        Architect-Engineer Contracts.

     2.2.1.4.6. The Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Synopsis Review. The FBO
     announcement is a key document in the A-E selection process. It identifies proposed,
     specific contract actions. In the case of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)
     contracts, the FBO synopsis identifies contract requirements based on projected, yet
     uncertain requirements.
        2.2.1.4.6.1. A-E Contracts on Specific Projects. The MAJCOM/A7 in the case
        of installation contracts, or the respective commanders of AFCEE or AFCESA in
        the case of AFCEE or AFCESA contracts, shall approve the technical data to be
        included in the FBO synopsis, prior to submitting this information to the CO, to
        ensure it properly describes the requirement.
        2.2.1.4.6.2. IDIQ Contracts. The MAJCOM /A7 in the case of installation
        contracts, or the Air Force Deputy Civil Engineer (AF/A7C-2), in the case of
        AFCEE and AFCESA contracts, shall approve the technical data to be included in
        the FBO synopsis, prior to submitting this information to the CO, to ensure it
        properly describes the requirements, the geographical coverage and provides an
        appropriate capacity relative to projected requirements. NAF contracting offices
        may have their own NAF IDIQ A-E contracts. Contact the funding organization
        for guidance.
     2.2.1.4.7. A-E Slate Selection Approval. Approval authority for A-E selection is
     outlined in DFARS 236.6.
        2.2.1.4.7.1. Approval Authority. For all A-E services, (Title I, Title II, BCPs,
        Other Services, and IDIQs), the BCE will obtain slate selection approval authority
        for services exceeding $1,000,000 per contract, per year plus option years, from
        the MAJCOM/A7. Similarly, for contracts at MAJCOM/A7, AFCEE, or
        AFCESA, slate selection approval authority for services exceeding $1,000,000
        per contract, per year plus option years, will be obtained from SAF/IEI.
        2.2.1.4.7.2. Notification Action (A-E Fees Greater than $1,000,000). When
        the cost of A-E design services for a project, or a group of related projects, is
        estimated to exceed $1,000,000, Congress must be notified in accordance with 10
        USC § 2807(b), Architectural & Engineering Services and Construction Design,
        before award or obligation of funds. Notification action is also required for
        project design undertaken by government personnel, as well as for A-E services
        and construction design planned for projects that are Congressional inserts or
        directed designs. AF/A7CP will initiate this Congressional notification, notify
        AFCEE when it has been sent to SAF/IEI, and notify the MAJCOM and AFCEE
        when SAF/IEI (through SAF/LL and SAF/FMBL) submits the notification
        package to Congress. (See DFARS Subpart 236.601 for the content of the
        Congressional notification and timeline requirements.) Notification must be
        completed (including the wait period) prior to start of any design, including that
        performed by government personnel. Staffing actions for ―2807 notification‖
        typically take 30–45 days. During the notification waiting period, public
        announcement of the plan to initiate design on a particular military construction
        project may be made and administrative actions leading to award of the A-E
        contract may be started, but no actions that obligate government funds may be
AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010                                                                     13


            undertaken.
               2.2.1.4.7.2.1. When a large project or several projects for the same functional
               purpose costing $1,000,000 or more are undertaken, notification is required
               prior to the start of design for any portion of the undertaking, even though the
               project design may be subdivided into several A-E contracts or a combination
               of A-E contracts and design performed in-house by government personnel.
               Notification is required even though the design costs for such portion may be
               less than the reporting threshold specified by law.
               2.2.1.4.7.2.2. Planning and design (P&D) funds expended to USACE and
               NAVFAC to award and administer A-E contracts are separate from the
               services themselves and do not apply to the 10 USC § 2807 threshold. All
               other costs funded with P&D funds apply to the threshold. For a design-build
               contract, the design effort accomplished by the construction contractor and
               funded with construction dollars is not applicable to the threshold. However,
               preparation of a request for proposal for a design-build contract is considered
               A-E services and construction design and is subject to the 10 USC § 2807
               notification requirements.
               2.2.1.4.7.2.3. For projects executed as design-build, a project-specific design
               cost estimate will normally be made and used as the basis for determining the
               notification requirements. In the absence of a design cost estimate, six percent
               of the programmed amount will be used by AF/A7CP as the estimated design
               cost for the purpose of determining notification requirements.
               2.2.1.4.7.2.4. The level of effort authorized by a design instruction (3%, 15%,
               30%, 100%, etc.) has no bearing on the notification requirement, as
               notification must be completed prior to start of any design.
               2.2.1.4.7.2.5. If there is any perceived potential for reaching the threshold,
               prior notification should be made. In the case where no notification has been
               made and the threshold is approached after start of design, project managers
               should notify AF/A7CP and request further guidance.
               2.2.1.4.7.2.6. Notwithstanding      10 USC    §    2807     requirements,
               procurement/financial management regulations may, in some cases, also
               require Congressional notification. The guidance provided here does not
               relieve the requirement to comply with procurement/financial management
               regulations governing notification.
     2.2.1.5. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contracts. Advanced approval by the Secretary of
     Defense or designee is required for the use of cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts that are
     funded by a military construction appropriations act; are estimated to exceed $25,000;
     and will be performed within the U.S., except Alaska. Refer to DFARS, Subpart 216.306,
     Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contracts for further guidance.
     2.2.1.6. Commercial and DoD Facility and Infrastructure Design and Construction
     Standards and Criteria.

        2.2.1.6.1. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) Program. The UFC program is
        implemented by MIL-STD-3007F, and for the Air Force by this AFI. AFCEE is
        responsible for managing the UFC program for AF/A7C.
        2.2.1.6.2. Commercial Standards. It is Congressional and DoD direction to use
        private sector criteria and technical standards based on their suitability for military
        use. The UFC unification process maximizes the use of commercial standards.
        2.2.1.6.3. Engineering Technical Letters (ETL). This AFI implements the ETL
        system to provide specific AF design and construction guidance, procedures, criteria
        and standards. The ETL system serves to implement SAF/IEI and SAF/IEN policies
        and contributes to the Secretariat’s oversight of the MILCON program. ETLs are
        directive and apply to all levels of command, unless stated otherwise. ETLs
        supplement the UFCs, providing specific Air Force technical execution guidance.
        ETLs apply to all facilities constructed on Air Force installations except for MFH.
        An ETL remains in effect until canceled, rescinded or superseded by a later ETL.
        The Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA) is responsible for
        managing the ETL system for AF/A7C. See Attachment 2 for ETL sample format.
        2.2.1.6.4. Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG). The WBDG website, with its
        Construction Criteria Base (CCB) electronic library, is the official distribution
        medium for all non-sensitive technical DoD facility-related documents and contains
        the latest UFCs, ETLs and Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS). All UFC,
        ETL and UFGS documents can be viewed at: http://www.wbdg.org.
     2.2.1.7. Space Criteria. Facility sizes shall be based on functional analyses while
     minimizing overall designed space to the maximum extent possible. AFMAN 32-1084,
     Facility Requirements, provides general planning and programming guidance. For Air
     Force Reserve facilities, refer to AFRCH 32-1001, Standard Facility Requirements. For
     Air National Guard facilities, refer to ANGH 32-1084, Standard Facility Requirements.
     Medical Facilities use DOD and Service-specific medical space planning criteria that is
     maintained and applied by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health
     Affairs), TRICARE Management Activity (OASD/HA TMA) and the AF Health
     Facilities Division.
     2.2.1.8. Relationship to Community and Local Development. Base plans will be
     developed with full consideration of the planning goals and objectives of communities
     surrounding Air Force bases to enhance our value to the public. Refer to Executive Order
     13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management, DoDD 4165.06, Real Property, and
     AFPD 32-90, Real Property Asset Management, for further guidance. In addition, federal
     agencies operating airfields shall work with local, regional, state, and other federal
     officials on compatible land use planning and ensure their programs serve to foster
     compatible land use and protect the airspace. Refer to AFI 32-7063, Air Installation
     Compatible Use Zone Program; Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations Part 77, Objects
     Affecting the Navigable Airspace; and UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and
     Design.
     2.2.1.9. Preservation of Historic Resources. DoDI 4715.16, Cultural Resources
     Management, provides policy, prescribes procedures, and assigns responsibilities for
     managing archaeological and historic resources in and on properties and lands under DoD
AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010                                                                       15


     control. Refer to AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural
     Resources Management, and AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources Management Program for
     guidance and compliance requirements.
     2.2.1.10. Antiterrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP). All DoD facilities must comply
     with the latest UFCs and directives governing AT/FP standards for facilities. Refer to
     UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, including Change
     1, for further guidance. Refer to UFC 4-022-01, Security Engineering: Entry Control

     Requirements, and the United States Air Force Project Managers’ Guide for Design and
     Construction for specific guidance. In the case of conflicts between the model codes and
     Air Force criteria, the Air Force criteria shall take precedence.
     2.2.1.12. Sustainable Design and Development. The Air Force has adopted the United
     States Green Building Council’s (USGBC) LEED Green Building Rating System™ as a
     tool to incorporate sustainable design principles and subsequently to measure the
     sustainability achieved during the design and construction process. The Air Force
     Sustainable Facilities Guide provides tools, templates and suggested guidelines to help
     incorporate sustainable design throughout all the phases of facility development. The
     WBDG further explains the environmental issues related to building materials and
     provides technical guidance on green building material selection and environmental
     issues. See also ETL 08-13, Incorporating Sustainable Design and Development (SDD)
     and Facility Energy Attributes in the Air Force Construction Program; UFC 4-030-01,

        Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating
        System™. All Air Force MILCON projects, regardless of scope or funding source,
        shall use the LEED rating system as their self-assessment metric and comply with the
        most recent Air Force sustainable policy, laws and executive orders. AFPD 90-17,
        Energy Management and AFI 90-1701, Energy Management outline the Air Force
        energy management goals and objectives supported by this effort. Refer to the United
        States Air Force Project Managers’ Guide for Design and Construction for additional
        guidance. Costs for sustainable features must be identified on the DD Form 1391,
        FY__ Military Construction Project Data and cannot be eliminated to save scope or
        cut costs.
        2.2.1.12.2. Energy Efficiency and Compliance. Designers will use a life-cycle cost
        analysis on all new facility designs, revitalization, and modification projects to reduce
        energy and water consumption and increase energy security in accordance with Title
        10 Code of Federal Regulation, Parts 433, 434, 435 and 436; Public Law 109-58,

        guidance). Consult UFC 3-400-01, Energy Conservation, with Change 4 for
        guidance and compliance requirements.
        2.2.1.12.3. Renewable Energy. Evaluate renewable forms of energy in accordance
        with Title 10 United States Code Section 2915, New Construction: Use of Renewable
        Forms of Energy and Energy Efficient Products.
        2.2.1.12.4. Metering. All Air Force buildings require metering where "cost
        effective". Required facilities will be in compliance with ETL 09-11, Civil
        Engineering Industrial Control System Information Assurance Compliance. All
        required meters will be in compliance with UFGS 26 27 13.10 30, Electric Meters;
        UFGS 33 12 33.00 30, Water Meters; UFGS 33 51 13.00 30, Natural-Gas Meters. At
        installations where an advanced meter reading system (AMRS) exists, all new
        building meters will become part of that system. Designers shall consider impacts of
        utility privatization as it relates to metering.
        2.2.1.12.5. Energy Efficient Products. The designer will specify ENERGY
        STAR® or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated products for all
        designs except if an ENERGY STAR® product or FEMP-designated product is not

2.4. MILCON Design Instructions:
   2.4.1. Planning and Design Instructions. AF/A7CP issues Planning Instructions (PI) and
   Design Instruction (DI) to the DM/CM who in turn issues a DI to the DA.
   2.4.2. AFRC Program Managers (PM). AFRC PMs issue the DI using the Air Force
   approved financial tracking database system.
2.5. Guidance Unique to the Unspecified Minor Construction (UMC) Program (P-341):
   2.5.1. AF/A7CP Roles and Responsibilities:
       2.5.1.1. Obtains project validation and approval through AF/A7C and SAF/IEI. AF/A7C
       validates the UMC projects and SAF/IEI approves the projects and notifies House and
       Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of the intent to accomplish the
       project (refer to AFI 32-1021). The congressional notification requires a 21-calendar day
       waiting period (14 calendar days if notification is in electronic format) before
       construction funds can be obligated. Electronic notification is the current method used; if
       no committee raises an objection within 14 calendar days after notification, the
       notification process is complete, and AF/A7C advises the DM/CM to proceed with the
       project.
       2.5.1.2. Issues the PI for the project to the DM/CM through ACES-PM.
       2.5.1.3. Sends the P-341 construction program authorization to the DM/CM.
       2.5.1.4. Authorizes construction advertising via a DI through the ACES-PM system.
       2.5.1.5. Evaluates cost variations and submits them to AF/A7C or SAF/IEI for approval.
       2.5.1.6. Approves transfer of P-341 funds between projects.
   2.5.2. DM Roles and Responsibilities:
       2.5.2.1. Manages projects according to ACES-PM financial tracking database system.
       2.5.2.2. Sends the final design cost estimates, bid opening, contract award reports and
       funds requests, due to construction changes, to AF/A7CP through ACES-PM.
       2.5.2.3. After construction contract award, uses P-341 funds to support DA or A-E, Title
       II construction supervision and inspection services and any required A-E design services
       (engineering and design or post contract award services).
2.6. Authorities:
   2.6.1. Expiration of Authorizations and Appropriations. Refer to AFI 65-601 V1,
   Budget Guidance and Procedure.
       2.6.1.1. Authorizations for Air Force MILCON projects expire after 30 September of the
       second year after the FY of the original authorization (A project authorized in FY08
20                                                               AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010


     expires at the end of FY10) or on the date the President signs the new National Defense
     Authorization Act in the third FY (FY11 from the previous example), whichever date is
     later.
     2.6.1.2. Congress must enact an extension of the authorization in the third year of the act
     or the authorization will expire. The DM/CM should submit requests for extension of
     authorization to AF/A7CP no later than 30 November each year.
     2.6.1.3. Partial awards (intended to keep an authorization from expiring) must involve a
     ―construction placement‖ rather than the purchase of government-furnished material or
     equipment.
     2.6.1.4. Funds appropriated in an FY for a MILCON project may remain available for
     obligations beyond that FY to the extent provided in appropriation acts. MILCON
     appropriations generally are available for obligation for five FYs. Refer to Title 10
     United States Code, Section 2860, Availability of Appropriations and AFI 65-601 V1 for
     use of expired funds.
  2.6.2. Cost and Scope Control:
     2.6.2.1. MILCON. Congress approves each MILCON project at a specific authorized
     and appropriated cost and scope. Title 10 United States Code Section 2853 authorizes a
     cost increase or decrease of not more than 25 percent of the amount appropriated or 200
     percent of the minor construction project ceiling, whichever is less. The project scope
     may be reduced by not more than 25 percent of that specified to Congress; however there
     is no provision for an increase in the project scope identified on the DD Form 1391. It is
     imperative that managers understand that a cost variation shall not be used to increase
     project scope. The Program Management Plan for the Management of the Air Force
     Capital Construction Program (MILCON PgMP) summarizes and updates the controls in
     place to manage the MILCON execution program. This plan is located on the AFCEE
     MILCON Program Management Office Community of Practice website and can also be
     obtained by contacting AFCEE/CM directly. MILCON program managers at all levels
     must be familiar with these controls to ensure proper authority and/or notification is
     sought in the appropriate situation. Use the tables in the MILCON PgMP as an initial
     source for taking appropriate MILCON execution actions.
     2.6.2.2. Reprogramming and Notification. Reprogramming and notification actions
     will be performed in accordance with all applicable regulations as outlined in the
     MILCON PgMP. AFCEE will prepare all documentation, coordinate with the
     MAJCOMs for project reprogramming and submit requests to AF/A7CP for further
     action.
     2.6.2.3. Funding Changes. Funding changes with expired funds involve special rules.
     Refer to AFI 65-601 V1 for further clarification on use of funds.
  2.6.3. Post Award Change Order Control:
     2.6.3.1. Scope Changes. Refer to AFI 65-601 V1 for further clarification on use of
     funds. Refer to the United States Air Force Project Managers’ Guide for Design and
     Construction for additional guidance.

  2.6.4. Funding Guidance for Facility Acquisition. The DM/CM is required to determine
  and document the key factors leading to the selection of the most cost effective and
  appropriate design delivery acquisition strategy for each MILCON project. The use of
  Design Build (D-B) is the preferred method. Use construction funds for design after the D-B
  contract is awarded.
  2.6.5. Funding and Project Management Guidance for Air Force Services
  Nonappropriated Fund Projects. The Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) is the office of
  primary responsibility for administering and managing NAFs used to build projects funded
  with AF central nonappropriated funds. Refer to AFI 32-1022 and AFI 34-205 for additional
  guidance.
  2.6.6. Expedited Construction Project. The use of MILCON funds to absorb extra cost of
  expediting a project is authorized under certain conditions described in Title 10 United States
  Code, Section 2858, Limitation on the Use of Funds for Expediting a Construction Project.

AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010                                                                        25


  3.3.4. Joint Occupancy:
     3.3.4.1. Approval. The CM may recommend approval of joint occupancy to the CA
     when it is advantageous to the government.
     3.3.4.2. Joint Occupancy Date. The CM, working with the using MAJCOM and the
     CA, jointly determine the joint occupancy date.
     3.3.4.3. Facility Maintenance Responsibility. When agreeing to joint occupancy, the
     Air Force assumes responsibility for maintenance and repair of items not under warranty
     and for operations of portions of the facility occupied during joint occupancy.
     3.3.4.4. Contractor Occupancy After Joint Occupancy. When the Air Force agrees to
     let a contractor continue to occupy or use a facility after it has accepted the facility, for
     any purpose other than to finish correcting deficiencies, the Air Force treats the
     contractor as a tenant and receives payment in accordance with AFI 65-601 V1, for
     logistical support that the Air Force provides to the contractor.
  3.3.5. Construction Quality:
     3.3.5.1. Responsibilities. The CM and the CA share the primary responsibility for
     delivering the user a quality facility. If CM responsibilities have been delegated to the
     BCE, then that office shares the responsibility with the CA. The contractor is responsible
     for inspecting, testing, and documenting those tests and inspections that are required by
     the contract to control material quality and workmanship.
     3.3.5.2. Quality Assurance (QA). The contractor is required by the terms of the
     contract to employ a Quality Control (QC) representative. The CA, through the QA
     program, oversees the Contractor Quality Control (CQC) program. Government
     personnel (from the CA for MILCON and from the BCE otherwise) perform QA
     performance assessment.
  3.3.6. Post-Occupancy Inspections:
     3.3.6.1. Requirement. When required by the MAJCOM and CM, the post-occupancy
     evaluation team conducts post-occupancy inspections 9 to 11 months after the contractor
     completes construction.
     3.3.6.2. Responsibilities. The CM will schedule post-occupancy inspections with all
     stake holders. The CM sends items of interest concerning criteria to AF/A7CP. BCE
     personnel check one-year warranty items even when a post-occupancy evaluation team
     inspection does not take place. BCE personnel will coordinate with the DA any corrective
     action for discrepancies discovered during the one-year warranty check.

                                           Chapter 4

       MEDICAL FACILITIES DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES

4.1. Scope. This chapter applies to the design and construction of all Air Force medical and
medical related facilities. Planning, programming and design procedures for medical facility
projects are covered in DoDI 6015.17, Planning and Acquisition of Military Health Facilities;
AFI 32-1021; UFC 1-200-01; and UFC 4-510-01, Design: Medical Military Facilities.
4.2. Roles and Responsibilities:
   4.2.1. Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)/TRICARE
   Management Activity (OASD/HA TMA (PPMD)). The OASD/HA TMA provides
   program management for the DoD medical MILCON program and funds medical MILCON
   through the Defense Wide MILCON program.
   4.2.2. Office of the Surgeon General, United States Air Force (USAF/SG). The
   USAF/SG is the using agency for all Air Force medical facilities.
   4.2.3. Air Force Health Facilities Division (HFD). The HFD represents HQ USAF/SG on
   all Air Force medical MILCON design and construction issues. They provide planning and
   programming documents for medical projects to OASD/HA TMA. HFD provides space,
   functional, and operational requirements for medical facility projects, reviews and approves
   medical functional aspects of designs and monitors medical functional aspects of
   construction projects. The HFD provides direct support to the MAJCOM Surgeon General
   and the installation Medical Group for all aspects of medical facility acquisition, design, and
   construction. HFD jointly accepts medical facilities with the BCE. Once the CA determines
   the contractor has met contract requirements, the CA will arrange for the Base Civil Engineer
   to formally accept the facility for the Air Force. The CA provides the BCE with the
   completed DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property, after the
   acceptance inspection.
   4.2.4. DM/CM. AFCEE provides centralized DM/CM expertise for all CONUS Air Force
   medical facilities projects. The DM/CM is responsible for medical MILCON projects at any
   base where the medical facility is to be constructed. The DM/CM shall be involved early on
   in the medical MILCON project, and shall work with the HFD project managers throughout
   the process to ensure successful project execution including conformance to the Base General
   Plan, base architectural standards and compatibility requirements. DM/CM also provides
   official AF position in coordination with HFD when working issues with the DA/CA.
   4.2.5. DA/CA. The HQs level Medical Facilities Office of the appropriate DA/CA provides
   project management and technical oversight for medical MILCON projects. Other DA/CA
   roles and responsibilities are similar to regular AF MILCON projects.
4.3. Medical MILCON: This program is managed by OASD/HA TMA and funded under
Defense Wide MILCON. This section applies to all medical and medical related facilities; it does
not apply to ANG medical facilities.
   4.3.1. Facility Functional Requirements. With input from the installation Medical Group,
   the MAJCOM Surgeon General and AF/SG staff, HFD develops a Program for Design,
   indicating room-by-room space requirements, and a Medical Facility Room Contents Listing,
AFI32-1023 21APRIL 2010                                                                        27


   indicating room-by-room equipment and furniture requirements; OASD/HA TMA provides
   final approval of the Departmental Level Program for Design. The DM/CM supports HFD in
   preparing the DD Form 1391; supporting facility costs; selecting and recommending the site
   for installation approval; coordinating requirements/approval documents with MAJCOM and
   Base representatives.
   4.3.2. Project Justification and Submittal. The OASD/HA TMA conducts a biennial Tri-
   Service scoring process called the Capital Investment Decision Model (CIDM). The Medical
   Treatment Facility Commander (MTF) will provide functional inputs to HFD to prepare the
   DD Form 1391 and other programming documents. Concurrently, the MTF establishes a
   requirement for the work or project with the BCE and provides the DD Form 1391 being
   developed by HFD. This enables the BCE to input the project and its programming data into
   ACES-PM and initiate the Environmental Assessment (EA) process, which for medical
   projects is paid for by   the Defense Health Program. If an EA is required for medical
   projects, the design may typically not begin until a Finding of No Significant Impact
   (FONSI) is made. HFD works with BCE to develop the Requirements Document
   (RD)/Project Book (PB)* for the project and AFCEE assists in validating the supporting
   facility costs and infrastructure for the project. AF/SG integrates and prioritizes the
   MAJCOM projects and forwards them to OASD/HA TMA for CIDM scoring. * Many
   installations have combined the RD and PB or use the terms interchangeably.
   4.3.3. Medical Unspecified Minor Construction (UMC) Requirements. Unforeseen or
   urgent construction projects that should not be delayed for inclusion in the next regular
   annual MILCON program are UMC or P-341 candidates. Installation and MAJCOM staffs
   will process Medical UMC requirements in the same way as medical MILCON projects.
   OASD/HA TMA funds approved projects from their Defense Wide MILCON account.
   Projects programmed under the UMC authority must comply with DoDI 6015.17.
4.4. Project Authorizations. OASD/HA issues all design and construction authorizations,
including A-E selection, design initiation, and contract advertising and award.
4.5. Design Approvals. OASD/HA reviews and approves concept designs, and approves
significant changes in project scope due to changes in concepts of operation and addition or
deletion of medical functions.
4.6. Construction Changes. OASD/HA TMA (PPMD) must approve changes that add
significant new features to the project, which were not originally contemplated in the design. All
non-mandatory change orders with cost estimates in excess of $100,000, must be reported to
TMA(PPMD). These proposed changes will be coordinated thru the DM/CM prior to submission
to TMA(PPMD). If funds are required for changes that exceed the amount available and the
management reserve account is inadequate, the Construction Agent will notify and request
additional funds from TMA-PPMD in writing along with justification for additional contingency
funds and/or source of funds as appropriate. The DM/CM approves construction changes less
than $100,000.
4.7. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Program. Some medical projects in the BRAC
program receive funding from the Air Force BRAC MILCON program. Larger medical projects
in the BRAC receive funding and authorization through OASD/HA TMA. However, design and
construction submittal procedures follow the medical MILCON procedures. The DM/CM

acquires the required funding and issues all design and construction authorizations to the
DA/CA, as appropriate.

ascertain quality or state of work and to determine compliance with plans and specifications and
contract provisions.
Construction Agent (CA)—The DoD component responsible for the technical execution of
project construction. For Air Force MILCON projects, the CA is either U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), or, for approved
projects, AFCEE. The AFCEE Waterbeach office is the CA for the United Kingdom.
Construction Manager (CM)—The Air Force organization designated to manage construction,
provide Air Force interface with the CA, and provide updates on construction milestones to the
Air Staff and major commands for specific projects.
Construction Management Plan (CMP)—Plan developed to identify and prescribe
organizational responsibilities, management procedures, and approval processes in detail.
Contracting Officer (CO)—A U.S. military officer or civilian employee who has a valid
appointment as a contracting officer under the provisions of the FAR. This individual has the
authority to enter into and administer contracts and determinations as well as findings about such
contracts.
Design Agent (DA)—The DoD component responsible for technical execution of project design.
For Air Force MILCON projects, the DA is either U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), or, for approved projects, AFCEE. The
AFCEE Waterbeach office is the DA for the United Kingdom.
Design Manager (DM)—The Air Force organization designated to manage the design, provide
Air Force interface with the design agent, and provide updates on design milestones to the Air
Staff and MAJCOMs for specific projects.

Inspection—The CA and contractors’ inspection duties include, but are not limited to, such
items as checking layout of the construction in the field and safety compliance; inspecting
workmanship and materials to determine conformity with contract documents. They also include
reviewing laboratory tests and analyses of materials; completing and submitting field and
progress reports; and checking monthly and final estimates as a basis for payment.
Military Construction Program (MILCON)—The program approved annually by the
Congress in the DoD Authorization and Military Construction Acts, plus individual projects
authorized pursuant to standing project authority provided by Congress in Title 10 of the United
States Code.
Project Delivery Team (PDT)—the integrated project team consisting of all project
stakeholders and contributing participants through each stage of the MILCON delivery process.
The PDT produces optimum project results from an integrated approach over the entire delivery
process. All team members provide an essential perspective and role throughout the process as
their contributions are leveraged from conceptual requirement planning through construction
completion. A PDT should include the primary stakeholders (facility user/customer, installation
engineers, and operators), project architects/ engineers, interior designers, planners, value
engineers, environmental engineers, energy managers, contracting officers, constructors, and
DA/CA-agents. For NAF projects, the funding organization is also part of the team determining
the execution strategy.
Red Zone Meeting—A meeting held at the 80 percent construction completion date where
participants discuss, define, and achieve consensus on actions necessary to complete
construction, support user occupancy, perform financial closeout and document the fiscal
closeout of the project in the Real Property Records.
Value Engineering—the systematic review by a multi-disciplined team to identify/analyze the
most cost effective options to reliably accomplish the programmed project intent at the lowest
life-cycle cost without sacrificing safety, quality, operations, maintenance, and the environment.
The experienced, multi-disciplinary team improves value and economy through the study of
alternate design concepts, materials, and methods without compromising the project’s functional
requirements.

                                  SAMPLE ETL FORMAT

A2.1. Overview. The sample ETL format in this attachment identifies the major topic areas and
the sequence in which they should appear in most ETLs. However, to maximize the flexibility of
the ETL system, you can modify the format for particular situations. Items 1, 3, and 7 must
appear in all ETLs, in the sequence shown here, and the distribution statement must appear at the
bottom of the first page only.
A2.2. Revised ETLs.
   A2.2.1. Minor Clarifications and Corrections. When a previously issued ETL needs minor
   clarifications and corrections, a summary of revisions is not required (see paragraph A2.2.3).
   Insert change bars at the location of the changes and add ―(Change #)‖ to the title, e.g., ―ETL
   09-10 (Change 1): CE Operations.‖ An ETL thus modified is not considered revised and will
   retain the original ETL number and date.
   A2.2.2. Supersedure Statement. All revised ETLs will contain a supersedure statement
   noting what ETL is superseded. Place the supersedure statement at the end of the purpose
   statement.
   A2.2.3. Summary of Revisions. Insert a summary of revisions as a separate paragraph after
   the purpose statement. It helps orient readers to matters that are different from the previous
   version of the ETL, and is a central and consistent place in the ETL where readers can find
   that type of information.
       A2.2.3.1. Minimal Revisions. When an ETL is minimally revised (less than 30 percent
       of the text is modified), place change bars at the location of the changes and add a
       summary of revisions. The summary identifies changes by citing the paragraphs, figures,
       tables, or attachments in which they appear. Renumbered paragraphs do not require
       change bars or inclusion in the summary.
       A2.2.3.2. Major Revisions. When an ETL has major revisions (at least 30 percent of
       the text is modified), change bars are not required and the summary of revisions will
       include the following statement: ―This ETL is substantially revised and must be
       completely reviewed.‖
