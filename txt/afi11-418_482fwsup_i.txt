1. General. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations
Group Commander (OG/CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) and Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The chain of supervision
begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the individual squadron supervisors. Specific
duties and responsibilities of each are defined later in this instruction. Paragraph 3 specifies the
requirements for each position.

NOTE: For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” (aircrew) is used in accordance with
(IAW) the definition specified in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11 -2 MDS
Volume 1. Aircrews are also considered “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in
another MDS or previously rated “experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS,
are selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC. Where no definition is provided,
“experienced” will be determined by the unit squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.
2. Operations Supervision Functions:
   2.1. Supervisor of Flying. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct
   representative of the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command a nd control of flight
   operations. Decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
 4                                                  AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011



NOTE:
     1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/RC-26
     operations/special operations/deployed U-2 Ops.
     2. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
     3. DELETED.
     2.2. Operations Supervisor. The squadron Ops Sup must be filled by the squadron operations
     officer, assistant operations officer, flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified
     by the squadron commander and approved by the OG/CC.
     ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops
     Sup and will determine the appropriate personnel to fill the Ops Sup position.
     2.2. (482FW) The 93d Fighter Squadron/ Commander (93 FS/CC) will screen and review
     qualifications and nominate candidates for the Operations Supervisors (OPS SUP) position.
     The 482d Operations Group (482 OG/CC) will review and appoint. The OPS SUP
     qualification will be tracked on the 93 FS Certification Letter (Letter of X’s).
        2.2.1. Squadron commanders can always fill the Ops Sup position, if available.
        2.2.2. During local flying operations, an Ops Sup will always be immediately available
        to the OG/CC, the SOF, command and control (C2) personnel or other supporting
        agencies to respond to any current operations issues requiring time-sensitive answers,
        decisions and actions.
        2.2.3. For Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) tasked missions, AFRC units require an
        Ops Sup for home station departure and arrival.
     2.3. Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The SDO is an experienced squadron member,
     designated by the squadron operations officer, who has the authority to make operations-
     related decisions and recommendations. The SDO is necessary when the squadron has on-
     going off-station operations. These operations include sorties that do not otherwise qualify as
     deployed sorties. When on duty, the SDO will be available to the OG/CC, the SOF, C2
     personnel and other supporting agencies to respond to squadron operations issues. For
     operations where the SOF is not qualified to provide technical assistance to the type of
     aircraft airborne and an Ops Sup is not readily available, the SDO will assist the SOF as
     required.
3. Supervision of Flying Operations. All levels of flight operations may not require each
supervisory position to be manned. With the exception of scramble (Active Duty), some type of
squadron-level supervisor is always required (Ops Sup/SDO), but other factors enter into the
decision if the group-level SOF position should be manned. Table 1 outlines the minimum
supervision requirements.

   3.2. Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1 for each type of
   operation. The OG/CC may impose additional requirements depending on local
   circumstances.
4. Responsibilities of Supervisors:

NOTE: For the purposes of this instruction, the term “operations group commander” also refers
to the designated representative.
   4.1. OG/CC (ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or AOO) will:
       4.1.1. Be responsible for the implementation, direction and execution of the Operations
       Supervision program.
       4.1.2. Be immediately available to the SOF or Ops Sup for consultation during daily
       flying operations.
       4.1.3. Ensure tenant flying units use host/tenant memorandum of agreement
       (MOA)/letter of agreement (LOA) to avoid duplication of effort, where appropriate.
       4.1.4. Be the final approval authority for unit supplement to this instruction.
   4.2. SOF will:
       4.2.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1 or when directed by the OG/CC.
       4.2.2. Be responsible to the OG/CC for monitoring and supervising all phases of unit
       flying operations and will provide guidance, advice, assistance and recommendations to
       aircrews, supervisors, command and control personnel and support agencies regarding the
       safe and efficient conduct of flight operations.
          4.2.2.1. While aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for the safe operation
          of their aircraft, the SOF will ensure that in-flight emergency (IFE) recovery plans
          and weather related mission changes reflect sound airmanship, follow AFI and
          technical order guidance, and “pass the common sense check.”
       4.2.3. Remember that safety is the first priority. If safety is an issue, the SOF has the
       authority to direct appropriate actions, on behalf of the OG/CC, to correct/prevent unsafe
       situations. This includes the use of any and all resources to include radios, FM nets,
       telephone hot lines and all wing-flying operations on the ground or in the air.
8                                               AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011


    4.2.4. Prior to the first launch, ensure the airfield status is suitable for safe operations
    IAW Air Force, major command (MAJCOM) and local directives.
       4.2.4.1. (Added-482FW) Each daily Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will complete the
       SOF Duty Checklist found in the SOF Continuity Books to confirm the airfield status
       and the Go/No-Go status of each pilot on the flying schedule.
       4.2.4.2. (Added-482FW) Every OPS SUP will complete the OPS SUP Checklist
       found in the OPS SUP Binder, confirm all the pilot/aircrew currencies via the
       Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) “SOF” report, and confirm the
       Go/No-Go status of each pilot.
    4.2.5. During an emergency or an abnormal situation, provide aircrews with guidance,
    timely advice and assistance to determine a correct course of action to safely recover the
    aircraft.
    4.2.5. (482FW) The SOF will ensure that the Quick Reaction Checklist in the SOF
    Continuity Book is accomplished when warranted. The SOF will ensure that the 482
    OG/CC is notified of every aircraft emergency. If unable to personally notify the 482
    OG/CC or designee, the SOF will ensure that the 482 FW/Command Post (482FW/CP) is
    alerted and request their help in notifying the 482 OG/CC.
    4.2.6. Be in a position to visually monitor the final approach and landing of IFE aircraft.
    If unable, the SOF will direct another highly qualified aircrew member to be in position
    to monitor the landing and provide needed assistance or guidance. (ANG/AFRC: Not
    required.)
    4.2.7. Closely monitor the status of primary and emergency airfields and inform aircrews
    of changes that may affect flight operations.
    4.2.8. When deteriorating weather conditions affect flying operations, coordinate with
    wing agencies and utilize all available resources (i.e., weather, radar, tower personnel,
    pilot reports, etc.) to determine the best course of action for wing aircraft. This course of
    action could extend to departures and recoveries as well as diverts or SOF directed
    holding. The SOF will determine suitable weather alternates, assign them accordingly
    and monitor them. When necessary to ensure safe flight operations, the SOF will
    coordinate with the air traffic control (ATC) watch supervisor or senior controller for
    runway changes.
    4.2.8. (482FW) The SOF has the authority to put the wing on weather (WX) hold, recall
    aircraft and direct diverts as necessary. The SOF will advise the 482 OG/CC and OPS
    SUP on all issues concerning airborne aircraft when time permits.
    4.2.9. Prepare a daily log tracking major events, with format and content as defined by
    unit supplement. The SOF will debrief the OG/CC and the applicable squadron
    commander of any aircraft involved in an unusual situation, IFE, weather divert or other
    mission change requiring SOF action or intervention.
       4.2.9.1. (Added-482FW) The SOF will complete an opening and closing checklist,
       as well as, maintain a daily log tracking major events. (See Figures 2, 3, & 4.)

     4.3. Ops Sup will:
        4.3.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1 and be present in the squadron when
        required in the performance of the duties listed below.
            4.3.1.1. (Added-482FW) The 93rd Fighter Squadron (93 FS) will schedule an OPS
            SUP during all local flying operations, including FCFs. The OPS SUP will be in the
            squadron 30 minutes prior to the first brief. In the event both the OPS SUP and SOF
            are not available due to scheduling constraints, the 482 OG/CC or designee may
            approve the SOF to perform both OPS SUP and SOF duties. The SOF position and
            duties will take priority. The SOF will run the OPS SUP checklist along with the
            SOF checklist when combining duties.
        4.3.2. Be immediately available to assist the SOF or aircrew (for units which do not
        require a SOF).
        4.3.2. (482FW) The OPS SUP will be immediately available to the 482 OG/CC, the
        SOF, command and control personnel, and other supporting agencies to respond to any
        current operation issues requiring time-sensitive decisions. All changes including
        cancellations or additions of personnel, aircraft or airspace to the current day flying
        schedule must have OPS SUP approval. The OPS SUP will normally sit at the
        Operations Desk during the period of scheduled flying.
        4.3.3. When the SOF is not qualified in the distressed aircraft or the unit does not require
        a SOF, be the primary source of technical assistance.
        4.3.4. For situations where the SOF and Ops Sup are not qualified to provide technical
        assistance to the type of aircraft airborne, schedule an instructor or experienced
        crewmember to be immediately available for aircraft technical assistance.
        4.3.5. Ensure the SOF is advised of any changes or deviations to the squadron’s flying
        schedule.
        4.3.6. Be responsible for the execution of the daily flying schedule and coordinate any
        mission changes as required. Ensure that the actual mission flown is accurately annotated
        on the flying schedule.
            4.3.6.1. Be assisted by SARM personnel or a duty officer as required.
AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011                                                           13


       4.3.7. Ensure crews are briefed on aircraft and airfield status, aircraft configuration,
       scheduled and available airspace and weather.
       4.3.8. Manage aircraft tail number changes, crew swaps, flight-plan and airspace
       changes.
       4.3.9. Ensure electronic scheduling and tracking systems are updated to include changes
       to and deviations from the daily flying schedule.
          4.3.9.1. Prepare, at squadron commander’s discretion, a daily operations log to aid in
          tracking daily operations. For missions where a SOF is not required, this log will be
          prepared by Ops Sup or SDO. Log format and content will be defined by unit
          supplement.

NOTE: Mission commanders/flight leads are required to coordinate with Operations
Supervisor/Top 3 prior to the flight brief when intended sortie type, profile, airspace, and/or
aircraft configuration do not match the approved schedule.
              4.3.9.1.1. (Added-482FW) The OPS SUP will complete an opening and closing
              checklist, as well as, maintain a daily log tracking major events. (See Figures 5)

     4.4. SDO will:
        4.4.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1.
        4.4.2. Be available by telephone, pager or radio to respond to any current operational
        issues requiring time-sensitive answers, decisions and actions.
AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011                                                         17


      4.4.3. Ensure the SOF and Ops Sup are advised of any changes or deviations to the
      squadron’s flying schedule.
5. Responsibilities of Other Key Unit Personnel:
   5.1. Wing/unit commanders are responsible for an effective Operations Supervision program
   for all assigned and attached units and ensure other group commanders support the OG/CC
   when and where needed in order to execute an effective program.
   5.2. Mission Support group commanders are responsible for the maintenance, upgrade and
   repair of the applicable SOF facilities and equipment.
   5.3. Mission Support group/Logistic Readiness group commanders are responsible for
   maintenance, upgrade and repair of the SOF vehicle.
   5.4. Squadron commanders ensure a SOF/Ops Sup/SDO is on duty when required by Table
   1.
   5.5. Command post is responsible for tracking all wing flying activities, both on and off
   station. It functions as the central source for information during an emergency. ANG/AFRC:
   Single squadron units and units with minimal command post full-time manning may establish
   procedures for unit SOF, Ops Sup, and duty desk personnel to track flying activities and be
   the central source for information during an emergency.
6. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
   6.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
   the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
      6.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
      and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
      (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
      crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
      6.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
      agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates, allowing the SOF or
      Ops Sup to devote full attention to the emergency.
      6.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
      6.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
      frequency) from the Ops Sup/SDO to an IFE aircrew. Only ATC personnel may authorize
      direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency. However,
      this does not preclude the SOF from using whatever communication necessary, to include
      GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation that could immediately jeopardize safe
      recovery.
      6.1.5. That only the on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate an
      emergency.
      6.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
      commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
      knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
      6.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
 18                                                  AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011


         6.1.8. Directing the Ops Sup or other highly qualified individual to report to the SOF’s
         duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
7. CONFERENCE HOTEL Aircraft Specific Procedures:

NOTE: DELETED.
      7.1. These procedures make aircraft specialists accessible to the SOF or Ops Sup and
      aircrew when in-flight situations pose systems-related questions that cannot be answered at
      the local level. See Attachment 4 for specific MDS procedures.
      7.2. Table A4.1 shows the different MDSs and the MDS-specific reference paragraphs.
8. SOF/ATC Relationship:
      8.1. The relationship between supervisors and ATC must be based on professionalism, trust
      and teamwork. SOFs represent the OG/CC for the conduct of safe flight operations and
      mission accomplishment.
      8.2. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of the watch supervisors
      and controllers. Unless safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch
      supervisor. To promote effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based
      on knowledge of the flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions,
      actions that affect ATC concerns or desires.
      8.3. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without prior
      coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All radio
      transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be coordinated
      through the SOF.
9. Duty Hours:
      9.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
      directed by AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented. For AFRC units, 12
      hours of crew rest is required prior to starting duty but may be waived by the OG/CC to 8
      hours on a case-by-case basis.
      9.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 12 hours. Waiver authority for SOF duty day is OG/CC.
      For AFRC units, the maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours and may not be waived.
      9.3. The SOF will be on duty in with sufficient time to complete required duties in paragraph
      4.2 and will be in the primary or alternate duty location 30 minutes prior to first scheduled
      takeoff and remain on duty until the last aircraft is shut down.
         9.3.1. (Added-482FW) The 482 FW SOF will report for duty a minimum of 15 minutes
         prior to the first brief time.
      9.4. (AFRC/ANG) If Ops Sup and SOF duties are combined, SOF duty hour limitations
      apply.
10. SOF Duty Location:
      10.1. The OG/CC will designate primary and alternate SOF duty locations. As a minimum,
      the location must have adequate communication equipment and the capability to monitor
      weather conditions. It is desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground
AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011                                                             19


  operations, takeoffs, landings and local traffic patterns can be observed. The designated
  locations must provide the SOF with timely access to a SOF vehicle and the airfield when
  required. AFRC units are not required to have a dedicated vehicle for the SOF, but must be
  provided access to a vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
  10.2. The primary SOF location for active duty bomber and fighter units will be in the
  control tower. The primary SOF location for all ACC flying units will be in the control tower
  (OG/CC may designate an alternate SOF duty location IAW this regulation). ANG/AFRC
  and smaller than wing-sized units will designate, in priority order, the SOF primary and
  alternate duty locations in their unit supplement to this instruction. Also see paragraph 16 for
  ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units. Unless contained in the following list, SOF
  duty locations need an OG/CC waiver:
     10.2.1. The control tower.
     10.2.2. The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
     10.2.3. The runway monitoring unit (RMU)/runway supervisory unit (RSU).
     10.2.4. The unit dispatch desk.
     10.2.5. The command post.
11. SOF Equipment:
  11.1. The communication equipment must be functional and immediately available to the
  SOF and include:
     11.1.1. A dedicated multi-frequency radio (UHF, VHF and/or HF, as appropriate) to
     contact airborne aircraft.
     11.1.2. A telephone (land-line or cellular telephone) or FM radio to contact the OG/CC,
     command post, Ops Sups/SDOs, weather facility and ATC watch supervisors. Dedicated
     phone lines (hot-lines) are preferred.
     11.1.3. The minimum equipment for the SOF to communicate with airborne aircraft and
     the command and control network and monitor ATC.
  11.2. An appropriate local weather dissemination system will be available.
  11.3. Units are required to have a dedicated SOF vehicle immediately available to the SOF
  and positioned to respond to emergencies, perform airfield inspections and other official
  purposes. This vehicle must have a flight line clearance and be equipped with a multi-
  channel radio capable of contacting unit aircraft and local controllers. MAJCOMs may waive
  this requirement in their supplement to this instruction.
  AFRC: Wing commander or equivalent may waive this requirement IAW paragraph 19.
  11.4. Locally developed checklists will be used to outline procedures for normal and
  emergency procedures. The required SOF checklists are listed in Attachment 2.
  11.5. SOF dedicated binoculars will be immediately available to the SOF when in the
  control tower, RSU/RMU or SOF vehicle.
  11.6. The SOF will have access to such items as applicable directives and instructions,
  aircraft Technical Orders, checklists, in-flight guides, SOF read/information file, etc. If the
 20                                                 AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011


      SOF repositions to an alternate location, minimum essential equipment will be available (pre-
      positioned or transported).
12. SOF Qualifications:
      12.1. All SOF nominees will be experienced, rated officers with proven maturity, judgment
      and supervisory ability. They must be mission qualified combat mission ready (CMR)/basic
      mission capable (BMC) in a unit aircraft and medically qualified to fly.
      12.2. All SOFs will complete the SOF qualification or upgrade program.
      12.3. Duties not involving flying (DNIF) crewmembers may perform SOF duties when
      specifically cleared by a flight surgeon.
      12.3. (482FW) will not assume SOF responsibilities until cleared by one of the attached
      Flight Surgeons.
      12.4. Qualified SOFs may perform duties while N-CMR/N-BMC at the discretion of the
      OG/CC. The status must be temporary in nature (due to TDY, DNIF status, RAP sortie look
      back, ground training courses, etc.). All SOF related items will be current. Qualified SOFs
      will not perform SOF duties in unqualified (UQ) status. EXCEPTION: AFRC OG/CC may
      approve qualified SOFs to perform SOF duties in UQ status on a case by case basis.
13. SOF Currency/Recurrency. The currency for SOF duties is 90 days (ANG/AFRC: 180
days; AETC ANG/Reserve Associate Instructor Pilots: 90 days). Individual squadrons will
track SOF currencies (Aviation Resource Management System [ARMS] preferred). To regain
currency, as a minimum, accomplish a 1-hour supervised tour with a current and qualified SOF.
14. SOF Upgrade Program:
      14.1. Squadron commanders will screen and review qualifications of all SOF candidates
      before nominating them for entry into the upgrade program.
      14.2. All SOF candidates will receive an interview and briefing from the OG/CC on
      responsibilities, personal philosophy and expectations. OG/CCs will emphasize the SOFs
      position as a group level supervisor and that decision authority is delegated to the SOF
      position to ensure the safe accomplishment of the mission.
      14.3. All upgrading SOFs will become familiar with airfield procedures, primary and
      alternate duty locations, equipment and local support agencies. The upgrade program will
      emphasize operating procedures and support provided, specifically capabilities and
      limitations. Upgrade programs will include:
         14.3.1. Weather (to include forecaster duties and priorities) information.
         14.3.2. Approach control information.
         14.3.3. Tower operation.

     14.3.8. Airfield Drivers License Qualification (N/A ANG/AFRC if alternate location is
     not IAW para 10.2.2).
  14.4. For previously qualified SOFs, the OG/CC may waive applicable upgrade
  requirements.
  14.5. The upgrading SOF will accomplish two supervised upgrade tours of two hours each
  (minimum of 4 hours of training time) with a current and qualified SOF (IAW para 14.9).
  Conduct SOF training on two different days in order for the upgradee to observe differing
  wind and weather conditions. Upgradees will act as primary SOF on their second upgrade
  tour (previously qualified SOFs require only this tour). These tours must include the
  following:
     14.5.1. Operation of all SOF equipment and radios.
     14.5.2. Contact procedures for aircraft and support agencies.
     14.5.3. A review of publications and directives available to the SOF.
     14.5.4. Operation of SOF vehicle (requires a flight line permit/license).
     14.5.5. A familiarity tour of the airfield and discussion of frequently used travel routes.
     14.5.6. When acting as primary SOF, the upgradee will successfully handle an IFE
     (actual or simulated).
  14.6. All upgrading SOFs will become familiar with the performance aspects and
  characteristics of all base assigned aircraft.
  14.7. Upgrading SOFs will accomplish an initial written examination containing a minimum
  of 25 questions on SOF duties, procedures and responsibilities. Minimum passing grade is 85
  percent correctable to 100 percent.
  14.8. The OG/CC will review upgrade training records and certify upgradees for SOF duties.
  14.9. (N/A AFRC/ANG) SQ/CCs will designate in writing and OG/CCs will certify (on the
  “letter of X” or equivalent documentation) and OG/CCs will certify on appropriate
  documentation SOFs who are qualified to upgrade a crewmember to SOF (i.e., perform the
  duties of an “Instructor SOF”).
  14.10. (Added-482FW) 482 FW SOF training will cover those potential hazards unique to
  Homestead Air Reserve Base (HARB) to include heightened periods of bird activity and
  HARB Bird Conditions and Warnings, barrier re-configurations and any delays for runway
  changes. Potential communication difficulties with Miami Air Traffic Control facilities, lack
  of on-base medical facilities and procedures for expeditious emergency medical response
  from Miami-Dade County Fire Department. The 482 FW/SOF Upgrade Training Sheet (See
  Figure 6) will be used to upgrade new SOFs.

                                                   Commander, 482d Operations Group
15. SOF Continuation Training (CT):
   15.1. Semi-annual SOF meetings are the usual means to accomplish CT. Commanders will
   be involved in developing meeting agendas and all qualified SOFs are expected to attend. If
   unable to attend, SOFs will review meeting minutes.
   15.1. (482FW) 482 OG/Standardization & Evaluations (482 OG/OGV) will coordinate and
   hold semi-annual SOF meetings. All SOF meetings will be videotaped (if available). SOFs
   unable to attend the meeting will watch the video and/or review the SOF meeting minutes.
   The Patriot Excalibur (PEX) Go/No-Go program will be used to track and sign off
   individuals unable to attend. In addition, the SOF meeting minutes will be added to the SOF
   Read File.
   15.2. Annually, all SOFs are required to review applicable SOF guidance and directives and
   receive a briefing from the OG/CC on responsibilities, expectations and commander
   perspective. If unable to attend the OG/CC briefing, SOFs will review briefing minutes.
16. Provisions for ANG/AFRC and Smaller Than Wing-Sized Units. The provisions of this
paragraph apply to ANG/AFRC units and to units not directly associated with a typical wing
(i.e., geographically separated units/squadrons, detachments, etc.).
   16.1. If a unit operates from a location with another organization (i.e., tenant unit),
   integration into host unit supervisory program should be attempted if operations are
   compatible. These procedures will be implemented through LOAs/MOAs.
   16.2. In ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing size units, supervisory positions are limited
   based on unit authorizations. At the discretion of the OG/CC (or equivalent), more than one
   supervisory position may be covered by a single supervisor. The responsibilities of the SOF
   position take priority over all other duties and the single operations supervisor will be SOF
   qualified. Units will establish procedures in their unit supplement to this instruction for
   others to assist with SOF and Ops Sup duties and responsibilities if required during times
   when one supervisor is covering both SOF and Operations Supervisor positions.
   16.3. For AFRC units which do not require a SOF, the OG/CC will designate duty locations
   and procedures for Ops Sup during IFEs in the unit supplement to AFI 11-418.
   16.3. (482FW) If, due to manning limitations, a supervisor is required to cover both OPS
   SUP and SOF, there will be an experienced and qualified pilot readily available via cell
   phone or Frequency Modulation radio (FM brick) to cover for that supervisor if
   circumstances should call
17. SOF Program Administration:
   17.1. The OG/CC will designate an Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the
   administration of the program.
   17.1. (482FW) 482 OG/OGV will administer the SOF program. 93 FS/Director of Training
   (93 FS/DOT) will track qualifications.
   17.2. The OPR will:
      17.2.1. Develop and administer the SOF initial training program.
 24                                                 AFI11-418_482FWSUP_I 23 MARCH 2011


         17.2.2. Develop and administer the SOF qualification test. This is a controlled test of at
         least 25 questions. It will be updated/reviewed annually.
         17.2.3. Retain all initial qualification and continuation training records IAW the Air
         Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
         17.2.4. Establish procedures for monitoring SOF currencies and continuation training
         requirements (ARMS preferred).
         17.2.5. Schedule semi-annual SOF meetings.
         17.2.6. Publish SOF meeting minutes for review by SOFs and other supervisors unable
         to attend.
         17.2.7. Develop normal and emergency SOF checklists and review/update annually.
         17.2.8. Update the SOF publications as required.
         17.2.9. Be primarily responsible for developing the group supplement to this instruction.
         17.2.10. Ensure SOF equipment is maintained in operating condition and is adequate for
         mission accomplishment.
18. Unit Supplement:
      18.1. Each wing/group will supplement this instruction to expand upon basic guidance and
      incorporate local procedures. The unit supplement should establish or detail the following
      items as required:
         18.1.1. Unit organization with responsibility for administering the Operations
         Supervision program.
         18.1.1. (482FW) The 482 OG/OGV will administer the SOF program. 93 FS/DOT will
         track qualifications.

         observe takeoffs and landings. The backup alternate SOF location will be at the 93 FS
         Operations Duty Desk.
         18.1.3. Supervision requirements and duty locations for FCFs.
         18.1.3. (482FW) Supervision requirements and duty locations for Functional Check
         Flights (FCF) will be identical to that of local flying operations (see 4.3.1.1. (Added) of
         this supplement)
         18.1.4. Use, review and maintenance of a SOF Read File(s).
         18.1.4. (482FW) 482 OG/OGV will maintain the SOF Read File in the SOF Continuity

         New Read File Items before every tour. New Read File Items will be annotated by
         placing all SOFs in the “red” in PEX. SOFs will electronically sign off the review of the
         new Read File items on this program.
