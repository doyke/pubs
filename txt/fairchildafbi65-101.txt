maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. System of Records Notice
(SORN) F065 AF A, Time and Attendance Feeder Records, applies.


1. Time and Attendance (T&A) Applicability: The designated timekeepers for each
organization will maintain a record of each employee’s T&A on Fairchild AFB Form 261. The
Financial Services officer will give timekeepers instructions and training on the preparation and
input of T&A forms, if requested.
2. Fairchild AFB Form 261: Use this form for reporting exceptions to a normal tour of duty
for each employee for a bi-weekly pay period. Use it to report all types of paid and unpaid hours
and leave charges that for fall outside an employee’s normal tour of duty.
3. Certification: The certification of a T&A form is an authorization for the expenditure of
government funds. The first-line supervisors are responsible for certifying T&A forms;
however, in the absence of the first-line supervisor, the acting supervisor or the next level
supervisor may certify T&A forms and approve leave.
     3.1. Certifying responsibilities should not be assigned to individuals who cannot actually
     observe employees’ attendance and absence each day.
     3.2. Supervisors may not certify their own T&A forms.
4. Supervisor’s Responsibilities: The supervisor may assign checking of daily attendance and
posting of T&A forms to a subordinate. Assignment of these duties to a timekeeper does not
relieve the subordinate. Assignment of these duties to a timekeeper does not relieve the
supervisor of the responsibility for the accuracy of the forms.
5. Timekeeper Responsibilities: All supervisors/subordinates/timekeepers should record all
manner of exceptions to T&A records on a daily basis on the Fairchild AFB Form 261. Ensure
employees either initial the form for leave used or sign Standard Form (SF) 71, Application for
Leave.
     5.1. Ensure that all postings for overtime and compensatory time earned are approved,
     corrections on the T&A form initialed, and totals are correct before submitting the T&A
     form.
     5.2. Ensure that employees present witness and jury duty documents and documents of
     attendance and statements of fees paid to employees. Contact the 92d Comptroller Squadron
     Financial Services Office (92 CPTS/FMF) for additional information on jury duty.
     5.3. SF 71 that is used for other than home leave or telecommuting, used by the supervisor
     to approve/disapprove or verify leave information to be posted to time and attendance forms,
     must be destroyed at end of the pay period if the T&A form is initiated by the employee.
        5.3.1. If the number of leave hours taken is less than a full workday, code the leave type
        and the number of hours used for each day leave is taken. Post the actual clock hours in
        the ―Time Frame‖ section of the form.
6. Recording Entries of Fairchild AFB Form 261: The form is self explanatory; however,
timekeepers must ensure approving officials are signing for the appropriate leave entry as
identified in AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave:
FAIRCHILDAFBI65-101 31 JULY 2012                                                               3


   6.1. Enter the correct number in the ―Pay Period‖ block.
   6.2. Annotate the appropriate type of leave (call the Civilian Payroll Office for other leave
   codes):
       6.2.1. LA—Annual Leave
       6.2.2. LS—Sick Leave
       6.2.3. LY—Time-off Award
       6.2.4. KA—Leave Without Pay
       6.2.5. LC—Court Leave
       6.2.6. LM—Military Leave
       6.2.7. OS—Overtime Scheduled
       6.2.8. CD—Credit Time Earned
       6.2.9. CN—Credit Time Taken
       6.2.10. CE—Compensatory Time Earned
       6.2.11. CT—Compensatory Time Taken
       6.2.12. CB—Travel Compensatory Time Earned
       6.2.13. CF—Travel Compensatory Time Taken
       6.2.14. OU—Overtime Unscheduled
7. Erroneous Entries. Only the certifying official can make pen and ink changes. The
certifying official must line through the error and make corrections as near as possible to the
erroneous entry. The certifying official must initial each line-through correction. Do not use
white-out or correction tape on T&A forms.
8. Erroneous T&A Forms. If a certifying official has already forwarded T&A forms to the
timekeeper and makes changes to the employee's T&A forms which were not recorded, the
certifying official must accomplish a new T&A form. Send the new form to the timekeeper as
soon as possible with the words "Corrected Copy" at the top of the new T&A form. The
timekeeper will input the changes, but the changes may not meet the required Defense Finance
Accounting System (DFAS) suspense for the current pay period but should appear in the
following pay period.
9. Overtime Policy and Procedures. AF Information Management Tool (IMT) 428, Request
for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time. is used to request approval of
overtime, holiday premium pay and compensatory time. This form must be accomplished before
the employee works additional time or, in an emergency, no later than the first workday after the
work is performed. The designated timekeepers for each organization will maintain a record of
each employee's AF IMT 428.
   9.1. Overtime Approval Authority. Within the wing, group commanders and their
   deputies are designated final approving officials for their respective personnel. Requestors
   must be squadron commander/deputy or higher.

    9.1.1. AF IMT 428. An electronic AF IMT 428 will be used to expedite the approval
    process. Attachment 2 provides further guidance on how to complete the AF IMT 428.
    Timekeepers are required to keep all overtime forms (AF IMT 428) on file with the
    Fairchild AFB Form 261. Ensure the complete date is included on the Fairchild AFB
    Form 261 for future reference.
       9.1.1.1. AF IMT 428 must include all applicable signatures with dates prior to
       payroll processing. To aid in timelines, an electronic AF IMT 428 will be provided to
       all organizations via respective group Resource Advisors (RA).
       9.1.1.2. Supervisors must ensure employees’ timekeeping records include approved
       AF IMT 428 for any overtime or compensatory time claimed. Further, supervisors
       must ensure the approved hours on the AF IMT 428 total (or exceed) the amount
       claimed on the time sheet.
       9.1.1.3. All signatures must be made by the proper approving authority, as described
       in paragraph 9.1. above.
       9.1.1.4. Funds Certification must be accomplished by group RAs or Comptroller
       personnel. Funds certifying officials must be appointed in writing by the group
       commander or base Comptroller, specifically indicating authority to approve
       overtime or compensatory time, as relates to annual budget provided to groups at the
       first Financial Management Board (FMB) of the fiscal year (FY).
       9.1.1.5. Justification on the AF IMT 428 must be detailed and describe, at a
       minimum, the specific work requiring overtime/compensatory time and identify why
       these tasks should not be completed during normal business hours or by other
       manning (e.g., military).
       9.1.1.6. Ensure all annual self-inspections are performed according to Attachment 3.
       9.1.1.7. When civilian employees deploy, the responsible base-level supervisor will
       ensure correspondence is obtained from the deployed location leadership specifying
       those who are authorized to approve overtime/compensatory time. Supervisors will
       ensure any overtime/compensatory time processed into the payroll system is approved
       by authorized individuals.
       9.1.1.8. Supervisors should carefully evaluate mission requirements before approving
       annual leave and requesting overtime authorizations in the same pay period. An
       example of an exception is required emergency overtime after annual leave has
       already been taken. Commanders should use sound judgment to ensure overlapping
       overtime and annual leave is kept to a minimum.
       9.1.1.9. Social Security Numbers (SSNs) will no longer be required on AF IMT 428.
       9.1.1.10. Supervisors have the authority to direct employees to take compensatory
       time before annual leave. This management oversight measure will help control
       payroll costs, as unused compensatory hours payout after 26 pay periods. Further,
       supervisors have the authority to adjust employee work schedules to accomplish the
       mission. For example, if you find that an employee typically works four hours
       overtime on Tuesdays to align with late flight ops, you could align the employee’s
       schedule to avoid unnecessary overtime. 92d Force Support Squadron Civilian

         Personnel (FSS/FSMC) should be consulted when dealing with non-routine leave or
         work schedules.
  9.2. Self-inspection Checklist. Quarterly self-inspection is required to ensure proper
  management of the civilian overtime program. Group commanders shall designate an
  individual to complete the quarterly self-inspection and associated checklist (Attachment 3).
  The 92 CPTS will oversee the program, assign names for audits and review self-inspection
  findings. Each quarterly self-inspection will be completed within 30 days of the end of each
  quarter and forwarded to 92 CPTS for review/approval. Corrective actions are the
  responsibility of each group commander and must be vetted through 92 CPTS.
