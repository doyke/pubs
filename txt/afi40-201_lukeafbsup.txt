Air Force Instruction (AFI) 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force, 16
March 2011, is supplemented as follows. This supplement applies to all personnel, military and
civilian, who bring radioactive materials (RAM) onto or use RAM on Luke Air Force Base
(AFB). This publication applies to the U.S. Air Force Reserve units and members attached or
assigned to Luke AFB. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and should be completely reviewed. Updates numbering
to reflect changes in the recently published AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the
US Air Force.
2.16. The base Bioenvironmental Engineer (BE), 56th Aerospace Medicine Squadron
(AMDS) is the Installation Radiation Safety Officer (IRSO).

2.20.2. (Added) The Servicing Contracting Office will ensure that all contractors are aware of
this requirement. The Servicing Contracting Office will also place a standardized statement in
bid solicitations requiring bidders to identify any planned use (including subcontractor use) of
RAM or devices. The contractor must submit the following documentation to the IRSO for
review, preferably as attachments to a cover letter on company letterhead:
2.20.2.1. (Added) Copy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) License or Agreement
State License, along with any amendments, covering the radioactive material to be used. The
license must be current as shown by the expiration date. Of note, the IRSO is specifically
prohibited from approving use for more than 180 calendar days per calendar year if the
contractor submits an agreement state license.
2.20.2.2. (Added) Copy of the users’ qualifications and proof of radiation safety training.
2.20.2.3. (Added) A brief description of the proposed activities, including a copy of the section
of the Air Force contract describing the work to be done at the base and the inclusive dates of the
work.
2.20.2.4. (Added) Statement of storage and security requirements or other particular needs of
the contractor, if applicable.
2.20.2.5. (Added) Copies of the last two leak checks if required by license, permit, or State

representative and the name, address, and telephone number of the RSO named on the license.
2.20.5. (Added) Ensures that under no circumstances will an unlicensed radioactive
source/device be used on Luke AFB. Any questions on contractor responsibility regarding this
issue should be directed to the IRSO prior to the contractor starting any work.
2.20.6. (Added) Ensures immediate notification to IRSO concerning any incident or accident,
loss, theft, or damage to the device or any alleged radiation exposures. Outside normal duty
hours, contact the IRSO through the 56 FW Command Post (6-5600) and request assistance from
the on-call BE representative (623-203-6852).
2.20.7. (Added) Ensures that procurement procedures prohibit the acquisition of radioluminous
signs (per HQ AETC/SG Memorandum “Accountability and Registration of Radio Luminous
Exit Signs,” dated 26 Apr 04).
2.21.3.1. (Added) Logistics Readiness Squadron Operations Officer: Contact BE for receipt
and shipment of RAM in accordance with Technical Order 00-110N-3, 10 CFR Part 20, 49 CFR
Part 173, and this AFI.

Provides information required by Technical Order 00-110N-3. Obtains written direction before
transferring waste from the using facility.
2.30.3. (Added) Ensures personnel perform their duties in a way that ALARA principles are
followed.
2.30.4. (Added) Coordinates with the Unit RSO for the training of employees who may be
occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation.
3.10.12. (Added) Disposal Procedures:
3.10.12.1. (Added) The generator will initiate a written request for disposal instructions for all
non-exempt RAM. If there is a question on whether an article is exempt, contact the IRSO. The
request will include the information contained in Table 3.1.

Table 3.1. (Added) Required information.

     1. NSN
     2. Nomenclature (Compass, Check course)
     3. Quantity
     4. Type of radioisotope (chemical symbol and atomic number, i.e. Ra226)
     5. Physical form (solid, liquid)
     6. Chemical form
     7. Activity per item in curies
     8. Intensity in mRem/hr at 4 inches from surface of unpacked article
9.      Point of Contact

3.10.12.2. (Added) For liquid waste, do not fill containers more than half full.
3.10.12.3. (Added) The generator will forward this request to the IRSO who will review,
approve, and endorse the form. The IRSO will then forward the request to AFRRAD).
AFRRAD will provide written disposal instructions to include packaging, labeling, and shipping
requirements. Failure to comply with AFRRAD instructions could result in the generator and/or
IRSO being subject to disciplinary action under AF regulations or prosecution under federal law.
3.10.12.4. (Added) While awaiting disposal instructions, the generator must store the
radioactive waste in a facility with a placard approved by the USAF Radioisotope Committee
(RIC). The facility must be an enclosed, covered area that provides enough protection to prevent
damage to the package or to the waste itself. The area must have sufficient security to prevent
loss or items from being stolen. The waste must be segregated from biological and chemical

wastes unless they have been produced as a direct result of permitted operations. Waste
comprised of nuclides, having half-lives of less than 65 days, can be held and allowed to decay
until it can be deposed of as non-radioactive waste. This must also be approved in the permit.
Areas in which radioactive waste is generated and temporarily stored must be locked whenever
unattended for more than 30 minutes.
