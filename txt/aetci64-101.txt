OPR: HQ AETC/A4PM                                           Certified by: HQ AETC/A4P (Ms Liz Day)
Supersedes AETCI 64-101, 18 February 2004                                                 Pages: 9

This instruction implements AFPD 64-1, The Contracting System, 7 December 2006. It defines and
explains specific wing or unit and HQ AETC staff roles and responsibilities for proposed modifications to
most efficient organization (MEO) and contract performance work statement (PWS) for aircraft mainte-
nance and base operating support (BOS) functions for contracts and MEOs. Note: PWSs are also known
as statements of work.
This instruction applies to all current and future PWSs procured by the AETC Contracting Squadron
(AETC CONS), Randolph AFB TX, or MEOs as a result of recompetition. It does not apply to Air Force
Reserve Command or Air National Guard units.
Wings and units will coordinate and provide copies of supplements to this instruction to the Program
Management Flight (HQ AETC/A4PM) prior to publication. Send recommendations for changes,
improvements, or waivers to this instruction to HQ AETC/A4PM, 555 E Street East, Randolph AFB TX
78150-4440. Note: Requests must be approved by the appropriate commander before they are sent to HQ
AETC/A4PM.
Attachment 1 contains a glossary of reference and supporting information. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123
(will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This change updates responsibilities (paragraphs 3., 4.2.), updates process flow charts (Attachment 2
through Attachment 4), replaces outdated terminology from PRD to PWS (paragraphs 1., 2.1., 3., 4., and
2                                                                 AETCI64-101 7 DECEMBER 2007

edition.


1. Goal. The goal of this instruction is to establish procedures that standardize processes, eliminate
redundancies and ultimately reduce time and work required to coordinate modifications to AETC PWSs.

2. Program Management. HQ AETC/A4PM will:
    2.1. Serve as the command focal point for all proposed aircraft maintenance and BOS PWS modifica-
    tions.
    2.2. Review and obtain coordination for all modification requests prior to implementation.
    2.3. Ensure responses to modification request packages are evaluated, coordinated with appropriate
    offices of primary responsibility (OPR), and returned to the requesting unit within 20 workdays. Note:
    Based on the complexity of some modifications, additional days may be required.

3. Process Overview:
    3.1. When HQ AETC and wing or unit-level functional representatives identify new or changing
    requirements:
       3.1.1. Begin discussions between these functional representatives and other affected organiza-
       tions as soon as possible prior to submission of the package to expedite the approval process and
       to facilitate meeting timeline goals.
       3.1.2. Complete discussions and related coordination before the request is submitted to the admin-
       istrative contracting officer (ACO).
       3.1.3. Coordinate changes to MEO PWSs with the wing manpower office (MO).
    3.2. The ACO will forward the modification package to HQ AETC/A4PM no later than 20 workdays
    from the date received.
    3.3. Because of the size and complexity of some contracts, there may be several modification propos-
    als from multiple functional areas in progress simultaneously. In an effort to expedite responses to
    these proposals, it is not necessary to consolidate them prior to their submission to HQ AETC/A4PM.
    3.4. HQ AETC functionals will concur or nonconcur with the modification requests within 10 work-
    days of receiving the request from HQ AETC/A4PM.

4. Contract Modifications to the PWS. Accomplish contract modification packages generated by the
wing or unit according to the flowchart in Attachment 2. HQ AETC functionals will generate contract
modification packages according to the flowchart in Attachment 3.
    4.1. Wing and Unit Responsibilities:
       4.1.1. The performance management office (PMO) or wing or unit functional will coordinate with
       the HQ AETC functional and wing MO (for MEOs) before submitting the proposed modification
       to the ACO. Note: For the purposes of this instruction, the PMO is also known as a quality assur-
       ance evaluator (QAE) office.
AETCI64-101 7 DECEMBER 2007                                                                           3


     4.1.2. The ACO is the single point of contact in the wing or unit to ensure continuity for any pro-
     posed PWS modifications that encompass multiple functional areas. The ACO will:
        4.1.2.1. Ensure proposed PWS modifications managed by HQ AETC/A4PM are coordinated
        with the PMO or functional representatives, and MO, as appropriate, before forwarding to HQ
        AETC/A4PM. Coordinate with the wing or unit MO to ensure contract manpower equivalents
        are accurately tracked according to Chapter 6, AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Require-
        ments, and to ensure the proposed modification does not conflict with the criteria identified in
        Chapter 15, AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program (expected to change to Chapter 10
        during next rewrite of AFI 38-203).
        4.1.2.2. Submit the following information to HQ AETC/A4PM for evaluation and approval:
            4.1.2.2.1. A cover memorandum indicating an explanation of the exact requirement
            change, the reason for the proposed modification, which functional areas will be affected,
            and any increase or decrease in manning and (or) equipment.
            4.1.2.2.2. Government-estimated costs associated with the increase or decrease in require-
            ments, the proposed source of funds, and a planning or funded draft of AF IMT 9, Request
            for Purchase, as required.
            4.1.2.2.3. Applicable workload data.
            4.1.2.2.4. Draft modification pages for the PWS.
            4.1.2.2.5. Any other supporting information.
        4.1.2.3. Once negotiations have been finalized, submit the final modification to the PWS
        (including modification change pages) to HQ AETC/A4PM.
  4.2. HQ AETC Responsibilities:
     4.2.1. HQ AETC/A4PM is the central point of contact for all aircraft maintenance and BOS con-
     tract modification proposals generated by HQ AETC or the Air Staff. (See Attachment 3 for a
     flowchart of the process.) HQ AETC/A4PM will:
        4.2.1.1. Review each requirements package for completeness and conduct an initial evalua-
        tion to determine if a valid requirement exits.
        4.2.1.2. Coordinate the package through the appropriate headquarters functional areas
        (including HQ AETC/A1M and HQ AETC/FM) for evaluation and funding.
        4.2.1.3. Resolve all modification package issues with the appropriate wing or unit PMO or
        functional and HQ AETC functional representative. For HQ AETC-funded modifications,
        functional representatives will also coordinate with their appropriate program element monitor
        (PEM) to ensure funding is available.
        4.2.1.4. Provide PWS modification change pages and forward them to the ACO and staff
        functional OPRs. The ACO will negotiate the governmentâ€™s proposed changes to the PWS
        with the service provider prior to issuing a contract modification.
        4.2.1.5. Notify all affected entities after the final product is published.
     4.2.2. HQ AETC functional representatives, HQ AETC/A1M, and HQ AETC/FM will:
        4.2.2.1. Review all comments.
4                                                                     AETCI64-101 7 DECEMBER 2007


           4.2.2.2. Concur or nonconcur.
           4.2.2.3. Send comments to HQ AETC/A4PM. HQ AETC/A4PM will then:
               4.2.2.3.1. Consolidate all comments, as appropriate.
               4.2.2.3.2. Forward a final determination to the ACO, base PMO and (or) base MO for
               action.
       4.2.3. Once the requirement is validated, coordinated through the HQ AETC staff, and funding is
       available, the wing or unit PMO or functional representative will provide the completed AF IMT
       9.

5. MEO PWS Modifications:
    5.1. Wing or unit functional representatives will coordinate proposed modifications (to add or remove
    workload) to MEO PWSs through the responsible official. The request must include full justification
    (mission impact, impact if not funded, etc.), a man-year estimate (as required) and change page mod-
    ifications to appropriate sections of the PWS. If the unit MO validates that the proposed modification
    is in the best interest of the government and is not in conflict with the criteria identified in AFI 38-203,
    Chapter 15 (expected to change to Chapter 10 during next rewrite of AFI 38-203). that office will for-
    ward the modification request and the justification to HQ AETC/A4PM for action. HQ AETC/A4PM
    will coordinate the proposed modification request throughout the HQ AETC/A1M and the HQ AETC
    staff.
    5.2. If Air Staff or HQ AETC personnel generate a new requirement, they will send it to the wing or
    unit PMO or MO or functional representatives for work estimates, justification, and cost or manpower
    estimates. HQ AETC/A1M will accomplish workload analysis and generate the manpower require-
    ments with coordination through the wing or unit MO.
    5.3. HQ AETC/A4PM will provide necessary information, including modification change pages for
    Air Staff- and HQ AETC-directed requirements to HQ AETC/A1M. For unit-generated modifica-
    tions, HQ AETC/A4PM will coordinate:
       5.3.1. The draft PWS modification through appropriate HQ AETC functional areas and return
       approved modifications to the wing or unit MO and contracting officer or ACO for execution.
       5.3.2. The review and validation of manpower and man-year equivalent requirements with HQ
       AETC/A1M.
    5.4. Once the requirement is reviewed and validated, HQ AETC/A4PM will:
       5.4.1. Generate a cover memorandum.
       5.4.2. Attach the modification pages.
       5.4.3. Forward the completed package to the applicable PMO, functional representative, MO, and
       HQ AETC functional OPRs, as required.
       5.4.4. For approved or validated changes, HQ AETC/A4PM will:
           5.4.4.1. Forward the package to the appropriate PEM who will initiate program objective
           memorandum (POM) action if required, as shown in the flowchart in Attachment 4.
