This instruction establishes procedures to implement the Tinker AFB Senior Airman Below-the-
Zone (BTZ) program and implements AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs. It
applies to all Air Force active duty units and personnel assigned to Tinker AFB. It establishes
the Central Base Board (CBB) for BTZ selection, provides information on quota distribution,
defines responsibilities and provides BTZ procedures for Airmen in student status. Do not apply
to Air force Reserve and Air National Guard units, except where noted otherwise. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847s from the field through publications/forms managers. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been revised and must be completely reviewed. For AFMC units, a face-
to-face board is mandatory regardless of nominee availability. Excused absence (i.e. TDY,
emergency leave, leave outside the local area, and quarters) will warrant the average face-to-face
board score, unexcused absence will result in a score of zero. Added and rearranged

Nomination for Award (AF Form 1206) Sample; and 6. Scoring Guidelines for AF Form 1206.
1. Objective. The BTZ program provides exceptionally qualified Airmen First Class (A1C) a
one-time consideration for promotion to SrA ahead of their peers, effective six months prior to
the normal promotion date. Selection opportunity is 15 percent of all eligible.
     1.1. Timeliness. A1Cs must meet the minimum eligibility requirements in AFI 36-2502,
     Table 2.1, and have 36 months time-in-service (TIS) and 20 months time-in-grade (TIG), or
     28 months TIG, whichever occurs first, and be recommended by the commander (see
     Attachment 2).
     1.2. Other significant dates are as follows:

2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 72d Air Base Wing Commander (72 ABW/CC) is the selection authority for the
     CBB and will prescribe the procedures for large unit boards.
     2.2. Quotas. Quotas are based on 15 percent of the eligible population (based on TIG and
     TIS only). 72 FSS/FSMPD determines quotas and obtains 72 ABW/CC approval (approval
     authority has been delegated to the MPS Commander) before distribution to units. Large
     units with seven or more eligible Airmen receive quotas and promote at the unit          level.
     Small units with six or less eligible are combined into one pool of eligibles to form the CBB
     population.
3. Computation. The BTZ quota is determined by multiplying the number of eligibles by 15
percent. Example: 13 eligible x 0.15 = 1.95 or 2 BTZ quotas. (Note: Fractions of 0.5 or more
are rounded up)

4. Notification. Large and small units are notified of their eligibles as soon as possible but not
later than the second week of the processing month.
5. List of Units and MAJCOMS. Below is a list of units and the MAJCOM those units fall
under (list is not all inclusive and is subject to change).

Table 3. Units and MAJCOMS
             AFMC                              ACC                            AFSPC

           448 SCMW
             5 MRS
            72 ABW

6. Large and Small Unit Selection Procedures.
   6.1. Upon receipt of roster, perform a quality review of eligibles. Follow guidelines outlined
   in the BTZ cover letter to determine nominees (see Attachment32). These actions must be
   accomplished by the established suspense date.
   6.2. Commanders of large units (those with seven or more eligibles) will use guidance
   provided in this instruction to implement their programs. (NOTE: Small units with less than
   seven eligibles cannot combine their eligibles with other units to make a large unit, i.e. a
   group or wing level board.) Once selections are made, commanders will turn in board results
   to 72 FSS/FSMPD no later than the 15th day of the selection month (i.e. Dec, Mar, Jun, Sep).
6.3. When a large unit board convenes, it must consist of at least four voting members in the
grade of MSgt or higher, a nonvoting recorder in the grade of SrA or higher, and a board
president in the grade of CMSgt. If a CMSgt is not available to the unit, another SNCO will be
appointed by the unit’s commander to be the board president.
   6.4. Small unit commanders will use the BTZ eligibility list and an appropriate evaluation
   process (i.e. a unit board, record review, recommendation from supervisors/first sergeants,
   etc.) to determine two nominees for the CBB. All small units with eligibles are authorized
   two nominees. The commander may nominate more than two individuals; however, this will
   be the exception and not the norm.
   6.5. Commanders of small units may nominate their individuals for consideration by the
       CBB with the concurrence of the convening authority. Since unit quotas for large units
       are based on the number of eligibles, small unit commanders must relinquish selection
   authority and all quotas to the CBB. Eligible A1Cs can only be considered once for BTZ
   promotion.
   6.6. For AFMC units. All BTZ nominees are required to physically appear before the CBB
   and large unit selection boards. Commanders, First Sergeants, and Supervisors will take all
   necessary steps to ensure nominees are present to meet the board (i.e., members on leave in
   the local area, shift workers). Deployments or similar circumstances (i.e. TDY, emergency
   leave, projected out of town leave, and quarters) will be considered excused absences.
   Nominees who do not attend but have an excused absence will receive an average face-to-
 4                                                   TINKERAFBI36-201 8 NOVEMBER 2012


     face board score, nominees who do not attend and do not have an excused absence will
     receive zero points.
     6.7. All packages are due to MPS Promotions Office by the determined suspense date
     provided on the quota computation memo.
7. 72 FSS/FSMPD Responsibilities.
     7.1. Determine base quotas by using the unit eligibility roster provided by Personnel
     Systems Management (PSM) which is run prior to the first processing month.
     7.2. Distribute unit rosters (large and small). Establish a suspense date for large units to
         select their promotees. Establish nomination procedures and a suspense date for small
     units.
     7.3. Solicit board members. The CBB will consist of four voting members in the grade of
     MSgt or higher, and the board president, who will be the Wing Command Chief Master
         Sergeant (CCC) or a CMSgt designated by the CCC.
     7.4. Upon receipt of nominations, prepare a selection folder for each board member.
     7.5. Appoint an officer to swear in board members prior to the appointed board date.
     Signatures of all board members will be documented.
     7.6. Upon completion of the board, obtain board president’s signature on score sheet and
     staff results to 72 ABW/CC for approval.
     7.7. Upon 72 ABW/CC approval of the board’s recommendation, update the Personnel Data
     System and release the results to all nominees’ first sergeant or commander.
     7.8. In accordance with AFI 36-2502, the Military Personnel Flight Commander is delegated
     the approval authority for distribution of the BTZ quotas to the CBB and large units (units
     with seven or more eligibles).
8. Board Member Responsibilities.
     8.1. Be familiar with TI 36-201 and ensure strict adherence to this instruction.
     8.2. Review the score sheet (see Attachment 4) and note what each category is worth and
     how the points are allocated.
     8.3. Judge how important each bullet is based on your own intellect, experience, and
     common sense. Do not bring your own knowledge of the person and consider only the
     contents of the AF Form 1206 and face-to-face interview.
     8.4. Assign the proper points and rank accordingly. It is important to take notes during the
     scoring process to be prepared to openly discuss scoring considerations if the board president
     deems it necessary. In addition, all board members must break their own ties.
9. Board President’s Responsibilities.
     9.1. Be familiar with TI 36-201 and ensure strict adherence to this instruction as well as
     oversee board operations.
     9.2. Review the score sheet (see Attachment 5) and be familiar with how to compute the
         final ranking. Ensure all board members have signed the score sheets.
TINKERAFBI36-201 8 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                5


   9.3. Ensure each board member receives complete selection folder for each nominee.
   9.4. Upon board completion, immediately ensure the return of all board member score sheets
   and selection folders to 72 FSS/FSMPD.
10. Scoring Scale/Selection Phase.
   10.1. Selection will be based on a combination of the Face-to-Face Board and selection
   folder scores.
       10.1.1. Face-to-Face Board: 25 percent of the overall weighted value; worth 10 points.
       10.1.2. Selection folder: 75 percent of the overall weighted value; worth 30 points.
   10.2. The total score will be given to the board president when all records have been scored.
   The board president computes the total score of each eligible by adding the ranking numbers
   of all voting members (i.e. someone ranked by the board as #1, #2, #1, #1 will receive a total
   of 5). After computing the total scores they will determine an order-of-merit by ranking the
   lowest score first and the highest score last. In the event of two or more members having the
   same overall score; the board president will break the tie.
11. 72 ABW/CC (Convening Authority).
   11.1. May approve the board’s order-of-merit list or disapprove it entirely, directing a new
   board.
   11.2. May elect not to use the full quota.
   11.3. May disapprove the promotion of an Airman whose record does not, in his or her
   judgment, justify the BTZ promotion.
   11.4. If a selectee becomes ineligible before the promotion effective date, the convening
   authority may promote the first alternate selectee.
12. BTZ Procedures for Airmen in Student Status.
   12.1. Students are not allowed to compete for BTZ with permanent party personnel.
   12.2. If there are enough eligibles to hold a student board, an exception to policy must be
   requested from HQ AFPC. If approved, AFPC will authorize supplemental consideration
   and issue the appropriate number of promotion quotas. The supplemental request must be
   made prior to the student board taking place.
13. Selection Requirements. The following procedures are required to ensure fair, equitable,
and timely BTZ consideration:
   13.1. Units will consider all individuals meeting TIS and TIG requirements, even if they
       are TDY, on leave, or have PCSd during or prior to the processing month (i.e. Jan, Apr,
   Jul, and Oct). All individuals appearing on the eligibility listing must be considered;
   however, it doesn’t necessarily mean they must be nominated. It does mean the commander
   reviews their personnel records, personal information file (PIF) and discusses the
   consideration with the individual’s supervisor and chain of command, etc. before making a
   decision to nominate or not to nominate.
   13.2. Alternates are selected by score obtained during the board, in the event a selectee is
   removed before the effective date of promotion. If the first alternate selectee’s DOR is past
 6                                                 TINKERAFBI36-201 8 NOVEMBER 2012


     due, they will receive the original BTZ DOR and an effective date (for pay purposes) with
     the unit commander’s approval. The MPF will assist in applying for a retroactive promotion
     effective date from HQ AFPC/DPPPWM.
     13.3. If an individual should have been considered during the current board and the error is
     discovered before promotions are announced, large unit commanders will consider the
     Airman and adjust selections accordingly. The CBB will reconvene to consider small unit
     eligibles and ensure selections are adjusted accordingly. If discovered after selections are
     announced, supplemental promotion consideration procedures apply.
     13.4. Commanders may request supplemental BTZ consideration for individuals who should
     have been considered by a previous board and an error was not discovered until after
     promotions were announced.
14. Selection Folder.
     14.1. Selection folders include the BTZ Report on Individual Personnel (RIP), Fitness
     Assessment Scores, AF Form 1206, and score sheet.
     14.2. The AF Form 1206 will be accomplished for all nominees (see Attachment 6).
        14.2.1. The nomination will not be more than 18 lines in length including the following
        headings: Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty, consisting of 9 lines;
        Significant Self-Improvement, consisting of 3 lines; and Base and Community
        Involvement, consisting of 3 lines.
        14.2.2. The maximum score for an AF Form 1206 is 30 points (see Attachment 7). Each
        bullet will receive a max score of 2 points (half point increments) using the following
        guidelines:
            14.2.2.1. Membership-level; ½ point; help, assist, participate, support; short class,
            Squadron awards.
            14.2.2.2. Supervisory-level; 1 point; supervise, lead, take charge, etc; higher-level

            14.2.2.4. Leadership-level; 2 points: broad scope, vast personnel, higher education;
            HQ/AF awards; extraordinary war impact.
15. Face-to-Face Board. The primary purpose of the Face-to-Face board is the professional
development of assigned Airmen and to ensure appearance is commensurate with written
performance.
     15.1. There are three areas evaluated during the Face-to-Face board: Dress and Appearance,
     Military Bearing, and Communication Skills.

TINKERAFBI36-201 8 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          7


          15.2.1.1. All fact-based opinionated questions will be based on the AFPAM 36-2241,
          Professional Development Guide, and current media such as local and base

16. A1C Departing PCS. 72 FSS/FSMPD must verify BTZ eligibility of all A1Cs departing
PCS to ensure a BTZ selection folder is prepared prior to PCS departure if necessary. This
requires the Promotion office to coordinate on the AF Form 907, “Relocation’s Preparation
Checklist”, for all A1Cs departing PCS.
