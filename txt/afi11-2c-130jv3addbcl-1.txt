___________________________________________________________________
This checklist establishes procedures for employing the Modular Airborne Fire
Fighting System (MAFFS) on C-130J aircraft employed by Mobility Air Forces
(MAF) to accomplish their worldwide mission. This checklist complements AFI 11-
2C-130J-V3, Operations Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond
paper, and trimmed to fit the standard plastic aircrew checklist binders. This
checklist is intended to provide MAFFS certified crewmembers quick reference to
procedures required for the safe execution of MAFFS ground and flight operations.
All MAFFS certified C-130J pilots will carry this annex.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate chain of
command.

                                  NOTE
   MAFFS CHECKLIST PROCEDURES: Items on the
   loadmaster’s MAFFS BEFORE TAKEOFF, AFTER
   TAKEOFF, and BEFORE LANDING, and AFTER LANDING
   CHECKLISTS will be accomplished following completion of
   the normal checklist items from T.O. 1C-130J-1CL-2. The
   loadmaster’s CL-2 checklists will not be called complete for
   MAFFS missions until items of the MAFFS checklist are
   accomplished. The loadmaster will verbalize the setting of the
   Compressor Enable Switch and the pressure of the MAFFS
   hydraulic system when calling the CL-2 Before Takeoff
   checklist complete. As always, the checklists and these
   instructions are not substitutes for sound judgment and special
   circumstances may require modifications of these procedures.

      This does not preclude servicing in pits on initial stop, if
      required.

      Most ATBMs publish a local Pilot Orientation Package.
      As a minimum review the following with the appropriate
      tanker base representative:

     PART TWO – NORMAL PROCEDURES

                              CAUTION
       Do not operate the MAFFS compressors if use of
       propeller de-icing is expected. Operation of the MAFFS
       compressors in icing conditions may exceed maximum
       generator loads. If icing conditions are anticipated,
       ensure Compressor Enable switch is in the OFF
       position. The loadmaster will obtain a verbal
       confirmation from the pilot prior to enabling
       compressors.

                  EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN

To stop both compressors and all hydraulic pumps from the MAFFS
loadmaster station:

1. Power Switch – GROUND MODE                                    (LM)
2. EMER STOP (FWD Pallet) – IN                                   (LM)
3. 28 VDC Power Switch (FWD Pallet) – DISABLE                    (LM)


If conditions dictate complete removal of power to the MAFFS unit:


4. Generators 1 and 4 – “OFF”                                    (PM)
5. TR 2 Circuit Breaker – “PULLED”                                (P)
6. TR 4 Circuit Breaker – “PULLED”                               (CP)

When conditions permit:

7. MAFFS Power Cables – “REMOVED”                                (LM)
8. TR 4 Circuit Breaker – “RESET”                                (CP)
9. TR 2 Circuit Breaker – “RESET”                                 (P)
10. Generators 1 and 4 – “ON”                                    (PM)

                              WARNING
       Once the MAFFS unit power cables are disconnected
       from the aircraft, pulling the MAFFS battery circuit
       breaker will remove all power from the MAFFS unit
       including power required for an emergency dump.
       Pulling this circuit breaker is only recommended if you
       have already dropped and the MAFFS DC system is
       suspected of causing smoke or fire.

11. MAFFS Battery Circuit Breaker – “PULLED” (if required) (LM)
12. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN CHECKS – “COMPLETE”
                                       (LM, PM)
