Terms
DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process
(DITSCAP)â€”The DoD standard for certifying and accrediting IT systems that collect, store,
transmit, or process unclassified or classified information. The standard applies to any IT life
cycle, including the development of new IT systems, incorporation of IT systems outside the
infrastructure, development of prototype IT systems, and reconfiguration or upgrade of existing
systems and legacy systems.
License Agreementâ€”A contract between the software publisher and the user which instructs
and limits how the software is to be used. When software is purchased, the purchaser acquires a
license to use it, but the publisher retains full rights to the software and can further distribute and
reproduce it. License agreements generally fall into the following categories:
Enterprise Licenseâ€”The DoD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) and the Enterprise Software
Agreements (ESA) entered into by DoD components who manage the acquisition of
commercially available software at the DoD Enterprise level to reduce the cost of acquiring and
maintaining software products. By aggregating requirements and leveraging DoDâ€™s buying
power together with the buying power of related communities of interest such as the Intelligence
Community, the DoD is able to achieve the most favorable terms and pricing for commercially
available software and software maintenance.

Individual Licenseâ€”A license for use on a single machine only.
Network Licenseâ€”A license that allows every member of the network to access the software.
Site Licenseâ€”A license defined by a geographic restriction, such as a building, unit, wing, or
base.
