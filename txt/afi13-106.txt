Terms
Administrative Control (ADCON) (JP1)—ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority
over subordinate or other organizations with respect to administration and support, including
organization of Service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management,
logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and
other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.
ADCON is synonymous with administration and support responsibilities identified in Title 10,
USC. This is the authority necessary to fulfill Military Department statutory responsibilities for
administration and support. ADCON may be delegated to and exercised by CDRs of Service
forces assigned to a CCDR at any echelon at or below the level of Service component command.
ADCON is subject to the command authority of CCDRs. ADCON may be delegated to and
exercised by CDRs of Service commands assigned within Service authorities. Service CDRs
exercising ADCON will not usurp the authorities assigned by a CCDR having COCOM over
CDRs of assigned Service forces.
Air Mobility Liaison Officer (AMLO)—An air mobility expert supporting specific
Army/Marine Corps ground units. AMLOs assigned to AMC units at Operating Locations (OL)
for command and control support, report to 18 AF at all times. Normally, Army/Marine Corps
Division levels and higher are supported with AMLOs. Infantry BCTs and ACRs not located
with a Division are also authorized permanent OL AMLOs.
 40                                                                    AFI13-106 4 JUNE 2013


Airlift Request Types—(1) Planned Requests; air movement requests that are known or
projected in advance and are normally handled through normal logistic channels. (2) Immediate
Requests; air movement requirements that are identified too late for the normal air tasking order
cycle coordination and are transmitted directly to the Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC). (3)
Emergency Requests; short notice air movement requirements that must be satisfied before the
JMC can issue a formal tasking.
Air Support Operations Center (ASOC)—The principal air control agency of the theater air
control system responsible for the direction and control of air operations directly supporting the
ground combat element. It processes and coordinates requests for immediate air support and
coordinates air missions requiring integration with other supporting arms and ground forces. It
normally collocates with the Army tactical headquarters senior fire support coordination center
within the ground combat element. (JP 1-02)
Aligned Unit—The designated Army or Marine Corps unit with whom a long term AMLO
support relationship has been established IAW inter-Service MOAs for liaison support.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status awarded to an individual who completes IQT and
MQT, local indoctrination, and deployed AOR-required training and is certified by the
commander (Chapter 3).
Continuation Training (CT)—Required to maintain duty position qualification and proficiency.
Coordinating Authority (JP 1)—CDRs or individuals may exercise coordinating authority at
any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Coordinating authority is the authority
delegated to a CDR or individual for coordinating specific functions and activities involving
forces of two or more Military Departments, two or more joint force components, or two or more
forces of the same Service (e.g., joint security coordinator exercises coordinating authority for
joint security area operations among the component CDRs). Coordinating authority may be
granted and modified through a memorandum of agreement to provide unity of command and
unity of effort for operations involving, RC, and AC forces engaged in interagency activities.
The CDR or individual has the authority to require consultation between the agencies involved
but does not have the authority to compel agreement. The common task to be coordinated will be
specified in the establishing directive without disturbing the normal organizational relationships
in other matters. Coordinating authority is a consultation relationship between CDRs, not an
authority by which command may be exercised. It is more applicable to planning and similar
activities than to operations. Coordinating authority is not in any way tied to force assignment.
Assignment of coordinating authority is based on the missions and capabilities of the commands
or organizations involved.
Direct Liaison Authorized (DIRLAUTH) (JP 1)—DIRLAUTH is that authority granted by a
CDR (any level) to a subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or
agency within or outside of the granting command. DIRLAUTH is more applicable to planning
than operations and always carries with it the requirement of keeping the CDR granting
DIRLAUTH informed. DIRLAUTH is a coordination relationship, not an authority through
which command may be exercised.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—A formal training process designed to initially qualify an
individual to perform their duty position requirements without regard to unit’s operational
mission.
AFI13-106 4 JUNE 2013                                                                        41


Liaison (DoD)—The contact or intercommunication maintained between elements of military
forces to ensure mutual understanding and unity of purpose and action.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in a unit’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR status.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)—The status CMR individuals are placed in after
failing to complete academic/proficiency training or currency requirements within the allotted
training cycle.
Operational Control (OPCON) (JP 1)—OPCON is the command authority that may be
exercised by CDRs at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command and may be
delegated within the command. When forces are transferred between combatant commands, the
command relationship the gaining CDR will exercise (and the losing CDR will relinquish) over
these forces must be specified by the SecDef.
Operating Location (OL)—An Army or Marine Corps installation to which an AMLO is
assigned in support of specific Army or Marine Corps ground maneuver unit(s). OLs are
assigned to AMC units as OLs for command. Normally OLs are permanently supported at
Division levels and higher. Separate infantry brigades or regiments are also authorized OL
AMLOs.
Parent Unit—AMC, USAFE or PACAF unit of assignment. AMC AMLO’s parent unit will be
the 621 CRW, 19 AW, or the USAF Mobility Operations School.
Supported Unit—The Army or Marine Corps unit with whom an AMLO support relationship
has been established by the appropriate C-NAF in a directive or order. The term “supported unit”
may also be used to refer to the AMLO’s aligned unit.
