erty collection. The Museum provides professional oversight, guidance and training for material heritage
activities throughout the USAF. The Museum executes the Secretary’s statutory (10 U.S.C. 2572) author-
ity to exchange for USAF historical property and services to better the national collection. The Museum
executes the Secretary’s statutory authority (10 U.S.C. 2572) to loan USAF historical property to civilian

the USAF.
