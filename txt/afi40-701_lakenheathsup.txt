                                           Chapter 1

            PROCESS STRUCTURE AND ADMINISTRATIVE OVERVIEW

1.1. Exceptional Family Member Program-Medical Component (EFMP-M). The mission
of the EFMP-M is to identify medical and educational service requirements of family members
in support of active duty sponsor reassignment and civilian employment overseas. The EFMP-M
proactively identifies those family members who have special needs in order to coordinate
accompanied travel orders and family relocations IAW with DoDI 1315.19, Authorizing Special
Needs Family Members Travel Overseas at Government Expense. DoDI 1315.19 implements
federal laws protecting persons with disabilities. EFMP implements DoD policy by providing
assignment considerations for active duty sponsors where special medical and educational
conditions of family members have been identified. Enrollment in EFMP is mandatory for
active duty members where family member conditions are identified that meet enrollment
criteria, as specified in DoDI 1315.19. Assignment coordination activities for those family
members with medical needs that do not meet the DoD definition of special needs are also
described in this instruction. EFMP families may be entitled to further community support
services, beyond medical/educational capability determinations, which are described separately
in AF policy. Additionally the AF EFMP-M provides for coordination of medical care to
families enrolled in EFMP.
   1.1.1. AFPC operates the EFMP IAW AFI 36-2110, Attachment 25, and with personnel
   regulations pertaining to accompanied permanent change of station (PCS) travel. EFMP-M
   functions include the collection of health information needed by medical authorities to
   recommend assignment considerations in support of EFMP reassignments. EFMP-M
   supports routine PCS actions for EFMP sponsors and for others with needs for specialized
   medical support or special educational services.
   1.1.2. The EFMP-M is a set of interrelated activities linking the medical treatment facility
   with multiple base and community agencies to support sponsors and their family members.
   The EFMP-M relies on the coordination of information and integration of services that
   support sponsors, DoD employees, and family members. EFMP-M functions directly support
   the EFMP through the application of medical information technology and the sharing of
   global resource information to ensure appropriate relocations of family members at
   government expense.
1.2. Process Components. The EFMP-M process is composed of four components: special
needs identification, FMRC process, healthcare coordination and research and evaluation.
   1.2.1. Special Needs Identification. The purpose of identifying sponsors and their family
   members with special needs is to determine the ongoing necessary medical and educational
   services required for family members based on specific conditions, to support access to
   specialized services at the current and projected duty assignment, and to protect federal rights
   and entitlements for mobile family members. Upon identification of special needs, the
   family is enrolled in EFMP and an assignment limitation code Q is placed on the sponsor’s
   personnel record after notification received by the Military Personnel Section (MPS). Early
   identification and documentation of special needs in family members of active duty sponsors
   by the MTF streamlines the assignment process when relocation is initiated. The coordinated
6                                   AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


    identification of special needs assists with the continuity of family member care through the
    sponsor’s PCS and Temporary Duty (TDY). Civilian sponsors, AFRC, and ANG members
    are not enrolled in EFMP but may be provided information by EFMP-M upon request.
    Additionally, AFRC and ANG may utilize healthcare when activated.
       1.2.1.1. DoDI 1315.19 defines “special medical needs” and “special educational needs”
       as the needs of family members who meet DoD criteria for identifying a family member
       with special needs, specified in Enclosure 4 of the DoD Instruction. The AF uses these
       definitions for all accompanied assignment actions, in the Continental United States
       (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). DoDI 1315.19,
       Enclosure 4, establishes the criteria for mandatory EFMP enrollment for active duty
       members. Special needs in this context are typically of an enduring nature, likely to
       require specialized forms of medical/educational assistance regardless of the location of
       the family members. Family members who are identified with conditions that meet DoD
       criteria as special needs are registered in AF-sanctioned databases in order to expedite the
       consideration of service needs during relocation.
       1.2.1.2. In addition, needs for specialized services that do not meet EFMP enrollment
       criteria may be identified in the course of family member relocation processes in order to
       ensure appropriateness of family member travel to locations OCONUS under government
       sponsorship. The nature of these service needs may be shared with gaining treatment
       facilities in order to ensure appropriateness of family member travel OCONUS. These
       needs for services are typically temporary in nature or mild in severity, not meeting
       EFMP enrollment criteria as described in the DoDI. However, they are identified and
       evaluated prior to completion of the OCONUS Family Member Relocation Clearance
       (FMRC) process to ensure family member safety and the availability of needed care in
       overseas locations. OCONUS locations may recommend delay of travel or recommend
       against travel under command sponsorship where service needs exceed the capabilities of
       the military health system, regardless of EFMP enrollment status.
       1.2.1.3. Identification of special needs in family members of Department of Defense
       (DoD) civilians may not be considered in the hiring process. OCONUS, DoD civilians
       are required by DoDI 1315.19 to disclose the existence of family member special needs
       to the hiring agent prior to initiating family member travel OCONUS at government
       expense. Upon hiring and accepting an assignment, DOD civilians will be queried using
       AF Form 4380, Special Needs Screener, to determine whether any member(s) of the
       selectee’s family has one or more special need(s). Applicants for employment shall not
       be queried unless or until an offer of employment has been made. The selectee shall sign
       to certify responses on the form are accurate. These employees will be made aware of
       general information on the availability of medical and educational services at the gaining
       location to include a point of contact for the employee to query about specific special
       needs or access concerns by the hiring authority. The hiring authority will inform
       employees of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) requirements
       under DoDI 1342.12, Provision of Early Intervention and Special Education Services to
       Eligible DoD Dependents, and DoDEA Regulation 1342.13, Eligibility Requirements for
       Education of Elementary and Secondary School-age Dependents in Overseas Areas.
       Additionally they will be informed that if they bring a family member to an overseas
       location that requires medical or dental care, the employee will be responsible for

     obtaining and paying for such care, to include any necessary transportation. Access for
     civilian employees and their families to military medical and dental treatment facilities is
     on a space-available and reimbursable basis only.
     1.2.1.4. Information about family members with service needs, as distinguished from the
     DoD definition of special needs, is not maintained in EFMP-M databases any longer than
     needed to coordinate the requested relocation. The coordination documentation of travel
     recommendations on behalf of these family members may be retained for process
     accountability for time periods specified in para. 3.5.1.2 of this instruction.
     1.2.1.5. Removal from the EFMP is accomplished through retirement of the AD
     member, majority age of the identified child in which they no longer qualify as a
     dependant, divorce or death of the identified spouse, or change in circumstance in which
     the identified special need no longer exists. To initiate disenrollment from EFMP, AD
     sponsor or adult family member will take documentation of the change in status or
     condition to the SNC who will validate and disenroll the sponsor from the EFMP by
     requesting removal of the Q-code from the AD member’s personnel record. This
     documentation may be in the form of court documents, updated medical summary from
     the treating specialist/provider or other validated forms.
  1.2.2. Family Member Relocation Clearances (FMRC). The EFMP-M implements Air
  Force responsibilities under Title 10, United States Code, for medical entitlements of military
  family members, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to support access to
  special education services, the Joint Federal Travel Regulation for family member travel
  allowances and household goods shipment, and DoDI 1315.19. The goals of the EFMP-M
  FMRC process are to prevent active duty assignment failures due to unavailable resources for
  family members, to support DoD civilians through the provision of information about
  services availability OCONUS, and to enhance access to medical and educational resources
  for all family members through the relocation process. These actions support mission
  readiness. Successful relocation reduces stress for sponsors, family members, and units.
  Coordinated relocation prevents the unnecessary loss of allocated fiscal resources and
  supports the equitable use of finite medical resources.
     1.2.2.1. In no way will the EFMP-M FMRC process affect offers of employment to DoD
     civilians. DoD civilians IAW DoDI 1315.19 may voluntarily disclose the details of
     special needs of family members to the hiring agent prior to initiating family member
     travel OCONUS at government expense. Civilians request completion of DD Forms
     2792, Family Member Medical Summary, and DD Forms 2792-1, Family Member
     Educational Summary, from their qualified service providers. These disclosures are used
     to advise civilian sponsors about availability of needed services. Decision-making about
     travel resides with the civilian sponsor.
         1.2.2.1.1. Civilian personnel agents working with selectees planning OCONUS
         travel inquire about the presence of special needs using AF Form 4380. Negative
         responses (no special needs reported) are filed in the civilian personnel office with
         other hiring actions for the employee. The hiring authority forwards any positive
         response (indication of potential needs) to the MTF EFMP-M office for information
         as needed.

       1.2.2.2. All relocation responsibilities for contractors, to include family member
       relocations and access to medical care, reside with the employing contractor and the
       employee.
       1.2.2.3. Active duty personnel who have family members with special needs that meet
       EFMP enrollment criteria will support family participation in the FMRC process prior to
       government-sponsored family travel to either CONUS or OCONUS locations.
       Additionally, all active duty sponsors will support the FMRC process used to screen
       family members for any service needs that may require additional relocation coordination
       prior to OCONUS relocation.
       1.2.2.4. Active duty personnel residing in locations under government sponsored travel
       that are not served by a MTF (such as Embassy) will have a DD Form 2792, DD Form
       2792-1, Family Member Special Education/Early Intervention Summary, or certified
       letter in lieu of forms completed by a qualified medical authority for each family member
       and forwarded to their servicing SNC for determination of medical and educational needs
       prior to issuance of orders for permanent change of station. The services SNC is
       normally determined by the Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code of the sponsor’s
       current assignment. Consult AFMOA/SGHW for processing requirements when not
       located in a MTF catchment area.
       1.2.2.5. All personnel planning accompanied family travel to the first duty station in the
       course of accession to active duty will participate in the FMRC process, using the same
       procedures and forms as other active duty members. Failure of family member’s full
       participation may result in non-approval for travel of family member at government
       expense. Accession programs (ROTC, recall to active duty programs, etc.) will ensure
       accession candidates are briefed on and supported in procedures for clearing family
       members for travel prior to the issuance of accompanied orders.
    1.2.3. Healthcare Coordination: The EFMP-M assists special needs family members with
    navigation of the healthcare services necessary and may involve the following: planning
    treatment strategies; monitoring outcomes and resource use; coordinating visits with
    subspecialists; organizing care to avoid duplication of diagnostic tests and services; sharing
    information among health care professionals, other program personnel, and family;
    facilitating access to services; planning a hospital discharge; and ongoing reassessment and
    refinement of the care plan. The amount of coordination is dependent on the needs of the
    family member(s) and is crucial during PCS.
    1.2.4. Research and Evaluation: The EFMP-M supports system-wide research and
    evaluation of its process components. Research projects are conducted through collaborative
    partnerships with prominent researchers who understand the unique needs of military
    families. Projects are selected based on their potential to inform EFMP-M’s key processes,
    special needs identification and family member relocation. The AF-provided special needs
    data management information system maintains a database for management of the EFMP-M.
    Statistical reports are generated from data collected through AF data management systems to
    assess the impact of the process components and to support continuous process improvement.
    EFMP-M partners with AFPC, with the AF Inspection Agency, and other monitoring entities
    to identify trends in service delivery in order to enhance the coordination of care for military
    families.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      9


1.3. Additional Administrative Elements. To ensure process effectiveness, the following key
features will exist as part of each installation EFMP-M.
   1.3.1. An EFMP-M installation directive for implementation of all EFMP-M processes. The
   installation commander ensures all involved agencies develop, coordinate, and publish an
   installation directive, which may integrate several topics outlining interagency support to
   families. The installation directive will:
      1.3.1.1. Establish procedures for training staff and students on EFMP-M operating
      procedures at bases with student training squadrons, to include the completion of the
      FMRC process by students who are sponsors of family members prior to the subsequent
      duty assignment. These instructions will outline methods for training students on
      requirements for the completion of the FMRC process if new dependents are added to the
      family while en route PCS.
      1.3.1.2. Emphasize and coordinate the cross-functional processes of base agencies that
      identify and assist special needs family members, that specify the coordination of
      assignments for all active duty members requesting accompanied travel, that describe
      processes for the employment of DoD civilians who have dependent family members
      requesting overseas travel at government expense, and which promote access of sponsors
      and family members to community resources. Mechanisms/forums for educating
      sponsors and key leaders will be specified.
      1.3.1.3. Identify the Community Action Information Board (CAIB) and Integrated
      Delivery System (IDS) as groups which can identify the community issues related to the
      quality of life for family members with special needs. Using the expertise of their
      representatives, CAIB and IDS can provide workable solutions to specific issues and may
      be able to influence policy above the local level.
      1.3.1.4. Specify the community-specific supports offered to families with special needs
      and describe base locations to apply for services as needed, including but not limited to
      the Airman and Family Readiness Center and TRICARE Service Center.
   1.3.2. Memoranda of understanding are completed between closely geographically located
   military installations’ medical treatment facilities (Air Force or other Services) to delineate
   procedures for identifying special needs and for conducting EFMP or FMRC processes and
   are reviewed every two years. Examples include methods for conducting the FMRC process:
      1.3.2.1. At remote locations.
      1.3.2.2. Where family members of active duty AF personnel are empanelled to MTFs of
      other branches of Service,
      1.3.2.3. Where AF active duty members are assigned to other Services’ installations,
      including joint basing locations, and
      1.3.2.4. Methods to support other Services’ EFMP relocation functions where their
      family members are served by AF MTFs.
10                              AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


  1.3.3. Memoranda of agreement are completed for managing special needs identification and
  FMRC processes between geographically separated units and their supporting MTFs and
  personnel agents. These agreements are particularly necessary to support locations where
  independent duty medical technicians are the sole medical staff assigned and where
  assignments are processed from a different location than the sponsor’s duty site.

   EFMP-M. Provides direct oversight to appointed EFMP-M staff in the completion of EFMP
   enrollment, FMRC procedures, and care of special need family members. All EFMP-M
26                               AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


  functions will be aligned under the SGH and co-located if possible with Medical
  Management functions.
  2.18.2. Ensures all providers employed by the MTF are trained upon assuming duties and
  annually on the provisions of DoDI 1315.19, including the criteria for enrollment in EFMP
  described in Enclosure 4 of the DoDI. Ensures providers are trained annually regarding
  mandatory referrals to the SNC for any identified special need in a family member of an
  active duty service member (any branch of Service).
  2.18.3. In the FMRC process, reviews information collected by the SNC and MRO during
  the outbound review process. Determines when consideration of identified needs by the
  gaining installation SGH is warranted prior to recommending travel. When indicated,
  ensures all information is forwarded via FDI package. If no conditions are identified after
  thorough review of all data sources, may recommend travel with no FDI needed via signature
  in the designated section of the AF Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and
  Education Clearance for Travel. Serves as final approval authority for CONUS FDIs and
  appeal requests.
     2.18.3.1. Ensures clinical sufficiency and legibility of all documents supporting the
     outbound FMRC process, including FDI packages. Works with providers where
     necessary (both within the MTF and with civilian network providers as needed) to clarify
     information pertaining to severity, duration, prognosis, and services needed for all
     healthcare, education, or environmental considerations on outbound FDIs. Where
     necessary, the SGH ensures appropriate referral of patient or obtains consultation in order
     to document sufficient medical information for medical decision-making regarding safety
     of travel.
     2.18.3.2. Certifies, by signing the AF Form 1466 (whether for initiation of FDI or local
     recommendation for travel) that all available data sources have been reviewed and that
     the appropriate medical staff members have been involved in the relocation clearance
     process.
     2.18.3.3. Ensures the gaining MTF (or appropriate review authority) has the opportunity
     to review via FDI any projected service needs that might exceed limited capabilities.
  2.18.4. Reviews inbound FDIs in conjunction with the medical staff to determine
  sufficiency, availability, and appropriateness of existent services to support the needs
  identified in inbound family members.
     2.18.4.1. In CONUS MTFs, inbound FDIs are only received where the active duty
     sponsor is Q-coded (where family members have previously been identified with special
     needs) or a temporary condition (not requiring EFMP enrollment) is needed to
     determine resources. The SGH will, in conjunction with the SNC:
         2.18.4.1.1. Consult with TRICARE to determine existent services in the local
         network and distances of such services when making determinations for travel
         recommendations.
         2.18.4.1.2. Ensure special educational needs, to include early intervention, are not
         used in isolation from medical needs when making travel recommendations.
         Information about location-specific early intervention and special education services
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     27


          may be obtained to inform the family, but cannot be the only basis for not
          recommending travel into CONUS locations for special needs family members.
          2.18.4.1.3. Consult with dental benefits plans advisors as needed, and with MTF
          senior dental providers where appropriate, to consider local availability of specialized
          dental services which may be specified on the AF Form 1466D, Dental Health
          Summary, for special needs family members.
          2.18.4.1.4. Ensure an available and qualified medical provider’s ability to speak a
          language other than English is not a discriminating factor when recommending
          relocation to a CONUS installation. For special education needs, may confirm the
          presence or absence of English as a Second Language (ESL) services when providing
          travel recommendations. However, clearances into CONUS areas may not be denied
          based solely on educational conditions.
      2.18.4.2. In OCONUS MTFs, inbound FDIs may be received for all family members of
      active duty sponsors who have identified needs for specialized services, to include those
      with no prior qualifying EFMP enrollment conditions. FDIs are forwarded for gaining
      base review for families of active duty members wherever specialized service needs are
      identified by the losing base SGH. FDIs are received OCONUS for DoD civilian
      sponsors requesting government-sponsored travel where special needs are identified and
      where DoD civilians have requested information about the gaining location. The
      gaining/reviewing SGH will:
          2.18.4.2.1. Be aware of the sufficiency, availability, and appropriateness of services
          to meet the needs for which the family is entitled to receive upon arrival.
          2.18.4.2.2. Ensure local procedures are established to specify the extent and methods
          of consideration of TRICARE Network resources in the local host nation when
          making travel recommendations for inbound active duty families.
          2.18.4.2.3. Where the adequacy of services for family members of civilian
          employees in the host nation is unknown or not verifiable, the SGH will ensure
          employees are informed of this prior to travel.
          2.18.4.2.4. In OCONUS areas refer to TRICARE for advisement on enrollment in the
          TRICARE Overseas Program Prime and Global Remote overseas to support military
          families.
   2.18.5. Ensures appropriate safeguards for the protection of sensitive information contained
   in FDIs and in Special Needs (SN) files are IAW Privacy Act and HIPAA requirements.
   2.18.6. Monitors and provides oversight to MTF staff to identify and refer family members
   of active duty sponsors eligible for Extended Care Health Options (ECHO) or other health
   benefits to the TRICARE/Health Benefits Advisor.
2.19. Special Needs Coordinator (SNC).
   2.19.1. Where manning is provided for SNC duties, the SNC is most often a social worker or
   nurse. The SNC may serve in this position in addition to other responsibilities, such as
   utilization management or case management, where workload does not justify a full-time
   SNC. Where no centrally funded manning is provided for SNC duties, the SNC is appointed
   by the MTF/CC as an additional duty. The SNC must be a clinical officer: Biomedical
28                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


  Science Corps, Dental Corps, Nurse Corps, or civilian equivalent. Medical Service Corps
  officers will not serve as SNCs. The SNC should have senior rank and/or had an overseas
  assignment, wherever possible. The SNC must have familiarity with clinical conditions that
  require specialized care, and demonstrated skills in interviewing families for the purposes of
  identifying special needs and for coordinating needed care. The SNC reports to the SGH (or
  the Health Care Integrator, where specified in local instructions) when fulfilling SNC duties.
  2.19.2. The SNC oversees and manages the installation EFMP-M IAW DoD and Air Force
  policy, and any subsequent implementing guidance. The SNC:
     2.19.2.1. Establishes and maintains procedures to identify sponsors whose family
     members have special medical and educational needs in a timely manner. The SNC uses
     a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach with other key service providers, such as
     installation youth and childcare facilities, and officer and enlisted spouses groups, to
     ensure effective outreach and identification of special needs.
         2.19.2.1.1. Ensures all active duty sponsors known to the MTF as having a special
         needs family member according to DoD criteria are identified to the AFPC (via the
         local MPS and/or CSS, where applicable) for issuance of assignment limitation code
         “Q”, regardless of the location of family members or the source of family health care.
         2.19.2.1.2. Ensures all Army, Navy, and Marine Corps active duty sponsors of family
         members with special needs are referred to their Services’ EFMP points-of- contact
         for enrollment and relocation support IAW Service-specific guidance. Consults with
         the MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaisons and/or AFMOA/SGHW as needed to support
         members of other DoD branches.
         2.19.2.1.3. Ensures all active duty sponsors known to the AFPC, and local MPS
         and/or CSS where applicable, as having family members with special needs are
         identified in AF medical special needs data management systems.
         2.19.2.1.4. Coordinates, with AFPC (and the local MPS and/or CSS, where
         applicable) all assignment actions for all “Q-coded” (EFMP-enrolled) AF sponsors
         assigned to the installation, or whose personnel functions are handled at the
         installation, regardless of location of family members.
     2.19.2.2. Provides training to medical staff, and consultation as needed to support the
     implementation of EFMP-M base-wide.
         2.19.2.2.1. The SNC, with the SGH, ensures training and reference material is
         provided to the personnel listed in the following paragraphs within 90 days of
         trainee’s assumption of responsibilities and on an ongoing basis as needed. Ensures
         annual refresher training or procedural reviews, at a minimum to:
             2.19.2.2.1.1. The alternate SNC(s), Medical Review Officer (MRO) and
             alternate(s), FMRCC and alternate(s), and other MTF staff with EFMP-M duties,
             regarding DoD and AF policy and their assigned responsibilities.
             2.19.2.2.1.2. All MTF clinical personnel on the use of DoD criteria (DoDI
             1315.19, Enclosure 4) for identifying family members with special medical and
             educational needs, and EFMP-M referral procedures. This training may be
             delivered as part of existing professional staff orientation, training forums and/or
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 29


            computer based training.
        2.19.2.2.2. The SNC supports base-wide training on EFMP through the
        provision/review of training materials for unit commanders, their representatives, and
        training monitors. The SNC reviews training materials and references used by
        installation-level Civilian Personnel staff involved with screening family members of
        civilian employees for OCONUS travel upon request.
     2.19.2.3. Is integrally involved in the FMRC process. Follows procedures outlined in this
     instruction and refers to subsequent AF implementing guidance as needed. Ensures all
     FMRC requirements are implemented by all EFMP-M staff.                    Works with
     supervisors/raters of other EFMP-M staff as needed to correct noncompliance and to
     ensure appropriate interactions with family members.
        2.19.2.3.1. For outbound FDIs, the SNC participates with the MRO in jointly-
        scheduled interviews with all family members requesting government-authorized
        travel to accompany a sponsor in PCS (face-to-face interviews are required for
        families of active duty and recommended for families of DoD civilians). Exceptions
        may be made IAW para.s 2.19.2.3.1.4 and 3.4.3.4.1 of this instruction. Prior to the
        joint interview, the SNC reviews all medical records and MTF clinical data sources
        and summaries available, and plans the interview(s) with the MRO, ensuring options
        for private discussions with adult family members. Where face-to-face interviews are
        not possible due to extreme distances from any MTF, or due to the family member’s
        inpatient/residential status or other serious medical condition, the SNC notes the
        exception in the FDI package to the gaining review authority.
            2.19.2.3.1.1. Conjoint interviews with families reduce the burden on customers
            by allowing “one-stop” processing of their travel screenings. Where it is not
            feasible to offer conjoint interviews, the SNC ensures modifications to the
            conjoint interview procedure are detailed in local operating instructions that
            address how the needs of families are considered in the FMRC process.
            2.19.2.3.1.2. For families of active duty members, the SNC first ensures all
            family members are listed on either page 1 or page 2 of the AF form 1466 for
            OCONUS travel requests; ensures all family members with special needs are
            listed on either page 1 or page 2 of AF form 1466 for CONUS travel. The SNC
            documents in the designated section on the AF Form 1466 the findings from
            record reviews and interviews with family members to support travel
            recommendations. Ensures any “yes” items specifying needs for housing
            modifications, adaptive equipment, etc., are addressed in the designated sections
            of the DD Form 2792 for the specified family member.
            2.19.2.3.1.3. For DoD civilian families who volunteer for an FDI prior to
            relocation, interviews special needs family members upon request, and forwards
            information via DD Form 2792 and DD Form 2792-1 with any cover summaries
            as appropriate. May use, but does not require, AF Form 1466 for FDIs of DoD
            civilian families with special needs.
            2.19.2.3.1.4. If the family members are geographically separated from the MTF
            supporting the FMRC, they may be seen by a civilian provider or a provider at a
30                            AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


        sister Service MTF. The provider(s) or MTF(s) with the most recent information
        available about family care needs provides the needed information to support the
        review. The family member(s) provide written consent to their medical
        provider(s) to release information to the EFMP-M staff for the purpose of
        coordinating care through relocation. In these cases the SNC and MRO
        collaborate to communicate with the provider interviewing family members to
        ensure understanding of the purpose of such screening, the limitations of service
        availability in many locations, and the documentation needed to support the
        gaining installation in making travel recommendations. When it is necessary to
        involve a civilian provider in completing DD Forms 2792, the MRO and SGH at
        the sponsor’s base retain responsibility for completion of the AF Form 1466 for
        families of active duty members. MTFs of any Service branch that are located
        near geographically separated family members may provide input to the AF Form
        1466 as supporting bases. See para. 3.4.3. A cover memo may be sent in the FDI
        in lieu of AF Form 1466 for families of DoD civilians.
        2.19.2.3.1.5. The SNC, with the SGH, ensures outbound documentation that
        supports the FMRC is processed in an expeditious manner toward timely
        assignment recommendations. The SNC intervenes/elevates through the medical
        chain of command as needed where delays potentially impact timely assignments
        or employments of sponsors.
     2.19.2.3.2. For inbound FDIs (active duty and civilian sponsors), the SNC works
     with the FMRCC and the SGH to ensure all medical and educational authorities that
     might be involved in the care of identified needs are consulted for service availability.
     Supports the SGH in providing written responses that either recommend or do not
     recommend travel for families of active duty members, or that outline potential
     limitations of services for families of civilian sponsors. Where necessary housing
     modifications are identified in the FDI package, ensures the base housing office is
     advised of the anticipated modification(s) during the 14-day relocation review period.
     Includes accessibility information provided by the housing office, where applicable,
     in the response to the losing installation.
     2.19.2.3.3. With the FMRCC, the SNC ensures all FDIs are appropriately logged and
     tracked during the review process. Ensures the inbound FDI process is completed
     within 14 calendar days from submission of a completed package to response from
     the gaining installation. If a response is not possible within this timeframe, ensures
     the losing FRMC Coordinator is notified of the reasons for delay and intervenes as
     needed to expedite response.
     2.19.2.3.4. With the FMRCC, the losing installation’s SNC ensures all considerations
     about potential limitations, types of housing modifications possible, etc., that are
     submitted by the gaining installation via FDI response are provided to the sponsor
     and/or adult family member(s) upon receipt.
     2.19.2.3.5. With the FMRCC, ensures sponsors receiving an initial recommendation
     against OCONUS family member travel are advised of the pinpoint process and of
     further MAJCOM consideration of OCONUS travel options.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  31


        2.19.2.3.5. (LAKENHEATH) If 48 MDG denies travel, the Facility Determination
        Inquiry (FDI) is forwarded to USAFE for possible pinpoint to another base within the
        MAJCOM (see Attachment 2, USAFE Memorandum Template).
            2.19.2.3.5.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) FMRCC coordinates with a specific
            point of contact (POC) to determine whether the family is suitable to travel to the
            LSMTF.
            2.19.2.3.5.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The FMRCC will notify the gaining
            Unit Commander or a representative when the 48 MDG makes a travel denial
            determination on an inbound member.
            2.19.2.3.5.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Inbound FDIs for Defense Attachés at
            any North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) branch/office (i.e. Norway,
            Stavanger only) are handled in the office of the USAFE Command Surgeon (SG)
            once received and identified by the 48 MDG FMRCC.
     2.19.2.4. Complies with requirements for data security, maintenance, collection, and
     reporting IAW AFPD 40-7 and any subsequent AFMOA, MAJCOM, or MTF
     implementing guidance. The SNC:
        2.19.2.4.1. Maintains responsibility for base-level data entry in AF-provided data
        management systems used in the management of EFMP-M. Ensures all family
        members of active duty personnel that have been identified as having special needs
        according to the DoD criteria are entered into the database, with the number of
        special needs family members identified reported upon request to AFMOA/SGHW.
        Tracks FDIs involving active duty personnel and DoD civilians using tracking
        mechanisms specified by the MTF and/or AFMOA, to include AF-sanctioned
        electronic data systems.
        2.19.2.4.2. Provides on-going training, support and oversight for FMRCCs
        performing data collection and information processing to support reassignment
        coordination in AF-provided data management systems.
        2.19.2.4.3. Provides AFMOA/SGHW the MTF/CC-signed appointment letters for the
        SNC, FMRCC, and alternates for access to password-protected data systems. Ensures
        all primary and alternate SNCs and FMRCCs register on the Special Needs site to
        activate their database access upon appointment by the MTF/CC. Consults with
        AFMOA/SGHW as needed for access assistance. Immediately submits requests for
        termination of accounts to AFMOA/SGHW when staff members no longer hold
        appointed EFMP-M roles.
        2.19.2.4.4. Ensures currency of EFMP-M office(s) contact information (e.g., phone
        numbers, fax numbers, email addresses) hosted within the AF-provided web-based
        communications and data management systems. Updates the EFMP-M office’s
        contact information in all AF-sanctioned directories, and ensures currency of access
        to organizational e-mail accounts.
     2.19.2.5. Ensures documentation is maintained IAW para. 3.5 of this instruction and

     2.22.4.2. Use the SNC’s letters sent to MPS/AFPC requesting enrollment of active duty
     AF sponsors as proof of enrollment for ECHO eligibility.
     2.22.4.3. Advise the SNC and/or SGH of local network resources and limitations in
     support of the FMRC process. Review inbound FDIs upon request and make
     recommendations to the SNC/SGH regarding availability of needed medical services not
     normally delivered to family members by the MTF. Assist as needed in identifying
     sources of information regarding dental service availability.
     2.22.4.4. Advise and educate TRICARE network providers on the EFMP-M, on the need
     to refer active duty sponsors’ family members with special medical and educational
     conditions to the SNC, and support the provision of medical documentation upon request
     and with proper consent to support the FMRC.
     2.22.4.5. Advise medical group commanders and other MTF staff as needed on civilian
     government employees’ use of overseas medical treatment facilities.
  2.22.5. MTF healthcare providers will:
     2.22.5.1. Refer active duty sponsors to the SNC for enrollment when, in the course of
     evaluation or treatment, a special need is identified in a family member that meets
 40                               AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


      enrollment criteria as specified in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4. Enrollment of the sponsor
      in EFMP when conditions are identified is mandated by DoD policy. Provide DD Form
      2792 to support enrollment upon request of the SNC.
      2.22.5.2. Support the EFMP-M through the timely completion of all medical summaries,
      DD Forms, and AF Forms related to all EFMP-M processes.
      2.22.5.3. Provide CDC medical advisor and nurse liaison with documentation to
      determine appropriateness of children who have special needs for enrollment in the CDC
      through the SNAP. The medical advisor/nurse liaison will conduct staff training and
      consultation on the provision of medical care provided to special needs children.
   2.22.6. Patient Administration Element/Flight will advise and support EFMP-M staff
   regarding AF and MTF requirements for the proper transmission, maintenance and
   disposition of files and records containing health information on family members.
      2.22.6.1. Where designated EFMP-M responsibilities by the MTF/CC, to include roles in
      the FMRC process, patient administration staff work collaboratively with the SNC and
      under the direction of the SNC. Supervisors of Patient Administration staff support the
      SNC to ensure all assigned EFMP-M responsibilities are conducted in compliance with
      this instruction and any local guidance.
      2.22.7. Medical Management Element/Flight: SNC and FMRCC functions will be
      aligned and co-located, if possible, with Medical Management, under SGH and Health
      Care Integrator (HCI) oversight to ensure standardization of EFMP-M functions at all
      installations.
          2.22.7.1. Health care coordination will be provided to EFMP families with multiple
          and/or severe medical needs to ensure that appropriate services/referrals are provided
          throughout the relocation process and at duty station as deemed appropriate by the
          Exceptional Family Member quarterly case reviews and/or physician treating the
          family member.
2.23. Commanders, First Sergeants, and Supervisors.
   2.23.1. Participate in training on the EFMP-M upon assignment and periodically thereafter,
   as offered. Proactively identify active duty families who may have special needs according
   to DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4, and inform them of the EFMP-M.
   2.23.2. Refer active duty sponsors to the EFMP-M office when medical and/or education
   conditions exist that may warrant enrollment in EFMP. Ensures that all active duty sponsors
   comply with requirements to report to EFMP-M personnel any family members’ special
   medical and educational conditions in order to support EFMP enrollment and assignment
   coordination functions. Intentional violations of the process are considered actionable for
   administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil
   sanctions for violations of related laws.
   2.23.3. Ensure that sponsors whose Family Care Plans (AF Form 357, Family Care
   Certification indicate) plans for special needs family members are identified to the SNC to
   determine eligibility for EFMP enrollment.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  41


   2.23.4. Inform active duty sponsors who plan to marry or otherwise gain new dependents
   while en route PCS of the requirement to complete the FMRC process prior to arriving at the
   new duty station with new dependents.
   2.23.5. Educate active duty members periodically about the requirements of DoDI 1315.19
   that pertain to family member relocation as specified in AF policy, and of installation
   services available to family members with special needs. Commander’s calls, unit training
   events, out-processing activities and other existent forums may be used. Consult as needed
   with the base SNC for resource materials and information.
   2.23.6. Consult with SJA when notified by an MTF/CC, by AFMOA, or by AFPC that a
   service member under their authority has allegedly violated or bypassed the EFMP-M
   process, or has ignored medical recommendations made on behalf of family members in the
   context of the FMRC process or in EFMP service coordination.
   2.23.7. Ensure active duty sponsors are briefed on possible consequences of taking family
   members with special needs to locations where services are not available when informed of
   this intent.
   2.23.8. When there has been or there is an active Family Advocacy Program (FAP) case and
   an effective family advocacy program cannot be established locally, or if the family’s needs
   exceed local capabilities, involuntary curtailment or humanitarian reassignment may be
   requested by the commander if the Airman chooses not to apply for reassignment under
   humanitarian provisions. AFI 36-2110, para 3.8.10.2 and Atch 24 apply.
2.24. Active Duty Members.
   2.24.1. Every active duty AF sponsor will comply with EFMP-M procedures.
      2.24.1.1. All active duty members will notify the installation SNC as soon as one or
      more family members are identified with special medical and/or educational needs. All
      sponsors previously identified as EFMP sponsors who identify additional family
      members with special needs must notify the SNC.
      2.24.1.2. All active duty members will comply with special needs identification and
      documentation processes, and any needed FMRC screening processes for family
      members prior to Permanent Change of Station travel. Active duty members will inform
      the SNC of any changes to a family member’s health status between the start of the
      FMRC process and the initiation of any recommended travel.
      2.24.1.3. Active duty members will provide necessary supporting documentation upon
      request and cooperate with periodic updates when contacted by EFMP-M staff.
      2.24.1.4. It is the active duty member’s responsibility for ensuring FMRC related
      paperwork is completed and returned to the EFMP-M staff in a timely manner.
      2.24.1.5. Active duty members will work cooperatively with the EFMP-M office when it
      is determined that needed services for special needs family members are not available in
      the existing location.
2.25. All DoD Personnel.
   2.25.1. Medical treatment facility personnel, base agencies, commanders, and supervisors
   will refer active duty sponsors whose family members have special educational and medical
42                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


  needs to MTF EFMP-M personnel for access to required services, enrollment determinations,
  and support with family member relocation clearances.
  2.25.2. AF personnel are required to report incidents of family maltreatment or neglect,
  substance abuse, and threats of harm to self and others to the appropriate Offices of Primary
  Responsibility. This may include notifying the unit commander and/or the MTF/CC of
  unsafe situations involving family members with special needs residing against
  recommendations in locations where needed medical services are not available.

                                         Chapter 3

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. Identification of Special Needs in Family Members of Active Duty Sponsors
   3.1.1. Upon Sponsor In-processing: The EFMP-M staff members within the MTFs (SNCs
   and FMRCCs) establish procedures, working with TRICARE and other MTF staff as needed,
   to ensure prompt identification of families with special needs during base in-processing
   procedures. Existing base or medical in-processing forums (such as “Right Start”) may be
   used.
      3.1.1.1. If necessary, the FMRCC contacts the losing base to obtain an existing SN file.
      3.1.1.2. The FMRCC ensures updated contact information is entered into AF Special
      Needs Data Management Systems.
   3.1.2. In the course of routine medical care: All medical staff will refer family members to
   the EFMP-M office when conditions are identified that meet EFMP eligibility criteria as
   specified in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4. Enrollment of the sponsor in EFMP is mandatory
   once eligibility is established, and does not require consent of family members or sponsors.
   Medical providers work collaboratively with the SNC to explain the EFMP to families and to
   elicit their cooperation.
   3.1.3. Upon notification of assignment action: The orders issuing agent (installation MPS
   outbound assignments offices, CSS, or AFPC through central orders processing functions)
   will query sponsors and data systems to determine if special needs exist in family members
   as soon as an assignment is identified (“RIP” generation), regardless of gaining location.
      3.1.3.1. MPS/CSS and/or AFPC will query all active duty sponsors not previously Q-
      coded about the presence of potential special needs in family members, using AF Form
      4380. MPS/CSS and/or AFPC directs sponsors to the DoD definitions of “special needs”
      in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4, as needed when forming their responses. Negative
      responses are documented and assignment processing is continued. Sponsors providing
      responses indicating the presence of special needs or uncertainty are referred to the
      EFMP-M office for guidance; orders will not be issued pending determination of EFMP
      eligibility by the SNC.
      3.1.3.2. All service members who have been previously Q-coded and all service
      members who plan to take family members OCONUS are referred to the EFMP-M office
      to initiate the FMRC process as soon as possible after notification of projected
      assignment.
   3.1.4. When special needs that meet DoD criteria are identified by medical personnel, the
   following forms and documents are used as appropriate to initiate enrollment of AF active
   duty sponsors in EFMP.
      3.1.4.1. AF Form 2523, Family Member Program-Medical (EFMP-M) Information
      Form
      3.1.4.2. DD Form 2005, Privacy Act Statement – Health Care Records
44                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


     3.1.4.3. DD Form 2792 with copies of supporting medical documentation specifying the
     condition(s)
     3.1.4.4. DD Form 2792-1 with copies of supporting educational documentation
     specifying the condition(s)
     3.1.4.5. Special Needs Coordinator’s memorandum to AFPC, local MPS or CSS (as
     appropriate), requesting initiation of Assignment Limitation Code “Q.” All EFMP
     enrollment or disenrollment actions addressed to AFPC, MPS or CSS must be signed by
     the appointed SNC at the base where the sponsor’s personnel functions are managed.
  3.1.5. The AF Form 2523 informs the sponsor of the purpose of enrollment, the ways that
  information collected is used, and the limits to confidentiality. It is read and signed by the
  sponsor (as well as by adult family members where appropriate) and witnessed by the EFMP-
  M staff at the time of enrollment to document the provision of this information.
  3.1.6. All other forms listed above are adopted for use in the EFMP-M and are described in
  their prescribing publications.
3.2. The FMRC Process
  3.2.1. All active duty sponsors who desire to travel OCONUS with family members, any
  who are accepting a remote unaccompanied assignment with an accompanied OCONUS
  follow-on, or are accepting a Consecutive Overseas Tour, must initiate the FMRC process at
  the EFMP-M office as soon as possible in the relocation process. All active duty sponsors
  already enrolled in the EFMP must also initiate the FMRC process at the EFMP-M office for
  all CONUS assignment locations and report if the family member(s) with special needs
  request government-sponsored travel. DoD civilians accepting overseas employment who
  report special needs in family members and who request information about capabilities in the
  gaining location are supported using the same methods as those provided to families of active
  duty members.
  3.2.2. The FMRC process consists first of a review of medical, dental, and educational
  records, and a survey of existing data bases (such as pharmacy records and/or patient
  encounter histories in AHLTA, and TRICARE referrals) in order to elicit information about
  service needs projected at the gaining location. All known conditions or treatments that may
  present increased risk are considered. The SNC, or qualified designee, reviews all electronic
  and hardcopy medical records, mental health summaries, service history documentation from
  Family Advocacy Program, educational documentation, or other information available and
  plans a conjoint interview with the MRO. The FMRC process should be initiated no earlier
  than 6 months prior to PCS with the exception of preliminary relocation requests for
  individuals required to attend any training course over 90 days that is to be performed en
  route and is a requirement for the end assignment.
     3.2.2.1. All family members of active duty sponsors relocating OCONUS must be seen
     and interviewed by the SNC and MRO. Family members of majority age, this varies by
     state, are offered private interviews, and the MTF staff ensures no unauthorized
     disclosures of protected health information are made during the relocation process.
     Where the family member is a minor, the parent/legal guardian is interviewed for
     pertinent health history of the minor child, and the child must be seen by the SNC and
     MRO. The SNC and MRO remain vigilant for documented health services that are
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   45


     protected from disclosure to the parent(s) and ensure private interviews are offered where
     warranted. Where these procedures are not possible, exceptions are noted and forwarded
     to the gaining base for consideration.
     3.2.2.2. All family members of active duty sponsors relocating to the CONUS who have
     identified special needs are seen and interviewed by the SNC and MRO. Family
     members of majority age are offered private interviews. Where the family member is a
     minor, the parent/legal guardian is interviewed for pertinent health history of the minor
     child, and the child must be seen by the SNC and MRO. The SNC and MRO remain
     vigilant for documented health services that are protected from disclosure to the parent(s)
     and ensure private interviews are offered where warranted.
         3.2.2.2.1. The sponsor must report all family members requesting travel via AF Form
         1466, and indicate the presence of any service needs, or recent history of specialized
         care, for further evaluation as a potential special need. The SNC and MRO may
         request an interview with a family member not previously identified as having a
         special need prior to CONUS relocation where further review may be warranted.
         Where these procedures are not possible, exceptions are noted and forwarded to the
         gaining base for consideration.
  3.2.3. Family members of DoD civilians are offered an interview with the SNC and MRO
  where the civilian sponsor has requested assistance in determining availability of services in
  the overseas location. They are not required to participate in any component of the FMRC
  process. DoD civilian sponsors are not required to complete the AF Form 1466, but it may
  be used if the sponsor voluntarily agrees to the use of the form for process coordination. The
  DD Form 2792 and DD Form 2792-1 are required to document special needs of family
  members of DoD civilian sponsors where OCONUS relocation assistance is requested by the
  family.
  3.2.4. Wherever medical records are not readily available to the MTF, the family members
  must provide copies to the EFMP-M FMRCC. Any request for medical information that is
  not provided or released by a family member may result in the inability of the EFMP-M
  office to process the clearance review. For families of DoD civilians, this may limit the
  ability to provide information about services in the gaining location. For families of active
  duty members, refusal to provide or release needed information will limit the ability of the
  EFMP-M office to process an FDI and will therefore preclude authorization for government-
  sponsored travel.
  3.2.5. The SNC at the losing installation ensures accuracy/legibility of all documentation,
  and forwards the complete relocation package to the losing installation’s SGH for review and
  signature.
     3.2.5.1. All packages involving a special needs family member of an active duty member
     (sponsor is “Q-coded”) must be forwarded via FDI to the gaining base after review by the
     SGH at the losing base.
     3.2.5.2. Where there are no special needs that meet enrollment criteria for a family of an
     active duty sponsor, the SGH determines if the package requires review by the gaining
     base. Generally, if there are needs identified that might require services other than those
     deliverable by a primary care manager, the entire FDI package is transmitted to the
46                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


     gaining base for review and travel recommendations. This includes pregnancy during the
     course of the anticipated permanent-change-of-station travel.
  3.2.6. If there are any conditions newly identified in the course of the FMRC process that
  meet EFMP enrollment criteria as specified in DoDI 1315.19, Enclosure 4, the SNC ensures
  enrollment of the sponsor in EFMP is initiated at the losing installation prior to sending the
  FDI to the gaining installation for review. A copy of the Q-code initiation letter is attached
  to the FDI package, indicating the date the request for enrollment was sent and to whom.
  Where the special need is identified in an adult family member, the EFMP-M staff does not
  disclose the nature of the special need to the sponsor without the adult family member’s
  consent.
  3.2.7. Every FDI is tracked electronically through AF authorized data management systems,
  such as “Q-base”, in order to facilitate review at all levels within EFMP-M. This enables
  MAJCOM and AF-level oversight for purposes such as data collection, workload monitoring,
  and assistance where needed.
     3.2.7.1. Information pertaining to FDIs of Q-coded sponsors will be noted separately
     within databases from those of non-Q-coded sponsors (active duty and DoD civilians).
  3.2.8. Written consent from adult family members is not required to release information
  between military medical departments to support the family’s request for government
  sponsored travel. The military health system may use existent databases in order to identify
  individuals with health conditions that require further consideration prior to making
  recommendations for government-sponsored travel, and may recommend against travel
  where insufficient information has been provided to support decision-making.
     3.2.8.1. Family members of majority age are asked to provide consent to release health
     information to support their applications for government sponsored travel wherever
     release outside the military health system is needed to coordinate travel
     recommendations. Examples include travel to OCONUS areas where host nation
     providers must be consulted. However, where this consent is not obtained, information
     about family member health histories that is known to the MTFs may be forwarded to
     Health Affairs agents with a need to know via the FMRC process for the stated purpose
     of assignment coordination.
     3.2.8.2. Where a family member of majority age (consult with SJA as needed, age of
     majority varies depending on types of treatment obtained) has not provided consent to
     release health information to the sponsor, MTF staff may not disclose such information to
     the sponsor or other family member(s). Responses to inquiries from the sponsor/parent
     or from the unit regarding recommendations against travel for family members of
     majority age who have not given consent to release health information are coordinated
     with the SGH and SJA.
  3.2.9. Where no needs are identified in the outbound review process for families of active
  duty sponsors, the losing base SGH may recommend travel. The SGH at the losing base
  returns the signed AF Form 1466 with supporting documentation to the FMRCC. The
  FMRCC then logs the disposition and forwards the necessary information to the orders
  issuing agent indicating “no needs, travel recommended for all family members.” All pages
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                47


  of the AF Form 1466 are forwarded to the orders issuing agent where there is no health
  information requiring protection.
  3.2.10. All documentation of the review process for families of DoD civilian sponsors is
  forwarded to the gaining base (or designated review authority) for review and evaluation of
  service availability.
  3.2.11. When an FDI is indicated, the package is logged by the losing FMRCC and is sent in
  a HIPAA-compliant manner to the gaining location’s FMRCC or other designated review
  authority (e.g., to the gaining OCONUS MAJCOM/SGO where there is no MTF). The
  gaining SGH or designated review authority makes the determination on appropriateness of
  family member travel and lists recommendations individually by family member name on
  appropriate page of the AF Form 1466, ensuring a response is returned to the sending base
  within 14 calendar days of receipt of a completed FDI package. The FMRCC at the
  receiving base also logs all inbound FDIs with disposition/recommendations noted.
     3.2.11.1. For active duty sponsors, the recommendations (“travel recommended” or
     “travel not recommended” for each family member) are returned to the FMRCC for
     documentation. The FMRCC at the gaining installation forwards the determination to the
     FMRCC at the losing installation for action. When coordinating with orders-issuing
     agents, the FMRCC at the losing installation appropriately protects any protected health
     information on the AF Form 1466 and in the FDI package, and forwards only the
     information pertaining to the travel recommendations for each specified family member
     to the orders’ issuing agent. The FMRCC (s) ensure any health information contained on
     any page of the AF Form 1466 is masked or removed prior to release to orders-issuing
     agents.
         3.2.11.1.1. If providing a response of recommendation against family travel to any
         active duty AF sponsor, informs the sponsor of the pinpoint process for OCONUS
         assignments and of the option to apply for EFMP reassignment via the vMPF, if
         applicable as well as the appeal process for CONUS assignments
     3.2.11.2. For senior leader assignments, the gaining review authority notifies the
     appropriate assignment coordinating office of any recommendations against family
     member travel, in addition to notifying the losing FMRCC. These notifications do not
     release the medical or educational reasons, only the status of the recommendations for
     each family member. If a request to an OCONUS location for accompanied family
     member travel is returned with “travel not recommended”, the gaining MAJCOM EFMP-
     M Liaison notifies the agencies below after review of the base level recommendations
     against travel. If a request for accompanied family member travel to a CONUS location
     is returned “not recommended,” the gaining EFMP-M office notifies the following
     agencies:
         3.2.11.2.1. AF/DPG for no-travel recommendations for general officer’s family
         members.
         3.2.11.2.2. AF/DPO for no-travel recommendations for colonel and colonel-selects’
         family members.
         3.2.11.2.3. AF/DPE for no-travel recommendations for chief master sergeant’s
         family members.
48                               AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


         3.2.11.2.4. AF/DPI for limitations in family service capabilities for Senior Executive
         Service’s (SES) family members.
         3.2.11.2.5. AFMOA/SGHW and AFMOA/SGHM or designee if unavailable will
         ensure coordination with these agencies for senior leader clearances into areas not
         reviewed by an AF EFMP-M office or MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison.
     3.2.11.3. For all DoD civilians, information about service availability and limitations
     related to the identified needs are returned to the selectee. They may be transmitted
     through the losing FMRCC upon request. It is the selectee’s responsibility to notify the
     hiring civilian personnel agency any decisions regarding relocation of family members.
     3.2.11.4. Where the gaining base has provided comments in response to an FDI about
     location-unique considerations, about types of housing modifications planned, etc., this
     type of information is shared with the sponsor and/or adult family member(s) by the
     losing EFMP-M office upon receipt.
  3.2.12. For OCONUS assignments: The FMRC process is initiated for ALL active duty
  sponsors who intend to take family members to OCONUS areas, regardless of prior EFMP
  status. Family members who travel overseas without command sponsorship are at risk of
  reduced or non-available medical care, loss of benefits such as base privileges or housing,
  and may incur significant personal expense when further relocation is needed. All sponsors
  who intentionally bypass the clearance process or who falsify information risk disciplinary
  action.
     3.2.12.1. The FDI package for OCONUS assignments, including consecutive overseas
     tours (COTs) and follow-on from unaccompanied tours, consists of one AF Form 1466
     per family (permissible but not required for DoD civilian families), the AF Form 1466D
     for every family member 2 years of age and older, the DD Form 2792 for each family
     member with special needs or needs for specialized medical services, and the DD Form
     2792-1 for ALL children aged 3 – 21 years.
         3.2.12.1.1. Family members of active duty sponsors requesting accompanied
         OCONUS relocation who have a history of, or potential future need for, any medical
         service(s) beyond routine primary care will submit DD Form 2792 as the medical
         summary. This form is used to support review for EFMP enrollment eligibility, as
         well as for assessment of availability of needed care via FDI if it is determined that
         EFMP enrollment criteria are not met.
         3.2.12.1.2. The DD Form 2792-1 is additionally completed for all children birth to 3
         years of age that have been identified with (or are at risk of) developmental delay.
         DD Forms 2792-1 are signed by early intervention and/or special educational
         authorities. Families with home-schooled children must submit a DD Form 2792-1
         for each child over the age of 3 years signed by the parent/guardian.
     3.2.12.2. The AF Form 1466 must be signed by the appointed SGH and final
     review/authorization for travel of families of active duty AF members may not be
     provided by network or sister Service providers. Sister Service providers may assist in
     the collection of information on the AF Form 1466 for review by the AF SGH. All other
     forms must be signed by a qualified medical provider/educational authority and only
     current versions of all AF and DD forms may be used. Medical summaries or cover
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   49


     memos may be used in lieu of AF Form 1466 for special needs family members of DoD
     civilians.
     3.2.12.3. When an active duty AF sponsor assigned OCONUS has a child, or adopts a
     child, in a location outside the theater of assignment, the FMRC process is completed by
     the closest AF installation for the new dependent, prior to accompanied travel to the duty
     location. Where necessary, the closest AF MTF may request documentation from
     civilian providers or sister Service MTF staff to support review of medical needs by the
     gaining base. These circumstances are documented on the AF Form 1466, with the base
     of assignment of the sponsor noted as the gaining location. The SGH at the sponsor’s
     current duty location OCONUS makes travel recommendations based on review of
     documented health status.
        3.2.12.3.1. MTF staff involved in coordinating arrangements for active duty AF
        families to travel in order to deliver the infant(s) safely (e.g., “storknesting”
        programs) must advise families of this procedure prior to departure from the base of
        assignment.
        3.2.12.3.2. MTF staff involved in perinatal care of families of active duty AF, known
        to reside under government sponsorship OCONUS but who have traveled outside the
        country of assignment to deliver or adopt a child or children, must advise families of
        this procedure and assist in the process prior to release from care.
        3.2.12.3.3. MTF staff involved in infant care at OCONUS installations will monitor
        through well-baby checks all infants that are newly presented for care and ensure the
        family is counseled on requirements for command-sponsorship OCONUS. Where
        necessary, the clinical staff delivering infant care will consult with the SNC.
        3.2.12.3.4. If it is determined that the new dependent cannot be adequately cared for
        in the location of the sponsor’s OCONUS assignment, EFMP enrollment and
        reassignment is initiated immediately. Families are cautioned against traveling with
        an infant or young child into OCONUS areas without command sponsorship.
     3.2.12.4. When an FDI to an OCONUS location is returned with one or more family
     members “not recommended” for travel, the base that cannot accommodate the family
     redirects the FDI to the gaining MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison for “pinpoint” assignment
     consideration. This ensures all active duty sponsors are given opportunities to serve tours
     of duty OCONUS IAW Assignments policy. The gaining MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison
     determines alternate location(s), if any, within the command that can accommodate the
     needs of family members.
     3.2.12.5. Where travel is not recommended OCONUS for Senior Leaders’ family
     members, the gaining MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison advises the appropriate branch AF/A1
     Senior Leader Office as listed in para. 3.2.11.2. of this instruction, in addition to other
     required notifications. The appropriate Senior Leader Office will work with all affected
     parties to develop courses of action, which may include continuing forward with the
     assignment in unaccompanied status. Where no AF MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison exists
     for the region of the potential assignment, AFMOA/SGHW and AFMOA/SGHM will
     ensure coordination with AF/A1.
50                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


  3.2.13. For CONUS assignments: The FMRC process is required for active duty sponsors
  who have assignment limitation code “Q”, also known as Q-coded. It may additionally be
  completed where medical conditions are known to the MTF that are determined to be a risk
  for family member travel to the identified location, but that do not meet DoD criteria for
  enrollment. This includes temporary conditions (such as high risk pregnancy), or conditions
  that are mild in the current location but are expected to exacerbate in the environment of the
  proposed location. All family members are listed by the sponsor on the AF Form 1466, who
  indicates the presence or absence of service needs or special needs for each family member
  in the appropriate sections of the form.
     3.2.13.1. The losing base SNC and MRO will evaluate any reported needs to determine
     if they meet the definition as a special need prior to completion of the FMRC process.
     Initiation of Q-code request letter is the responsibility of the sending base where
     eligibility is determined in the relocation process. A copy of the letter requesting
     assignment limitation code “Q,” signed by the SNC, is forwarded with the FDI where the
     condition meeting enrollment criteria is newly identified. Information pertaining to the
     family member(s) whose conditions meet the DoD criteria as special needs are forwarded
     to the gaining MTF via FDI using DD Forms 2792 and 2792-1.
     3.2.13.2. If MPS, CSS, or AFPC identifies the potential for special needs in a family
     member of a non-Q-coded sponsor based on a report by the sponsor or unit command
     representative, AFPC, the MPS, or the CSS will refer the sponsor to EFMP-M first for
     enrollment eligibility determination prior to the issuance of orders. Where possible, this
     referral includes a completed AF Form 4380.
     3.2.13.3. The FDI package for CONUS assignments consists of one AF Form 1466 per
     family, the DD Form 2792, DD Form 2792-1 (for school aged children), and the AF
     Form 1466D, one each for the identified special needs family member(s) only who is 2
     years of age and older. All forms used must be in the most current published version.
     All specified forms are required for each special needs family member to certify the
     presence or absence of specialized care/service needs. All forms must be signed by a
     qualified medical provider/educational authority, and the AF Form 1466 must be signed
     by the appointed SGH at the AF MTF. Sister Service providers may assist in the
     collection of information on the AF Form 1466 for review by the AF SGH. DD Forms
     2792 and AF Forms 1466D may be completed by civilian specialists familiar with the
     care provided as outlined in para. 3.4.4. FDIs for active duty families relocating within
     CONUS do not meet EFMP criteria but who require or request a review to ensure travel
     safety may include medical summaries or treatment histories in lieu of DD Forms 2792
     where enrollment criteria are not met.
     3.2.13.4. . Specialized child care services for children 0 to 12 years who have special
     needs may not be available on the installation in child development centers, school age
     centers or family child care homes in certain locations. EFMP-M may make inquiries
     into levels of service available on the installation before an assignment is made, at the
     request of the family. Where limitations are reported, the information is provided to the
     family by the SNC to support the family’s pursuit of other alternatives in the local
     community. Availability of child care may not be the sole basis for recommending
     against government sponsored PCS of family members.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      51


     3.2.13.5. Where travel is not recommended for family members to CONUS locations due
     to the non-availability of needed medical services, the losing FMRCC, in coordination
     with the SNC, notifies the orders-issuing agent that travel was not recommended. The
     sponsor must apply to AFPC for EFMP reassignment via the virtual MPS. AFPC will
     work to identify an alternate assignment location and conduct the FMRC process with the
     potential alternate locations.
     3.2.13.6. Where travel is not recommended to a CONUS location for senior leader
     family members, the gaining FMRCC advises the appropriate AF/A1 Senior Leader
     Office as listed in para. 3.2.11.2. of this instruction, in addition to other required
     notifications. The reasons for the no-travel recommendation are not released to the
     Senior Leader Office, only the status of the recommendations. The appropriate Senior
     Leader Office will work with all affected parties to determine courses of action, which
     may include continuing forward with the assignment in unaccompanied status.
  3.2.14. Where special needs are known via Q-code, or prior to any OCONUS relocation, an
  FMRC review must be initiated within 6-months of government sponsored family member
  travel with the exception of training courses over 90 days that are performed en route and
  required by gaining assignment. These reviews must be initiated in accordance with the
  training requirements/reporting. This is to ensure the most recent medical and educational
  information is available to the review authorities. The sponsor must notify the SNC at the
  base of current assignment of any changes in family member conditions or in needed services
  that are identified after the initiation of the clearance process and before initiation of family
  travel.
  3.2.15. The EFMP-M office at the current base of assignment of the sponsor retains
  responsibility for the coordination of the FDI at each stage of the process and requests
  support from the MTF closest to the family in conducting interviews, records reviews, etc. If
  there is no MTF within a reasonable travel distance, documentation from the civilian
  providers is requested by the sponsor’s EFMP-M office. After review for clinical sufficiency
  by the SGH at the sponsor’s base of current assignment, the documentation is submitted to
  the gaining location for consideration. Refer to section 3.4.3. of this instruction for
  additional guidance where sponsors and family members are geographically separated at the
  time of initiation of the FMRC process.
     3.2.15.1. In limited circumstances it may be necessary for AFMOA/SGHW to designate
     non-medical points-of-contact (POCs) to coordinate FDIs into OCONUS locations not
     served by a gaining MTF. When this is necessary, AFMOA/SGHW, and any MTF that
     releases specific protected information, will instruct those POCs in the proper storage,
     transmission, and protection of family member information from unauthorized disclosure
     or release. The losing EFMP-M office ensures the authorization to release medical
     information is noted to specify the designated non-medical POC and the specific purpose
     of the release. Consents obtained to release this information are retained as required
     under MTF HIPAA guidance. AFMOA/SGHW will specify routing procedures to ensure
     qualified AF medical authorities make final travel recommendations for government
     sponsored travel.
  3.2.16. The following procedures apply when any active duty AF sponsor is scheduled for an
  OCONUS unaccompanied assignment of 15 months or less.
52                               AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


     3.2.16.1. Sponsor may choose a designated location move, and relocate family members
     to any location within the CONUS while serving overseas in unaccompanied status.
     Relocation of family members to a follow-on location may only be authorized if the
     follow-on assignment is approved; see para. 3.2.16.3. Where special needs have been
     identified prior to a designated location move within the CONUS, an FDI is forwarded to
     the closest AF EFMP-M office for recommendations since the family will relocate at
     government expense. The reviewing AF SGH will ensure the family is advised regarding
     the extent of MTF services available at their chosen location and which services will be
     provided by TRICARE network providers.
     3.2.16.2. Sponsor may choose a home-basing option and, if approved, will be reassigned
     back to the same CONUS location of prior assignment after completion of the short
     overseas tour. No FMRC process is needed since the family will not be traveling at
     government expense.
     3.2.16.3. Sponsor may request and receive a follow-on assignment to either a CONUS or
     OCONUS location. This assignment is provided prior to the member’s departure for the
     short overseas tour.
         3.2.16.3.1. All sponsors requesting family travel to an OCONUS follow-on location
         initiate the FMRC process prior to sponsor’s departure to the unaccompanied tour.
         All EFMP-enrolled sponsors (“Q-coded”) selected for an unaccompanied assignment
         with an accompanied follow-on to either a CONUS or an OCONUS location initiate
         the FMRC process and an FDI is generated to the follow-on base prior to the issuance
         of orders to the unaccompanied assignment. If travel is not recommended for one or
         more family members in either situation, the sponsor may apply for reassignment
         consideration prior to departure for the short overseas tour.
            3.2.16.3.1.1. If travel to the follow-on is recommended for all family members,
            the family may initiate travel to the follow-on at government expense prior to the
            sponsor’s departure for the short overseas tour. When the sponsor returns to the
            follow-on from the unaccompanied location, there is no FMRC process needed
            (even if sponsor is Q-coded) as the family will not be traveling at that time. The
            sponsor receives orders for unaccompanied travel to the follow-on location.
            3.2.16.3.1.2. If the family does not proceed to the follow-on location at that time
            but remains in place, a second FDI is initiated within 6 months prior to the
            relocation of family members to the follow-on location. The FDI is processed
            according to the guidance on geographically separated families in paragraph
            3.4.3. of this instruction. All family members authorized travel in the second FDI
            will be listed on the sponsor’s orders to the follow-on location to support travel at
            government expense.
     3.2.16.4. A sponsor may relocate the family to any location at personal expense. Where
     special needs are known, an FDI to the proposed location is advised to support decision
     making and to determine accessibility to needed services. Sponsors remain responsible
     for promoting the well-being of family members regardless of location.
  3.2.17. Once a completed FDI package is received (in both CONUS and OCONUS
  locations), the gaining installation MTF has 14 calendar days to review all specified needs
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     53


   and provide a response to the losing installation FMRCC. If the gaining installation is unable
   to provide a response to the losing base within that time frame, a message must be sent to the
   losing FMRCC indicating the status and reason(s) for delay. If additional information is
   subsequently requested by the gaining base, the 14-day timeline is initiated upon receipt of
   all the information needed to review the FDI package.
   3.2.18. When there are no special needs identified in the clearance process, the FMRCC at
   the losing installation will forward to the orders issuing agent all pages of the AF Form 1466.
   Page 4 will be blank since an FDI is not sent to a gaining installation. When special needs or
   needs for care have been identified in the clearance process, FRMC Coordinators at the
   losing installation will send pages 1, 4, and 5 of the AF Form 1466 to the orders issuing
   agent, once the completed package is returned from the gaining installation. Page 4 will list
   by name all family members cleared for government-sponsored travel and all not
   recommended for travel. Page 4 must be signed by the gaining location MTF's SGH or
   designated review authority. Where needs are identified, pages 2 and 3 will not be provided
   to orders issuing agents as they may contain sensitive medical information that must be
   protected. The FMRCC ensures no health information is marked on any page sent to an
   orders issuing agent.
   3.2.19. The losing FMRCC or SNC advises active duty sponsors of medical
   recommendations generated through the FMRC/FDI process, emphasizing that orders issuing
   agents retain final authority to authorize accompanied family travel.
3.3. Research and Evaluation
   3.3.1. Research that supports professional knowledge about families with special needs, and
   that is designed to enhance the quality of life for families with special needs, may be
   supported by AFMOA and by EFMP-M staff. All research proposals must meet current
   academic standards for research methods, must be approved by an Air Force Institutional
   Review Board, and must be authorized by AFMOA. All publications that report results of
   such research must be approved by AF Public Affairs prior to release.
   3.3.2. Program and Process Evaluation. AF EFMP-M is committed to the delivery of
   effective and efficient services which support assignments, appropriate family member
   travel, and quality of life for military families.
      3.3.2.1. The AF EFMP-M participates in all MTF, MAJCOM, and AF-level initiatives
      designed to monitor and enhance services to beneficiaries.
      3.3.2.2. IAW DoDI 1315.19, the AF will report annually to OSD (P & R) on the
      numbers of special needs family members of active duty sponsors and on the
      effectiveness of any processes implemented for the authorization of government-
      sponsored travel. AFPD 40-7 specifies key benchmarks for evaluating EFMP-M
      effectiveness for this purpose.
          3.3.2.2.1. EFMP-M staff members will use the AF-provided data management
          systems to collect and manage data used to generate process evaluation reports.
      3.3.2.3. AFMOA and MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison may use aggregated data to enhance
      delivery of services and program evaluation.

3.4. Special Considerations
   3.4.1. EFMP Reassignments and Deferments: EFMP reassignments/deferments are made at
   the sponsor’s request only, and are submitted through the vMPF online. EFMP
   reassignments cannot be mandated by the commander or requested by the family member.
   Typically they are warranted where there is a lack of needed medical care for a family
   member with special needs, or where special education services required on an IEP or IFSP
   do not exist in the current location. AFPC provides information to the sponsor on what he or
   she needs to submit in the application package once initiated thru vMPF. AFPC/DPAPH
   determines the appropriateness of the request and makes the final decision on all assignment
   actions, excepting those for Senior Leaders, which are forwarded by AFPC/DPAPH to the
   appropriate branch of AF/DP for review.
      3.4.1.1. For EFMP Reassignment Requests, EFMP-M staff at the base of sponsor
      assignment may release to DPAPH any medical or educational documentation needed to
      process the request. EFMP-M staff must attempt to contact family members of majority
      age to notify them of the release of this information, and the purpose for the release.
      EFMP-M staff documents these attempts in the SN file. However, inability to contact the
      family members directly does not prevent release of information to AFPC/DPAPH to
      expedite timely reassignment considerations.
      3.4.1.2. If the EFMP reassignment request warrants approval by AFPC/DPAPH, the
      medical and educational documentation is forwarded to the SNCs at several potential
      assignment locations simultaneously to expedite review. FDI packages sent to potential
      locations from AFPC/DPAPH will include all the medical and educational documentation
      provided with the request. In most cases, this will include the DD Form 2792, DD Form
      2792-1 and IEP when applicable. It will not, as a rule, include an AF Form 1466.
      Gaining bases provide response directly to AFPC/DPAPH via locally designed
      memorandum or other means acceptable to AFPC/DPAPH. Gaining bases will prioritize
      responses on FDIs generated as a result of EFMP Reassignment Requests and provide
      recommendations within 5 business days, or notify AFPC/DPAPH of necessary response
      delays within 5 business days.
      3.4.1.3. In OCONUS areas, where the SNC and SGH concur that remaining in the local
      area poses a significant risk to the health and/or wellbeing of family members due to the
      lack of needed medical services or the limitation of resources, they may recommend to
      the MTF/CC the coordination of Early Return of Dependents (ERD) pending
      reassignment consideration.
      3.4.1.4. Where maintaining family members OCONUS in the absence of needed medical
      care, and where there is evidence of spousal or child abuse or neglect and an effective
      family advocacy program cannot be established locally, or if the family’s needs exceed
      local capabilities, involuntary curtailment or humanitarian reassignment may be
      requested by the commander if the Airman chooses not to apply for reassignment under
      humanitarian provisions. AFI 36-2110, para 3.8.10.2 and Atch 24 apply.
      3.4.1.5. The SNC will assist the sponsor in compiling appropriate medical/educational
      documentation for the EFMP Reassignment Package upon request.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     55


     3.4.1.6. The SNC at the sponsor’s current base of assignment will, in collaboration with
     the MRO and SGH, assess the availability of medical/educational services and will
     provide a letter regarding availability of services. The letter will contain the specifics of
     what services can or cannot be obtained at the sponsor’s current location. The SNC does
     not make reassignment recommendations in the letter.
     3.4.1.7. Requests for deferment of assignment or deployment can only be made through
     AFPC and the sponsor’s unit once the sponsor has been notified officially of a pending
     assignment or deployment. SNCs may support sponsors with similar documentation
     upon request, and must focus on the identified needs of family members and what benefit
     is expected by the authorization of a deferment, or what harm to the family member is
     anticipated by the timing of subject assignment or deployment. SNCs do not make
     deferment recommendations but rather provide supporting documentation as described.
  3.4.2. Requests to Reconsider Family Member Travel Denials (“Appeals”)
     3.4.2.1. Within 21 calendar days of family receipt of a recommendation against family
     member travel (“denial”), the family may submit additional new information for
     consideration through the losing base SNC. The intention of this provision is to allow the
     submission of significant information that the family believes was not available at the
     time of the initial review and determination, consideration of which might substantially
     change the risk assessment for the identified family member. The additional information
     provided is forwarded directly via Q-base from losing base SNC to gaining base SNC,
     with no additional review by the losing installation needed. The losing FMRCC notifies
     the orders issuing agent that a review is pending, and notes the appeal on the FDI log.
        3.4.2.1.1. OCONUS, the gaining SNC who receives information submitted for an
        “appeal” of the FDI recommendation notifies the gaining OCONUS MAJCOM
        EFMP-M Liaison of the appeal and coordinates the review of information for either a
        base-level recommendation or a pinpoint review, as needed.
     3.4.2.2. The gaining SGH (or OCONUS MAJCOM SG, as needed) is the final authority
     on what constitutes new information. The gaining SGH or OCONUS MAJCOM SG may
     determine that subsequent information received does not constitute new or compelling
     information that would change the initial recommendation against travel, and the gaining
     EFMP-M office will notify the losing SNC and/or FMRCC within 7 calendar days that
     the recommendation against travel stands. Where there is no MAJCOM SG,
     AFMOA/SGHM serves as the final authority for FDI appeals.
     3.4.2.3. Upon receipt of new information that is determined significant, the gaining SNC
     (or MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison) will send within 7 calendar days a reply to the losing
     SNC a message that the new information submitted is under evaluation. A response is
     provided to the losing installation within 14 days of receipt of the newly submitted
     information. If the initial decision is amended and family member travel that was
     previously denied is subsequently recommended on the basis of new information, the
     gaining SGH and SNC (or MAJCOM EFMP-M Liaison) will provide a statement
     recommending travel to the losing EFMP-M office, and may do so using the AF Form
     1466 (or other official messaging system) noting the change and date. The losing SNC
     and/or FMRCC will contact the orders-issuing agent to advise of the completion of the
56                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


     review process, will submit any needed notification of the results of the appeal review
     process, and will inform the family of the final determination, regardless of outcome.
     3.4.2.4. Expeditious assignment processing is paramount and requests to consider further
     information after two denials (the initial recommendation and the appeal) will not be
     considered, unless authorized by the gaining MAJCOM/SGO and the orders-issuing
     agent.
  3.4.3. Geographically Separated Sponsors and Families
     3.4.3.1. When family members are geographically separated from their sponsors
     (unaccompanied tours), the EFMP-M office at the base of assignment of the sponsor (or
     base where sponsor’s AF Personnel functions reside, for sponsors not assigned to AF
     installations) is responsible for coordinating all EFMP-M functions.
     3.4.3.2. When it is necessary to accomplish EFMP-M clinical functions involving the
     family members (such as interviewing family members and/or reviewing current medical
     records for identification or family member relocation), the base where the sponsor is
     assigned may request assistance of the base nearest to the family (supporting base). The
     sponsor’s base SNC or FMRCC initiates the request to the supporting base, specifying
     what is needed. Where the supporting base has never provided medical care and has no
     information to support the clearance, they may serve as a conduit of information between
     the sponsor’s base EFMP-M office and any civilian providers delivering care. The
     supporting base may conduct face-to-face interviews on behalf of the sponsor’s base if
     located within a reasonable travel distance to allow family participation.
     3.4.3.3. It is the AD sponsor’s responsibility to ensure FMRC related paperwork is
     completed and returned to the EFMP-M staff, to include appropriately signed release of
     information documents as needed, when AD personnel are geographically separated from
     their family member(s).
     3.4.3.4. The supporting base completes needed processes as possible given the
     availability of records, access to family members for interview, etc., and documents for
     the sponsor’s base what was accomplished and what sources of information were
     available. Where civilian network providers have delivered all recent medical care, or
     where family members are located at great distance from any MTF, the sponsor’s base
     may work directly with the civilian providers to obtain completed forms and information
     to process the clearance, documenting the limitations on the available information. The
     supporting base may coordinate these requests with any civilian providers as needed at
     the request of the sponsor’s base (obtaining appropriate consents to release health
     information as appropriate), ensuring all information flows through the sponsor’s base as
     the process owner.
         3.4.3.4.1. Face-to-face interviews at a DoD MTF must be conducted except where
         extreme geographic distances, inpatient status, or other compelling health
         contraindications prohibit family travel to participate in the interview. In these rare
         circumstances, a sponsor’s base or a supporting base may involve civilian providers
         to query family members on health conditions, providing specific instructions
         regarding the types of information needed. The SGH at the sponsor’s base retains
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    57


         final discretion on the use of civilian providers in lieu of travel to an MTF for travel
         screening purposes.
     3.4.3.5. The supporting base does not generate enrollment (“Q-code initiation letters”),
     but rather sends documentation to the sponsor’s base to do so as needed.
     3.4.3.6. Where a supporting base is involved in screening family members, the
     supporting base SGH signs on all AF Form 1466s but documents “Clearance performed
     to support (name of sponsor’s base)”. The entire clearance package is then forwarded to
     the sponsor’s base for action as the losing base. The sponsor’s base SNC and SGH
     review all recommendations and the sponsor’s base FMRCC logs/processes the package
     in the same manner as all other outbound clearances. The SGH at the sponsor’s base of
     assignment (losing base) determines when an FDI is warranted, regardless of whether a
     civilian network provider or supporting MTF provided information.
     3.4.3.7. Any questions or concerns by the sponsor’s base about the review performed by
     the supporting base are addressed between sponsor base SNC and supporting base SNC,
     or between sponsor base SGH and supporting base SGH. The sponsor’s base is
     considering the losing base when coordinating an FDI to the gaining base. The gaining
     base EFMP-M staff may contact the supporting base with any questions but should only
     do so in coordination with the sponsor’s base.
  3.4.4. Medical care delivered by a Sister Service or civilian health care provider: When
  family members of active duty sponsors are empanelled to the MTF of a Sister Service, or
  when family members receive their primary and/or specialty care outside of the MTF, the AF
  SNC at the base of assignment of the AF sponsor (or where the AF personnel functions for
  the service member are located) remains the primary POC for EFMP-M functions, both
  identification and family relocation.
  3.4.4. (LAKENHEATH) Once the FDI is received and determined to be a member who is
  not Air Force, the FMRCC will coordinate with the gaining installation for travel
  recommendation.
     3.4.4.1. The SNC, or designee, will advise AF sponsors and families that neither civilian
     providers nor providers in Sister Service MTFs may provide authorization for AF family
     member travel. Non-AF care providers and all school authorities contribute supporting
     information for AF decision-making through the SNC at the losing installation. Only AF
     SGHs may make official travel recommendations for families of active duty AF service
     members under government sponsorship.
     3.4.4.1. (LAKENHEATH) For Army, coordination will occur with a POC at the
     gaining installation and the European Regional Medical Command (ERMC) to get their
     travel recommendation, then forward to 48 MDG Chief of Medical Staff (SGH) for the
     final travel recommendation.
     3.4.4.2. When the SNC/SGH at the losing installation need information from outside
     sources to conduct the FMRC process (such as health summaries, medication histories,
     dental summaries, etc), the EFMP-M office will provide the sponsor, and family
     members of majority age if geographically separated, with written instructions to share
     with service providers that specify what is needed and how to submit the information
     (e.g., proper completion of AF Form 1466D, DD Form 2792, and any other forms or
 58                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


      documentation as needed.). EFMP-M staff will ensure families are instructed in how to
      provide their civilian providers the appropriate consent to release this information to the
      military health system for FMRC purposes.
      3.4.4.2. (LAKENHEATH) For Navy, FMRCC will coordinate with corpsmen from the
      gaining installation to get their travel recommendation, then forward to 48 MDG/SGH for
      the final travel recommendation.
      3.4.4.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Outbound FDIs from LSMTFs and Defense
      Attachés:
          3.4.4.3.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) FMRCC is notified by a POC at the LSMTF,
          or the AD member.
          3.4.4.3.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) FMRCC will coordinate with the member and
          POC to get all paperwork accomplished to include a face-to-face interview or
          telephone interview.
          3.4.4.3.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Once complete, the member or POC will e-
          mail or hand carry all forms to the FMRCC and the FMRCC will route to the 48
          MDG Special Needs Coordinator (SNC) and 48 MDG/SGH for travel
          recommendations.
      3.4.4.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Outbound FDIs from LSMTFs and/or Defense
      Attachés going to another Defense Attaché and/or LSMTF.
          3.4.4.4.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The FMRCC will coordinate with the
          individual to get the paperwork completed at the nearest Military Treatment Facility.
          3.4.4.4.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Once the paperwork is done and is returned to
          the FMRCC, the FMRCC will get a travel recommendation from the 48 MDG SNC
          and 48 MDG/SGH.
          3.4.4.4.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) If an FDI is required, the FMRCC will
          reference the “Area of Responsibility” letter and send to the designated base for a
          travel recommendation (see Attachment 3, Sample Memorandum for SNCS and
          FMRC Coordinators).
3.5. Maintenance of Documentation:
   3.5.1. Administrative notes of processes and forms used to review medical or educational
   information for the purpose of determining EFMP enrollment eligibility, or for the purpose of
   coordinating family member travel where there are no special needs identified (FMRC and
   FDI packages for non-Q-coded sponsors), are not considered medical care records. Files
   may be created electronically and/or in hardcopy to store copies of forms and documents
   used in the decision making process to ensure process accountability.
      3.5.1.1. Logs of all relocation clearances performed will be maintained in each EFMP-M
      office and OCONUS MAJCOMs (for pinpoint assignment considerations) and will
      document disposition/status of all clearances. They are maintained in accordance with
      the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, and
      other MTF requirements in the EFMP-M office for 2 years past the conclusion of the
      process, to support any needed investigation by MAJCOM, AFPC or AFMOA.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   59


     Documents that have been requested to support a review may not be shredded until
     released by AFPC/DPAPH and AFMOA. Logs of disclosures outside the military health
     system for the purpose of determining suitability for government sponsored travel are
     maintained for the duration specified under MTF HIPAA guidance. Otherwise, these
     logs are shredded 2 years after completion of the last clearance on the page, IAW
     AFRIMS Table 41 – 12, Rule 22.00.
     3.5.1.2. Documentation pertaining to the relocation process for non-Q-coded sponsors,
     including any FDIs generated, forms completed, and correspondence, are filed by name
     of sponsor, with date of review completion. This FMRC/FDI documentation is
     maintained at both the losing and gaining installations (following HIPAA, Privacy Act,
     and MTF requirements) for 2 years after completion of the review process to support any
     investigation by MAJCOM, AFPC or AFMOA. Those documents that have been
     requested to support a review may not be shredded until released by AFPC/DPAPH and
     AFMOA. Signed consents used to release information to entities outside of the military
     health system for the purpose of determining suitability for government sponsored travel
     are maintained in the manner and for the duration specified in MTF HIPAA guidance. If
     not requested to support a review and if not involving release of information outside of
     the military health system, they may be shredded 2 years after completion of the review
     process IAW AFRIMS.
     3.5.1.3. Documentation pertaining to the relocation process for civilian employees who
     have requested assistance will be shredded after completion of relocation assistance
     provided by the gaining and losing MTF. This includes the AF Form 4380 if utilized.
  3.5.2. Where special needs are identified in an active duty family member, and upon
  initiation of assignment limitation code-Q, a Special Needs (SN) file is established and is
  maintained separately from medical records.
     3.5.2.1. The SN file is a compilation of documents and summaries of information that
     exist in original form in medical records and in educational records, and is considered a
     secondary medical record.
     3.5.2.2. SN files are maintained in accordance with HIPAA and other MTF requirements
     in order to protect the sensitive information contained therein. Access is limited to MTF
     staff with a need to know in order to support assignment recommendations.
     3.5.2.3. SN files are transferred to the gaining EFMP-M office with each PCS and are
     maintained so long as the sponsor remains active duty, the condition(s) exist in the family
     member(s) which met eligibility criteria, and so long as the family member(s) identified
     with special needs remain(s) in official dependent status. If any one of these conditions
     changes, the SN record is maintained locally for 2 years at the last base where EFMP
     enrollment was in effect, and then shredded IAW AFRIMS.
         3.5.2.3.1. A copy of the SN file may be kept at the location closest to the family
         member(s) when geographically separated from the sponsor, or at the losing base
         pending confirmation of receipt of the original SN file when transferred for PCS.
         3.5.2.3.2. When an EFMP sponsor arrives at a new duty station, the gaining FMRCC
         reviews the SN file for completeness and may contact the family to update contact
         information, etc. The FMRCC, with the SNC, may contact the family to provide any
 60                                AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014


           missing information. However, it is not necessary to require periodic completion of
           forms while the family remains on station, unless there is a significant change in
           diagnosis, family composition or other information that could impact Q-code status.
           Six months prior to PCS, or upon notification of projected PCS, the DD 2792, DD
           2792-1 and other information needed to support the PCS will be re-completed unless
           needed earlier to support participation in training requirements for the projected
           assignment.
   3.5.3. The SN file contains:
       3.5.3.1. The EFMP-M demographic information page, original informed consent
       documents, eligibility for services, and other materials obtained during the enrollment
       process. These materials are maintained during the sponsor’s entire AF career, and may
       be updated. All consents, whether original or updates, are maintained the entire life of
       the SN record.
       3.5.3.2. The names of all family members with special needs and the qualifying
       enrollment conditions identified for each, with supporting documentation obtained from
       the family or service providers. These pages are updated as needed, with previous
       documentation related to names and conditions maintained for the life of the record.
       3.5.3.3. The FDI documentation pertaining to relocation actions for the family for the
       last two assignments. FDI documentation for assignments prior to the previous two FDIs
       (with the exception of consents received that must be retained under existing HIPAA
       guidance) may be shredded with a dated, signed note entered in the SN record of
       appropriate disposal of prior FDI documentation.
       3.5.3.4. Documentation of coordinating services delivered by EFMP-M, such as follow-
       up contacts and referrals made, are maintained in the SN record during two full
       assignments. Service notes from a location more than two assignments prior may be
       shredded or kept at the discretion of the SNC. If shredded, a dated, signed note is entered
       in the SN record indicating such disposition.
       3.5.3.5. E-mailed or faxed correspondence pertaining to service coordination.
3.6. Standards of Care. EFMP-M will comply with Air Force Inspection Agency, Health
Services Inspection, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization
standards, or Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care standards, and other AF-
sanctioned quality assurance mechanisms.
3.7. Standards of Practice. Standards of practice are the parameters of service provision as
permitted by licensure and/or an accredited body. The scope of practice for medical providers is
covered in AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations.
AFI40-701_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 21 FEBRUARY 2014                                               61


3.8. Application of Standards. The standards and guidance stated in this document apply to
active duty, civilian, and contract personnel providing special needs identification, Family
Member Relocation Clearances, process evaluation to include data collection and data
management, and support to AF sponsors with family members.
