This instruction is in compliance with Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-2, Law Enforcement. This
instruction applies to all military dependants and civilians, regardless of age and affiliation that are sub-
ject to the Technical Agreement between the United States and Portugal. The objective of this supplement
is to provide safe and secure living and working conditions for Air Force employees, members and their
families. It attempts to prevent misconduct through a clear policy on dealing with misconduct. When mis-
conduct does occur, the program seeks to rehabilitate the individual through intermediate actions short of
barment. The program also provides a means in which to interact with the offender and to foster positive
relationships between offenders and the 65th Security Forces Squadron (65 SFS). Refer recommended

                   CONDUCT ADJUDICATION PROGRAM BOARD LETTER


MEMORANDUM FOR ____________________, SPONSOR OF________________________


FROM: 65 MSG/CC


SUBJECT: Conduct Adjudication Program Board (CAPB)


1. As 65th Mission Support Group Commander at Lajes Field, it is my responsibility to decide on issues
of misconduct that occur on this base. AFI 36-3026, Identification Cards for members of the uniformed
services, their family members, and other eligible personnel, dictates that civilian offenders who commit
acts of misconduct can have their base privileges suspended, curtailed or revoked. In extreme or repeat
cases, the civilian offender may be barred from the base, which could prevent the family from residing in
base housing, or suffer revocation of command sponsorship, which would necessitate the early return of
dependents to the United States.


2. The Lajes CAPB is designed to make civilian offenders more responsible for their actions and offer a
more formal approach to discipline. The program requires the full support of the civilian offenders spon-
sor to be effective. An offender accused of misconduct may meet the CAPB, which will evaluate the case
along with any voluntary input from the civilian offender and the sponsors/parents. The board is com-
prised of various base agencies and will recommend action. It is a rehabilitation program and usually
includes community service, counseling and/or loss of privileges for the civilian offender. Each sanction
is based upon the circumstances of the misconduct. The board itself is not a criminal proceeding.


3. The board may recommend suspension of base privileges or barment from the base. I have the discre-
tion to impose suspension, curtailment or revocation of base privileges or may recommend to the Wing
Commander barment, regardless of the board recommendations. The CAPB is an option that is voluntary.
Failure to participate, however, could result in any of the actions mentioned above without the benefit of
your input.


4. The board will provide an opportunity for you to offer information that could lead to a rehabilitation
program of community service, counseling, class attendance or other appropriate activity. You and your
dependent will have the opportunity to make a presentation to the board. If a board meeting is scheduled
to review your dependent’s case, your First Sergeant or Commander will notify you. You will be required
to attend with your dependent.
LAJESFIELDI31-101 29 AUGUST 2008                                                                         7


5. The Lajes CAPB is not meant to take the place, nor do away with your part in disciplining your depen-
dent (if applicable), but provides a more formal rehabilitation tool to help you and your dependent. Your
active involvement in this program can weigh heavily in your favor if further disciplinary actions are con-
sidered. If you have any questions or comments concerning the CAPB, please contact the Security Forces
Investigations Office (S2I) at 535-1324. For further guidance on appropriate parental disciplinary meth-
ods, please contact Family Advocacy at 535-5177.

MEMORANDUM FOR ____________________, DEPENDENT OF _____________________


FROM: CONDUCT ADJUDICATION PROGRAM BOARD (CAPB)


SUBJECT: Conduct Adjudication Program Board Options


1. The CAPB offers you the opportunity to give back positively to the Lajes Field community. You may
suggest the length of time and kind of community service you desire to perform. The CAPB may support
your request or recommend other options based on the offense and your explanation. I will make the final
decision. Options available include, but are not limited to:


       a. Community Service. Examples: Working on Services or Civil Engineering details or providing
       restitution to victims.


       b. Revocation of Privileges. Examples: Services, AAFES and Commissary. The Wing Com-
       mander may revoke base access privileges or order an early return of dependents after revoking
       command sponsorship.


       c. Attending classes and seminars individually and as a family. Examples: Substance/drug abuse,
       understanding your teen/school-age child, self-concept, Systematic Training for Effective Parent-
       ing type classes, building family strengths, parent/teen communication, adult communication
       workshops and stress management. Family counseling and/or individual counseling for family
       members.


       d. Writing essays and speaking to various groups on lessons learned, identifying values, providing
       information and suggesting alternatives.


2. The goal of the CAPB is to help individuals and families deal positively with situations that are diffi-
cult, and in some cases, illegal. This program is voluntary. The choice is yours to decide if the CAPB’s
assistance is needed. Failure to participate will result in assessment of rehabilitative options without your
input.
