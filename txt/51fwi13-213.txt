                                            Chapter 1

                                             SCOPE

1.1. This instruction establishes responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle
operations on the Osan AB airfield. Airfield driving is for official use only. Maximum
attention must be paid to safety and accident prevention. Drivers may not deviate from
procedures or principles set forth in this instruction except in the interest of safety. Airfield
safety is paramount; conscientious and safe driving will prevent accidents. The requirements of
this instruction must be included in the unit‘s self-inspection program if personnel perform
airfield driving duties.
1.2. The goal of the Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI) is to maintain a safe airfield
environment. Motor vehicles on the airfield present a clear and definite danger to both aircraft
and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and disregard for established safety standards are the
primary sources of aircraft-vehicle incidents.
1.3. The standards set forth in this instruction apply to all motor vehicles and bicycles on
the airfield. Only properly trained and certified personnel will be permitted to drive or ride their
bike on the airfield. All personnel operating vehicles on the airfield must be knowledgeable of
and comply with this instruction. In addition, they must be trained on local driving procedures
and possess a valid AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency. The AF Form 483 must be
endorsed by Osan AB Airfield Management (AM) in order to be valid. This requirement applies
to all military and civilian employees assigned to, visiting, permanently assigned contractor or on
temporary duty to this base, and to all types of vehicles (military, commercial and private-
owned).
1.4. This instruction does not address every possible airfield driving scenario. Contact AM
at 784-4222/5149 if you have any questions or require clarification.

   6.1.1. Runway (RWY) 09/27, runway overruns, the area within 100 feet of the edges of the
   runway and overruns (not including Perimeter Rd on the east end).
   6.1.2. During Alternate Landing Site (ALS) Operations Taxiway Foxtrot and the Driving
   Lanes will become a CMA. Notification will be verbalized via the SCN/Ramp Net activated
   by AM and protected by 51 SFS. The lateral limits of the CMA along taxiway Foxtrot
   coincide with the yellow dashed wingtip clearance markings. Drivers will not proceed pass
   these markings unless they have permission from the control tower.
   6.1.3. During inclement weather, the Localizer critical area, Glide slope critical areas, and
   Precision Obstacle Free Zones (Attachment 3) are active CMAs. The Control Tower will
   advise vehicles to exit these areas when activated.
6.2. Operations.
   6.2.1. Vehicles/personnel will not enter the CMA unless absolutely necessary.
   6.2.2. All vehicles/personnel requiring access into the CMA must establish and maintain
   direct two-way radio contact with Tower and receive approval from Tower prior to entering
   the CMA.
   6.2.3. Personnel must have a current AF Form 483 stamped with ―All Airfield‖.
   6.2.4. Vehicles will stop at the Visual Flight Rules (VFR) or Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
   hold line markings and contact Tower for permission to enter the runway portion of the
   CMA. VFR runway hold line markings are at least 100 feet from the runway edges.
   6.2.5. When approaching the runway in the grassy areas, stop at least 100 feet from the
   runway edge and contact the Tower before proceeding. The runway distance remaining
   markers are approximately 75ft from the edge of the runway. Use them as a reference point
   to judge your distance.
   6.2.6. Any vehicle operator told by Tower to exit the runway will comply immediately by
   safely expediting to the nearest exit point and reporting off the runway. Operators forced to
   exit the runway must contact the Tower to re-enter the runway.
   6.2.7. Any operator told to hold short of the runway will do so and read back hold short
   instructions to Tower regardless of their perceived need to enter the runway.
   6.2.8. Vehicles operating within the CMA have a call sign on file at AM Ops (Attachment
   4).
   6.2.9. Escorts will request permission from the Control Tower into the CMA by using their
   call sign, the term ―plus,‖ and the number of vehicles to be escorted.
   6.2.10. The escort vehicle is responsible for the group and will relay Control Tower
   instructions/communications for the group.

  6.2.11. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency flashers
  when driving in the CMA.
  6.2.12. In the event of a radio failure immediately depart the CMA via the shortest route that
  does not enter/cross the runway. Do not enter the CMA until radio contact has been re-
  established with the Control Tower and the Control Tower has approved you to re-enter the
  CMA.
  6.2.13. Operators will notify the Tower when they exit the runway and must gain additional
  authorization to re-enter the runway after exiting. This applies to all operators of all types of
  vehicles or equipment, including emergency responders.
  6.2.14. When radio communication fails, Tower will use light gun signals that must be
  obeyed. The following light signals are designed to control airfield vehicle traffic:
     6.2.14.1. Steady Green Light – Cleared to cross, proceed or Go.
     6.2.14.2. Steady Red Light - STOP. Do not move vehicle.

                      AIRFIELD SIGNS, MARKINGS, AND LIGHTING

7.1. Airfield Signs
   7.1.1. Mandatory signs must be obeyed. They have white inscriptions on a red background.
       7.1.1.1. A Runway Hold sign indicates to operators they are at an intersection with a
       runway. It is colored red to indicate it is mandatory to stop before crossing the hold line
       associated with this sign. Vehicle operators must request and be granted permission from
       Control Tower to precede past this sign onto the runway. It also tells which direction to
       turn to get to the approach end of each runway. In Figure 7.1. runway 09 is to the left
       and runway 27 is to the right.

Figure 7.1. Runway Hold Sign




       7.1.1.2. An instrument hold sign informs operators they are at an intersection with a
       navigational equipment critical area. It is colored red to indicate it is mandatory to stop
       before crossing the instrument hold line associated with this sign when instrument hold
       procedures are in effect. Operators must have permission from the tower to cross into
       that area when instrument hold procedures are in effect; which occurs during inclement
       weather. Instrument hold procedures are in effect whenever the cloud ceiling is below
       800 feet or the visibility is less than 2 miles. If in doubt, ask the Control Tower. Failure
       to abide by instrument hold procedures can affect the navigational capability of aircraft
       on approach to the runway, and causes a flight safety hazard.
51FWI13-213 11 MAY 2012                                                                      31


Figure 7.2. Instrument Hold Sign




   7.1.2. Informational signs indicate a specific location or destination, or provide useful
   information, such as taxiway or ramp designations. Informational signs have black
   inscriptions on a yellow background or vice versa.
      7.1.2.1. Directional signs inform operators of the direction for other pavements or
      facilities. These signs can reference any area of the airfield, including aircraft parking
      aprons. These signs are informational and aid operators in knowing where they are and
      where they are going.

Figure 7.3. Taxiway Directional Sign




      7.1.2.2. A location sign is placed at the intersection of a taxiway and the runway. This
      sign reminds operators what taxiway they are entering when exiting the runway. This
      assists in knowing where operators are for travel and reporting to the tower.

Figure 7.4. Taxiway Location Sign




7.2. Airfield Markings
   7.2.1. Various markings are painted on the pavement. Vehicles must pay strict attention to
   markings which correspond with mandatory signs. These markings have a direct bearing on
   flight safety. Other markings define taxiways, roadways, or pavement boundaries.
   7.2.2. Runway Holding Position Markings are painted on the pavement and correspond to
   mandatory signs. There are two different hold lines—one for VFR and one for IFR.
      7.2.2.1. Runway VFR hold line. Two solid 6 inch wide yellow lines and two dashed six-
      inch wide yellow lines running across each taxiway at least 100 feet from the runway
      edge. The dashed lines are on the runway side of the taxiway. These markings identify
      the locations on a taxiway where an aircraft or vehicle is supposed to stop when it does
      not have clearance to proceed onto the runway.

Figure 7.5. Runway VFR Hold line




      7.2.2.2. Instrument Hold Line. Two solid yellow parallel lines with double vertical
      yellow stripes spaced two feet apart, with ―INST‖ painted on the runway side of the line.
      These markings prevent aircraft and vehicles from interfering with signals transmitted to
      inbound aircraft from the Instrument Landing System (ILS) during periods of inclement
      weather. During inclement weather, i.e. thunderstorms, fog, snow showers, etc., vehicles
      must stop behind the INST hold line and request access prior to entering the area. The

      INST hold lines are in effect at Osan when the ceiling is 800 feet and visibility is less
      than 2 miles. Instrument hold lines are located on Taxiway Alpha, Echo, and the
      Hazardous Cargo Pad.

Figure 7.6. Instrument Hold line




   7.2.3. Taxiway/ramp edge stripes. Two continuous 6-inch wide stripes separated by a 6-inch
   wide gap. This yellow marking is used when there is little contrast between the taxiway and
   the surrounding area. The marking delineates the edge of the taxiway or apron from other
   pavements or surfaces which are not intended for use by aircraft.

Figure 7.7. Taxiway/Ramp Edge Stripes




   7.2.4. Restricted Areas are marked with a continuous red line with white boxes at intervals
   along the red line. The Entry Control Points to the Restricted Areas are marked with a thick
   continuous white line.

                                       PHRASEOLOGY

8.1. General.
   8.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with Tower by using the appropriate call sign.
   8.1.2. Do not use any form of the word ―clear‖ in any communications with the Control
   Tower.
   8.1.2.1. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, Tower must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what Tower wants them
   to do.
   8.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
8.2. Phraseology.
   8.2.1. Vehicle operators must contact Tower before they proceed onto the CMA and when
   they leave. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must advise Tower of three
   things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your intentions are.
   8.2.2. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so Tower and other
   personnel know that the message was received.
   8.2.3. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 8.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                    “OSAN TOWER AIRFIELD ONE.”
TOWER:                               “AIRFIELD ONE, OSAN TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                    “OSAN TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO CROSS
                                     RUNWAY 09 AT TWY ALPHA.”
TOWER:                               “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS RUNWAY 09 AT TWY ALPHA.
                                     or
                                     “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD SHORT OFRUNWAY 09.”
   8.2.4. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what Tower has transmitted, or if you do not
   understand an instruction, you MUST ask Tower to repeat it. Good communications only
   occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.
 38                                                               51FWI13-213 11 MAY 2012

proceeds across the runway            or
                                      “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLDING SHORT AT TWY ALPHA.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “OSAN TOWER, AIRFIELD ONE CROSSING
                                      COMPLETE, OFF RUNWAY 09 AT TWY ALPHA.”
Tower:                                ―AIRFIELD ONE, ROGER.‖
   8.2.5. If vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide a
   read back to Tower.

Table 8.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions.
TOWER:                                “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED VIA TAXIWAY
                                      CHARLIE, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO SEVEN.”
                                      or
                                      “AIRFIELD THREE PROCEED VIA CHARLIE, HOLD
                                      SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO SEVEN.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “AIRFIELD THREE, ROGER.”
TOWER:                                “AIRFIELD THREE, READ BACK HOLD
                                      INSTRUCTIONS.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “AIRFIELD THREE, PROCEEDING VIA CHARLIE,
                                      WILL HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY TWO SEVEN.”

8.4. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet.
   8.4.1. Because some letters have similar sounds, like B and P, the international aviation
   industry uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example, Taxiway B would be
   referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Vehicle operators must know and use the

9.2. Documenting/Reporting CMAV Events.
   9.2.1. A CMAV event is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians
   entering the CMA without specific ATCT approval. This definition also includes runway
   incursions. A runway incursion is a CMAV event that involves the incorrect presence of an
   aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
   take-off of aircraft.
   9.2.2. Unit Commander, Unit ADPM and AM must be notified immediately of any CMAV
   event. AM will notify MAJCOM OPR for AO within 24 hours of a CMAV/HATR incident.
   9.2.3. For an actual or suspected runway incursion, the individual‘s AF Form 483 must be
   surrendered to AM and airfield driving privileges temporarily suspended until an
   investigation and retraining is completed.
   9.2.4. Runway Incursions and CMAV events must be reported to Wing Safety as outlined in
   AFMAN 91-223, Chapter 6.
   9.2.5. The AOF/CC, 51FW Safety and, 51FW ADPM will work as a team to assign all
   runway incursions an operational category (e.g., Operational Error, Pilot Deviation and
   Vehicle/Pedestrian) for trend analysis.
9.3. Documenting/Reporting General Airfield Driving Violations.
   9.3.1. Report airfield driving violations/possible unsafe acts or conditions to AM Ops.
   9.3.2. AM Ops will report and document other airfield driving incidents/violations (e.g.
   speeding, expired or no POV pass, etc.) and forward all information to 51 FW ADPM. At a
   minimum, they will obtain the following information:
      9.3.2.1. Name/Rank of the individual, unit, duty phone, Unit Commander or unit ADPM.
      9.3.2.2. Details of incident/violation (including date, time, location, nature, other
      pertinent facts, etc.).
9.4. CMAV/Runway Incursion Required Actions.
   9.4.1. The Wing ADPM is responsible for taking immediate actions to correct any identified
   systematic problems and ensuring interim control measures are applied until permanent
   corrections are made.
   9.4.2. The Wing ADPM and Wing Safety must inspect the unit ADP of personnel that
   commit a runway incursion as a part of the investigation. Emphasis will be placed on how
 42                                                              51FWI13-213 11 MAY 2012


   the unit trained the individual and their compliance with the ADI. The results will be
   reported to the Unit Commander.
   9.4.3. CMAV events must be briefed at the AOB.
      9.4.3.1. Provide a detailed description of each incident to include (What, When, Where,
      How, type vehicle/aircraft involved and action taken to prevent a reoccurrence).
      9.4.3.2. Highlight any trends (e.g. annual/biannual chart showing upward or downward
      incident rate as applicable)
   9.4.4. The Wing ADPM must maintain a copy of the AF Form 651s/457s, actions taken,
   results and supporting documentation in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 13-06, Rule
   15.00 (see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Program and AFI 91-223. A copy of the
   final runway incursion AFSAS report may be obtained from Wing Safety and/or MAJCOM
   OPR for AO.
9.5. Violation Consequences.
   9.5.1. Consequences for airfield driving violations may vary based on the nature or
   circumstances of the violation. AM (51 OSS/OSAM) has final authority to determine
   consequence actions other than those mandated below.

      9.5.2.3. Third violation: Permanent suspension of privileges.
   9.5.3. If an individual commits a violation while using a POV Pass; the individual‘s POV
   pass will be confiscated permanently in conjunction with the above AF Form 483 suspension
   period.
   9.5.4. Unit Commanders will sign the Suspension MFR (attachment 12) verifying airfield
   driving privileges have been suspended.
   9.5.5. Individuals must re-accomplish all training prior to reissuance of an AF Form 483
   after a suspension. Unit Commanders will sign the reinstatement MFR (attachment 12) and
