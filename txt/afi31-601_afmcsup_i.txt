SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access to
classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the DD
Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information systems
(AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the requirement
to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in this
publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security and
policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. The term
"sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified contract that
has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | )
indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.

(AFMC) This document is revised and must be completely reviewed. It aligns its guidance with
Air Force Instruction 31-601, 29 June 2005, Industrial Security Program Management. Revision
includes update of office symbols and program responsibility; Installation Commander (IC)
designation of the local Chief, Information Protection (CIP) as the Information Security Program
Manager (ISPM) and the authority that provides industrial security oversight and support; adds
requirement for CIP’s to report number of classified and non-classified contractor support
personnel on the installation 1 October each year.

   within HQ AFMC. The servicing Program Security Officer (PSO) is responsible for
   approving DD Form 254s that require access to SAP information.
1.6. Program Implementation and Administration.
   1.6.1. The IC will:
      1.6.1.1. Designate on-base contractor operations that require access to classified
      information as an intermittent visitor, visitor group, or cleared facility.
      1.6.1.2. Execute a VGSA with all contractor operations located on Air Force installations
      that require or will have access to classified information. This provision may also be
      extended to include other contractors that perform contractual services on the installation
      and require or have access to sensitive unclassified information or those that require
      routine or infrequent “entry” to the installation in the performance of other types of
      contracts, services or maintenance.

          contractors work on the installation with their organizations for periods of 30 days or
          more continuously. This applies to contractors that require access to classified
          information and those that do not. CIPs maintain lists of contractor groups by
          categories (cleared facilities, integrated visitor groups, NISPOM visitor groups, or
          unclassified).
          1.6.1.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Establish VGSAs with contractor groups working on
          classified contracts on the installation for 90 days or more continuously not identified
          as cleared facilities.
          1.6.1.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Consider establishing VGSAs with contractors
          supporting classified contracts on the installation for less than 90 days continuously
          when there is a requirement for specialized/supplemental security requiring alarms,
          guards, etc.
      1.6.1.3. Ensure NISPOM or equivalent security procedures are implemented for
      contractor operations supporting classified efforts within the confines of the installation.
      1.6.1.4. Designate the installation ISPM (see AFI 31-401, Information Security Program

          installation commander retains security cognizance.
       1.6.5.6. Conduct security oversight of an on-base designated “cleared facility” as
       determined by the IC. A designated on-base cleared facility operates under the security
       provisions and requirements of the NISPOM.
       1.6.5.7. Ensure the contractor takes prompt corrective actions when security program
       deficiencies are identified and promptly report security violations and/or compromises.
       1.6.5.8. Forward to DSS a copy of the security review and survey reports and other
       applicable documentation, which pertains to an on-base “cleared facility” per DOD
       5220.22-M, DOD 5220.22-R, AFPD 31-6, and this instruction, if required.

        or information to the CIP.
        1.8.1.2. Upon receipt of information submitted per paragraph 1.8.1, the ISPM will
        forward the report to the visitor group’s Home Office Facility (HOF). Any subsequent or
        additional reporting required by the NISPOM to other federal agencies, e.g., CSA, CSO,
        Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), is thereafter the responsibility of the HOF.
        1.8.1.3. The ISPM will retain a copy of the adverse information or suspicious contact
        report in the visitor group’s files for 2 years.
        1.8.1.4. The ISPM is responsible for notifying other AF activities, e.g., contracting
        office, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), when appropriate.
     1.8.2. Reporting Security Violations.
        1.8.2.1. A designated on-base “cleared facility” reports the loss, compromise, suspected
        compromise or other security violations pursuant to the NISPOM through the ISPM, who
        in-turn is responsible for notifying the CSO.
        1.8.2.2. On-base integrated visitor groups report such incidents and/or information in
        accordance with AFI 31-401 to the ISPM via the AF activity security manager. This
        reporting requirement must be specified in the VGSA, if applicable. The commander of
        the AF activity being supported appoints an assigned federal employee (military or
        civilian) to conduct the preliminary inquiry in accordance with AFI 31-401, Chapter 9.
        1.8.2.3. The CSO and ISPM report significant contractor security violations and
        compromises (resulting in actual loss or compromise) of classified information to the
        contracting officer.
     1.8.3. Reporting Espionage, Sabotage, and Subversive Activities.
        1.8.3.1. The ISPM reports espionage, sabotage, subversive activities, deliberate
        compromises of classified information, and leaks of classified information to the media,
        involving cleared facilities or visitor groups located on Air Force installations to the
        servicing AFOSI. AFOSI coordinates with the FBI, as appropriate. The ISPM sends a
        report via secure communications (STU III or classified fax) with an information copy to
        each of the following activities:

                                SECURITY CLEARANCES

2.1. Facility Security Clearances (FCLs).
   2.1.1. Sponsoring FCLs. The contracting office (CO) is responsible for Facility Security
   Clearance (FCL) sponsorship. Defense Security Service is the authorizing agent for the FCL.
   DSS establishes and maintains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M, DOD
   5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-501,
   Personnel Security Program Management.
       2.1.1.1. To request an FCL sponsorship, write to the CSO with oversight responsibility
       for the sponsored facility.
       2.1.1.2. Give the full name for the sponsored facility, its physical and mailing address,
       telephone number, and a specific point of contact at the facility, when known. Give the
       full name, job title, and direct-dial telephone number of the Air Force sponsor.
       2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When
       circumstances do not permit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through
       DSS.
   2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential
   and Secret FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of
   interim Top Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD
   5220.22-R. To request a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships
   through command channels to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each
   request must include these items:
   2.1.2. (AFMC) Route interim Top Secret facility security clearances through local CIP and
   HQ AFMC/IP.
       2.1.2.1. An explanation of why an interim Top Secret FCL would prevent a crucial delay
       in the award or performance of a classified contract.
       2.1.2.2. A listing giving the legal name of the facility being sponsored, its complete
       street address, and the names and positions of people who are applying for interim Top
       Secret access authorization.
       2.1.2.3. The address of the authorizing DSS.
   2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations
   participating in the NISP.
       2.1.3.1. The ISPM with oversight responsibility for a cleared facility conducts required
       security reviews of the operation and assists the CSO, as necessary.
       2.1.3.2. The ISPM also conducts surveys and/or administrative inquiries pertaining to an
       on-base cleared facility as requested by the CS O and ensures contractor compliance
       with DOD 5220.22-M, NISPOM.
14                                                  AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2010


        2.1.3.3. Complete the survey by using the DD Form 374, Facility Security Clearance
        Survey Data Sheet, [DOD 5220.22-R], or an equivalent/acceptable automated format
        when conducting survey for an on-base cleared facility and forward a copy to the CSO.
        2.1.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Contracting officers (COs) verify facility security clearances
        through the Defense Security Service (DSS) Industrial Security Field Database (ISFD) or
        DSS Secure Web Site. When COs require assistance to verify a facility security
        clearance, they contact the servicing CIP.
2.2. Contractors with Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).
     2.2.1. The CSO tells COs if a contractor performing on a classified contract has foreign
     ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) or whether it can be negated. Such influence might
     jeopardize the security of classified information held by the contractor.
     2.2.2. To resolve a FOCI problem, the CSO may establish a facility clearance that limits the
     level and type of classified information to which a FOCI contractor has access. Such
     restrictions might affect ongoing, pending and future classified contracts with the contractor.
     The CO should discuss this impact with the ISPM and servicing Foreign Disclosure office.
     2.2.3. The CO considers sponsoring a National Interest Determination (NID) after receiving
     written justification from the requesting program office or activity. This justification must
     address and explain how the FOCI contractor’s product or service is crucial or is the sole
     available source to the AF. If applicable, the program or activity must also provide a written
     explanation when contract cancellation would cause unacceptable delays for mission-
     essential weapons systems in the field or for support organizations.
        2.2.3.1. The requesting program office or activity is responsible for obtaining written
        release approval authority from the functional owner of the “proscribed information,”
        prior to submitting the NID to the contracting office. The program office or activity
        contacts the OCA for Top Secret (TS), NSA for Communications Security (COMSEC),
        DCI for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and DOE for Restricted Data (RD)
        or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) to obtain release approval. (NOTE: All release
        determination request (NID) involving/for SCI must be submitted to HQ USAF/XOIIS
        for review, coordination and processing).
            2.2.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Forward requests for SCI NIDs through the supporting
            SSO/SIO, to HQ AFMC/A2S (MAJCOM SSO), for HQ USAF/A2RS approval.
        2.2.3.2. The CO reviews, validates, and processes the NID and associated written
        approvals as follows:
            2.2.3.2.1. Forward request for NID related to special access program (SAP)
            performance through the appropriate SAP and command channels to the Deputy for
            Security and Investigative Programs, Office of the Administrative Assistant
            (SAF/AAZ), 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20330-1720 for approval.
            2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to
            HQ USAF/ XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to
            SAF/AAZ for review and endorsement.
            2.2.3.2.2. (AFMC) Forward requests for non-Special Access Program (SAP)
            National Interest Determination (NID) through the local CIP to HQ AFMC/IP for
AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2010                                                              15


          submission to SAF/AAP. Local CIP and HQ AFMC/IP review and coordinate as
          appropriate.
      2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of
      Defense for Counterintelligence and Security (OSD-USD/I), 5000 Defense Pentagon,
      Washington, D.C. 20301-3040, for final approval.
2.3. Contractor Personnel Security Clearances (PCLs).
   2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also
   terminates contractor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor
   employee is terminated. Administrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse implications
   regarding the employee or the contractor.
   2.3.2. The Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review, DOD Office of General
   Counsel, may suspend or revoke contractor PCLs following due process.
   2.3.3. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential or Secret PCLs for interim
   clearances, where possible.
   2.3.4. When a contractor employee who is not cleared for access to Top Secret information
   needs such access to perform on an Air Force classified contract, the employing contractor
   may sponsor the individual for an interim Top Secret PCL.
      2.3.4.1. The contractor should send requests to the CO who seeks concurrence of the
      system program office (SPO), system manager (SM), or program manager (PM).
      2.3.4.2. The contractor's request should document clearly why the individual needs an
      interim PCL, why contract requirements may not be satisfied with another individual
      more suitably cleared, and what the potential adverse impact would be on contract
      performance if an interim PCL were not granted. The contracting officer will deny
      contractor requests that do not meet these criteria.
      2.3.4.3. The CO routes the appropriate contractor’s request for interim Top Secret PCLs
      to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval.
      2.3.4.3. (AFMC) Route interim Top Secret personnel security clearance (PCL)
      paperwork through the local CIP and HQ AFMC/IP for submission to AFMC/CC.
      2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes
      the endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS
      for action. The CO promptly returns denied requests.
   2.3.5. (Added-AFMC) OC-ALC/PK acts as the nominating commander on requests for
   personnel security investigation requests for contractors supporting presidential activities.
   See DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program; AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security; and AFI
   31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, for additional guidance.
2.4. Processing Trustworthiness Determinations.
   2.4.1. When contractors require unescorted entry to restricted areas, access to sensitive
   unclassified information, access to government automated information systems (AIS) and/ or
   sensitive equipment, not involving access to classified information, the contractor’s personnel

     security questionnaire is processed by the sponsoring Air Force activity per DOD 5200.2-R
     and AFI 31-501.
     2.4.1. (AFMC) Sponsoring Air Force organizational security managers submit requests for
     contractor unclassified IT personnel security investigations to the servicing CIP for
     processing IAW AFI 31-501.
2.5. Reciprocity. The CO, ISPM, and other installation security disciplines offices of primary
responsibility (OPRs) work together to resolve issues pertaining to reciprocity, as applicable to
inspections, surveys, audits, security clearances, security reviews, etc. Elevate reciprocity issues
to the next higher level of command when they can not be resolved locally.

                        SECURITY TRAINING AND BRIEFINGS

3.1. Security Training Requirements.
   3.1.1. Air Force classified solicitations and/or contracts [Statement of Objectives (SOO),
   Statement of Work (SOW), Request for Bid (RFB), Request for Quote (RFQ), VGSA, etc.]
   may stipulate contractor compliance with and participation in pertinent Air Force, command
   and installation security training programs when performance or services will occur on an
   Air Force installation.
   3.1.2. When specified in an executed VGSA, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management, security training requirements satisfy the NISPOM training provision for on-
   base integrated visitor groups. Other Air Force functionals and/or security discipline OPRs
   may use this training provision for operational efficiency, however the specific requirements
   must be identified in the VGSA.
   3.1.3. When an on-base contractor operation is designated as a cleared facility, the ISPM
   will provide the initial facility security officer (FSO) briefing in accordance with the
   NISPOM and CSO guidance.
   3.1.4. Air Force unit security managers or security officers will provide information security
   program training (initial, refresher and annual) and other security awareness support to
   integrated visitor groups. The AF activity, working in concert with the ISPM, will
   incorporate language into the VGSA, which requires visitor group personnel to attend and/or
   receive information security training per DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Chapter 8. Unit
   security managers will ensure integrated visitor group personnel are included in their security
   education program.
   3.1.4. (AFMC) The contractors' facility security officer or visitor group security point of
   contact (POC) will provide initial and recurring security training to NISPOM visitor group
   contractors. NISPOM visitor group employees may be included in AF unit security training
   programs.
3.2. Security Briefing/Debriefing Requirements.
   3.2.1. Management officials of the on-base cleared facility visitor groups are responsible for
   ensuring their employees receive all required security briefings and debriefings as mandated
   by the NISPOM.
   3.2.2. For integrated visitor groups, DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 security training
   requirements are equivalent to and satisfy the training requirements of NISPOM, where
   appropriate. On-base contractor management officials are responsible for ensuring their
   personnel’s attendance and satisfying NISPOM documentation requirements.
   3.2.3. The ISPM will invite on-base cleared facility, Facility Security Officers (FSOs) and/or
   security representatives, to the installation’s information security manager meetings.

                      SECURITY SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDANCE

4.1. Issuing Security Classification Guidance.
     4.1.1. The AF program, project, activity and contracting office (CO) implements NISPOM,
     DOD 5200.1-R, and installation security requirements through contract documents. Only
     COs can sign, modify or negotiate changes to contracts.
     4.1.2. When a contractor requires access to classified information, the AF program, project
     or activity prepares the required DD Forms 254, DOD Contract Security Classification
     Specifications. The contractor should use the security requirements in this form to accurately
     estimate the cost of security measures. More detailed security requirements are specified in
     the statement of work (SOW), statement of objectives (SOO), performance work statement
     (PWS), Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA), etc.
     4.1.2. (AFMC) AF program, project officers, or activity POCs must involve the CIP early
     in the acquisition process when contracts require contractor access to classified or
     unclassified sensitive information or enhanced physical security for products while under the
     contractor’s control.
     4.1.3. The responsible AF program, project, or activity will identify (by title, functional
     OPR, and approval date), the specific security classification guidance or guides (SCGs)
     applicable to the contract in Block #13 of the DD Form 254. The AF activity/program will
     provide copies of the SCG to the contractor prior to the contract commencing.
        4.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Use the DD Form 254 to convey contractual security
        classification guidance to foreign contractors. For complex classification issues, attach
        Country Specific Guides or extracts of security classification guides (SCG) applicable to
        the foreign contract performance that are releasable to the government of that country
        under National Disclosure Policy. DoD SCGs are not releasable to foreign nationals or
        governments unless approved by the responsible foreign disclosure officer (FDO).
        Coordinate all proposed releases with the local Foreign Disclosure Office.
4.2. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specifications.
     4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
     contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
     the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the
     terms of the solicitation/ contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is
     forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
     classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements
     listed in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
     4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
     disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security
     guidance is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the
     requesting AF entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards
     an original DD Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2010                                                                19


   4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security
   disciplines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form
   254. This review and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office
   symbol, date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and
   maintain a copy of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file. When
   SAPs are involved, coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office responsible
   for SAP security oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs
   unclassified, whenever possible.
4.3. Reviewing and Certifying the DD Form 254.
   4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security
   classification guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only
   annotates Block 13 of the draft DD Form 254. Other security requirements are incorporated
   into the SOW, SOO, PWS, VGSA, etc
   4.3.2. The AF program, project or activity reviews the DD Form 254 and applicable security
   classification/declassification guidance at least once every five years or as required, to ensure
   accuracy and currency. When changes are necessary, the contract will be modified, if
   appropriate and revised guidance issued.
   4.3.2. (AFMC) CIPs monitor required review dates of DD Forms 254 issued by local
   contracting office and applicable security classification/declassification guidance at least
   once every five years. Retain a copy of the review with file copy of DD Form 254. Issue
   revised DD Form 254 if changes are required.
   4.3.3. The CO certifies (signs) the DD Form 254, Block 16e. At the CO discretion, this
   authority may be delegated (in writing) as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations
   (FAR) or supplementation thereto.
   4.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Identify the responsible program manager or project officer by
   name, organization, address, and phone number in Block 13. Estimated contract completion
   date may be annotated in Block 13, if desired.
4.4. Distribution of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.1. When DSS is relieved of security oversight responsibility for cleared facilities
   performing on SCI or SAP programs, furnish Headquarters DSS, 1340 Braddock Place,
   Alexandria VA 22314-1651, a copy of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.2. When a contractor’s performance will be on Air Force installation, the AF program,
   project or activity must identify/specify all contract performance locations, if known, on the
   DD Form 254. When the contract is performed elsewhere, the CO will provide a copy of the
   signed DD Form 254 to that location’s ISPM.
   4.4.2. (AFMC) When performance will be on an Air Force installation, identify the
   servicing CIP by office symbol and address in Block 13 of the DD Form 254. For contract
   performance outside the CONUS, place an “X” in Block 17f with a note, “See Block 13.” In
   Block 13, enter the office symbol and mailing address of the overseas cognizant security
   office.” In addition to the distribution indicated in Block 17, make distribution to the security
   offices listed in Block 13.

     4.4.3. Procuring Contracting Officers (PCOs), their designated representatives, including
     Administrative Contracting Officers (ACOs), distribute DD Form 254.
4.5. Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).
     4.5.1. Execute a VGSA with all contractor operations located on Air Force installations that
     will require access to classified information. At the IC’s discretion, the VGSA execution
     requirement may be extended to contractors performing on contracts that require access to
     sensitive unclassified information, sensitive resources or frequent "entry" to the installation.
     4.5.1. (AFMC) Execute VGSAs with contractor groups visiting 90 days or more
     consecutively. Consider executing VGSAs with contractors visiting periodically for periods
     of less than 90 days if they require supplemental security using alarms, security guards, or
     other means.
     4.5.2. The installation ISPM, security disciplines and functional OPRs work in concert with
     the AF program, project and/or activity to develop the Visitor Group Security Agreement
     (VGSA) requirements. The requirement to execute a VGSA is in addition to preparing the
     DD Form 254.
     4.5.3. The VGSA must address those security requirements and/or procedures that are
     unique to the installation for which the contractor will be held contractually liable. VGSAs
     need only address those areas of security, safeguarding and/or protection that have not been
     covered elsewhere within the contract, DD Form 254, SOW, SOO, PWS, etc.
     4.5.4. The ISPM is the technical OPR for development and preparation of the VGSA. For
     coordination purposes, the ISPM routes the VGSA to all installation security discipline
     OPRs and/or other agencies lending expertise to the contractual security requirements.
     4.5.5. The ISPM signs the VGSA on behalf of the installation commander. The ISPM
     forwards a copy of the executed/signed VGSA to the contracting officer who awarded the
     contract or to the contracting officer’s designated representative, when appropriate.
     4.5.5. (AFMC) CIPs may not delegate authority to sign VGSAs. Host activity commanders
     and program managers or their designees sign VGSAs in addition to CIPs.
     4.5.6. An authorized company official shall sign the VGSA. The CO will file a copy of the
     authorization with the contract.
     4.5.6. (AFMC) An authorized representative of the sponsoring cleared facility's
     management staff (e.g., the facility security officer) signs VGSAs.

                                      SAFEGUARDING

5.1. Designation of On-Base Visitor Groups. The IC works in concert with the Air Force
activity, CO and ISPM to determine the designation of an on-base visitor group (cleared facility,
integrated visitor group or intermittent visitor).
5.2. Integrated Visitor Group.
   5.2.1. Integrated visitor groups operate in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental
   guidance thereto. They handle, generate, process, and store classified information per AF
   guidance. The exception being, their “access” is limited to “need-to-know” contract-specific
   classified performance information.
   5.2.2. The AF must stipulate the specific DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental guidance, which
   is applicable under the terms of the executed VGSA.
   5.2.3. The guidance conveyed to on-base contractor operation via the VGSA is limited to the
   AF installation and the AF solicitation/contract which it was executed to support. All other
   NISPOM mandated security requirements not addressed or specifically exempted by the
   executed VGSA or other contracting document must be implemented by the contractor.
   5.2.4. The VGSA must clearly reflect that the Air Force is accountable for and controls all
   classified information. Integrated contractor visitor groups are prohibited from establishing
   separate classified information controls. (NOTE: Integrated visitor group personnel can not
   be appointed as primary or alternate security managers for AF activities. However, they can
   be required (via the VGSA) to provide other security program support, under AF direction,
   such as, conducting end-of-day security checks, security training/briefings, etc.).
5.3. Cleared Facility. An on-base cleared facility operates under the security mandates and
requirements of the NISPOM. See AFPD 31-6 for further guidance regarding their
establishment.
5.4. Intermittent Visitors. Intermittent visitors may operate under the security requirements of
the NISPOM or the installation security program. The IC makes this determination after
considering the intermittent visitor’s relationship and interface with the AF activity and/or
installation.
5.4. (AFMC) Intermittent Visitors. Sponsoring host AF activity commander or staff agency
chief determines the security requirements under which intermittent visitors operate.
5.5. On-Base Contract Completion or Termination. The program, project or AF activity will
notify the ISPM in writing when the contractual services and/or performance has been completed
or terminated.
5.6. (Added-AFMC) NISPOM Visitor Group. NISPOM visitor groups operate in accordance
with the NISPOM, VGSAs, and installation security program requirements. They handle,
generate, process, and store classified information separately IAW AF guidance described in
VGSAs. Their access is limited to need-to-know contract-specific classified information.

              OVERSIGHT REVIEWS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Conducting Industrial Security Reviews (SRs).
     6.1.1. Industrial Security Reviews. The ISPM conduct security reviews (SRs) of on-base
     cleared facilities that performs classified work on Air Force installations. Such SRs evaluate
     the contractor’s compliance with contract specific-security requirements and pertinent DOD
     and Air Force security instructions.
     6.1.1. (AFMC) ICs have security cognizance and CIPs provide security oversight and
     support to two Federally Funded Research and Development Centers that operate as cleared
     facilities. The Electronic Supply Center (ESC) IC has cognizance over Massachusetts
     Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, and The MITRE
     Corporation, Bedford, MA.
     6.1.2. Scheduling Industrial Security Reviews. Conduct (SRs) of on-base cleared facilities
     per DOD 5220.22-M and DOD 5220.22-R. Unless conducting an unannounced security
     review on a cleared facility, provide contractor activity’s management 30 days advanced
     written notification.
     6.1.2. (AFMC) CIPs conduct security reviews of cleared facilities, for which they maintain
     security oversight, at least annually.
     6.1.3. Performing Industrial Security Reviews. ISPMs coordinate with other Air Force
     security discipline OPRs such as; Operations Security (OPSEC), Computer Security
     (COMPUSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC), to provide specialized expertise
     when necessary to complete a security review. The SR is complete when all security
     requirements imposed under the terms of the contract have been evaluated.
        6.1.3.1. When SRs are conducted for cleared facilities, provide copies of completed SR
        report, with all related correspondence, to the CSO. Use DSS’ automated format to
        document the results of the SR. Contact HQ USAF/XOS-FI to obtain a copy of the
        automated DSS format.
        6.1.3.2. Facility security clearance (FCL) files must contain all key documentation
        prescribed by DOD 5220.22-R and the CSO, to include DD Form 254 and related
        contract security requirement documents.
     6.1.4. Post-Industrial Security Review Requirements.
        6.1.4.1. Send a letter/report to senior management officials of the cleared facility within
        10 days of completing the security review. The letter should:
        6.1.4.2. Confirm the contractor's security status as discussed during the exit interview.
        6.1.4.3. List any deficiencies requiring corrective action.
        6.1.4.4. Within 30 days, request written confirmation on the status of any open major
        discrepancy (condition which resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in the
        loss or compromise of classified information).
AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2010                                                               23


      6.1.4.5. The ISPM may extend the time for corrective action if required changes are
      significant and the contractor is making a conscientious effort to resolve problems
      expeditiously.
   6.1.5. Unsatisfactory Industrial Security Reviews.
      6.1.5.1. The ISPM assigns an on-base cleared facility an unsatisfactory SR rating:
          6.1.5.1.1. To a cleared facility visitor groups if it fails to satisfactorily perform its
          contractual security responsibilities.
          6.1.5.1.2. When major failures in the contractor's security program have resulted in
          or could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of classified
          information.
          6.1.5.1.3. When the contractor is clearly responsible for the security problems cited
          during a security review.
          6.1.5.1.4. The ISPM coordinates with the CSO and contracting officer when
          assigning an unsatisfactory SR rating for an on-base cleared facility.
          6.1.5.1.5. The home office facility (HOF) for the cleared facility is ultimately
          responsible for meeting contract security requirements. When assigning an
          unsatisfactory SR rating, the ISPM notifies the HOF immediately through the
          contracting office and requests prompt and complete corrective action. If the HOF
          fails to take corrective action, its security clearance may be affected. The servicing
          security activity should notify the HOF’s CSO if problems continue.
   6.1.6. Invalidating the Facility Security Clearance (FCL).
      6.1.6.1. The CSO notifies the contracting officers in writing when the FCL of a
      contractor under their jurisdiction is invalidated.
      6.1.6.2. A contractor who fails to correct security deficiencies that subsequently results
      in invalidation may lose its FCL.
      6.1.6.3. Although most contractors resolve invalidations promptly, contractors with
      foreign owned, controlled, or influence (FOCI) invalidations may have to wait for many
      months. Where FOCI is evident, the facility clearance may remain invalidated for more
      than a year while methods to resolve the FOCI are considered, approved, and
      implemented. The FCL is invalidated while DSS negotiates voting trusts, proxy
      agreements, or special agreements with foreign interests.
      6.1.6.4. Document SR for an on-base cleared facility as required by the DOD 5220.22-
      M, DOD 5220.22-R, and CSO guidance. Keep copies of completed SR reports with pre-
      security review letter and completed post-review correspondence for 2 years from the
      date of the most recent SR.
      6.1.6.5. Maintain copies of self-inspection reports or reviews for 2 years from date of the
      most recent self-inspection.
6.2. Conducting Information Security Program Reviews.
   6.2.1. Information Security Program Reviews. On-base integrated visitor groups will be
   evaluated and conduct self-inspections collectively with the AF activity per DOD 5200.1-R
24                                                  AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2010


     and AFI 31-401, guidance. Integrated visitor groups will not be subjected to the SR
     requirements of the NISPOM. The installation prescribes the report for documenting program
     reviews.
     6.2.2. Scheduling Information Security Program Reviews. Schedule program reviews per
     DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 guidance.
     6.2.3. The AF activity is responsible for ensuring its integrated visitor group implement and
     comply with DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 requirements.
     6.2.4. The ISPM, unit security manager and integrated visitor group establishes files and
     maintain the following documentation, as appropriate:
     6.2.4. (AFMC) NISPOM visitor groups establish and maintain files including the
     documentation listed in paras 6.2.4.1. through 6.2.4.5.
        6.2.4.1. Signed copy of the DD Form 254 and any revisions.

7.1. Installation Visitors. The installation commander is the sole authority responsible for
granting contractors access to the installation, regardless of which DOD agency, military service
component, or activity awarded the contract.
7.2. Visitor Groups. The IC designates contractors who require access to the installation in the
performance of a government contract as intermittent visitors, integrated visitor groups, or
cleared facilities.
7.2. (AFMC) Visitor Groups. The IC delegates authority to the CIP to determine contractor
group designations (intermittent visitor, integrated visitor group, NISPOM visitor group, or
cleared facility). Contractor activities may be designated NISPOM visitor groups IAW AFPD
31-6, paragraph 7, only when it is required by the mission, operational requirements,
autonomous nature of a visitor group's operation or other factors.
7.3. Contractor Visits to Air Force Installations.
     7.3.1. DOD contractors located on or visiting Air Force installations in support of a
     classified contract must comply with DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6, Section 1, visit

                                   SUBCONTRACTING

8.1. Prime Contractor’s Responsibilities.
   8.1.1. Prime contractors are responsible for ensuring their on-base subcontractors are
   knowledgeable of and comply with the applicable security requirements (NISPOM,
   installation, etc.) as identified in contracts and/or other contracting documents.
   8.1.2. Prime contractors supporting classified efforts must include a provision in each on-
   base subcontract that requires subcontractors to contact the installation commander or
   designee and execute a VGSA prior to beginning on-base operations.
8.2. Subcontractor Responsibilities. On-base subcontractors must execute a separate and/or
independent VGSA with the installation. (NOTE: As an alternative, when multiple
subcontractor perform services in support of the same on-base classified contract and prime
contractor, the execution of this VGSA, can be satisfied by the subcontractor acknowledging
review and understanding of the security requirements identified in the prime contractor’s
executed VGSA. This being the case, executing and adding a signatory page only (attachment)
to the prime’s VGSA is acceptable).

                                            Chapter 11

                      INTERNATIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

11.1. Procedures for Contractor Operations Overseas. DOD policy does not allow an FCL
to be issued for contractors located outside the US, Puerto Rico, or a United States possession or
trust territory. Treat DOD contractor operations supporting the Air Force overseas as visitor
groups.
11.2. Disclosure of Information to Foreign Visitors/Interests. Visits by foreigners to
contractors performing on Air Force contracts (whether on or off base) that requires access to
classified or controlled unclassified information will be processed through the Foreign Visits
System IAW AFI 16-201. Approved visits will include disclosure authorization through the

VGSA—Visitor Group Security Agreement

Terms
Classified Contract—Any contract that requires or will require access to classified information
by the contractor or the employees in the performance of the contract. A contract may be
classified even though the contract document itself is not classified.
Cleared Facility—A non-government owned and operated industrial, educational, commercial,
or other facility for which DOD has made an administrative determination (from a security
viewpoint) that the entity is eligible for and requires access to classified information of a certain
category (Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret).
Cognizant Security Office—The designated Department of Defense (DOD) agency responsible
for industrial security program administration. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) has
designated the Defense Security Service (DSS) to perform this function. The Director of DSS
has further delegated this responsibility downward within the agency. DSS Regional Directors
provide industrial security administration for DOD contractor facilities located within their
respective geographical area. One exception, for which ISPM has responsible, is DOD
contractors on Air Force installation who have been designated as “visitor groups.” When used,
the language “Cognizant Security Office” (CSO), always refers to DSS or an entity thereof.
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)—This AF entity implements and administers
the installation’s information, personnel and industrial security programs. The ISPM is
responsible for supervising and overseeing on-base contractor’s security programs and/or
operations.
Installation—An installation is an area in which the Air Force holds a real property interest or
real property over which the Air Force has jurdisdiction by agreement with a foreign government
or by right of occupation. The term installation also includes all auxiliary off-base or detached
installations under the jurisdiction of the commander of the primary installation.
Integrated Visitor Groups—An on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that
requires access to classified information and operates under the direct control/supervision of the
Air Force. The integrated visitor group is authorized to function in accordance with DOD
5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 per the VGSA. The Air Force maintains control of all classified and
provides day-to-day supervision over this type of contractor operation. It basically differs from
the on-base cleared facility because of its close interaction and/or relationship with the AF
organization it supports.
Interim Facility Security Clearances (Interim FCL)—Interim FCL are temporary, limited
company security clearances established by the DSS. It does not permit access to Restricted
Data, COMSEC, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), SCI, SAP, or Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency classified Information. However, if an interim Top Secret FCL is issued,
the contractor may access such information at the level of Secret and Confidential. Interim FCLs
may not be appropriate for all contractual needs and are not available for all sponsored
companies.
Intermittent Visitor—A contractor or company, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that require
“entry” to an Air Force installation for brief periods of time on a scheduled or on call basis to
AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2010                                                                 35


perform contractual duties. An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation usually does not
exceed 90 consecutive days.
Invalidation—A condition at a cleared facility caused by changed conditions or performance
under which the facility may no longer be eligible for an FCL unless the facility promptly
initiates appropriate corrective actions.
Major Discrepancy—A condition, which resulted in or could reasonably be, expected to result
in the loss or compromise of classified information.
NISPOM Visitor Group—An on-base contractor operation that does not meet the requirements
of a cleared facility or integrated visitor group. A NISPOM visitor group operates in accordance
with the NISPOM and installation security program requirements. They handle, generate,
process, and store classified information separately IAW their contracts and guidance provided
in the VGSA. The visitor group has access to a security container or containers under the visitor
group's control. Their access is limited to need-to-know contract-specific classified information.
The CIP conducts industrial security reviews in accordance with the NISPOM
On—Base Cleared Facility—An on-base contractor operation cleared under the provisions of
the NISP and established at the discretion of the IC per DOD 5220.22-R. These entities operate
under NISPOM guidance and the ISPM has been designated by the IC to provide security
oversight.
Reciprocity—A reciprocal condition, relationship, mutual or cooperative agreement, between
two or more agencies, components, or departments agreeing to recognize and accept the efforts
(requirements, procedures, actions, etc.) of the other in exchange for the same compensation.
Visitor Group—Any on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that requires
access to classified information. The installation commander determines their “official” on-base
designation. (NOTE: All on-base contractor operations are considered “visitor groups,” per this
AFI. The IC assesses and evaluates the working relationship and interactions between the visitor
group and AF activity to determining their “official” designation, i.e., cleared facility, integrated
visitor group or intermittent visitor).
Visitor Group Security Agreement—A documented and legally binding contractual agreement
between an Air Force activity and a DOD contractor whereby the contractor commits to
complying with, rendering or performing specific security tasks or functions for compensation.
The VGSA attest to and certifies the existence of such an agreement, including applicable
changes and amendments, attachments, supplements and exhibits.

 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
 This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
 Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
 chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
 government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
 documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
 information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
 with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access
 to classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
 execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
 unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
 procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the
 DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
 subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
 Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
 contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information
 systems (AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the
 requirement to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in
 this publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security
 and policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. The
 term "sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified
 contract that has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R,
 Information Security Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information
 Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC
 is at the last attachment.

 2.1.1. Sponsoring FCLs. The contracting office (CO) is responsible for Facility Security
 Clearance (FCL) sponsorship. Defense Security Service is the authorizing agent for the FCL.
 DSS establishes and maintains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M, DOD
 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-501,
 Personnel Security Program Management.
 2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When circumstances
 do not permit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through DSS.
 2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential and
 Secret FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of interim
 Top Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD 5220.22-R.
 To request a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships through
 command channels to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each request
 must include these items:
 2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations
 participating in the NISP.
 2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to HQ
 USAF/XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to SAF/AAZ for

 regarding the employee or the contractor.
 2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes the
 endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS for
 action. The CO promptly returns denied requests.
 4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
 contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
 the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the
 terms of the solicitation/contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is
 forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
 classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements listed
 in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
 4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
 disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security guidance
 is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the requesting AF
 entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards an original DD
 Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
 4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security

disciplines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form 254.
This review and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office symbol,
date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and maintain a copy
of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file. When SAPs are involved,
coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office responsible for SAP security
oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs unclassified, whenever
possible.
4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security
classification guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only
annotates Block 13 of the draft DD Form 254. Other security requirements are incorporated
into the SOW, SOO, PWS, VGSA, etc.
4.3.2. The AF program, project or activity reviews the DD Form 254 and applicable security
classification/declassification guidance at least once every five years or as required, to ensure
accuracy and currency. When changes are necessary, the contract will be modified, if
appropriate and revised guidance issued.
