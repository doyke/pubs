SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The focus of this instruction is to inform participants of specific processes and to facilitate the
timely and accurate completion of EWIR. The PACER WARE/SERENE BYTE (PW/SB)
notification process is simplified and explained in greater detail. The following summarize the
major changes: HARM Targeting System (HTS) PACER WARE information is added to the
instruction throughout. 8 FW/CP urgency to notify 8 OSS/OSKE and 8 MXG Avionics Manager
during peacetime, exercises, and contingencies is clarified.

1. EWIR General Information and Objectives.
     1.1. General Information. EW systems reprogramming is a result of operational
     deficiencies or a change in operational requirements. SB is an exercise of the emergency
     reprogramming process. PW is an actual reprogramming effort. Reprogramming includes
     modification of aircrew tactics, computer software, and may include changes to equipment
     settings. Changes will be dispatched to the 8 FW from HQ PACAF in the MXGt expedient
     manner in accordance with (IAW) AFI 10-703, Electronic Warfare Integrated
     Reprogramming. The Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) is the primary
     method of receiving reprogramming data from the Multiservice Data Distribution System
     (MSDDS). A secure data connection using the STE-III is secondary. Units will proceed
     with reprogramming actions only upon receipt of implementation directions from MAJCOM
     and the 8th Operations Group Commander (8 OG/CC) approval. Expedient distribution and
     execution is critical to counter new or updated threats and ensure aircraft/aircrew
     survivability, therefore all actions contained in this instruction must be executed without
     delay.
2. SB/PW Message Information.
     2.1. The normal flow and definition of messages for a SB/PW are as follows:
     2.2. An initial message may alert the wing of an impending SB/PW event, or it could be no-
     notice with a System Impact Message (SIM) or Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM)
     arriving first.
     2.3. A SIM describes parametric changes to threats and details what effect the changes will
     have on a particular aircraft system.
     2.4. A RIM may follow the SIM. The RIM details how the Reprogramming Center (RC)
     plans to compensate for the change in the threat and how the reprogramming actions affect
     the system. A Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) or Maintenance Instruction
     Message (MIM) may also arrive that defines the reprogramming procedures for maintenance
     personnel.
     2.5. Along with the RIM, the data (reprogramming software) will be available on the
     MSDDS. The MSDDS is a classified network that can be accessed through SIPRNET or a
     STE-III modem.
     2.6. The Implementation Message (IMP) is the authorization from HQ PACAF to
     reprogram the affected systems. The IMP will be attached to the RIM and authorize
     loading unless further MAJCOM instruction is received. However, prior to reprogramming
     any 8 FW aircraft or alternate mission equipment, the 8 OSS/OSKE( 8 FW Electronic
     Combat Pilot (ECP)) will brief the 8 OG/CC on the effect of the SB/PW. Aircraft, HARM
     Targeting System(HTS), and Electronic Attack (EA) pods will not be reprogrammed
     without approval from the 8 OG/CC.
     2.7. The interval between messages can vary from a few hours, as in a PACAF SB exercise,
     to several months for a PW dealing with a routine software upgrade.
     2.8. The systems affected by SB/PW at Kunsan AB are: ALR-56M Radar Warning
     Receiver (RWR) Set, ALE-50 Active Towed Decoy (ATD), ALE-47 Countermeasures
8FWI10-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   3


   Dispenser System (CMDS), ALQ-184 Electronic Attack Pod (EAP), HTS, and ALQ-188
   EAP.
   2.9. An 8 FW/PW PACER WARE inbox is available on SIPRNET to provide notification of
   SB/PW messages and applicable messages posted on MSDDS.
3. Objective.
   3.1. To provide the 8 FW an expedient and accurate flow of information and actions in
   compliance with MAJCOM directed reprogramming.
   3.2. 8 OSS/OSKE will notify 8 MXG Avionics Manager and 8 MXG/MXOOM
   (Maintenance Operations Center) of a SB/PW within 30 minutes of 8 OG/CC approval.
   3.3. The goal per AFI 90-201_ACCSUP_ADD_A, Combat Aviation Operational Readiness
   Inspection, 13 Jul 07, is for 8 FW Maintenance to accomplish the first aircraft SB/PW within
   two hours of notification from 8 MXG/MXOOM.
   3.4. Unless otherwise indicated, a SB exercise will involve the reprogramming of all units of
   a particular EW system per Aircraft Maintenance Unit/Pacer Ware objective as stated in 3.3.
4. SB/PW Message Notification Process.
   4.1. Peacetime Operations.
      4.1.1. 8 OSS/OSKE, 8 AMXS/MXA, and 8 FW/CP will check the 8 FW/PW PACER
      WARE account for PW messages daily.
      4.1.2. If 8 FW/CP receives an Emergency or Urgent PW message first, immediately
      contact the following two individuals in order: 8 OSS/OSKE and 8 MXG Avionics
      Manager. DO NOT leave a message on an answering machine or voicemail. If no
      contact can be made, notify 8 OSS/OSK or designated representative and 8
      MXG/MXOOM. If 8FW/CP receives a Routine PW message first, contact the above
      individuals within normal duty hours, only.
      4.1.3. Any other individual checking the PACER WARE account will contact 8 FW/CP
      if they receive a message that has not yet been disseminated.
      4.1.4. If 8 OSS/OSKE is unavailable, 8 OSS/OSK will designate an alternate ECP from
      8 FW SERENE BYTE/Pacer Ware Message Management Letter provided by 8
      OSS/OSKE.
      4.1.5. 8 OSS/OSKE (or designated alternate) will disseminate 8 OG/CC approvals for
      implementation to affected EW maintenance personnel and fighter squadrons.
   4.2. Exercise/Contingency Operations.
      4.2.1. During exercise or contingency operations, the 8 FW/PW PACER WARE inbox
      will be checked at least every 60 minutes by 8 FW/CP.
      4.2.2. Upon receipt of the SB/PW message, 8 FW/CP will immediately contact the
      following two people in order: 8 OSS/OSKE and 8 MXG Avionics Manager. DO NOT
      leave a message on an answering machine or voicemail. If no contact can be made,
      notify the 8 FW Mission Director (MD) and 8 MXG/MXOOM. The MD will locate and
      designate an alternate ECP from the 8 FW SERENE BYTE/Pacer Ware Message
 4                                                           8FWI10-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2013


        Management Letter provided by 8 OSS/OSKE and have the alternate ECP perform the
        duties of 8 OSS/OSKE.
        4.2.3. Any other individual checking the PACER WARE account will contact 8 FW/CP
        if they receive a message that has not yet been disseminated.
        4.2.4. 8 OSS/OSKE (or designated alternate) will coordinate with 8 MXG Avionics
        Manager and maintenance personnel to ensure dissemination of SB/PW messages. Once
        determined a valid message, the 8 OSS/OSKE, 8 OSS/OSK, or 8 MXG Avionics
        Manager will coordinate with 8 MXG/MXOOM to run the SERENE BYTE/Pacer Ware
        checklist.
        4.2.5. When maintenance units are notified of the SB/PW (RIM and/or MIM), they will
        download and print the reprogramming software from the MSDDS. The (VIPER)
        Memory Load Verifier (MLV) will be loaded with the new software at that time.
        However, reprogramming will not commence until the 8 OSS/OSKE (or Designated
        Alternate) and 8 OG/CC approves the reprogramming.
        4.2.6. 8 OSS/OSKE or acting MD will disseminate 8 OG/CC approval instructions
        during exercise and contingency operations.
     4.3. All units, peacetime or exercise/contingency, will compile their reprogramming times,
     pertinent actions, tail numbers, persons involved and problems encountered when
     reprogramming ceases and then pass this information to 8 OSS/OSKE as soon as practical.
5. 8 OSS/OSKE will:
     5.1. Act as the focal point for all 8 FW EWIR activities and designate an alternate ECP.
     5.2. Coordinate with 8 OSS/IN to develop Operational Change Requests (OCR) when
     required.
     5.3. Provide a Message Management Letter (MML) to 8 CS/SCOSC and 8 FW/CP
     authorizing individuals (8 OSS/OSKE and alternates) to receive SB/PW message traffic for 8
     OSS/OSK.
     5.4. During exercise and contingency operations, provide MD with a list of ECP-qualified
     individuals.
     5.5. Verify the MMLs are up to date once per quarter.
     5.6. Review message addresses on incoming messages and update as required.
     5.7. Upon receiving notification of reprogramming message traffic, determine urgency and
     applicability. Instruct 8 MXG Avionics Manager and 8 MXG/MXOOM on the notification
     process based on message urgency and 8 OG/CC approval timeline.
     5.8. Coordinate with 8 MXG/MXQ on which systems are affected by a SB/PW
     reprogramming message.
     5.9. Download SB/PW files from the MSDDS for use as backups.
     5.10. During contingency and exercise operations, notify the MD of received SB/PW
     message traffic and, if necessary to expedite the process, may directly pass the SB/PW
     message information to the 8 MXG/MXOOM.
8FWI10-101 4 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                        5


   5.11. During contingency and exercise operations, provide briefing to 8 OSS/IN detailing
   SB/PW messages and expected impact on flying operations.
   5.12. Write messages required by tasking, such as the Unit Load Message (ULM), when
   reprogramming is complete.
   5.13. Ensure EW systems are returned to their original configuration or as directed by HQ
   PACAF after exercise termination.
   5.14. Ensure deployed units have accurate points of contact and inform HQ PACAF/DOTW,
   USAFAWC/EC, 513 ETS, and WR-ALC/LNE of status.
   5.15. Conduct an after action meeting, if required, to address concerns.
   5.16. Compile a history of events and file the ULM and after action report to
   PACAF/DOTW.
   5.17. Conduct as a minimum, quarterly SB/PW exercises. SB scenarios during an
   Operational Readiness Exercises (ORE) will count towards this requirement. SB scenarios
   should     be    coordinated     through    53rd   WG       PW      Administration     at
   53wg.pwadmin@afmc.af.smil no later than two weeks prior to an exercise for proper
   coordination. Passing SB messages directly to the 8 FW/PW PACER WARE inbox or 8
   FW/CP should only be done when all avenues to post to MSDDS have been exhausted.
   Passing SB messages directly to the 8 FW/CP negates desired learning objectives of proper
   communication and data flow among all involved.
   5.18. Maintain an updated list of Operational Flight Program (OFP) versions after every
   SB/PW reprogramming action. In the case of exercises where several reprogramming efforts
   can happen, the updated list can wait until after the exercise.
6. 8 OSS/INW will:
   6.1. During contingency and exercise operations, forward the 8 OSS/OSKE briefing
