This instruction provides 374th Airlift Wing (374 AW) guidance for PRMS implementation as
outlined in Joint Publication 3-50, Personnel Recovery, 20 Dec 11, USPACOM TASKORD
5050.08, USPACOM INST 0503.01, and AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and
Escape (SERE) Program, and assigns individual responsibilities for Isolated Personnel Report
(ISOPREP) development/updates, managerial duties, responsibilities and oversight requirements.
PRMS allows ISOPREP and Evasion Plans of Action (EPA) development, storage, update,
retrieval and system management by Individuals, Managers, Unit Managers, Recovery
Coordinators       and      Component        Managers.           The      PRMS         website
(https://prmsnatl.osc.acc.af.smil.mil/prms) is a web-based application that supports
management of ISOPREP and EPA information. Upon notification of an isolating event, the
Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) or equivalent will use PRMS to search and immediately
access ISOPREP and EPA information to support recovery operations. PRMS eliminates the
need to forward ISOPREP data (and EPA when developed in PRMS) to the JPRC and Personnel
Recovery Coordination Cells (PRCC) during combat operations. This instruction applies to all
374 AW personnel. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected
by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by 10 U.S.C. Sections 133, 3012, 3051 and 8012; E.O.
9397. System of records notice F031 AFMC B. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.         Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)

the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Direct all question to the 374
OSS/OSK Office. DSN 315-225-8948.

1. Commanders’ Responsibilities.
     1.1. Commanders will:
        1.1.1. Ensure all personnel complete a PRMS ISOPREP as directed within USPACOM
        reporting instructions.
        1.1.2. Designate PRMS Managers in writing (Appointment Letter example at
        Attachment 6).
        1.1.3. Ensure in-processing/out-processing checklists are updated with PRMS
        requirements and activation/deactivation of Secure Internet Protocol Router Network
        (SIPRnet).
2. Policy and Guidance for the Individual.
     2.1. Individual Account Privileges:
        2.1.1. Individual members can create, import, and edit their own ISOPREP and EPA.
        2.1.2. Update their password and user profile information.
     2.2. Individual Account Responsibilities:
        2.2.1. All personnel should complete an ISOPREP before reporting to PACOM in order
        to meet USPACOM reporting instructions.
        2.2.2. All personnel who have not completed an ISOPREP prior to arrival in PACOM,
        should complete an ISOPREP as part of their individual squadron in-processing.
        Mandatory ISOPREP fields are outlined in Attachment 2. Information obtained through
        the registration page will automatically populate certain fields within their ISOPREP.
        2.2.3. PRMS ISOPREPs must be accomplished on, or loaded into, a secret computer and
        can be accomplished in one of the following ways:
            2.2.3.1. Individuals who possess a secret clearance should request a SIPRnet account
            through their Security Manager/communications focal point. After a SIPRnet
            account is established, member will register for a PRMS account and complete an
            ISOPREP           through       the         following        SIPRnet        website:
            (https://prmsglobal.prms.af.smil.mil)
            2.2.3.2. Individuals who possess a secret clearance, but who are not authorized a
            SIPRnet account, can complete an ISOPREP using their manager’s account.
            2.2.3.3. Individuals who do not possess a secret clearance will accomplish an
            ISOPREP by completing a paper copy DD form 1833 (see Attachment 2). This
            method requires the manager to manually upload data into the PRMS database. This
            is the least preferred method since it is very time consuming and subject to additional
            errors.
        2.2.4. Individuals will review ISOPREPs in accordance with AFI 11-2MDS guidance
        and theatre reporting instructions.
