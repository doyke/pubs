                        GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY AND POLICY

1.1. Goals and Objectives. The goal of this instruction is to provide the most effective
guidance for unit planning and execution of operations flying and maintenance scheduling
activities in support of the AFMC flying hour program. The objectives of this guidance are to:
     1.1.1. Provide methods for units to develop and improve their flying and maintenance
     scheduling programs.
     1.1.2. Provide audit methods so that units may analyze their effectiveness.
     1.1.3. Provide methods for local commanders, and the MAJCOM, to assess effectiveness of
     unit performance in schedule planning and execution.
1.2. Policy. This instruction provides procedures and audit methods for units to develop their
flying and maintenance scheduling program and analyze their effectiveness. It is intended to be
a local tool for operations and maintenance activities to use in support of their programs.
Reviewing flying and maintenance schedule deviations, and the reasons for those deviations,
allows wing commanders (WG/CC) and their staffs/subordinates to evaluate unit flying program
and scheduling procedures for efficiencies and effectiveness. Higher Headquarters (HHQ)
management attention is directed to those areas beyond a unit’s control.
1.3. Applicability. This publication is applicable to all AFMC Centers and activities
possessing, flying or supporting aircraft, to include contractor maintained operations.
1.4. Standardization. Wings will develop a supplement to this instruction standardizing
attrition rate, spare factors and scheduling practices for the wing and each assigned mission
design series (MDS). Minimum topics should include quiet hour policies, cross country takeoffs
and returns, minimum turn times, crew ready times, etc. Supplements will include local schedule
input and publishing deadlines along with any wing unique requirements.
1.5. Waivers. The MXG/CC or group designee will coordinate on waiver requests for this
instruction. Send waiver requests or proposals to change this instruction to HQ AFMC/A4M for
action. Unit requests for waivers must contain justification why the unit cannot comply with the
existing guidance, actions taken to achieve compliance, and expected date of compliance. Test
or trial programs that deviate from this instruction are not authorized without prior approval from
HQ AFMC/A4M. Those affecting organizational structure will also be coordinated through
local manpower office IAW AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization.
1.6. Responsibility. The terms maintenance operations and operations flight in this instruction
refers to Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) maintenance operations officer (MOO) or
superintendent (SUPT), Equipment Maintenance Squadron (EMS) maintenance operations
officer or superintendent, Component Maintenance Squadron (CMS) maintenance operations
officer or superintendent, Maintenance Squadron (MXS) maintenance operations officer or
superintendent, and/or Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS), Maintenance Operations
Flight (MOF), commander or superintendent, Operations Group (OG), Operations (OP or OPS),
Operations Squadron (OS) and Operations Support Squadron (OSS).
1.7. Reporting Requirements. Flying scheduling deviation recording and reporting is required
for all AFFTC and AAC possessed aircraft while status, inventory, and utilization reporting is
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                  5


required for all AFMC units and activities possessing or supporting AFMC possessed aircraft to
include those possessed for the AFMC mission by contractors.
   1.7.1. Reporting procedures are contained in Chapter 3 of this publication. Operations,
   maintenance, test agencies, and others share in the responsibility for monitoring and
   controlling deviations. Schedule deviations altering the planned use of resources generally
   have a domino effect that upsets future and near-term events. Every effort must be made to
   reduce or eliminate deviations.
   1.7.2. Units will use approved Maintenance Information System (MIS) reporting procedures.
   This includes contractor-maintained, AFMC assigned and possessed aircraft. In the event
   that the contractor is not obligated to utilize the MIS, the MXG commander or equivalent is
   responsible to ensure all reporting procedures are complied with. C

                                           Chapter 2

              FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

2.1. Purpose. This chapter defines flying and maintenance scheduling procedures which all test
units will comply with. The objective of the flying and maintenance planning cycle is to execute
the wing flying hour program (FHP) consistent with operational and test requirements (AFI 11-
102, Flying Hour Program Management and AFI 11-101, Management Reports on the Flying
Hour Program) and maintenance capabilities (AFI 21-101 AFMC Sup1). These procedures
enhance operations and maintenance interface. The flying and maintenance planning cycle
begins with the annual allocation of flying hours no later than 1 August of each year for the
following fiscal year. Maintenance schedulers must understand test and operational needs to
determine supportability.      Likewise, operations schedulers must consider maintenance
capabilities. Maintenance and operations schedulers will develop a proposed annual flying plan
balancing both operational and test requirements and maintenance capabilities. The annual plan,
detailed by month, will evaluate the capability of maintenance to support the annual flying hour
program. The plan will be coordinated and consolidated by OSS Operations Flight scheduling
and forwarded to the Operations Flight commander, AMXS/CC and AMXS/MOO, MOS/CC,
MOF/CC and MOF PS&D. The printed wing plan will include an assessment of the wing’s
ability to execute the flying hour program. The plan will be coordinated with the OG/CC and
MXG/CC before being approved by the WG/CC. Commit the fewest number of aircraft possible
to meet flying goal. The annual plan is further refined into quarterly/monthly operations and
maintenance plans and then into weekly schedules using the guidelines contained in the
following paragraphs.
2.2. First Look. The maintenance planning cycle ensures proper and effective use of
maintenance resources. Maintenance schedulers use both maintenance and operational long-
range planning to assess maintenance’s ability to support the wing flying program, Programmed
Depot Maintenance (PDM) schedules, Time Compliance Technical Order programs, scheduled
inspections and exercises. PS&D or equivalent will perform the long range planning function
and uses MIS products such as time distribution index (TDI), planning requirements (PRA), and
workable TCTO report (WTR) to determine long range maintenance requirements. PS&D will
forecast and monitor requirements for the planned fiscal year. Maintenance requirements are
included in long-range plans to project aircraft availability.
     2.2.1. Every year, on or about 15 March, MOF PS&D will request Maintenance
     Management Analysis (MMA) accomplish airframe, personnel, and facility capabilities for
     each AMU based on historical data to start the First Look requirements. The capabilities are
     due back to MOF PS&D no later than (NLT) the last workday of March.
     2.2.2. MOF PS&D will provide copies of the capability study to each Operations Squadron
     (OS) operations scheduling and maintenance supervision. AMU PS&D will refine the initial
     MMA airframe capability by applying projected maintenance requirements to the historical
     data. AMU PS&D will provide first look maintenance capability projections in a monthly
     format to OS operations officer, AMU OIC/ NCOIC, AMXS/CC/MOO, and MOF PS&D by
     15 May. Projections include known operational and test requirements, an assessment of
     maintenance’s ability to support the monthly contract requirements, and an overall
     assessment of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the annual flying hour program.
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                   7


   2.2.3. MOF PS&D will gather the AMXS and OS coordinated operational capability and
   forward them to OSS Operations Flight scheduling section for consolidation into a
   comprehensive package that includes a breakdown of the following items by OS/AMU:
      2.2.3.1. Sorties contracted/scheduled per day. Compute the number of sorties (hours)
      required per operations and maintenance (O&M) day to meet the operational and test
      requirement using the formula: Number of sorties (hours) required divided by number of
      O&M days in a given month. Sorties (hours) per day will be computed by month for
      each operational squadron/AMU.
      2.2.3.2. Monthly scheduled sorties. Compute monthly scheduled sortie requirements
      using the formula: (Number of sorties or hours required) divided by (1 minus the
      attrition factor). Example: 1,000 sorties or hours required divided by (1 minus 0.15)
      equals 1,177 sorties or hours to schedule. Remember to round any part up to the next
      whole sortie or hour.
      2.2.3.3. Inspection dock capabilities. Compute the number of Phases/ISO inspections to
      be accomplished in order to meet operational and test requirements for each AMU, by
      month, for the entire fiscal year. Compute dock capability using the formula (number of
      O&M days) divided by (number of phase days) times (inspection cycle). Inspection dock
      capabilities is provided at the wing level and provided by the squadron performing
      inspections.
      2.2.3.4. Sortie UTE Rates (N/A to MAF units). Compute UTE rates by month for the
      entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled sorties using formula:
      (number of sorties per month) divided by (number of PAI aircraft).
   2.2.4. Once compiled, the annual maintenance plan will be presented to the OG and MXG
   CCs (or equivalents) before being presented to the WG/CC for final approval. MOF PS&D
   will review the comprehensive package submitted to OSS Operations Flight scheduling
   section and provide feedback to AMU PS&D and MXG/CC if required. Final assessments of
   maintenance capabilities to support the operations ―first look‖ projections are sent to
   AFMC/A4.
2.3. Flying Hour Allocation/Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle.
   2.3.1. Flying Hour Allocation. Using the Lead Command Baseline Allocation message
   (provided by AFMC/A3), PS&D and OS/OSS scheduling provide affected work centers the
   following planning factors NLT 20 August each year, or within 10 working days after receipt
   of the flying hour allocations:
      2.3.1.1. Updated capabilities computed by MMA, provided by PS&D.
      2.3.1.2. Required flying hours and estimated sorties and missions, provided by OSS, in
      monthly increments.
      2.3.1.3. Flying days in each month, provided by OSS.
      2.3.1.4. Aircraft and aircrew alert requirements, provided by OSS.
      2.3.1.5. Known and projected TDY and special mission requirements, provided by OSS.
      2.3.1.6. PDM schedule, provided by PS&D.
 8                                                            AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012


        2.3.1.7. Configuration and munitions requirements, provided by OSS.
        2.3.1.8. Special mission and test requirements.
     2.3.2. NLT 1 September, or within 10 working days after receipt of the planning factors,
     maintenance supervision provides PS&D, SQ/CCs, and OSS operations scheduling the
     following planning factors:
        2.3.2.1. Estimated number of aircraft available by month, taking into consideration
        aircraft required for training.
        2.3.2.2. A projected airframe capability statement.
        2.3.2.3. Forecasted personnel capability, taking into consideration required annual
        training for maintenance personnel.       (Not applicable to contract maintenance
        organizations).
        2.3.2.4. The number of supportable sorties for each month.
        2.3.2.5. An estimated monthly attrition factor (N/A to MAF units) provided by MMA.
        This factor combines operations, weather and materiel (maintenance and supply) factors.
        Maintenance is responsible for adding the attrition factor to operational requirements.
        2.3.2.6. A recommended block scheduling pattern.
        2.3.2.7. A statement of limitations.
     2.3.3. The OSS Operations Flight commander consolidates unit inputs into a final package
     and coordinates it through the OG and MXG CCs before final approval from the WG/CC.
     MOF PS&D will review the package and provide feedback to AMU PS&D and MXG/CC, if
     required. The final approved package constitutes the wing annual Flying Hour Program
     (FHP). A copy of the approved annual plan and changes thereafter will be forwarded to
     MOF PS&D and the Analysis section. Units will submit the annual FHP (contract) to
     AFMC/A3 and AFMC/A4M around the 15th of September.
     2.3.4. The annual plan will show the number of flying hours projected to fly by aircraft
     Mission Design Series (MDS). Flying hours will be subdivided into planned test/test
     support, test pilot school, and an ―all other‖ category (i.e. proficiency, maintenance, ferry,
     etc.).
2.4. Quarterly Scheduling. The quarterly plan applies to Test Wing training missions and all
known test missions.
     2.4.1. Quarterly planning starts with the operational requirements for the flying hours, UTE
     rate, and airframe availability, alert and other related scheduling data. The OS operations
     officer provides these requirements to maintenance supervision and PS&D NLT 25 days
     before the beginning of the quarter. Maintenance supervision and the OS operations officer
     discuss these requirements at the scheduling meeting before the quarter being planned.
        2.4.1.1. The Test Wing scheduling office will use the following priority as a guide to
        determine which objectives to support if a lack of resources prevents meeting
        requirements such as: alert commitments, HHQ directed missions, training, and test and
        test support missions.
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                    9


   2.4.2. The unit’s rolling 3-month maintenance plan briefed each month meets the intent of
   the quarterly scheduling process. The meeting may be held in conjunction with the weekly
   or as a separate scheduling meeting. The plan will be posted so it may be viewed by both
   maintenance and operations.
2.5. Monthly Scheduling Procedure. Monthly scheduling will be accomplished IAW AFI 21-
101 AFMC Sup 1.
2.6. Weekly Scheduling Procedure. Weekly scheduling will be accomplished IAW AFI 21-
101 AFMC Sup 1.
   2.6.1. Also included in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule will be:
       2.6.1.1. Sortie sequence numbers, aircraft tail numbers (primary and spares), scheduled
       take-off and landing times, aircraft or equipment scheduled use times, configurations,
       fuel loads and special equipment requirements.
       2.6.1.2. Scheduled maintenance actions by aircraft and equipment serial number to
       include inspections, TCTOs, time changes, contract and depot inputs, engine changes,
       washes or corrosion control, documents review, deferred discrepancies, modifications
       and hours remaining to phase.
   2.6.2. Changes to the Weekly Schedule.
       2.6.2.1. Pen-and-Ink. The pen-and-ink AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule
       Coordination is not intended to be used as a tool to extend the scheduling process by
       another day. Pen-and-ink changes made to next week’s schedule, submitted to the MOC
       by 1600 hours Friday or at the daily maintenance scheduling/production meeting,
       whichever occurs first are authorized (exception: NLT 2 hours after the last landing
       during printed wing night flying weeks). They are non-reportable and become part of the
       printed weekly flying schedule. An AF Form 2407 is required stating the changes are
       pen-and-ink. NOTE: The intent of the pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is to correct minor
       errors and not complete revisions of the previously Wing/CC approved schedule.
2.7. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. Any changes to the printed schedule will require an
AF Form 2407 with the following exceptions: a change to the original printed takeoff or landing
time of 30 minutes or less; a change of aircrew names, ranges, or airspace; or a change arising
after the first crew ready time for the squadron’s current day’s scheduled flying window.
   2.7.1. Changes made during the daily scheduling meeting also require an AF Form 2407.
   2.7.2. All AF Form 2407 changes that add aircraft or sorties or increase the flying window
   require both OG and MXG commander (or designated group level representative) approval.
   MXG/CD or equivalent will approve changes to the final schedule and coordinate through
   affected AMXS Operations Officer/MX SUPT, AMU OIC/SUPT, MXS Operations
   Officer/MX SUPT, operations group representative, maintenance group, and wing staff
   agencies (e.g. MOC, PS&D, Analysis, etc.) using an AF Form 2407. MOC will coordinate
   higher headquarters directed taskings that require immediate execution.
       2.7.2.1. AFMC units are authorized to use the Edwards Scheduling System (ESS) and
       Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE) in recording and coordinating changes to the weekly
       schedule in place of the AF Form 2407. Electronic coordination is acceptable provided
       receipt is acknowledged and sender enters the name of the person notified, along with the
 10                                                              AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012


       date/time of notification, and logged in accordance with the requirements on the AF Form
       2407.
2.8. Scheduling Procedure. Units must effectively plan and execute operations, test and
maintenance schedules. Each day, no later than 1600 local time, the OG/CC and MXG/CC/CL
or their designated group representative will review the flying and maintenance schedule, agree
on revisions, and coordinate with other agencies to confirm the next day’s activities. Use AF
Form2407 or authorized automated system in coordinating the final schedule through the
affected AMXS Operations Officer/MX SUPT, AMU OIC/SUPT, MXS Operations Officer/MX
SUPT, operations group representative, maintenance group, and wing staff agencies. (i.e. MOC,
PS&D, Analysis, etc.). Develop flying schedules IAW AFI 21-101.
   2.8.1. The finalized flying schedule will include, at a minimum, the following details:
       2.8.1.1. Aircraft tail numbers.
       2.8.1.2. Aircraft takeoff and landing times.
       2.8.1.3. Configuration requirements.
       2.8.1.4. Munitions requirements.
       2.8.1.5. Fuel loads.
       2.8.1.6. Special or peculiar test support requirements.
       2.8.1.7. Special or peculiar mission support requirements.
       2.8.1.8. Off station sorties.
       2.8.1.9. On equipment training requirements.
       2.8.1.10. Other special requirements (i.e. ground test/mount).
   2.8.2. Maintenance Debrief will load all sorties considered ―flown as scheduled‖ (e.g.
   Functional Check Flights (FCF)/Operational Check Flight (OCF), Ferry and cross country
   returns) in the MIS.
   2.8.3. Finalize aircraft and equipment configurations at the daily maintenance scheduling
   meeting and document it on an AF Form 2407. To prevent excessive expenditures of work
   hours, configuration changes made after the daily maintenance scheduling meeting and prior
   to the first crew ready time the next day, require an AF Form 2407 coordinated through the
   required agencies.
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                          11


                                             Chapter 3

                         TOTAL SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

3.1. Purpose. This chapter defines flying schedule deviations and provides formulas for
computing Total Scheduling Effectiveness (TSE). A cornerstone of successful flying scheduling
and execution is an understanding of how the schedule is executed versus how it was planned to
be executed. These differences in scheduled versus actual events, are only recorded in the
execution phase of the scheduling process and are called deviations. Deviation data must be
recorded so that follow-up analysis can identify appropriate corrective actions, if any. Deviation
data recording and analysis is the beginning of the process that will, in the end, improve unit’s
flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting deviations to the flying schedule and
determining the cause for each deviation. Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate
agency before being assigned to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a
sequence of events will be assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will
be made by the parties involved to arrive at a unit position. The Operations representative and
the AMU/AMXS MS will monitor deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication.
When conflicts arise, leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All
deviations will be recorded as described in this publication. Although deviations are a key
indicator with regards to scheduling effectiveness, they are sometimes necessary to meet
dynamic mission sets that cannot be predicted, such as some flight test activities. Although
every attempt will be made to properly schedule and reduce deviations, this metric must be
viewed in conjunction with additional mission execution metrics to allow a more comprehensive
assessment of maintenance effectiveness.
3.2. Requirements. Total scheduling effectiveness computation and deviation recording are
required for all AFMC assigned aircraft. Reporting procedures are contained in para 3.5.
3.3. Deviations.
   3.3.1. Deviations apply to the approved weekly flying schedule. Multiple deviations will not
   be recorded against a single line entry except for (a) additions that air abort, (b) additions that
   cancel or ground abort, (c) added sorties that take-off late, and (d) late take-offs that air abort.
   The AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document is the official source
   document for takeoff and landing data. For all deviations, the person recording the
   deviations in the MIS will provide a detailed explanation in the remarks section and a Job
   Control Number/Event ID in IMDS (CAMS) screen 350, if applicable. Schedule deviations
   fall into one of the following categories:
   3.3.2. Ground Deviations. Ground deviations are events occurring before aircraft takeoff or
   scheduled ground test. All ground deviations are recorded and used in total scheduling
   effectiveness calculations unless otherwise noted. FCF and OCF whose primary purpose is
   to perform maintenance checks and sorties originating off-station without home-unit support
   will be considered "flown as scheduled‖ without recording deviations with the exception of
   aborts. Specific ground deviations are:
       3.3.2.1. Addition (AD). An aircraft or event (including both sortie and ground test)
       added to the approved flying schedule. Will be recorded against the agency (OP, MX,
       HQ, Test Agency, etc.) requesting the additional sortie or aircraft.
12                                                          AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012


     3.3.2.2. Cancellation (CX). A sortie or ground-test event that is removed from the
     printed schedule for any reason before crew ready time. Cancellations occur when it is
     determined the originally scheduled mission cannot be met. For training sorties, if the
     sortie can launch and recover during the squadron’s flying window and perform its
     original mission with the original crew, a cancellation is not recorded. If any sortie does
     not launch within the late takeoff criteria, a late takeoff is recorded. Any cancellations
     will be recorded against the agency (OP, MX, HQ, Test Agency, etc.) that is responsible
     for the cancellation.
     3.3.2.3. Early Takeoff (ET). An early takeoff is a scheduled sortie launching more than
     30 minutes prior to the published takeoff time.
     3.3.2.4. Ground Abort (GA). A ground abort is an event, after crew show, which
     prevents a ―crew ready‖ aircraft on a scheduled or added sortie event from becoming
     airborne. Ground aborts will be recorded against the responsible agency or condition that
     caused the abort. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA/GAB/GAC),
     operations, higher headquarters, weather, sympathy, project, other, etc.
     3.3.2.5. Late Takeoff (LT). A late takeoff occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes
     airborne more than 30 minutes after the scheduled takeoff time.
     3.3.2.6. Spare (SP). A spare is a designated aircraft on the printed schedule to be used
     in case a scheduled aircraft cannot fly its scheduled sortie. Spares can include aircraft
     that have canceled, aborted, flown earlier or an aircraft released after FCF/OCF. The
     aircraft production supervisor will manage scheduling and use of spare aircraft. Do not
     count printed spares flown in scheduled lines as deviations when computing TSE. Spare
     aircraft requirements are based on projected test mission needs. The following factors are
     used to determine spares and are not hard limits but guidelines, and as such, it is up to the
     AMU to actually schedule what it can support.
        3.3.2.6.1. The spare requirements may be canceled (when deviations are not used for
        computing TSE) if test requirements are accomplished/met.
        3.3.2.6.2. Additional spares are authorized to support HHQ taskings and special
        missions (if required by tasking).
     3.3.2.7. Interchange/Tail Number Swap (TS). Interchanges are changes to the printed
     flying schedule involving aircraft tail numbers printed on the flying schedule.
     Interchanges may be used to prevent reconfigurations and unnecessary expenditures of
     man-hours, or to replace a printed tail number when that aircraft will not be mission
     capable in time to accomplish the flight. Every effort is made to make the aircraft
     interchanges at the daily maintenance production meeting the day prior to the aircraft
     scheduled flight and entered on the AF Form 2407. All interchanges made at the daily
     production meeting are entered on an AF Form 2407 for audit and analysis purposes.
     Interchanges between aircraft on the flying schedule, including FCF/OCF flown, will not
     be recorded as deviations. Interchange procedures do not apply to aircraft not on the
     flying schedule. Interchanges include the following:
        3.3.2.7.1. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers with printed spare aircraft.
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                     13


          3.3.2.7.2. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to different printed line numbers
          (tail number swap).
          3.3.2.7.3. Changing aircraft not on the printed schedule that have flown that day,
          with aircraft on the printed schedule.
          3.3.2.7.4. Interchanges may be made up to the crew ready time. The MOC must be
          notified of all interchanges for proper coordination with affected work centers. Once
          crew ready time has passed, normal deviation recording will apply. Interchanges
          made after the daily maintenance meeting and prior to the first crew-ready time
          require coordination for support from agencies outside the flying and maintenance
          squadron. Record all interchanges in the MIS. Do not count Interchanges/Tail
          Number Swaps as deviations when computing TSE.
   3.3.3. Air Deviations. Air deviations are events occurring after takeoff. They are recorded
   in the MIS, but are not included in total scheduling effectiveness calculations. Air deviations
   fall into the following categories:
       3.3.3.1. Air Abort (AA). An aircraft/sortie that cannot complete its primary or alternate
       mission for any reason. Air aborts are considered a sortie flown when reporting total
       sorties flown. Air aborts will be recorded against the agency or condition that caused the
       aborted mission. An air abort will not be recorded when malfunctions occur during the
       "Before Takeoff Checklist" portion of helicopter sorties. Air aborts caused by specific
       test mission will not be counted in abort rate computations.
NOTE: Effective sortie decisions will be made by operations.
       3.3.3.2. Air Abort, IFE (AI). An air aborted aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in
       an in-flight emergency declared by the aircrew.
       3.3.3.3. IFE (FE). An aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an in-flight emergency
       declared by the aircrew after the mission is accomplished.
       3.3.3.4. Late Landing (LL). An aircraft/sortie landing more than 15 minutes after the
       scheduled landing time. If the sortie originated on time, record any subsequent late
       takeoff or cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended
       sortie did not originate on time, record any subsequent sortie deviation against the agency
       that caused the original delay. Late landings are not included in TSE calculations.
       3.3.3.5. Early Landing (EL). An early landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 30
       minutes before the scheduled landing time. Early Landing deviations are not used when
       computing TSE.
3.4. Deviation Causes. Deviations will be assigned a primary cause. The WG/CC will resolve
questions concerning assigning deviations between maintenance and operations. The OS/CC,
AMXS/CC, and LRS/ CC will resolve questions concerning deviations involving supply and
POL. Deviations will be assigned one of the following causes:
   3.4.1. Maintenance (MT). Deviations resulting from aircraft discrepancies, unscheduled
   maintenance, or for actions taken for maintenance consideration. NOTE: Maintenance-
   related ground aborts will use one of the ―GAx‖ cause codes (See Para 6.2.4).
 14                                                            AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012


   3.4.2. Operations (OP). Deviations resulting from operations/aircrew actions, mission
   changes causing an early/late takeoff, or cancellation including substitution/aircrew illness,
   and over-stressing the aircraft. OP are also deviations resulting from unit controlled
   operations factors including those caused by mission/load planning, life support, intelligence,
   base operations, and passengers.
   3.4.3. Project/Test Agency (PJ). Deviations to flight that result from rescheduling,
   reconfiguration, test item malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment
   undergoing tests or evaluations associated with Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E).
   Development Testing and Evaluation (DT&E), or Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation
   (IOT&E).
   3.4.4. Supply (SU). Deviations resulting from a Partially Mission Capable Supply (PMCS)
   or Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) condition or for late Supply or Petroleum Oil
   Lubricant (POL) delivery. Contract Logistics Support (CLS) items are included. In
   accordance with local MOAs/operating instructions. NOTE: The actual time required for
   installation will be considered.
   3.4.5. Higher Headquarters (HHQ). Deviations resulting from a higher headquarters
   tasking including closing of low level routes/ranges or external customer driven mission
   change. When an aircraft that was scheduled for a higher headquarters directed off-base
   mission is replaced by a spare refer to paragraphs 3.3.2.6. and 3.3.2.7. for unit options.
   3.4.6. Weather (WX). Deviations for aircraft which takeoff early, late, abort, or are added
   or canceled due to weather conditions. For example, if an aircraft taxied to the end of
   runway and the wing commander cancels all flying due to weather, the aircraft is a weather
   abort. Sorties/Aircraft cancelled prior to crew show are weather cancels.
   3.4.7. Sympathy (SY). Deviations occurring when a event of two or more aircraft, under
   the command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are canceled, aborted, or late due to a
   cancellation, abort, or delay of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Events,
   which are to replace sympathy aborts or cancellations on the same day, will be recorded as
   sympathy additions.         Events lost caused by the aircraft’s scheduled mated
   tanker/receiver/mission event will be recorded as sympathy. Examples of mission events are:
   loss of release times, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) support, Minimum
   Interval Take Off (MITO) causing takeoff delay or cancellation, or for another unit’s or
   command’s support should be coded as sympathy deviations.
NOTE: Deviations caused by aircraft/missions earlier scheduled lines will be assigned to the
cause of the earlier deviation, not sympathy (SY).
   3.4.8. Air Traffic Control (AT). Deviations resulting from air traffic control problems (for
   example, flight clearance delays, tower communication failure, conflicting air traffic, runway
   change, or runway closure).
   3.4.9. Contractor Support (CS). A deviation resulting from a test or system contractor not
   being able to support the mission in accordance with the requirements of the contract.
   3.4.10. Range Availability (RN). A deviation resulting from the Range not being available.
   3.4.11. Other (OT). Deviations resulting from unusual circumstances not covered by other
   causes listed. OT may include:
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                        15


       3.4.11.1. Unusual circumstances (e.g.., bird strikes, damage during air refueling,
       unscheduled exercises) may use this code.
       3.4.11.2. Equipment, non-AFMC. Deviations caused by National Airborne Operations
       Center NAOC) or Air Intelligence Agency (AIA), and other non-AFMC support and
       equipment.
       3.4.11.3. When an aircraft is off station and cannot return for its scheduled
       sortie/mission, a deviation will be recorded for the reasons the aircraft was unable to
       return. The reasons will be specific (maintenance, operations, weather, etc.). A printed
       spare aircraft may be used for any sorties scheduled for the aircraft that did not return.
       3.4.11.4. Ferry Sorties. Ferry sortie requirement too late for inclusion in the flying
       schedule will be documented as a new line for the day and “flown as scheduled”.
       3.4.11.5. Hot Spare Aircraft. Properly configured aerospace vehicle that is listed on the
       flying schedule as a spare with a specific takeoff time and not utilized. If not used will be
       recorded as a cancel other.
       3.4.11.6. Airborne Instrumentation.
       3.4.11.7. Laboratories.
   3.4.12. Exercise, Higher Headquarters (EXH). Deviations resulting from higher
   headquarters directed exercises, including alarm/force protection conditions. Deviations in
   this category will not be included in TSE calculations.
   3.4.13. Exercise, Local (EXL). Deviations resulting from wing/unit directed exercises,
   including alarm/force protection conditions. Deviations in this category will not be included
   in TSE calculations.
   3.4.14. Special Instrumentation (SI). Deviations that directly result from issues with SI
   support.
3.5. Rules for Reporting Schedule Deviations. The unit is responsible for documenting
deviations to the weekly flying schedule and determining the cause for each deviation.
Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate agency before being assigned to a specific
category. The operations representative and AMU/AMXS MS will monitor deviations to make
sure they meet the criteria in this instruction. When disparities exist, they will be referred to the
OG and MXG CCs or designated representative for resolution. Schedule deviations that result
from a sequence of events will be assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary
cause will be decided upon by all parties involved to arrive at a unit position.
3.6. Scheduling Exceptions.
   3.6.1. Adverse Weather. Units/flying squadron(s) may add sorties to the flying schedule to
   make up for weather losses. Sorties will only be added to the schedule when the planned
   weather attrition for the month has been exceeded for that month. The number of sorties
   added will not exceed the difference between the planned weather attrition and actual
   weather losses. Weather attrition will be computed by the MMA Section. (Example:
   Planned weather attrition for the month equals 30 sorties. On the 20th of the month 40
   sorties are lost. Ten non-chargeable sorties may be added. The maintenance schedule and
 16                                                         AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012


   the ability of maintenance to support the additional requirements must be carefully
   considered before adding sorties in accordance with paragraph 2.7.2.
   3.6.2. Unscheduled Tasking. When a unit is tasked with an unscheduled higher
   headquarters tasking or self-initiated tasking (mobility exercises or weather evacuations), or
   other services tasking which significantly impacts the flying schedule, the printed schedule
   may be revised or deleted from the MIS by AMU PS&D and replaced with a new schedule
   without recording deviations. For weather evacuations, the schedule will be cancelled in the
   MIS, not deleted, so the data is available for historical attrition.
NOTE: Local unscheduled tasking will not be used solely to recoup sortie losses.
       3.6.2.1. If the schedule is revised or canceled and reprinted, the following procedures
       will be used:
          3.6.2.1.1. Follow normal deviation reporting procedures once the revised/reprinted
          schedule is finalized. The revised schedule will be finalized a minimum of 2 hours
          before the first scheduled launch.
          3.6.2.1.2. Once the tasking terminates, the original schedule may be used or it may
          be revised or reprinted for the tasking period, as required. Normal deviation reporting
          is to be used once the revised or reprinted schedule is finalized.
          3.6.2.1.3. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed after a takeoff
          time is established to a tasking by higher headquarters or other services.
3.7. Utilization Reporting. All aircraft flying hours are required to be reported in REMIS in
accordance with AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting. This
requirement is not waived for contractor-maintained aircraft.
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                 17

                  MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a means to measure maintenance management
Effectiveness, reflected by how well the maintenance schedule is carried out. Maintenance
efforts should be directed toward the timely accomplishment of all scheduled maintenance
actions. The AFMC Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE) goal is 95%.
4.2. Computations.
   4.2.1. Scheduled maintenance events and respective weighted factor points in Table 4.1 are
   used to compute the MSE rate. Credit is received for actions completed on, or prior to, the
   scheduled date as printed in the weekly schedule. The MIS database and the published
   schedule will be used to determine whether or not the maintenance actions were completed
   on-time. EXCEPTION: Phase/PE and ISO inspection, and all maintenance requiring more
   than 24 work hours to complete will be measured against the scheduled start time/date.
   4.2.2. The MXG/CC may select additional areas (such as AGE, AIS, AME, etc.) for local
   scheduling effectiveness tracking. The unit will establish standards for these programs and
   develop a computation table in the format of Table 4.1 This data will not be included in
   aircraft maintenance scheduling effectiveness when reported to higher headquarters.
   4.2.3. MOF PS&D will record maintenance scheduling deviations and forward the
   computations to MOF maintenance analysis weekly for publications in the monthly
   maintenance summary.
   4.2.4. When a unit is tasked with a test acceleration, quick reaction test, unscheduled
   tasking, unannounced exercise/real world contingency, or higher headquarters exercise that
   significantly impacts the printed weekly maintenance schedule, the plan may be revised or
   reprinted without incurring deviations. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be
   followed once the revised or reprinted plan is finalized. The unaccomplished portion of the
   maintenance schedule that was revised will not be included in the scheduling effectiveness
   formula.
   4.2.5. Establish local written procedures to ensure coordination of changed/cancelled/added
   scheduled maintenance.
   4.2.6. Maintenance Scheduling Deviation Categories.

                                            Chapter 5

                                 TDY/DEPLOYED SORTIES

5.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes rules and procedures used in planning, executing,
evaluating, and reporting of unit flying and maintenance schedules at deployed/TDY locations
where unit maintenance is provided. Sorties flown at deployed/TDY locations where no parent
unit maintenance is provided are considered off-station sorties. If parent unit support is
deployed, this is considered the same as home station support and normal deviation reporting
applies. Limited launch support is not considered parent unit maintenance.
5.2. General. Normal deviation reporting applies to deployed operations except as noted in this
chapter. Data from deployed operations will be transmitted or forwarded back to home station.
5.3. Scheduling. In addition to the procedures established at home station for scheduling and
reporting, deployed units will use the following procedures when developing a flying schedule
and reporting deviations:
   5.3.1. Separate block(s) of sortie sequence numbers will be assigned for deployment/TDY
   location(s).
   5.3.2. Additions and cancellations at deployed/TDY locations, which are required to
   accomplish specific test and aircrew training requirements and make optimum use of
   available range time, are considered flown as scheduled. This does not relieve operations
   and maintenance from developing a viable and realistic flying schedule at the deployed
   location. The primary purpose of this flexibility is to allow the unit to make up non-effective
   sorties to ensure accomplishment of the training plan. Procedures for changing the flying
   schedule in Chapter 2 apply to deployment/TDY location flying and maintenance schedules.
   Additions and cancellations caused by ineffective planning are recorded.
   5.3.3. Sorties scheduled at other than home station are not required to be input into the home
   station’s operations scheduling system to be counted as scheduled sorties. Once tail numbers
   are plugged in at the daily meeting; this becomes the ―firm schedule‖ and deviations are
   reported from that point on.
5.4. Deployed/TDY Daily Activity Report. Required information for deployed/TDY AFMC
units will be transmitted to home station IAW applicable unit deployment/TDY plans.
5.5. Off-Station Sorties. Those sorties flown from other than home station and parent unit
maintenance are not provided (e.g., cross-country sorties). When an aircraft is off-station and
cannot return to home station for its scheduled sortie, a deviation will be recorded for the reason
the aircraft was unable to return. The reasons will be specific, i.e., maintenance, operations,
weather, etc.
NOTE: If the off-station aircraft can fly its scheduled mission from its location, no deviation is
recorded
 20                                                                  AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012



                                                Chapter 6

                         SCHEDULING REPORTING PROCEDURES

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides instructions on flying scheduling reporting procedures.
The flying schedule must be loaded into the MIS to track scheduling and deviation data. Once
loaded, the mission schedule or proposed maintenance plan background programs will provide
base-level retrieval of flying and maintenance schedule information, and will complete higher
headquarters reporting of aircraft utilization.
6.2. Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. The MXG/CC will ensure procedures are established to verify the accuracy of all
   scheduling and deviation data.
   6.2.2. The OG and MXG CCs or their designated group representative will publish the flying
   schedule IAW Chapter 2 of this publication on AF Forms 2400 series or computer generated
   forms. Units will load changes to the flying schedule into the MIS by 1600L one workday
   prior to date of execution.
   6.2.3. The Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will review the previous day’s activity
   reports to ensure accurate deviation accounting and reporting. The MOC will record
   additions, cancellations before crew show, interchanges, and the use of spare aircraft as
   deviations occur. The debrief section will record, late and early takeoffs and landing aborts,
   and in-flight emergency incidents during the automated debriefing process. The MOC will
   coordinate with the squadron/AMU on all changes and deviations to the flying schedule to
   assist in determining correct debriefing status codes. The MOC will provide sortie sequence
   numbers and sortie numbers to the squadron/AMU for all additions and cross-country sorties.
   Sortie numbers assigned to a specific tail number must be in sequential order (for example
   sortie number 101 must be used on a specific tail number before sortie number 102). Unique
   sortie sequence numbers will be developed for deployed sorties.
   6.2.4. Cause Code. Enter one of the following codes to indicate the reason for a deviation
   or the agency, which caused a deviation.

                                           Chapter 7

                                         ATTRITION

7.1. Attrition. Attrition factors represent historical percentage of scheduled sorties lost to
causes outside unit control. Maintenance and operations schedulers add attrition sorties to
monthly contracts to ensure mission goals are met. Operations and maintenance personnel must
ensure the contract includes flexibility to accept attrition requirements during acquisition
planning. Units may make a conscious decision, with MXG/CC approval, to use different
attrition factors from statistical attrition rates calculated by MMA.
   7.1.1. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls, they are additive to the
   contract to ensure mission goals are met. The monthly flying and maintenance plan will
   clearly identify attrition sorties for management purposes. If attrition is less or more than
   planned, adjustments to the weekly flying and maintenance schedule will be made to prevent
   over-extending maintenance or exceeding the unit’s contract. A sortie lost will normally be
   flown in the same month the loss occurred. If at the end of a quarter combined losses exceed
   attrition figures, the OG and MXG CCs will negotiate a resolution to the shortfall.
   7.1.2. The factors used to compute attrition will be MXx, OPx, SUx, WXx, ATx, SYx, OTx,
   EXH, EXL, and HQx sortie losses. Attrition factors are used to compensate for non-unit
   controlled factors. Spares are used to compensate for unit controlled factors. Attrition and
   spare factors will be computed for and applied to each flying squadron/AMU. Monthly
   statistical attrition anomalies should be identified, documented and factored out of attrition
   calculations if necessary. MMA will compute attrition factors monthly for each OS/AMU
   and provide the results to MOF PS&D for dissemination to the OS and AMU PS&D
   schedulers. During the annual first look, MMA will provide attrition factors by month for
   the entire next fiscal year.
NOTE: Attrition and spare factors need not be developed for test and evaluation (CB)
possession identifier coded aircraft.
7.2. Attrition Factor Application.
   7.2.1. Attrition computation is based on unit historical data from previous similar flying
   months. For example, when computing attrition for Jan 12, use historical data for Jan 11, Jan
   10, Jan 09, Jan 08, Jan 07, etc. Use as much historical data as required ensuring seasonal
   variations are considered to determine a basis for attrition. When computing attrition, use the
   total sorties lost in a particular category. Do not use the difference between the sorties lost
   and those sorties added to make up for the losses. The formula for computing the attrition
   factor is Historical Sorties Lost divided by Historical Sorties Scheduled.

Sortie Losses attrition factor               0.09
WX Sortie Losses                             0.03
Total attrition factor                       0.12
Overall attrition factor is                  0.12 or 12 %
   7.2.2. Sample Application of Total Attrition Factor:
Sorties Required 1,000 Subtract attrition factor from 1 (1-.12)=0.88

Divide 1,000 by 0.88 Required sorties to schedule 1,136.36 , round up to 1,137.0

Based on historical attrition of 12%, the unit can expect to lose 137 sorties to meet the required
1,000 sorties.

Continuation Sortie—A scheduled sortie containing scheduled operation stops. When a crew
completes their training/mission and performs an operation stop, the engines/APU remains
running and maintenance does not service the aircraft. The aircraft can subsequently be
launched without the participation of maintenance personnel, except for a fire/safety observer.
The prime purpose is to on/off load crew members. EXCEPTION: C-130 aircraft, engines may
be shut down to upload/download paratroopers/ passengers. NOTE: N/A to fighter and attack
aircraft.
Contract Logistics Support—Logistics support of DoD materiel performed under contract by
commercial organizations. Support provided may include materiel and facilities, as well as
additional services in the areas of supply and distribution, maintenance, training, software
support and rebuild/ overhaul.
Crew Ready—An aircraft that has been properly inspected, fueled, required weapons loaded,
necessary maintenance actions completed, the exceptional release signed off (for the first flight
of the day) and the tail number passed to operations. NOTE: Units will develop and publish
specific crew ready times for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the OG and MXG CCs.
Crew Show—The time that the aircrew arrives at the aircraft.
Deployed/TDY Sorties—Sorties launched away from home base or with parent-unit
maintenance provided. For the purpose of this instruction deployed/TDY sorties are considered
home station sorties.
Daily Maintenance Scheduling Meeting—Meeting required by AFI 21-101 AFMC Sup1 to
review the previous day’s accomplishments, verify aircraft and equipment utilization and
scheduled maintenance requirements for the current and next day, establish work priorities, and
coordinate schedule changes.
Deviation—A departure from the printed flying schedule.
Early Takeoff—Scheduled sorties launched more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff.
NOTE: Do not record early takeoff deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
Exercise—A unit or higher headquarters event designed to test or evaluate an organization’s
plans, procedures, and operational/maintenance capabilities
External Customer—Outside the control of the operational wing, a user of aircraft sorties that
dictates, either partially or wholly, flying schedule execution, e.g., Joint Airborne Air
Transportability Training (JA/ATT) users, Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) users or
channel mission users.
Ferry Sortie—Those sorties flown to transfer an aircraft to or from a maintenance facility or to a
new assignment, including intercommand, inter-unit transfers.
Flown as Scheduled Sortie—A sortie flown by a specific aircraft on the date and time indicated
on the printed flying schedule, and those aircraft that are defined as "flown as scheduled"
elsewhere in this instruction.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash -6 manual, to verify the airworthy condition of the aircraft.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from becoming
airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC), operations, HHQ,
AFMCI21-165 15 AUGUST 2012                                                                      29


weather, sympathy, other, etc… The difference between a ground abort and a cancellation is
after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel.
Higher Headquarters—A controlling agency normally above wing level.
Home Station Sortie—Sorties launched from the home base or deployed/TDY locations where
parent unit maintenance is provided.
Hot—Pit Turn—Refueling aircraft with engines running between sorties at a designated
location with approved equipment IAW T.O. 00-25-172. Hot pit refueling provides minimum
aircraft turnaround time and reduces fueling personnel and equipment support requirements.
In—Flight Emergency (IFE)—An airborne aircraft that encounters a situation or emergency
that results in an IFE being declared by the aircrew. (Not a deviation, but will be recorded IAW
Chapter 3).
Late Landing—Aircraft landing 15 minutes past its scheduled landing time. Does not apply to
continuation sorties. If the sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late takeoff or
cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not
originate on time, record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the
original delay. Late landings are not included in TSE calculations.
Late Takeoff—Scheduled sortie launched more than 30 minutes after scheduled takeoff time.
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness—A measurement used to determine what percent of the
scheduled maintenance actions were actually completed, or started in the event of events taking
more than 24 work hours to complete, as scheduled in the weekly schedule.
Off—Station Sorties—Sorties flown away from home base (cross-country) and parent unit
maintenance is not provided. This includes aircraft that divert or break off-station and parent
unit maintenance is sent to repair and launch the aircraft. NOTE: Off-station sorties are
considered flown as scheduled. Deviations incurred are not used in scheduling effectiveness or
abort rate computations.
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft that has had extended
downtime or extensive maintenance which does not require an FCF.
Project/Test Agency—--Deviations to flight that result from rescheduling, reconfiguration, test
item malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment undergoing tests or
evaluations associated with Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E).
Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number confirmed on the flying
schedule. FCF and OCF are excluded.
Scheduled Maintenance Action—A maintenance requirement printed in the weekly schedule.
Sortie— An aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on takeoff or takes
off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft
returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are stopped, or
the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change is made in
the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency training,
on missions during which some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the original
takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew sortie.

Spare Aircraft—An aircraft specifically designated on the flying schedule to replace aircraft
that cannot fly its sortie. Spares can include aircraft that have been canceled, aborted, flown an
earlier sortie, or an aircraft that has been released after FCF/OCF. Do not count "Printed Spares"
used as deviations when computing TSE.
Tail swap— Tail number swaps made to the flying schedule IAW paragraph 2.7. Includes
swaps between printed aircraft on the same day, between printed aircraft and printed spare
aircraft on the same day (before crew-ready only), or between printed aircraft and aircraft that
have previously flown that day (cross country return, OCF, FCF, etc.).
Total Scheduling Effectiveness—Rate used to determine how well the flying schedule was
executed.
Unscheduled Tasking—Tasking in which initial notification occurs after publication of the
schedule.

                   SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS COMPUTATION

A2.1. Test Schedule Effectiveness (TSE) Rate. Similar to the Flying Schedule Effectiveness
for the CAF, TSE is a leading indicator and is a measure of how well the unit planned and
executed the weekly flying and ground test event schedule. TSE is derived by comparing each
day’s deviations to the flying and ground test schedule. Deviations that decrease the TSE from
100 percent include: scheduled sorties/ground test events not accomplished because of
maintenance, supply, operations, weather, HHQ, air traffic control, sympathy, or other reasons;
scheduled events that actually start more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled start time; scheduled
events that begin more than 30 minutes after their scheduled start time and events that are added
to the schedule. Disruptions to the flying or ground test schedule, or constant configuration
changes to test assets can cause turmoil on the flightline, send a ripple effect throughout other

A2.2. Maintenance Deviation Rate (MX Dev). Although all deviations to the test schedule are
counted in the TSE calculation, the Maintenance Deviation Rate represents deviations to the
flying/ground test schedule that are, for the most part, are within the maintenance community’s
control. All maintenance late take offs, ground aborts, cancellations, and maintenance additions
are counted towards the rate. Although all deviations from the published schedule can cause
turmoil on the flightline, maintenance supervision should focus on eliminating or minimizing
schedule deviations due to maintenance.
