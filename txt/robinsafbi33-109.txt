alternate means of obtaining support. This instruction applies to all units and/or personnel on
Robins AFB. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command Units. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF

1. Responsibilities:
     1.1. The 78 ABW/SCOV (Wireless and Radio Communications work center) will:
        1.1.1. Provide portable PA equipment to support OFFICIAL functions only.
        1.1.2. Determine supportability of PA requests based on current mission, manning
        requirements, and equipment availability. The primary mission of 78 ABW/SCOV is to
        provide personal wireless and radio communications to base personnel. This mission will
        have priority over all PA support.
        1.1.3. Contact the requestor within 48 hours of receipt of official PA request.
        1.1.4. Have all requested equipment set up and fully operational at least 1 hour before
        scheduled event start time unless otherwise coordinated with event point of contact.
     1.2. 78 ABW/SC is the final authority to determine the level of support given when there is a
     conflict between two different PA setups at the same time.
     1.3. 78 ABW/SCOV, 78 ABW/SCO, or 78 ABW/SC may cancel PA setups or remove PA
     equipment from operation if personnel or equipment safety is threatened (i.e., during
     inclement weather).
     1.4. Facility managers are solely responsible for providing fixed PA equipment in facilities
     used by base personnel. Use of these systems will be coordinated through the facility
     managers. These facilities include, but are not limited to, Heritage Club and Horizon Club.
     1.5. 78 ABW/SCOV can provide training to personnel responsible for fixed PA systems
     such as the Base Theater. Call 468-0066 to arrange date and time for training.
     1.6. Organizations requesting PA support will:
        1.6.1. Submit an official request through using the RAFB secure home page
        https://wwwmil.robins.af.mil/ or the “Blue Star” on their desktop. Once at the site,
        select the “Requesting Public Address Support” icon near the bottom of the page. The
        form must be filled out and submitted no later than 7 calendar days before the event (to
        include any applicable practice event). In the event the “Blue Star” cannot be accessed,
        submit the request utilizing the 78 ABW/SCOIW Public Address organizational
        mailboxes. 78 ABW/SCOV personnel will contact the customer within 2 business days of
        receipt. If contact is not made, the customer may call 468-0066 to inquire about the
        status.
        1.6.2. Provide personnel to pick-up and operate audio equipment for events not
        supported by 78 ABW/SCOV personnel.
        1.6.3. Provide 78 ABW/SCOV support personnel a written sequence of events (script),
        to include highlighted music cues, at least 24 hours before the event start time, if
        supported by SCOV.
        1.6.4. Immediately notify 78 ABW/SCOV of any changes or cancellations.
2. Procedures:
     2.1. Obtaining fixed PA equipment. Fixed PA systems installation should be obtained
     through the Base Contracting Office. Permanently installed PA systems are justified and
ROBINSAFBI33-109 17 OCTOBER 2012                                                              3


  procured by submitting an Information Technology Service Manager (ITSM) ticket via Unit
  Personal Wireless Communications Systems (PWCS) Manager. 78 ABW/SCOV may be
  used as a technical consultant for any PA system acquisition.
  2.2. Obtaining organizationally supported portable PA system support:
     2.2.1. Requesting units must submit a request through the “Blue Star” as outlined in
     paragraph 1.6.1 Equipment is scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.
     2.2.2. PA equipment can be picked up at building 214, 468-0066, and the day before the
     event and must be returned not later than 0800 the morning after the event. If the
     equipment is to be used over a weekend or holiday, the requestor must pick up the
     equipment the last duty day before the event and return it the first duty day (morning)
     following the event. All equipment must be picked up before 1500 and returned not later
     than 0800 the next duty day. No-show letters will be sent to unit commanders (CCs) for
     equipment not returned on time.
     2.2.3. All PA equipment is signed for on an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
     Equipment must be returned in the condition it was issued. Coil and tape or tie cables to
     prevent tangling. Identify broken parts, problems, or discrepancies when the equipment is
     returned. The customer is responsible for any lost or damaged equipment. Training will
     be given at the time of pickup to ensure the customer can operate the equipment.
  2.3. Obtaining 78 ABW/SCOV portable PA system support:
     2.3.1. Portable PA system support may be requested for any official function as outlined
     in Attachment 1. Requesting units must submit a “Blue Star” Request as outlined in
     paragraph 1.6.1
     2.3.2. Practices/rehearsals will be supported on a case-by-case basis. Supported practices
     will be kept to a minimum and be entrusted to the unit if at all possible. Practices can
     also be supported by a sign-out portable PA system, if available. If the requesting unit is
     having a practice before the day of the event, 78 ABW/SCOV will be given an
     opportunity to assemble the PA system before the practice and may leave the equipment
     in place until the official event concludes. 78 ABW/SCOV will provide the requesting
     unit with an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, and training on how to control the
     system's on/off and volume functions. If this is not possible, a sign-out portable PA
     system will be offered, if available, for the practice event.
  2.4. Call 468-0066 for help in scheduling/requesting PA support. Short-notice support,
  within 3 duty days before the day of the event, must be requested in writing with the
  requestor’s unit CC and the 78 ABW/SCO endorsements. The letter must state why the 10-
  calendar day advanced notice was not given. Base e-mail is an allowable substitute for the
  traditional letter. The 10-calendar day window is to provide adequate time for scheduling,
  and also to provide the requesting unit time to locate an alternate source in the event a
  request is denied or cannot be satisfied.
  2.5. Approval or disapproval of support will be determined at the time the request is
  received. If approved, the POC will be contacted for confirmation and for any additional
  information        that may be required. If disapproved, the POC will be contacted with
  possible alternative solutions.

     2.6. 78 ABW/SCOV personnel will normally stay with the equipment to ensure continuous
     operation unless precluded by higher priority mission requirements or lack of manpower
     resources. In the event a 78 ABW/SCOV technician cannot stay, or is not required to stay
     with the system, the PA system user will be required to sign an AF Form 1297, Temporary
     Issue Receipt, for the equipment. The 78 ABW/SCOV technician(s) will be utilized to run
     official ceremonial music only (i.e., National Anthem, Air Force Song, Ruffles and
     Flourishes, etc.). The requesting organization wishing to use music that does not fall within
     that category (i.e., pop, jazz, rap, etc.) will need to provide an individual to start/stop the
     music at appropriate times.
     2.7. All agencies (i.e., Public Affairs, and local media) requesting interface with the 78
     ABW/SCOV PA system will have their device connected and tested no later than 1 hour
         before the start of any event. Should this interfacing equipment interfere with the 78
     ABW/SCOV PA system, the 78 ABW/SCOV technicians is authorized to disconnect the
     equipment and deny the interface.
     2.8. 78 ABW/SCOV is not responsible for the installation/maintenance of fixed systems or
     for the PA support of OFFICIAL (below Wing level) or UNOFFICIAL functions. AFI 65-
     106 Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Non-appropriated
     Fund Instrumentalities, prohibits an appropriated funds maintenance resource from working
     on public address systems in non-appropriated funds facilities (i.e., Officers' Club, Enlisted
         Club, Recreation Center, Gymnasium, Base Theater, etc.).
