                                 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Section 1A—Program Applicability and Objectives

1.1. Purpose:
     1.1.1. This Instruction provides specific guidance for operations involving RAM covered by
     the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. § 2011 et seq., commonly termed Section 91(b).
     RAM under the 91(b) designation within the scope of this Instruction are: current nuclear
     weapons material, legacy nuclear weapons maintenance wastes, residuals from nuclear
     weapons accidents, residuals from aircraft washdown operations from atmospheric testing of
     nuclear weapons, and residuals from nuclear reactor operations.
     1.1.2. This Instruction does not apply to RAM covered under AFI 40-201, Managing
     Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force, or 91(b) RAM covered under AFI 91-110,
     Nuclear Safety Review and Launch Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive
     Material and Nuclear Systems. Note: this Instruction references AFI 40-201 as some
     processes from that Instruction may be applicable to INRAD safety.
1.2. Program Applicability:
     1.2.1. Implementation of the INRAD safety program and the ALARA concept must consider
     weapons safety, security, reliability, and operational mission requirements. The ALARA
     concept is further defined and explained in AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection. Note:
     most Technical Order (T.O.) procedures have inherent ALARA principles that reduce the
     potential for exposure.
        1.2.1.1. Units with a contingency or limited nuclear mission must comply with the
        ALARA concept.
        1.2.1.2. Host installations that support nuclear-capable tenants or geographically
        separated units (GSUs) must comply with this Instruction.
        1.2.1.3. Use the following as primary methods to achieve ALARA:
            1.2.1.3.1. Minimize the time individuals spend in the vicinity of weapon systems.
            1.2.1.3.2. Maximize distance between the source(s) of ionizing radiation and working
            area.
            1.2.1.3.3. Use shielding techniques, when appropriate.
            1.2.1.3.4. Implement a combination of these actions.
     1.2.2. Units that generate radioactive waste and/or mixed (i.e., chemical and radioactive)
     waste from nuclear weapons maintenance procedures must comply with this Instruction.
     1.2.3. CONUS installations that possess residual 91(b) RAM-contaminated buildings, burial
     sites, etc. from past (legacy) nuclear weapons accidents, incidents and maintenance, or
     dismantled/decommissioned 91(b) nuclear reactors (still under AF possession), or other
     residual 91(b) RAM must comply with this Instruction.

1.3. Program Objectives:
   1.3.1. Limit the risk of radiation-induced effects to a reasonable level in relation to the
   requirements of the USAF mission, other societal or military risks, benefits gained and
   economic factors.
   1.3.2. Manage 91(b) RAM associated with current nuclear weapons maintenance operations
   and residual 91(b) RAM from CONUS legacy maintenance, nuclear weapon
   accident/incidents, and AF 91(b) reactors.
