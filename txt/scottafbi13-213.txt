          OPR for AO within 30 calendar days.
    1.2.3. Unit Commanders.
       1.2.3.1. Appoints a primary and alternate unit ADPM in writing (Attachment 8) to
       manage training and testing requirements of unit personnel who are required to operate a
       vehicle on SAFB airfield. Forward a copy of the appointment letter to the wing ADPM.
          1.2.3.1.1. Unit ADPMs must be at least a SSgt/7-level or civilian equivalent or
          waived by the group commander due to manning constraints.
       1.2.3.2. Ensures a replacement unit ADPM is appointed in writing and trained by the
       wing ADPM at least 30 days prior to releasing the current unit ADPM.
       1.2.3.3. Delegates authority to the unit ADPM to ensure all personnel required to drive
       on the airfield are trained and certified IAW this ADI.
       1.2.3.4. Limits the number of personnel authorized to drive on the airfield to the absolute
       minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.

     civilian equivalent acts as the wing ADPM and has the approval authority for requests to
     operate government and privately owned vehicles (POV) on SAFB’s airfield. The
     preferred grade of the wing ADPM is a MSgt/E-7 or civilian equivalent.
        1.2.4.1.1. Develop an ADI to be used by all ADPMs as part of their ADP. The ADI
        must be approved by AMC OPR for AO prior to final publication and

                                           Chapter 2

                      VEHICLE PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

2.1. Vehicle Operations on SAFB Airfield.
   2.1.1. Personnel driving on the airfield must be in possession of an AF Form 1199, Air
   Force Entry Control Card, with open area “4” and/or “5” for the 375 AMW or “9” for the
   126 ARW ramp and “CC” for the CMA, receive training IAW Chapter 3 and have an AF
   Form 483 for airfield driving, or have an escort prior to entry onto the airfield. The
   sponsoring agency (e.g., fire department, contracting, civil engineering, etc.) will provide an
   airfield-qualified escort for personnel working on the airfield. Personnel acting as an escort
   must be authorized/certified to drive on the airfield.
   2.1.2. Units sponsoring TDY personnel or non-base assigned contractors are responsible for
   providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF Form 483 for airfield driving.
   2.1.3. Responsibility for operation of a vehicle on the airfield rests with the operator. The
   vehicle operator is responsible for ensuring occupants have seat belts fastened when the
   vehicle is in motion.
   2.1.4. Vehicles authorized on the airfield must enter at the Heritage Drive Entry Control
   Point (ECP) (Attachment 2), unless otherwise coordinated with the 375 SFS.
   2.1.5. POV/Government Owned Vehicle (GOV) operators on a DOD installation will not
   use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked on the airfield. Cell phone use shall be for
   official/business use only. The wearing of other portable headphones, earphones, or other
   listening devices (except for hands free cellular devices) while operating a motor vehicle is
   prohibited. Use of approved devices may impair driving and may prevent recognition of
   emergency signals, alarms or radio calls.
   2.1.6. Vehicles using the flightline access road South of Hangar 1 must stop and give way to
   aircraft taxing out of parking from the South Ramp in order to provide adequate wingtip
   clearance. This restriction impacts any aircraft with a wingspan greater than 75’ or larger
   (any fighter and aircraft larger than a C-21).
2.2. Procedures and Standards for Operating a Vehicle in the CMA.
   2.2.1. CMA defined:
      2.2.1.1. The CMA on the military side of the airfield west of Silver Creek extends 1000
      feet (ft) either side of RWY 14R/32L centerline and extends to the jogging path on the
      north end of the airfield and to the railroad tracks on the south end of the airfield.
      Exceptions are the golf course on the east side of the airfield, Hangar Road where it
      passes the fire department, on the west side of the airfield and 200 ft either side of
      Taxiway Golf from Taxiway Alpha to just east of Foxtrot Ramp (Attachment 2).
      2.2.1.2. The CMA on the civil side of the airfield east of Silver Creek extends 650 ft
      either side of RWY 14L/32R centerline and extends just past the Instrument Landing
      System (ILS) Localizer on the north end of the airfield and 1000 ft off the south end of
      the threshold to RWY 32R.
 14                                                 SCOTTAFBI13-213 9 DECEMBER 2013


      2.2.1.3. All taxiways falling into the area described above are inside the CMA.
      2.2.1.4. MAA personnel operating on the SAFB CMA must have a valid driver’s permit
      issued by the MAA Public Safety Office.
   2.2.2. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must possess two-way radio contact with the
   ATCT on the Tower Net to gain access to the CMA. No vehicle operator or pedestrian may
   enter the CMA without specific approval from Scott ATCT prior to entry and operators must
   maintain radio contact with the ATCT while in the CMA.
   2.2.3. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians must read back all ATC instructions verbatim.
   2.2.4. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency flashers
   when driving in the CMA. Vehicles operating on any other portion of the airfield will have a
   roof-mounted beacon or rotating amber light. If these are unavailable, flashing hazard lights
   are authorized. Note: Emergency response vehicle lights (red or blue) will not be operated
   while on the airfield unless required in performance of emergency response duties,
   preventing personnel from taking action under the assumption of an actual emergency.
   2.2.5. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
   mounted in the vehicle to communicate with Scott ATCT. A hand-held radio should only be
   used as a backup or when communication is required outside the vehicle. Operators shall
   conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
   2.2.6. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a distinct call sign
   (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.). Call signs are coordinated and approved
   (Attachment 9) by the wing ADPM to avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies
   using similar names (e.g., Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). Note: Do not
   use a call sign that is also a part of ATC phraseology such as―Taxi.
   2.2.7. Unconditional instructions (blanket approval) will not be issued when authorizing
   vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield inspection/check or other airfield
   operation. See Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, for
   additional information.
   2.2.8. CMA access is limited to vehicle operators/traffic performing mission essential duties
   and then only to an absolute minimum. Vehicle operators will use the most direct route
   when runway crossing is required.
2.3. Procedures for Proper Radio Terminology/Phraseology and Discipline.
   2.3.1. Two-way radio communication on the Tower Net is the primary way to communicate
   with the ATCT and is critical to flight safety. Ensure all ATCT instructions are heard and
   understood.
      2.3.1.1. If there is, any doubt about a transmission with the ATCT, do not proceed onto
      the CMA, and ask ATCT for clarification by saying “Say Again.”
   2.3.2. Correct use of radio phraseology is extremely important. Vehicle operators will be in
   radio contact with ATCT while operating in the CMA. Everyone must communicate in the
   same manner to avoid confusion. Correct language is short, direct, precise, and descriptive
   leaving no room for confusion or error. Do not use “10” codes, phrases like “10-4” and
   “Good Buddy.” This terminology is not professional and results in confusion, instead of “10-
SCOTTAFBI13-213 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 15


   4” say, “I copy” or “I understand.” Avoid using personal names such as “Kathy, Jim, Jones,
   or Smith”; there are too many people with the same or similar names. Only use approved
   call signs IAW Attachment 9.

Table 2.1. An example of a transmission with Scott ATCT is as follows:
 Airfield 3 -- (Initial contact) “Scott Tower, Airfield 3.”
 Tower -- (Establishment of ATCT contact.) “Airfield 3, Scott Tower.”
 Airfield 3 -- (Request to proceed. Always include location and destination.) “Scott Tower,
 Airfield 3 on Taxiway Golf request access/entry onto RWY 32 Left to conduct a runway check,
 estimated time on the runway is 15 minutes.”
 Tower -- (Tower gives instructions based on traffic and request.) “Airfield 3, proceed onto
 RWY 32 Left. Report when off.”
 Airfield 3 -- (Read back instruction verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
 correction if misinterpreted.). “Airfield 3 understands, proceeding onto RWY 32 Left. Will
 report when off.”
 Airfield 3 proceeds onto the runway and conducts the check.
 The following is an example of a typical conversation when exiting controlled area:
 Airfield 3 -- (Initial contact.) “Scott Tower, Airfield 3.”
 Tower -- (Establishment of ATCT contact.) “Airfield 3, Scott Tower.”
 Airfield 3 -- (Request to proceed. Always include location and destination.) “Scott Tower,
 Airfield 3 is off RWY 32 Left at Taxiway Echo, will remain off.”
 Tower -- (Tower gives instructions based on traffic and request.) “Airfield 3 Roger, remain off
 the runway.”
   2.3.3. The words “Clear” or “Clearance” will not be used by personnel operating vehicles on
   the airfield. Instead, state “off the runway” or “requesting access/entry onto the runway”
   when contacting the ATCT for permission on/off the runway.
   2.3.4. In the event of a radio failure or loss of communication with the ATCT while driving
   on a taxiway or runway, the ATCT will use the light gun signals below to communicate. A
   vehicle operator must immediately vacate the runway/CMA as quickly and safely as possible
   and contact the ATCT or AM by other means such as a cellular telephone to advise of the
   situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway/CMA, should turn
   the vehicle toward the ATCT and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the
   controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know and
   comply with the following light gun signals:

Table 2.2. Light Gun Signals.

Steady Green Light           Cleared to cross, -Proceed, -Go
Steady Red Light             STOP! Vehicle will not be moved
Flashing Red Light           Clear active taxiway/runway
Flashing White Light         Return to your starting point

Alternating Red / Green      Exercise extreme caution

2.4. Escorting Procedures.
   2.4.1. One individual may act as an escort for two or more vehicles who are together, or
   within 250 ft of each other. The escort vehicle is responsible for the group and will relay
   ATCT control instructions/communication for the group.
   2.4.2. Escorts will ensure personnel/equipment are clear of the runway and CMA, and
   contact ATCT upon leaving controlled areas.
2.5. All vehicles that operate on the airfield must contain AFVA 11-240 or FAA Form 5280-7,
Ground Vehicle Guide to Airport Signs & Markings, AFVA 13-222, and a SAFB airfield
diagram, permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor
on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for ready reference. Note: Diagrams
and decals are available at AMOPS, building 433. These may also be ordered from
http://afpubs.hq.af.mil/profile/userlogin.aspx for the AFVA 11-240 or FAA Form 5280-7 at
http://www.faa.gov/runwaysafety/order/order.cfm.
2.6. All airfield vehicle operators will know and comply with all airfield signs, markings,
and ATCT signals.
   2.6.1. Airfield Signs (Mandatory and Informational). Signs and markings are standard and
   meet all criteria required by the Air Force and FAA.
       2.6.1.1. Taxiway Location Signs. This sign has a black background (Figure 2.1 “G”)
       with a yellow inscription and yellow border. The inscription is the designation of the
       taxiway on which the aircraft or vehicle is located.
       2.6.1.2. Direction Signs. Direction signs have a yellow background with a black
       inscription (Figure 2.1 “A” & “APRON”). These signs identify the direction of an
       intersecting taxiway or Apron. Direction signs are normally located on the left prior to
       the intersection.

Figure 2.1. Location & Directional Signs.




       2.6.1.3. Mandatory Signs. Red Signs with white letters.
           2.6.1.3.1. Located adjacent to the runway hold position markings. These signs
           augment the markings on the pavement and are lit to help drivers identify the entrance

          to the runway environment at night and when the taxiway markings are covered (i.e.,
          snow).

Figure 2.2. Runway Hold Position Sign.




   2.6.2. Airfield Markings (runway, taxiway, apron/ramp instrument).
      2.6.2.1. Runway Markings are marked with retro-reflective white paint. Runway edge
      stripes are solid white lines running the length of the runway. A dashed white line
      extending down the center of the runway denotes runway centerline stripes.
      2.6.2.2. Taxiway Markings are marked with a solid yellow line denoting the taxiway
      centerline and solid double yellow lines denoting the edge of the taxiway.
      2.6.2.3. Hold Lines. Hold lines are necessary on all pavements that lead to a runway.
      They designate a boundary intended to protect the runway environment from incursions
      and prevent interference with signals transmitted by electronic navigational aids. There
      are two basic patterns for marking hold lines (VFR) and (INST).

Figure 2.3. INST Hold Line.




          2.6.2.3.1. Runway VFR hold position markings (Figures 2.4 and 2.5). Four parallel
          yellow stripes that extend across the entire width of the taxiway. The two lines
          closest to the runway are dashed and the other two lines are solid. These markings
          are found on taxiways and require ATCT approval prior to crossing/entering the
          runway or CMA boundary (Figure 2.6).

   2.6.3. Airfield lighting. SAFB airfield is illuminated by a variety of lights (ramp lighting,
   taxiway and runway (Figure 2.7). Two lights you will encounter while driving at night on
   the CMA are taxiway lights and High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL). Taxiway lights are
   used to outline the edges of taxiways during reduced periods of darkness and/or restricted
   visibility. They emit a blue color. HIRLs are used to outline the edges of the runways.
   HIRLs emit a white light or white and amber within the last 2000’ of each runway end and
   are evenly spaced the full length of the runway.

   2.8.3. Do not drive vehicles within 10 ft of a parked aircraft unless the vehicle is required for
   ground servicing. Use of a spotter and pre-positioned chocks are required within 10 ft of an
   aircraft. The delivery of coffee, meals, etc., does not qualify as aircraft ground servicing and
   will be operated IAW AFMAN 24-306_IP, Chapter 20, and applicable technical orders.
   2.8.4. Under no circumstance will a vehicle stop in front of or drive into the path of a
   moving aircraft with the exception of “guide” or “follow me” vehicles. No vehicles will be
   driven between an aircraft and the “follow me” vehicle.
   2.8.5. Vehicles transporting distinguished visitors may approach aircraft with the passenger
   side facing the aircraft, but not closer than 10 ft from the nearest point of the aircraft.
   2.8.6. Vehicles shall not travel behind any aircraft on SAFB without prior coordination with
   the aircraft crew chief or aircrew members. With minor exceptions (airfield inspections, road
   closures, etc.) this restriction applies whether or not the aircraft engines are running. SAFB
   ramp configuration does not provide adequate safe distance requirements for vehicles to
   travel behind aircraft with engines running.
      2.8.6.1. Use the flightline road to the maximum extent possible.
2.9. Parking and Chocking Requirements.
   2.9.1. Before exiting a vehicle, turn off the ignition, set the parking brake and put the vehicle
   in reverse gear (manual transmission), park (automatic transmission). Leave vehicle
   unlocked with the keys in the ignition when parked on the airfield.
   2.9.2. The parking brake is the primary safety item. Only use chock blocks as a secondary
   safety item in conjunction with the parking brake (i.e., parking on hills). Using chock blocks
   alone is not enough or effective. The parking brake must be set at all times when the vehicle
   is parked.
   2.9.3. Extreme caution must be used during reverse operations around aircraft. In these
   cases, place pre-positioned wheel chocks between the aircraft and the approaching vehicle to
   keep vehicles from striking the aircraft. Post guides as a required safety measure. Keep
   chocks in position until vehicles leave from within 10 foot (ft) safety distance
   2.9.4. Do not point vehicles directly toward an aircraft when parked on the airfield.
      2.9.4.1. All vehicles must approach parked aircraft with the vehicle operator’s side of the
      vehicle toward the aircraft.
   2.9.5. Chock, all powered vehicles and all equipment that does not have an integral braking
   system when parked within 25 ft of any aircraft and when left unattended on the airfield.
   2.9.6. Aircraft servicing support vehicles that require the vehicle engine to operate as the
   power source for auxiliary components may be left unattended while the engine is running.
   When the vehicle operators seat is not occupied; set the parking brake, place the transmission
   in neutral or park, and chock the rear wheels.
   2.9.7. Emergency vehicles that must remain in operation at the scene of an emergency may
   be parked with the engine running, the parking brake set, the transmission in neutral, or park
   and the rear wheels chocked when the vehicle operators seat is not occupied.
   2.9.8. Vehicle Parking Areas. Vehicles may park in one of the two designated areas only.
SCOTTAFBI13-213 9 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  21

   of the taxiway centerline without an AMC MAJCOM approved waiver.
   2.10.3. The lateral clearance distance from the edge of all ramps and aprons to a mobile
   obstacle is 50 ft from the wingtip of any aircraft. The lateral clearance from the 126ARW
   apron edge is 77.9 ft (1/2 wingspan +50). When operating off the edges of a ramp or apron
   do not park or operate a vehicle within 50 ft of a moving aircraft. To ensure separation from
   any aircraft in the Air Force inventory, vehicles should park a minimum of 125 ft from edge
   of pavement.
   2.10.4. The lateral clearance distance from the runway centerline is 1000 ft. This area is
   located within the CMA and radio contact with the ATCT must be established and
   maintained at all times. When operating within this area, do not park and leave a vehicle
   unattended.
2.11. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Control/Prevention.
   2.11.1. Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid
   driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g., dirt or grass). If driving on unimproved surfaces is
   required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning to paved surfaces.

      FOD has been removed from vehicle and tires.
      2.11.1.3. Exit the airfield via the shortest authorized route. If significant FOD exists on
      the flight line, exit the airfield via the shortest authorized route then follow procedures in
      paragraph 2.11.2.4
   2.11.2. At a minimum, a FOD check will consist of:
      2.11.2.1. Vehicles entering the airfield via the airfield ECP will pull over to the right to
      perform a thorough walk around of the vehicle. Vehicle operators will:
      2.11.2.2. Inspect the vehicle tires for loose stones, grass, and other potentially damaging
      FOD items, and then return to the vehicle and pull forward enough to check the rest of
      the tire that was in contact with the pavement. Remove all FOD and deposit in a suitable
      container for FOD disposal.

   2.28.1. Runway hold lines are necessary on all pavements leading to an active runway or
   helipad. These markings designate a boundary intended to protect the runway and helipad
   environment from incursions and prevent interference with signals transmitted by electronic
   navigational aids. On paved surfaces (taxiways, entry roads, etc.), yellow runway hold lines
   consisting of a double solid and double broken lines are painted across the pavement surface
   approximately 285 ft from the runway centerline. The double solid line is on the ramp side;
   the double broken line is on the runway side. A combination taxiway and runway
   identification sign is located adjacent to each runway hold line. A taxiway/runway
   identification sign for Golf taxiway and the West runway would appear on the left side of the
   taxiway, adjacent to the runway hold line. The sign would appear as: “G 14R/32L”. The
   letter “G” is yellow surrounded by a black background. The “14R/32L” portion has white
   letters on a red background.
   2.28.2. POFZ is located at the end of each runway. The dimensions are 800 ft (400 ft on
   each side of the runway centerline) and extend 200 ft from the end of the runway. POFZ is
   only in effect when visibility is less than 3/4 statute mile, ceiling of 250 ft or less and an
   aircraft on final approach within two miles of the runway threshold. The POFZ only applies
   when all three conditions exist.

         PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE (POV) AIRFIELD CONTROL CAPS

4.1. Procedures for Issuing POV pass (Control Caps).
   4.1.1. POVs on the airfield are highly discouraged and are restricted to an absolute
   minimum. No POVs are authorized to operate in the CMA.
   4.1.2. The 126 ARW does not authorize POVs on their ramp and therefore will not issue
   POV caps. In the event the 126 ARW would need to have a POV enter (i.e., airfield
   maintenance) their ramp, the POV will be under constant surveillance/escort by the
   sponsoring unit.
   4.1.3. The AFM, wing ADPM, or designated AM representatives are responsible for issuing
   POV passes. Note: Authority will not be delegated outside of AM.
   4.1.4. Numbered and color-coded magnetic control caps are issued along with ADTP POV
   passes to readily identify authorized POVs on SAFB ramps/aprons. Government vehicles do
   not require a POV pass/control cap.
   4.1.5. A single control cap may be issued for up to two vehicles (i.e., if the requester has
   more than one vehicle). In the additional vehicle block of the POV pass letter (Attachment
   5), list the other vehicles authorized to use the control cap. If the POV is sold or transferred
   to another individual, the control cap must be returned to AMOPS and a new letter must be
   provided. The responsibility for security and safekeeping of the control cap lies with the
   holder. Note: Deployed/Transient/TDY Personnel. Government owned vehicles will be
   used to the maximum extent possible. Use of POVs and rental vehicles on the airfield for
   deployed unit missions, inspection teams, etc., may be authorized by the AFM/DAFM or
   designated representative on a case-by-case basis.
   4.1.6. Personnel requesting a POV pass for SAFB airfield must be trained/certified and have
   in possession an AF Form 483 prior to issuance of a POV pass.
   4.1.7. Vehicle operators will display the control cap on the roof or hood of the vehicle prior
   to entering the airfield. If necessary, display the POV cap on dashboard during periods of
   inclement weather.
   4.1.8. After exiting the flight line, remove the cap from the roof or dashboard and secure it.
   Return the cap to AMOPS when there is no longer a valid need for it.
      4.1.8.1. AM will:
          4.1.8.1.1. Ensure the requestor has a current AF Form 483 for SAFB and in the
          ADTP or is provided the local briefing and put into the ADTP website.
          4.1.8.1.2. Log onto ADTP, select personnel list and search for personnel requesting
          the POV pass. Click on the individuals name and then scroll to personal options and
          click Grant POV pass. Fill out all information for the POV pass and click Submit.
          4.1.8.1.3. Print the POV pass from the ADTP and issue via AF Form 1297,
          Temporary Issue receipt, a colored magnetic control cap.
              4.1.8.1.3.1. Complete AF Form 1297 prior to issuing POV control cap.

        4.1.8.1.4. POV passes are only valid for the current calendar year and must be
        revalidated every year.
  4.1.9. Maintain vehicle passes/decals and supportive information IAW AF RDS, Table 13-
  01, Rule 01.00.
