This pamphlet supersedes AFPAM 10-1403 dated 18 December 2003 Air Mobility Planning
Factors. It provides broad air mobility planning factors for peacetime and wartime operations. It
is designed to help service, joint, and combined planners make gross estimates about mobility
requirements in the early stages of the planning process. It covers strategic airlift, air refueling,
and aeromedical evacuation (AE). For greater detail, or in-depth mobility analysis call HQ

Section A—Mobility Planning

1. How To Use This Pamphlet
   1.1. There are four basic parts to this pamphlet: terms and definitions, formulas, planning
   factors, and examples. Although each of these parts can be individually used, we recommend
   you review the entire contents to get a full understanding of the planning process.
   1.2. Due to the number of variables involved in every air mobility operation, the planning
   factors presented are not universally applicable. Instead, they provide ―order of magnitude‖
   approximations in the context of a generic scenario. The use of detailed computer simulation
   models is encouraged for extensive calculations.
   1.3. This pamphlet only addresses objective planning computations. It does not provide
   guidance concerning other factors such as environmental and tactical considerations which
   can impact the mobility operation.

Section B—Airlift Formulas

2. Number of Cargo Missions Required



3. Number of Passenger (PAX) Missions Required



NOTE: PAX on Cargo Missions = Number of PAX seats available on each cargo mission x
Number of Cargo Missions.
4. Total Missions Required
= Cargo missions + PAX missions
5. Time to Arrival
= active route flying time (ARFT) + active route ground time (ARGT)
 4                                                    AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011



6. Cycle Time
= round trip flying time (RTFT) + round trip ground time (RTGT)




7. Closure



NOTE: For major wartime operations, we recommend planners use the wartime objective surge
UTE rates published in Table 6. For non-mobilized contingencies, we recommend the
contingency UTE rates published in Table 6. The computations involved in determining actual
UTE rates are quite involved and not necessary for initial gross planning estimates.
8. Fleet Capability
Short tons delivered to the theater per day




NOTE: This formula is preferred for contingency planning because it accurately relates the
variables affecting the deployment of requirements.
9. Fleet Capacity
Million ton-miles per day



NOTE: Although planners do not commonly use this formula, occasionally we need to convert
short ton figures into million ton-miles per day (MTM/D). AMC force structure programmers
use MTM/D when funding out-year aircraft purchases and many civilian agencies are
accustomed to visualizing our fleet capability in terms of MTM/D. Fleet Capacity is generally
more optimistic than actual Fleet Capability for a particular contingency.
10. Airfield Throughput Capability (station capability)



NOTE: Use the lower of the working, parking, or fuel MOG.

Section C—Air Refueling Formulas
AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    5


11. Air Refueling Overview Refer to Table 10, Table 11, and Table 12 for determining the
approximate number of tankers required to meet the air refueling requirements for various size
fighter/airlift deployments. These tables were constructed using average/historical data and will
provide a gross estimate of the size and duration of an air refueling operation. If actual mission
specifics and data are known, such as aircraft model, configuration, air refueling altitude,
airspeed, tanker basing, etc, using the formulas below will provide more accurate planning
estimates. However, this formula does not consider specific air refueling abort reserves and the
impact on destination fuel. As stated in the introduction we recommend using computer
simulation models whenever feasible.
   11.1. Offload Required (per receiver)



Distance = total distance from takeoff to landing

TAS = average airspeed of receiver leg (use Table 4 Aircraft Block Speeds or applicable flight
manual airspeeds for other aircraft.)

Fuel Flow = fuel burn rate in lbs/hr

Total Fuel = total fuel on board at takeoff

Destination Reserve = required fuel reserves at destination
   11.2. Offload Available (per tanker)


   11.3. Tankers Required



Section D—Aeromedical Evacuation Formulas

12. Aeromedical Evacuation Overview Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 Addenda A for detailed
aircraft specific configuration and mission planning. Use the following formulas and data in
Table 14 to determine the AE force and capabilities. In the near term, AE will be primarily
accomplished using, C-21, C-130, KC-135, or C-17 aircraft. Opportune airlift may be used,
keeping the best interest of the patient and crew in mind. When the aeromedical segment (Stage
II or Stage III) of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is activated, the B-767 will be the primary
means of intertheater AE, with augmentation by military aircraft such as KC-135 and C-17, as
necessary. An AE crew consists of two (2) flight nurses and three (3) medical technicians.

Aircraft Load Planning Factor = standard number of patients loaded per aircraft for aeromedical
evacuation (see Table 14).

     12.2. AE Crew (# required for missions flown, does not include stage)


Crews per Aircraft: Refer to Table 14

Crew Cycle Time:
Intratheater (Within Theater) = 2 days
Intertheater (Theater to CONUS) = 4 days

Section E—Examples

13. Airlift Example. As an example of how to use the formulas and planning factors in this
pamphlet, assume the following scenario. The 10th Mountain Div. out of Ft. Drum, NY, is to
deploy to Kathmandu, Nepal, at the foot of the Himalayas, to assist in earthquake relief. The
requirement is to move 700 personnel and 800 short tons of cargo.
NOTE: The following examples use International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes,
which are four-character alphanumeric code designating each airport around the world and
commonly used in flight planning.
     13.1. Suitable Airfield
        13.1.1. Referring to the Aircraft Airfield Restrictions (Table 1), we see that the B-767
        requires a minimum of 6,000 feet of runway and the C-17 requires a minimum of 3,500
        feet. Since the airfield at Ft. Drum, Wheeler-Sack AAF, has a runway length of 10,000
        feet, it meets the requirements for both aircraft (this assumes adequate runway width).
NOTE: Refer to the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) or the airfield
database (AFD) in AMC‘s Global Decision Support System (GDSS) to determine suitability for
mobility aircraft (C-5, C-17, C-21, C-130, KC-10, KC-135). If the airfield does not appear in
the ASRR/AFD, contact AMC/A3AS and request the airfield be evaluated and added to the
database (Airfield.Helpdesk@amc.af.mil). AMC/A3AS will provide prompt feedback and
include suitability information in future editions of the ASRR.
        13.1.2. Looking in the Kathmandu area, we find Tribhuvan International airport in
        Kathmandu to have 10,121 feet of runway which, along with the associated taxiways and
        ramp, is stressed for B-767 aircraft. Therefore, we make our initial plans based on using
        Wheeler Sack AAF as the onload and Tribhuvan International as the offload.
     13.2. Missions Required. Our examples will address only the cargo requirements, however
     passenger movement would be handled in a similar manner. For all examples to follow,
     assume we have 15 C-17s apportioned for our use and we will use crew staging where
     necessary.
AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 7




   13.3. Time to Arrival. The time required for cargo/PAX to arrive at the offload location
   including all en route ground times. For this example, the C-17‘s will depart McGuire
   (KWRI), fly to Wheeler Sack AAF (KGTB) for onload, then en route stop at Rota (LERT),
   Dhahran (OEDR), Delhi, (VIDP), and then offload at Tribhuvan (VNKT). Refer to
   definitions and tables as needed.
= active route flying time (ARFT) + active route ground time (ARGT)




NOTE: First leg from McGuire to Wheeler is inactive as it‘s a positioning leg. Block speeds
were interpolated from Table 4.


                                                       (refer to Table 5.)




= 26.55 hours
   13.4. Cycle Time. For this example, we calculated round trip flying time (RTFT) and round
   trip ground time (RTGT) using reverse routing except the last leg will be from Rota (LERT)
   to McGuire (KWRI). Refer to definitions for RTFT and RTGT.
Cycle Time = round trip flying time (RTFT) + round trip ground time (RTGT)
 8                                                        AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011




= 20 hours



13.5. Closure




= 3.8 days
     13.6. Fleet Capability (short tons delivered to the theater)




= 208.8 Stons/day

13.7. Airfield Throughput Capability It is necessary to look at the throughput capability of all
airfields associated with a deployment, to determine whether any one airfield limits a planned
operation. However, for initial planning, the en route locations may be assumed to have a higher
throughput capability than the onload and offload locations. For this example, we have used
Tribhuvan International and a working MOG of one narrow body (NB) aircraft.

Airfield Throughput Capability (e.g.., Tribhuvan)




= 282.5 Stons/day (Refer to Table 8.)

NOTE: Since the arrival airfield can handle the estimated fleet capability that will be delivered,
this calculation is complete. If the fleet capability had exceeded the airfield‘s throughput, either
the flow would need to be slowed to compensate or the airfield‘s resources increased to handle
the airflow.
14. Air Refueling Example. For this example, assume you need to deploy 6 F-15C‘s from
Langley (KLFI) to Spangdahlem (ETAD). How much fuel and how many tankers (KC-135R) are
AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     9


required? Note: For this example average/historical figures were used. Actual numbers would
vary according to aircraft model, configuration, altitude, airspeed, etc.


   14.1. Onload Required (per receiver)



Distance = total distance from takeoff to landing

TAS = average airspeed of receiver leg (use Table 4. for mobility aircraft or applicable flight
manual airspeeds for other aircraft.)
Fuel Flow = fuel burn rate in lbs/hr
Total Fuel = total fuel on board at takeoff
Destination Reserves = required fuel reserves at destination
       = (3500/480 x 10,822) - 23,000 + 7500

       = 63,410 lbs (per receiver) x 6 = 380,462 lbs

   14.2. Offload Available (per tanker)




= 71,848 lbs per tanker
   14.3. Tankers required



= 380,462 (rounded up)
  71,848

= 6 KC-135Rs required
15. Aeromedical Evacuation Example. For this example, C-130s will be used to evacuate 500
patients per day.
   15.1. AE Missions (# required)



= 10 AE Missions required

       NOTES:
       1. HQ AMC/A3 retains runway criteria waiver authority for AMC organic aircraft.
       2. Refer to DOD Flight Information Handbook for an airfield‘s specific Pavement Classification
       Number (PCN) and subgrade as well as additional aircraft Aircraft Classification Number (ACN).
       Table 1 reflects values for the aircraft‘s empty weight and the aircraft‘s maximum take-off/taxi
       weight.
       3. Refer to the weight bearing information in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report
       (ASRR) or Global Decision Support System (GDSS) for an airfield‘s specific PCN and sub-
       grade. The GDSS also provides weight bearing capacity (WBC) information when pavement
       strength is reported in terms other than ACN or PCN, and translates raw WBC into aircraft gross
       weight limits. Planners can contact the AMC Airfield Help Desk
       (Airfield.Helpdesk@amc.af.mil) for assistance regarding weight bearing capacity information
       in the ASRR or GDSS/AFD. Mobility aircraft planners will use only the weight bearing
       information figures published in the ASRR and GDSS.
       4. For Non-Tactical Assault Operations, minimum runway width is 80 ft; minimum runway
       length is 5000 ft.
       5. Values listed are maximum values for the Aircraft Type.

NOTES:
1. Wingtip clearance: 10 ft on each side with wing walker, 25 ft each side without wing walker.
(Does not apply to CRAF aircraft)
2. Refer to DOD Flight Information Publication (Enroute Supplement) for an airfield‘s
maximum runway load bearing capability expressed as a maximum aircraft weight for a
particular landing gear type. Additionally, the ASRR and GDSS/AFD provide maximum
runway/taxiway/parking apron load bearing capability information for AMC aircraft by landing
gear type.
3. Width required is for landing gear only and does not include the wingspan footprint required
for a 180 degree turn.
4. C-17 Parking spot equivalent calculation

= Aircraft Length x Aircraft Width
   C-17 length x C-17 width

5. The C-17 minimum width for a Star Turn is 90 ft (can be done in 80 feet, but 90 feet is the
minimum runway width for landing).
6. Values listed are maximum values for the Aircraft Type.
7. Based on full asymmetric thrust and initial differential braking.

NOTES:
1. Cargo and passenger payloads (except for the C-5) are exclusive of one another.
2. Organic (except C-130) calculated as the maximum ACL for a 3200 nm leg, CRAF calculated
for a 3500nm leg. C-130 calculated based on a 2000 nm leg.
3. CRAF based on mixed service averages (B-747-100 Equivalent = 78 Stons).
4. CRAF MAX and AVG passengers are the same because PAX are loaded to the max allowable
by weight.
5. Lower NEO number reflects life raft capacity.
6. Weights are based on 400 lbs per passenger, which includes passenger, baggage, and combat
gear. Take total passenger weight into account as part of total cargo weight when requirements
dictate movement of cargo and passengers on the same aircraft.

NOTES:
1. Due to the multitude of Air Refueling variables, this table reflects an ―order of magnitude‖
only.
2. Table assumes multiple tanker launch bases would be used for AR distances greater than
3000nm.
3. Fighter/tanker ratio can be limited by boom cycle time.
4. For the airlift aircraft, assume average payloads, maximum takeoff gross weight, optimum
located air refueling tracks and divert bases, and a minimum tanker off-load capability of 90,000
lbs.

   NOTES: Maximum litter patients on 3 Patient Support Pallets (PSP) would be 18; however,
   PSPs near cargo door cannot be configured with stanchions resulting in the loss of 3 litter
   positions.
   1. Basic crew only (2 Flight Nurses and 3 AE Technicians). B-767s require 1 additional Flight
   Nurse for basic crew to act as overall mission MCD.
   2. Total positions. Data reflects the subtraction of litter positions and seat requirements for a
   basic AE crew with medical equipment. Addition of one CCATT would subtract an additional 3
   seats and 2 litter positions.
   3. Various litter and ambulatory patient combinations are available based on requirement.
   4. Limited to 80 seats including crew for overwater flights.
   5. No integral litter capability. PSP required to increase number of positions.
   6. Capacity increases to 36 litter positions with LSAS Litter Stanchion Kit installed, or by
   redistributing assets from other airframes.
   7. Only configuration possible due to number of ship sets available.

   8. Not used for contingency planning at this time.

Terms
ACN— See Pavement/Aircraft Classification System.
Active route flying time (ARFT)— The flying time from onload to the offload location
including all intermediate locations en route. This does not include ground time.
Active route ground time (ARGT)— The cumulative ground time of all intermediate stops
from the onload location to the offload location. This does not include flying time.
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Patients— Litter = Patient who needs to be carried during both
enplaning and deplaning. Patient requires assistance to enplane and deplane. Ambulatory =
Patient capable of walking who may not require assistance to enplane and deplane.
Air cargo— Stores, equipment or vehicles, which do not form part of the aircraft, and are part or
all of its payload. Note: There are different classifications of military cargo, categorized as
follows:
Bulk Air Cargo, including the 463L pallet itself, that is within the usable dimensions of a 463L
pallet (104‖ x 84‖ x 96‖) and within the height and width requirements established by the cargo
envelope of the particular model of aircraft.
Oversize Cargo exceeding the usable dimensions of a 463L pallet loaded to the design height of
96‖ but is equal to or less than 1,090‖ in length, 117‖ in width, and 105‖ in height. This cargo is
transportable on the C—5, C-17, C-130, and to a limited extent the KC-10.
Outsize Cargo which exceeds the dimension of oversize (1,090‖ x 117‖ x 105‖) and requires use
of a C—5 or C-17.

Rolling Stock Equipment that can be driven or rolled directly into the cargo compartment.
Special Items requiring specialized preparation and handling procedures, such as space satellites
or nuclear weapons.
Aircraft block speed— True airspeed in knots under zero wind conditions adjusted in relation to
length of sortie to compensate for takeoff, climb out, descent, instrument approach, and landing.
AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    25


Aircraft parking size— The ramp space a particular aircraft occupies, usually expressed in C-
17 equivalents (See Table 2.).
Airfield database (AFD)— The airfield database is contained in the AMC Global Decision
Support System (GDSS) and establishes suitability and restrictions for AMC and AMC-gained
C-5, KC-10, C-17, C-130, and KC-135 aircraft operations.
Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR)— AMC/A3 quarterly publication
available on line that contains AMC policy and guidance regarding airfield suitability and a
synopsis of suitability for airfields AMC operates at globally.
Airfield throughput capability— The amount of passengers or cargo which can be moved
through the airfield per day via strategic airlift based on the limitations of the airfield (such as
parking spots).
Air refueling track— A track designated for air refueling reserved by the receiver unit/planner.
If possible, the track from the ARIP to the ARCP should be along a TACAN/VORTAC radial
and within 100 NM of the station.
Air refueling initial point (ARIP)— A point located upstream from the ARCP at which the
receiver aircraft initiates a rendezvous with the tanker.
Air refueling control point (ARCP)— The planned geographic point over which the receiver(s)
arrive in the observation/precontact position with respect to the assigned tanker.
Air refueling control time (ARCT)— The planned time that the receiver and tanker will arrive
over the air refueling control point (ARCP).
Air refueling exit point (AR EXIT PT)— The designated geographic point at which the
refueling track terminates. In a refueling anchor it is a designated point where the tanker and
receiver may depart the anchor area after refueling is completed.
Allowable cabin load (ACL)— The maximum payload that can be carried on a mission. Note:
The ACL may be limited by the maximum takeoff gross weight, maximum landing gross weight,
or by the maximum zero fuel weight.
Anchor point— A designated geographical point on the downstream end of the inbound course
of the Anchor Refueling Pattern.
Anchor refueling— Air refueling performed as the tankers maintain a prescribed pattern which
is anchored to a geographical point or fix.
Anchor rendezvous (Anchor Rendezvous)— The procedures normally employed by radar
(CRC/GCI/AWACS) to vector the tanker(s) and receiver(s) for a visual join-up for refueling.
Base air refueling altitude— A reference altitude at which lead aircraft of a tanker formation
(or single aircraft for individual air refueling) will fly at initial contact.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)— A program in which the Department of Defense (DOD) uses
FAA Part 121-certificated, US-flagged aircraft. These aircraft are allocated by the Department of
Transportation (DOT) to augment the military airlift capability of the DOD. These aircraft are
allocated, in accordance with DOD requirements, to segments, according to their capabilities,
such as International, Domestic, and Aeromedical segments as may be mutually agreed upon by
the DOD and the DOT. The CRAF can be incrementally activated by the DOD in three stages in

response to defense-oriented situations, up to and including a declared national emergency or
war, to satisfy DOD airlift requirements. Note: The International segment is further divided into
long-range and short-range sections; and the Domestic segment is further divided into National
and Alaskan sections.
Closure— In transportation, the process of a unit arriving at a specified location. It begins when
the first element arrives at a designated location, e.g. port of entry/port of departure, intermediate
stops, or final destination, and ends when the last element does likewise, For the purposes of
studies and command post exercises, a unit is considered essentially closed after 95 percent of its
movement requirements for personnel and equipment are completed.
Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT)— CCATTs provide critical care augmentation
to aeromedically evacuated injured, ill and/or burn patients requiring advanced care during
transportation. They are available to assist the AE crews if a patient‘s condition dictates. A
CCATT is comprised of three personnel: a physician who may be an intensivist
(cardiopulmonary), a critical care nurse, and a respiratory technician.
Cycle time— Total elapsed time for an aircraft to depart home station, fly a complete mission
and be back to start a second time.
Dual role mission— A mission where both air refueling and airlift are provided to the user. The
primary mission role is normally air refueling. Missions where cargo movement is primary
require a dedicated funded special assignment airlift mission (SAAM).
Enroute rendezvous— A rendezvous procedure whereby the tanker and receiver arrive at a
common rendezvous (RZ) point at the same time with 1,000 feet altitude separation.
Fleet capability— The amount of cargo or passengers which can be moved into or out of a
location or theater expressed in short tons or PAX per day. Limitations include the number of
aircraft in the operation, their UTE rate, and the distance between onload and offload locations.
Fuel MOG— See Maximum on Ground.
Global Decision Support System (GDSS)— GDSS is AMC's force level command and control
(C2) system supporting 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC) execution authority for
effective airlift mission management. It provides AMC accurate, near real-time data required for
making decisions concerning the deployment and employment of AMC resources. New
accounts may be obtained by following the "GDSS2 Accounts" guidance on the support web
site: https://gdss2ams.c2.amc.af.mil/gdss2web/
Ground time— The planned ground time for the type of aircraft used.
Maximum on ground (MOG)— It is most commonly expressed in C-17 equivalents.
Parking MOG— The number of aircraft that can fit, or be parked, on the ground.
Working MOG— The number of parked aircraft can be worked simultaneously based on
available personnel, materials handling equipment (MHE), and ramp space.
Missions required— The number of strategic airlift missions (by aircraft type) required to move
a requirement from the onload to the offload location.
AFPAM10-1403 12 DECEMBER 2011                                                                       27


Noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO)— Operations conducted to relocate threatened
noncombatants from locations in a foreign country. These operations normally involve US
citizens whose lives are in danger, and may also include selected foreign nationals. Note: NEO
planning factors (refer to Table 3.) should be used when planning NEO operations. Emergency
NEO capabilities represent the most extreme of circumstances.
Number of aircraft— The specific number of aircraft apportioned to any peacetime operation,
contingency, or exercise, or the number apportioned in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan
(JSCP) Enclosure 11 for tasked OPLANs.
Pavement/Aircraft classification system— The ICAO standard method of reporting pavement
strengths. The Pavement Classification Number (PCN) is established by an engineering
assessment of the runway. The PCN is for use in conjunction with an Aircraft Classification
Number (ACN). ACN values (provided in Table 1.) relate aircraft characteristics to a runway‘s
load bearing capability, expressed as a PCN. An aircraft with an ACN equal or less than the
reported PCN can operate on the pavement subject to any limitations on the tire pressure. Refer
to DOD Flight Information Publication (Enroute Supplement) for an airfield‘s specific PCN.
Payload— The sum of the weight of passengers and cargo that an aircraft can carry. Note: Cargo
weight is normally expressed in short tons.
Planning payload— The payload (expressed in short tons of cargo or number of passengers)
expected on a fleet-wide basis, and used by planners to make initial gross planning estimates.
The size, shape, and density of most payloads, as well as passenger constraints (i.e., oxygen or
life preservers available), rarely permit loading to 100 percent capacity. Planning payload data,
not maximum payload data, should be used for operations/transportation planning.
Point parallel rendezvous— A rendezvous accomplished with the tanker maintaining an
appropriate offset, the receiver flying the ARIP to ARCP track, and the tanker turning in front of
the receiver at a computed range.
Primary mission aircraft inventory (PMAI)— Aircraft authorized to a unit for performance of
its operational mission. The Primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation of operating
resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hours funds.
Productivity factor— Gross measure of an aircraft‘s expected useful ability to move cargo and
passengers to a user, expressed as a percentage. Positioning, depositioning, and other non-
productive legs all diminish the overall productivity. For example, on a strategic airlift mission
involving an outbound and a return leg, the return leg is normally considered nonproductive. The
productivity factor, in this case would be 50 percent. However, this assumes cargo has already
been positioned at the aircraft‘s departure point. In most situations, airlift aircraft must fly one or
more positioning legs to an onload location. Since productive cargo is usually not moved at this
time, these positioning legs reduce the overall productivity factor to a value less than 50 percent.
For planning purposes use the productivity, factors found in Table 7, or calculate your own by
dividing productive leg distance (onload to offload) by round trip cycle distance.
Queuing efficiency— A factor used by planners and applied in formulas (i.e., throughput
capability) to account for the physical impossibility of using limited airfield facilities with
perfect efficiency. For example, when a parking spot is vacated, it is never instantly re-occupied.
Historically, planners have applied a queuing efficiency of 85 percent.

Requirement—
Airlift. The force to be moved in number of passengers or short tons of cargo.


Tanker. The number and type of receivers, fuel desired, time to loiter, and AR track.


Round trip flying time (RTFT)— The accumulated flying time from the aircraft‘s starting
point, to the onload location, through the en route structure, to the offload location, back through
the en route system, to starting point of origin or other final destination.
Round trip ground time (RTGT)— The accumulated ground time from the aircraft‘s starting
point, to the onload location, through the en route structure, to the offload location, back to the
final destination.
Short Ton (Ston)— 2,000 pounds.
Time to arrival— The time required for cargo/PAX to arrive at the offload location including
all en route ground times.
USE rate— The capability of a subset of PMAI aircraft to generate flying hours expressed in
average flying hours per aircraft per day. Computed only for those aircraft applied to a specific
mission. For example, consider an operation using 2 C-17 aircraft. If 1 aircraft flies 10 hours
while the other is in maintenance, then one aircraft has 10 hours of USE rate and the other has 0
hours of USE rate. Collectively, these two aircraft generate 5.0 hrs/day of ―USE‖.
Utilization rate (UTE rate)— The capability of a fleet of aircraft to generate flying hours in a
day, expressed in terms of per Primary Authorized Inventory (PAI). Applies only to long-term,
large scale operations such as OPLANs. For small operations involving less than the entire fleet,
UTE rates are not normally a factor.
Wartime Objective “Surge” UTE Rate— A command established flying hour goal for
planning and programming to meet JCS directed wartime objectives in the first 45 days of the
most demanding wartime operations. AMC sets this rate as a target for planning and
programming aircrews, maintenance, and aerial port manpower, active and reserve force mixes,
and spare parts. This early 45 day surge period assumes the deferral of scheduled maintenance,
support people working overtime, and the full mobilization of both active and reserve forces with
fully funded and fully stocked spares in supply.
Wartime Objective “Sustained” UTE Rate— Sustained UTE rates represent another command
goal for planning purposes. After a 45 day surge operation in wartime, the immediate demand for
airlift decreases somewhat and a greater percentage of needed equipment arrives by
sealift/surface. AMC plans to fly at a lower operational tempo known as a sustained UTE rate.
This reduced rate is based upon normal duty days, 100% active and reserve participation, and the
accomplishment of maintenance activities deferred in the surge period.
Contingency Non—Mobilized UTE Rate = Sustained rate of flying hour activity based upon
full active duty participation and 25% reserve volunteerism. (e.g. JUST CAUSE, RESTORE
HOPE, PROVIDE COMFORT).
