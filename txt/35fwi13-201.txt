        by USAF and JASDF personnel jointly on a 24-hour basis. Pilot-to-Dispatch (PTD) is available on
        313.6 or 131.4 MHZ.
     3.3. Flight Planning Form Requirements. For flights originating at Misawa AB, the pilot in command,
     aircraft commander, or formation leader shall prepare and submit a flight plan to AM Ops at least 60
     minutes prior to the estimated time of departure (ETD) for a local flight and 2 hours prior for a cross
     country. AM Ops will transmit all flight plans as soon as possible.
     3.4. Flight Planning Procedures.
        3.4.1. Flight Plan Forms. All flights that depart Misawa must file a DD Form 1801, DoD Inter-
        national Flight Plan. The DD Form 1801 is filed by the pilot, copilot, or navigator as early as
        possible.
            3.4.1.1. Flight plans must be filed at least 1 hour before proposed departure time for flights
            remaining within Japan. Overseas/international flight plans must be filed at least 2 hours in
            advance.
            3.4.1.2. DD Form 1801 may be filed by base assigned aircraft (13 FS, 14 FS, or NAF Mis-
            awa)—on or off station—via fax, provided:
                3.4.1.2.1. All required information, including signature, is contained on the form.
                3.4.1.2.2. AM Ops receives the fax at least 1 hour (preferably 2 hours) prior to departure
                time. The 2-hour lead time is to work out any potential routing errors and/or airspace
                restrictions with the affected unit, and to prevent any aircraft departure delays.
                3.4.1.2.3. AM is notified by phone (follow-up) of the flight plan.
                3.4.1.2.4. The original flight plan is maintained IAW Air Force WEB-RIMS Records Dis-
                position Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                   15


              3.4.1.2.5. Locally filed flight plans may be amended by any means provided the original
              flight plan is on file at the departure AM Ops.
          3.4.1.3. Form 7540-010-0022-H can be used for local sorties by JASDF transient or JASDF
          locally assigned aircraft.
      3.4.2. Patriot Excalibur (PEX) may be used for all USFJ base assigned IFR/Visual Flight Rules
      (VFR) flights within the established local flying area. TDY/transient units not filing in AM Ops
      shall contact the AFM or AOF/CC at least 48 hours prior to setup flight plan filing procedures
      IAW AFI 13-213. Flight plans for local sorties shall be automatically filed by AM Ops provided:
          3.4.2.1. Individual pilots obtain an adequate weather briefing and checks current NOTAMs.
          3.4.2.2. Sufficient information relative to the flight is included to adequately guard the flight.
          3.4.2.3. Each unit operations center/duty desk will advise AM Ops of any additions, changes,
          or deletions to their respective daily flight schedules NLT 2 hours prior to the proposed depar-
          ture time. This will ensure enough lead time to amend/retransmit flight plans and prevent
          potential departure delays.
          3.4.2.4. Flying squadrons ensure the local flying schedule is loaded in PEX by 1300L for the
          day flight weeks, and by 1600L for the night flying weeks on the day preceding the proposed
          flights. Wing agencies to include the 35 FW Executive Secretary, 35 FW Wing Operations
          Center (WOC), Weather, Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC), and AM Ops pull
          the schedule from PEX. JASDF is provided a copy by AM Ops.
          3.4.2.5. When the Misawa Automated Radar Terminal System or Flight Services and Aircraft
          Movement Information Service Data Processing (FADP) equipment is not operational AM
          Ops shall relay the following items to JASDF personnel who will in turn forward the informa-
          tion to the Tower and the Chitose Flight Service Center:
              3.4.2.5.1. Aircraft call sign.
              3.4.2.5.2. Aircraft type and number in flight.
              3.4.2.5.3. IFR or VFR.
              3.4.2.5.4. Destination/departure location.

              3.4.2.5.6. Other necessary information.
      3.4.3. Navy P-3 Aircraft Alert Launch. Navy Duty desk shall contact AM Ops and provide call
      sign, ETD, ETE, and which specific flight plan to file. AM Ops will process the flight plan
      promptly, inform ATC control tower, JASDF Base Operations, and enter the flight plan into the
      ATC system.

4. Aircraft Operations
   4.1. Local Aircraft Priorities.
      4.1.1. Normally a "first come, first served" basis of priority is used by the Tower and RAPCON
      facilities. Due to the special mission requirements of the traffic listed below, inbound or outbound
      traffic shall be re-sequenced when necessary to allow for quick takeoff or landing of these aircraft.
16                                                                           35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


        Low approach and touch and go (except flight check) may be limited when the traffic pattern is
        congested. Traffic complexity and density shall be the final determining factor for compliance
        with this paragraph.
        4.1.2. Tower shall not deny takeoff clearance but shall sequence aircraft arrivals/departures in
        accordance with established traffic priorities listed below. L=Landing Priority; T=Takeoff Priority.

           equipped aircraft shall be transferred to RAPCON in the same manner as IFR departures.
           4.8.1.2. VFR arrivals. All VFR arrivals shall be given Radar Service, radar vectors and traffic
           pattern sequencing when available from Misawa Approach. Aircraft returning VFR should
           contact approach control prior to entering Misawa airspace (see Attachment 6). Aircraft
           recovering to Misawa AB from the West shall contact Sapporo Center for clearance.
           4.8.1.3. VFR Departures and Recoveries to/from R-130. VFR departure and recovery routes
           are depicted in Attachment 10. VFR departure aircraft shall maintain an altitude of 1,600 feet
           until clear of Misawa traffic patterns. VFR recovery aircraft shall maintain 2,500 feet until ini-
           tial. If unable, they will notify the Tower or RAPCON of the altitude they intend to fly. All
           VFR recovering aircraft shall depart R-130 with west (Rwy 10 in use) or east (Rwy 28 in use)
           heading and call the RAPCON as soon as possible.
       4.8.2. General Instructions. Obstructions south of control tower are not charted in attachments
       because of the published flight restriction over Misawa City below 3,000 feet.
           4.8.2.1. Aircraft shall not overfly the large circular antenna field 1.5 NM northwest of Run-
           way 10 below 2,000 feet above ground level (AGL).
           4.8.2.2. Do not overfly military family housing area located 1.5 NM north of the Runway or
           JASDF military family housing area located SE of field boundary.
           4.8.2.3. Do not overfly munitions storage areas below 1,600 feet (see Attachment 9).
           4.8.2.4. All aircraft shall avoid overflight of Misawa City at less than 3,000 feet AGL.
           4.8.2.5. Aircraft departing on Runway 10 shall not overfly the elementary and junior high
           school buildings located approximately one mile east of the field (see Attachment 14).
           4.8.2.6. Pattern direction and altitude shall be as depicted in Attachment 9 unless otherwise
           coordinated by Misawa Tower.
           4.8.2.7. Landing Gear Checks. All aircraft shall report "gear down" and type landing to the
           Tower when turning to base leg.
           4.8.2.8. Go Around. Aircraft executing a go around from final approach shall clear the runway
           as directed by the Tower, flying parallel so as to remain between the runway and the respective
           parallel taxiway. Do not exceed 1,600 feet until 3 DME on runway 28 or 2 DME on runway
           10.
           4.8.2.9. Modification of established patterns. Straight-in approaches, direct downwind, base
           leg entries, or any other modifications to the traffic pattern may be initiated by Misawa Tower
           or requested by the pilot.
NOTE: The Tower shall close the VFR traffic pattern during visual meteorological conditions (VMC) if
the watch supervisor determines the Tower cannot provide visual separation or pilot reports indicate they
are unable to fly the published VFR traffic pattern.

          4.8.2.10. Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) aircraft (see Chapter 13).
          4.8.2.11. (VFR) Departures. All VFR departures shall advise Ground Control of the initial
          heading and altitude before they taxi out.
          4.8.2.12. VFR departures for 35 FW aircraft on the daily schedule are approved with the fol-
          lowing criteria/procedures:
             4.8.2.12.1. A delay is expected for an IFR/local flight plan.
             4.8.2.12.2. The official weather (current weather observed by JASDF, and the forecast for
             the time of the flight by USAF Weather) must be 1500/3 or greater.
             4.8.2.12.3. The SOF must approve the procedure.
             4.8.2.12.4. The Tower shall relay VFR departures to AM Ops by stating: "(call sign), VFR
             DEPARTURE."
             4.8.2.12.5. AM Ops will enter or delete flight plans as follows:
                 4.8.2.12.5.1. Cancel/amend the original clearance and enter a local VFR departure for
                 aircraft which originally filed a flight plan entering Sapporo's airspace.
                 4.8.2.12.5.2. File a separate local VFR flight plan for aircraft that were initially
                 included as an element of a previously departed flight.
                 4.8.2.12.5.3. No action is required for aircraft, which originally filed an IFR flight plan
                 to remain in Misawa Approach Control’s airspace.
          4.8.2.13. The Tower will advise all VFR arriving and departing aircraft whenever R-130 or
          R-521 is in use.
      4.8.3. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS).
          4.8.3.1. JASDF ATC is authorized to apply reduced runway separation between 35 FW air-
          craft and Misawa based JASDF aircraft of similar operating characteristics. The 35 OG/CC
          may authorize non-Misawa based USFJ aircraft to utilize the reduced separation procedures
          after the pilots receive a RSRS briefing and coordination has been accomplished with JASDF
          ATC. The control tower shall not apply reduced runway separation if the watch supervisor
          determines that poor visibility (e.g., runway distance markers not visible from the Tower) will
          preclude such an operation. The following RSRS apply:


Type Aircraft Behind              Arriving/Departing Aircraft          Distance Required
Fighter Type                      Same Fighter Type                    4000
Fighter Type                      Dissimilar Fighter Type              6000

                 4.8.3.1.1.1. Between sunset and sunrise.
                 4.8.3.1.1.2. Reported wet runway.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                  23


                  4.8.3.1.1.3. The RCR is reported to be 16 or less.
                  4.8.3.1.1.4. When RCR is not available and RSC is reported as ice or snow on runway.
              4.8.3.1.2. RSRS criteria contained in this provision will normally be applied at Misawa
              AB, Japan, by JASDF controllers as a courtesy to US forces’ aircraft. However, JASDF
              controllers retain the prerogative to apply standard runway separation when deemed neces-
              sary or as directed by their higher headquarters.
          4.8.3.2. Aircraft arriving behind a departing aircraft: The preceding aircraft must be airborne
          and at least 4,000/6,000/9,000 feet (as appropriate) down the runway as specified in paragraph
          4.8.3.1. when the second aircraft crosses the landing threshold.
          4.8.3.3. Restrictions: All other operations shall be in accordance with applicable United States
          Government and Japanese Government policies and regulations. Less than standard separation
          shall not be authorized when one or more aircraft involved is:
              4.8.3.3.1. Emergency aircraft.
              4.8.3.3.2. Heavy jet.
              4.8.3.3.3. Civil aircraft.
              4.8.3.3.4. Military contract carrier.
              4.8.3.3.5. Air evacuation aircraft.
              4.8.3.3.6. To any situation involving an aircraft cleared for the option or a stop and go
              (SG), a low approach (LA) behind a touch and go, or a TG behind a full stop (FS).
       4.8.4. Overhead Traffic Pattern.
          4.8.4.1. Protection of 360 Overhead Pattern. All departures will be instructed to maintain at or
          below 1,600 until 3 DME for runway 28 or 2 DME for runways 10 departures.
          4.8.4.2. VFR arrivals. Proceed to the appropriate initial point (IP) as depicted in Attachment
          8. Aircraft shall report appropriate "IP" at 2,500 feet (3,500 for South IP), or as instructed by
          Misawa Tower, maintaining 2,500 feet until initial and then descending to 2,100 feet. Aircraft
          shall normally break at the approach end of the landing runway. If traffic does not allow air-
          craft on initial to continue the overhead pattern, Tower shall provide positive control or advise
          the aircraft to "Report outside downwind." Outside downwind is 5 NM north and parallel to
          the runway; altitude for outside downwind is 2,500 feet. From outside downwind, proceed to
          the appropriate pattern IP.
NOTE: When reaching IP or requesting closed patterns, pilots shall inform Tower of landing intentions
(i.e., low approach, touch and go, or full stop).
          4.8.4.3. Do not descend below 2,500 feet until initial, and maintain 2,100 feet until starting
          turn to base leg.
          4.8.4.4. Formation Breaks and Landings. Formation flights shall take intervals in the break for
          landings as specified in the appropriate operating training manuals. Formation flights shall
          take spacing in the break so as to ensure aircraft touch down with spacing IAW paragraph
          4.8.3. Pilots desiring formation landings must notify the Tower prior to aircraft entering the
          pattern. Helicopters will maintain landing spacing in accordance with flight manuals.
24                                                                          35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


          4.8.4.5. Jet closed traffic pattern shall be flown at 2,100 feet. Aircraft shall normally turn
          closed traffic at the departure end of runway unless otherwise directed.
          4.8.4.6. If required to hold for the VFR overhead, hold as depicted in Attachment 8. Hold on
          the radial that defines the North Holding Point (300 degrees, 12-15 DME), East Holding Point
          (080 degrees, 12-15 DME) or South Holding Point (240 degrees, 12-15 DME), outbound turns
          toward the north, at 3,500 feet. If necessary, longer leg lengths may be requested from the
          Tower. Subsequent aircraft will hold at 1,000 foot increments above 3,500 feet.
       4.8.5. Rectangular (Conventional) Traffic Pattern.
          4.8.5.1. Aircraft on VFR flight plan utilizing the conventional pattern shall descend to 1,100
          feet outside the control zone and make a 45-degree entry onto downwind leg as depicted in
          Attachment 9, or as directed by Misawa Tower.
          4.8.5.2. Downwind leg shall be flown north of the north area military family housing and ele-
          mentary school.
          4.8.5.3. Base leg shall not be further than 3 NM from end of runway to provide separation
          from aircraft on IFR approach, or as directed by Tower.
          4.8.5.4. Missed approach and go around. Crosswind leg begins after passing airfield boundary
          or as directed by Tower.
       4.8.6. Light Aircraft and Helicopter Pattern.
          4.8.6.1. Light conventional aircraft on a VFR flight plan shall descend to 600 feet outside the
          control zone and make a 45-degree entry onto downwind as depicted in Attachment 9, or as
          directed by Misawa Tower.
          4.8.6.2. Downwind leg shall be flown south of north area military family housing.
          4.8.6.3. Base leg shall not be further than 1 NM from end of runway unless otherwise directed
          by the Tower.
          4.8.6.4. Crosswind begins after passing airfield boundary or as directed by Tower.
NOTE: Helicopters inbound on standard helicopter arrivals will proceed no further than the inbound
holding points (see Attachment 16) until cleared to land or to enter base/downwind.
       4.8.7. Simulated Flame-Out (SFO) Procedures.
          4.8.7.1. Pilots shall request the SFO from Misawa Tower or Misawa RAPCON prior to climb-
          ing to high key.
          4.8.7.2. High and/or low key shall be in accordance with applicable aircraft flight manual.
          4.8.7.3. All overhead SFOs will be flown north of the field; left traffic for Runway 10 and
          right traffic for Runway 28.
          4.8.7.4. Straight-in SFOs will report Glider West R-280/10 DME or Glider East R-100/10
          DME at 8,500 feet. Additionally, they will report 5 NM straight-in.
          4.8.7.5. SFOs shall only be flown during day VMC conditions. Ceiling must be a minimum of
          500 feet above low or high key, as appropriate. Visibility must be at least 5 miles. Entries from
          other than a high key over the field may be made from various directions with Tower approval.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                    25


         4.8.7.6. RAPCON may approve/disapprove the SFO based on RAPCON traffic and Tower
         approval/disapproval.
         4.8.7.7. The Tower shall be responsible for issuing traffic advisories to aircraft executing an
         SFO.
         4.8.7.8. Tower shall sequence SFOs with all known traffic and if necessary hold SFO aircraft
         at high key to resolve any conflicts.
         4.8.7.9. The Tower may discontinue an SFO anytime they deem necessary. Normal breakout
         shall be: climb above initial at 3,000 feet.
     4.8.8. Tactical Straight-In (TSI): F-16 TSI may be flown at flight lead discretion for training with
     Tower approval. Exercise scenarios involving simulated threats near the airfield or "overhead pat-
     tern closed" conditions are examples of when a tactical straight-in recovery might be appropriate.
     Procedures are as follows:
         4.8.8.1. Required Weather - 1500/3.
         4.8.8.2. Maximum flight size - 4 aircraft (large package recoveries may use this option, but
         should coordinate with Tower prior to takeoff).
         4.8.8.3. When TSIs are in effect (fragged in an ATO or at SOF direction) or if a flight wants to
         practice the procedure, contact Tower as early as possible (contact Misawa RAPCON first
         IAW normal procedures). Aircraft recovering from the southeast shall avoid Hachinohe's con-
         trol zone and perform the "in-place 90" maneuver from "STICK" (Misawa 106/11), or proceed
         VFR to the east IP and perform the maneuver from there. Aircraft recovering from the south-
         west (South IP) shall avoid direct overflight of Towada City below 1,000 feet AGL.
  4.9. Draughon Range VFR Routes. VFR departures proceeding direct to Draughon Range or recover-
  ies directly from Draughon to a VFR initial point (IP) should follow the routings and altitudes
  described in Attachment 10.
  4.10. Radar Vectoring of Aircraft
     4.10.1. The RAPCON Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) chart is shown in Attachment 11.
     4.10.2. PAR and ASR approaches are available during periods of scheduled wing flying.
         4.10.2.1. A maximum of 2 PAR or ASR approaches can be conducted simultaneously.
  4.11. Recovery Routes. Recovering aircraft from air work areas that intend to recover IFR shall
  request an IFR recovery clearance from Sapporo Area Control Center (ACC) or directly from the
  RAPCON at least 5 minutes prior to exiting the training area. ACC or RAPCON shall issue an IFR
  clearance if traffic conditions permit. Recoveries should follow routings described in Attachment 12
  unless otherwise cleared by the controlling agency.
     4.11.1. Radar vectors to initial are available when pilot requested and is based on other traffic.
  4.12. Radar Trail Recoveries.
     4.12.1. General. Radar assisted trail recoveries are authorized for recovery into Misawa AB. Use
     of these procedures is authorized by all locally stationed aircraft. Transient and temporary duty
     personnel may use these procedures if fully briefed by 35 OG/OGV and approved by the 35 OG/
     CC.
26                                                                           35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


        4.12.1.1. Trail recoveries will be flown IAW AFI 11-2F16-V3, F-16--Operations Procedures,
        and AFI 11-2F16-V3/35 FW Supplement 1. Trail recoveries may only be initiated by pilot
        request. ATC will treat trail recovery formations as single flights and provide vectors/service
        to the lead aircraft in the flight. Aircraft within the flight are responsible for maintaining sepa-
        ration within the flight.
     4.12.2. Pilot Procedures: Inform Misawa radar of the number of aircraft in flight and request upon
     initial contact. Flights should normally be established in trail formation prior to contacting Mis-
     awa RAPCON. If not previously established in trail, inform ATC when dragging wingmen. For-
     mation break-up should not be accomplished in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC);
     however, if unavoidable, break-up will be accomplished in straight and level flight. Drags should
     be accomplished with the power in idle, speedbrakes open, until obtaining spacing. Maintain 1.5
     to 2 NM spacing throughout recovery and final approach. If RCR is less than (18/FAIR), use 3
     NM spacing. The last aircraft in the formation will squawk Mode III/C 5400.
        4.12.2.1. Aircraft in trail will comply with altitude and heading instructions given to the lead
        aircraft. Airspeed will be 300 KIAS until slowing for the approach or radar vectors. Flight
        leads will maintain a minimum of 180 KIAS until the final approach fix (FAF) and will pass
        unbriefed airspeed changes to flight members over the radio. Airspeed changes will be accom-
        plished by all flight members at the same time. Altitude and heading changes will be made at
        the same place, not time, for all aircraft. All aircraft will fly the same type of final approach
        (TACAN, ILS, or VFR straight-in) and report the FAF. Recoveries will normally terminate in
        a full stop landing. Low approaches for pilot proficiency may be requested, but will be
        approved by ATC on a workload/traffic-permitting basis.
     4.12.3. ATC Procedures: Upon approving trail recovery, ATC will provide IFR separation
     between the first aircraft in the flight and any preceding aircraft, and between the last aircraft in
     the flight and any trailing aircraft. Instructions will be given for the entire flight. Landing clear-
     ance given for the lead aircraft will be landing clearance for trailing aircraft in the formation. Trail
     recovery clearance terminates at the landing threshold. Inform ATC when recovery order is differ-
     ent from numbering in flight (i.e., number 2 landing first). In this case, ensure aircraft in the lead
     position squawks Mode III/C assigned and the trail aircraft squawks Mode III/C 5400.
     4.12.4. Abnormal Procedures: Trail aircraft losing radar contact on preceding aircraft prior to a
     segment of the published approach will inform lead, climb 500 feet above last assigned altitude,
     and obtain a separate clearance from ATC. If contact is lost after established on a segment of the
     published approach, the approach may be continued if minimum separation can be confirmed by
     navigation aids. In the event of a breakout/go-around each flight will comply with specific instruc-
     tions issued by ATC. Aircraft executing missed approach will assume the preceding aircraft has
     also gone missed approach. If radar contact is lost with the preceding aircraft during a missed
     approach, execute the following instructions until receiving vectors from ATC:

   4.13. Functional Check Flight (FCF).
      4.13.1. Coordination.
          4.13.1.1. When the 35 FW Command Post receives notification of a proposed F-16 FCF, they
          shall immediately advise AM Ops of the estimated time of departure (ETD), call sign, and esti-
          mated time enroute (ETE) of the FCF.
          4.13.1.2. AM Ops shall file a local FCF flight plan and advise the Tower of the ETD, aircraft
          call sign, and the FCF route the aircraft shall fly.
          4.13.1.3. Misawa Tower shall advise Misawa RAPCON of the FCF flight plan information.
          RAPCON shall advise Sapporo ACC.
          4.13.1.4. FCF pilot shall:
               4.13.1.4.1. Squawk as assigned by ATC.
               4.13.1.4.2. Monitor the appropriate frequency as assigned by Misawa RAPCON or Sap-
               poro ACC.
               4.13.1.4.3. When outside or above Misawa RAPCON's airspace, remain within the air-
               space bounded by 4125N latitude (west edge of V22) and 3955N latitude (east edge of
               V11). The pilot shall not deviate from this airspace unless approved by Sapporo ACC. Fly
               all FCFs in VMC.
          4.13.1.5. Sapporo shall provide FCFs with radar traffic advisories to the maximum extent pos-
          sible within the airspace defined.

   4.14. Radar Traffic Patterns.
      4.14.1. Normal and minimum fuel radar traffic patterns are shown in Attachment 14.
      4.14.2. Due to high terrain west of the airfield, do not exceed 10.7 DME below 3,100 feet on
      downwind for Runway 10.
28                                                                             35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


NOTE: Do not overfly the large circular antenna field 1.5 NM northwest of Runway 10 below 2,000 feet
AGL.
        4.14.3. Formations are considered "standard" unless stated by flight lead that they are in a
        "non-standard formation." The last wingman should squawk 5400. The flight leader shall inform
        the RAPCON of their order of recovery and the wingman's call sign when split-ups are required.
        Prior to final approach, all pilots shall inform the RAPCON of their intentions after completing a
        low approach or touch and go.
        4.14.4. PAR procedures when airport surveillance radar (ASR) is inoperative:
           4.14.4.1. Approach Control shall transfer radio communications to the PAR final controller
           when an aircraft is approaching 17 DME fix on a TACAN (VOR/DME) final approach.
           4.14.4.2. Radar identification fixes and altitudes:
                       DME FIX         DISTANCE FROM TOUCHDOWN                         ALTITUDE


                       MIS107/9        (Rwy 28)        8.7 NM                          2000-3000
                       MIS281/10       (Rwy 10)        8.8 NM                          2200-3000
           4.14.4.3. Pilot procedures:
               4.14.4.3.1. The pilot shall execute the TACAN/VOR DME Approach and report heading
               and altitude to approach control at the radar identification fix.
               4.14.4.3.2. If radar contact is not established by 7 miles from touchdown and the weather
               is above the TACAN minimums, the pilot shall continue with the TACAN/VOR approach.
               4.14.4.3.3. If radar contact is not established by 7 miles from touchdown and the weather
               is below the TACAN minimums, the final controller shall inform the pilot that radar ser-
               vice is not available and request pilot's intentions.
     4.15. Break Out/Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
        4.15.1. Aircraft on final approach shall be issued go around or missed approach instructions as
        specified. Standard climbout procedures shall apply unless stipulated by ATC.
        4.15.2. When an aircraft is 4 miles or more on final approach, the control tower shall issue
        instructions to break the aircraft to the north, i.e. “Turn/Fly (left/right) (heading), Climb and main-
        tain (altitude).”
        4.15.3. When an aircraft is less than 4 miles on final, the control tower shall issue instructions to
        maintain runway heading at or below 1,600 feet.
        4.15.4. The control tower may break an arriving aircraft to the south if traffic conditions permit.
        4.15.5. Aircraft on an instrument approach or visual straight-in approach should be cleared for a
        landing maneuver or issued missed approach instructions no later than 2 miles from runway.
        4.15.6. Aircraft in the VFR pattern shall be issued go around instructions far enough from the run-
        way to allow the pilot time to execute a go around safely.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                   29


          4.15.6.1. Aircraft in a 360-degree overhead pattern should be cleared for a landing maneuver
          or issued go around instructions prior to the aircraft turning final.
          4.15.6.2. Aircraft flying in the VFR pattern should be cleared for a landing maneuver or
          issued go around instructions prior to the aircraft turning final.
       4.15.7. ATC shall issue go around instructions to an aircraft on final if it reaches a point within 2
       NM of the runway and there is an aircraft in takeoff position on the runway. The aircraft on the
       runway shall be told to hold position until the other aircraft is clear.
NOTE: Aircraft under RAPCON control shall not proceed beyond 3-mile final without tower clearance.
   4.16. Multiple Approach Procedures.
       4.16.1. When pilot requests multiple practice approaches, RAPCON may issue "climb-out as pub-
       lished." If the pilot is unfamiliar, Misawa climb-out procedures shall be issued.
       4.16.2. Standard Climb-out Instructions:
          4.16.2.1. Runway 28. Climb and maintain 1,600 feet until 3 DME, then turn right heading
          060.
          4.16.2.2. Runway 10. Climb and maintain 1,600 feet until 2 DME, then turn left heading 320.
   4.17. Landing Instructions.
       4.17.1. Aircraft Procedures. All aircraft returning to Misawa VFR should contact Misawa RAP-
       CON prior to entering Misawa Approach Control airspace. If radar service is not desired, the pilot
       shall be told to contact Misawa Tower for pattern entry and landing instructions after he/she
       reports the field in sight.
       4.17.2. Approach Control Procedures. Misawa RAPCON shall issue traffic pattern entry instruc-
       tions. Except when contained in the ATIS broadcast and the pilot states the appropriate ATIS
       broadcast code, these instructions shall include, but are not limited to:
          4.17.2.1. Runway in use.
          4.17.2.2. Surface winds.
          4.17.2.3. QNH (Altimeter).
          4.17.2.4. Instructions to enter a point in the traffic pattern.
          4.17.2.5. Request for additional position reports.
          4.17.2.6. Any additional information deemed necessary by ATC.
   4.18. Lost Communications Instructions.
       4.18.1. The phrase, "Lost comm as published" may be issued to pilots to reduce frequency con-
       gestion. If the pilot is unfamiliar, standard lost communications shall be issued.
       4.18.2. Standard Lost Communications.
          4.18.2.1. No Radios (NORDO) in the pattern. If no transmissions are received for more than
          30 seconds for RWY 10 (1 minute for RWY 28) during radar vectors to final, or for more than
          5 seconds/15 seconds once established on PAR/ASR final approach, the pilot shall maintain
30                                                                                35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


            VMC and attempt to contact Misawa Tower. If unable to maintain VMC, the pilot shall pro-
            ceed with a published instrument approach or previously coordinated instructions.
            4.18.2.2. IMC NORDO Recovery. Proceed to Shoju initial approach fix (IAF) for the runway
            of departure, at or above the minimum safe altitude and execute an instrument approach or
            previously coordinated instruction.
            4.18.2.3. VMC NORDO Recovery. Enter initial for the last know active runway at 1100 feet
            rocking wings. Break at departure end, climb to 2,100 feet for a normal downwind and look
            for a green light from the tower on base to final turn.
        4.18.3. Helicopter Lost Communications Procedures.
            4.18.3.1. In the event of lost communications with the controlling agency, pilots will squawk
            the appropriate codes and attempt to maintain VMC if able.
            4.18.3.2. If able to maintain VMC, pilots will navigate to the north side of the airfield, avoid-
            ing the local no-fly areas and entering a normal downwind for the active runway at 600 feet,
            looking for a green light from the Tower. Pilots will turn downwind and fly a normal pattern
            landing on the runway, if no red light is observed.
            4.18.3.3. If unable to maintain VMC, pilots will climb or descend to 4,000 feet and proceed to
            the IAF (OKADA) for the ILS Y Runway 28 regardless of the current active runway. Begin
            the approach immediately upon arrival. If the pilot determines the situation dictates a shorter
            approach, he/she may intercept the approach inside the IAF. Pilots will continue the published
            approach once started, even if VMC conditions are encountered. Pilots may fly a straight-in or
            a modified (tight) circling approach to land in either direction and should plan to touch down
            at the midfield marker. The approach should terminate to the ground via a run-on or other type
            landing as required.
     4.19. Helicopter Operating Procedures.
        4.19.1. Clearance to takeoff/land at a location other than a designated helicopter landing area may
        be granted by the Tower. However, the pilot shall ensure that a safe takeoff/landing can be made
        within the operating limitations of the aircraft. If an aircraft is taxiing near the helipad, the Tower
        shall give instructions to the aircraft to hold or terminate helicopter operations until taxiing aircraft
        are no longer a factor. Helicopters taking off or landing will avoid overflying taxiing/parked air-
        craft.
        4.19.2. Helicopters operating from/to any airport surface (hovering/takeoff/landing) will ensure
        no debris is blown onto airport surfaces. The crew will notify ground/tower if any debris is
        noticed.
        4.19.3. Clearance to land on Twy B will be interpreted as clearance to land anywhere on Bravo
        unless otherwise specified. For helicopters cleared for closed patterns to Bravo, early turnouts on
        upwind and early turns to base will be assumed unless otherwise directed by ATC. ATC will call
        traffic advisories (i.e., aircraft on final). Once a helicopter has called traffic in sight, the helicopter
        may be cleared to land and will avoid that traffic.
        4.19.4. Traffic, Transition, and Training Areas. The helicopter traffic and transition areas are
        located north of the runway. The pattern is rectangular and parallels the runway. Pattern altitudes
        are downwind 600 feet and crosswind 400 feet. Helicopters may conduct hover training with prior
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                   31


     coordination with the AFM and Tower approval. Due to the increased chance of foreign object
     damage (FOD), such operation shall take place only above the taxiway surface and not in the
     grassy areas surrounding the taxiway.
     4.19.5. Departures. Helicopters may depart in any direction as approved by Misawa Tower. Pilots
     shall avoid flying over parked aircraft or passing within 500 feet of buildings or other fixed obsta-
     cles.
     4.19.6. Autorotations/Running Landings. Tower clearance shall be received prior to conducting
     autorotations/running landings and shall be conducted on the active runway, or Twy B.
     4.19.7. Optional Helicopter Departures/Arrivals. Helicopter arrivals are flown at a maximum of
     600 feet unless Tower approves a higher altitude.
     4.19.8. Helicopter Emergency Procedure Training.
         4.19.8.1. Helicopter emergency procedure training will normally be performed on the active
         runway or to the approved helipad. If Twy B is clear and after coordination with AM, emer-
         gency procedures and landings/approaches may be made to Twy B to minimize congestion on
         the active runway (Pilots will make their request on downwind).
     4.19.9. Autorotations will be flown to either the active runway or to Twy B. Pilots will request
     "1,000 foot downwind for 180-degree autorotation" before climbing above 600 feet. Downwind/
     initial for 180-degree autorotations may be flown over Twy B. Base for 90-degree autorotations
     may be turned "inside" Twy B2 or B5 to ensure the approach doesn't terminate over the barrier.

NOTES:
         1. Once autorotation has begun, the pilot will not be asked to go around, except for safety of
            flight requirements or emergency aircraft.
         2. Tower will consider helicopters reporting "base for 90-degree" and/or "initial for
            180-degree auto" as on short final. Tower can expect the autorotation to begin immedi-
            ately after landing clearance is granted.
     4.19.10. Helicopter Local Area Operations.
         4.19.10.1. Traffic Avoidance: Helicopters are uniquely capable of avoiding traffic due to
         excellent visibility, low altitudes, slow airspeed, and maneuverability. Helicopters will nor-
         mally monitor Misawa Approach when within radio reception range for flight following. Traf-
         fic is normally a concern only if it will pass within 500 feet (altitude) and 3 miles (laterally).
         Once a helicopter has called the traffic in sight, it will be responsible for separation, and won't
         need an ATC vector to avoid the traffic.
         4.19.10.2. Water Operations: Helicopters will notify ATC when they will be performing water
         operations. When a helicopter is performing water operations, it will not normally monitor
         Misawa Approach due to the intensive amount of radio calls. ATC will call the helicopter on
         Guard if any traffic approaches within the ranges given above; the helicopter will acknowl-
         edge the call on Approach frequency.
  4.20. Hazardous Cargo. When Misawa Tower is advised an inbound aircraft is carrying hazardous
  cargo, Tower shall advise the aircraft on first contact to call AM Ops on pilot-to-dispatch frequency
32                                                                            35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


     (313.6 or 131.4 MHz) to verify load information. AM Ops shall pass the information to appropriate
     agencies. See Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Cargo/Ordnance Weapons, Chapter 10.
     4.21. Noise Abatement Procedures/Quiet Hours. Current directives require noise from aircraft opera-
     tions be controlled as much as possible with flight patterns and/or operating hours. Flight safety and
     mission accomplishment are paramount; however, the following guidelines shall be observed to the
     maximum extent possible, consistent with mission requirements and aircraft performance capability.
        4.21.1. After establishing a safe climb altitude, reduce power, and do not use afterburner or max-
        imum climb power until 10 NM from Misawa AB or 4,000 feet.
        4.21.2. Do not start a rejoin until 500 feet AGL. Aircraft will avoid overflight of Misawa City
        below 3,000 feet. If cleared for a turn, the south departure aircraft will delay turns until 3 DME for
        Runway 28 and 2 DME for Runway 10.
        4.21.3. Low altitude flight (below flight pattern altitude) should be avoided except when the mis-
        sion so requires.
        4.21.4. Supersonic flight over Japan is prohibited over land.
        4.21.5. Use of afterburner should be limited to that required for mission accomplishment and/or
        operational necessity. Afterburner use for takeoff should be discontinued as soon as safe altitude
        and speed permit.
        4.21.6. Training flights are discouraged on Sundays.
        4.21.7. Aircraft commanders shall minimize noise, consistent with aircraft safety and operational
        necessity.
        4.21.8. High power unsuppressed engine runs are prohibited during quiet hours, 2200-0600L
        daily.
            4.21.8.1. The 35 MXG/CC or Deputy is the waiver authority for the 13th and 14th Aircraft
            Maintenance Units engine run-ups above idle during quiet hours. Engine run requests will be
            coordinated with the MXG/CC or Deputy. Engine runs inside the engine suppression facility
            (hush house) do not require a waiver. Once approved, notify AM Ops (226-3110) who in turn
            will notify ATC.
            4.21.8.2. The 35 OG/CC is the waiver authority for all engine run-ups above idle on the south
            Transient Ramp during quiet hours. AM Ops will coordinate approval with the 35 OG/CC
            through the Wing Command Post.
            4.21.8.3. Navy P-3 Squadron engine run-ups above idle will first be coordinated and approved
            through the NAF/CC via the maintenance commander. Once approved through NAF/CC, AM
            Ops will coordinate and request final approval with the 35 OG/CC through the Wing Com-
            mand Post.
NOTE: All engine runs must contact Misawa Ground for notification prior to engine start. See paragraph
9.5. for additional information on maintenance engine runs.
        4.21.9. Both flight and ground operations should be held to a minimum during daily quiet hours.
        Night training flights should be limited to those necessary to fulfill assigned missions and main-
        tain aircrew proficiency, and efforts should be made to complete night flights not later than 2200L.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                33


     4.21.10. As depicted in the DoD Flight Information Publication, Supplement/Pacific, Australasia
     and Antarctica or as directed by 35 FW Public Affairs
  4.22. Practice Instrument Approaches. Pilots requesting practice approaches should annotate their
  request on their flight plan and advise RAPCON of the following information:
     4.22.1. Type and number of aircraft.
     4.22.2. Type of approach.
     4.22.3. Intentions after the approach.
  4.23. ATIS Operating Procedures. Operated by JASDF ATC. Operational Hours: Mon-Fri,
  0700-2000L. When deemed necessary by the RAPCON, the ATIS may be operated other than the nor-
  mal published operational hours due to local night or weekend flying.
     4.23.1. ATIS Information. The RAPCON will provide the following information using the ATIS
     system:
         4.23.1.1. Weather information including advisories and warnings. The cloud ceiling for Mis-
         awa will be specified in hundreds of feet. Prevailing visibility will be expressed in both kilo-
         meters and meters and statute miles and fractions thereof.
         4.23.1.2. Runway in use and type of approach to expect.
         4.23.1.3. Significant runway surface conditions and braking actions.
         4.23.1.4. Other necessary ATC information.
         4.23.1.5. Instructions for the pilot to acknowledge receipt of the ATIS broadcast.
     4.23.2. Flight leaders or aircraft commanders shall report receipt of the current ATIS broadcast on
     initial contact with the RAPCON or Tower with the specific ATIS phonetic alphabet code.

     4.25. BWC and Wildlife Dispersal.
        4.25.1. Declaring Authority: During 35 FW flight operations, the authority to declare a BWC is
        solely vested with the SOF. When a SOF is not on duty, AM Ops shift supervisor will be the
        declaring agency for upgrades to MODERATE or SEVERE in time critical situations. The declar-
        ing authority must use good judgment and often subjective means for determining the BWC. Ini-
        tial response should be to take the most conservative action until a better determination of the
        BWC can be made. Once a BWC other than LOW has been declared, the SOF or AM Ops (when
        the SOF is not on duty) may change the condition with updated information.
            4.25.1.1. Low: Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability of hazard.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                 35


        4.25.1.2. Moderate: Concentrations of bird’s observable in locations which represent a proba-
        ble hazard to safe flying operations. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies
        and extreme caution by aircrews. If possible, departure paths should be planned to avoid bird
        concentration areas and the necessity to conduct multiple approaches should be thoroughly
        evaluated before conducting such operations. F-16 formation takeoffs and landings are not
        authorized.
        4.25.1.3. Severe: Heavy concentration of birds on or immediately above the active runway or
        other specific location that represents an immediate hazard to safe flying operations. The area
        declared SEVERE shall be open only by specific pilot request and after thorough evaluation of
        mission requirements. All aircraft should delay departure until the BWC is downgraded and
        conduct one approach to a full stop upon arrival. If F-16 landings are directed, plan on full stop
        single ship landings.
     4.25.2. Wildlife Dispersal Operations.
        4.25.2.1. When notified of BWC MODERATE or SEVERE, AM personnel will immediately
        respond to the airfield to conduct bird dispersal operations using bioacoustic equipment, pyro-
        technics, or other available measures. BWC increases are considered an airfield emergency
        and you will respond with light bar and siren on as required.
        4.25.2.2. AM will provide the SOF and tower with an initial evaluation of the situation. Pro-
        vide an estimate of the time needed to disperse the birds or if circumstances will not allow for
        dispersing the birds in order to downgrade the condition. Keep the SOF and tower updated on
        results of bird dispersal operations.
        4.25.2.3. The Bird Abatement Team (BAT) Dispersal Operations: The BAT is comprised of
        AM and Wing Safety. The BAT will utilize any method of bird dispersal, including depreda-
        tion, to eliminate bird/wildlife hazards around the airfield. The BAT may be activated by the
        SOF or AM personnel when bird scare techniques are not successful by contacting the Wing
        Command Post.
  4.26. Airfield Snow Removal Operations.
     4.26.1. Taxiing During Snow Removal. Taxiway snow removal operations can be suspended by
     Misawa Ground Control to allow taxiing of aircraft. The SOF will work closely with Snow 1 and
     AM Ops to determine the taxiway RCR and decide when to let 35 FW assigned aircraft taxi when
     snow removal ops are ongoing.
     4.26.2. Runway snow removal operations shall be suspended at the request of Misawa Ground
     Control to allow:
        4.26.2.1. Landing of emergency aircraft.
        4.26.2.2. Launch of hot scramble aircraft.
        4.26.2.3. Launch of Patrol Squadron ready alert aircraft.
        4.26.2.4. Other operational launches (30 minutes prior notification required). Aircraft com-
        manders conducting operational (vice training) flights may determine runway conditions are
        acceptable for takeoff.

        4.26.3. Snow removal operations may be delayed via coordination with the AFM, AM Ops/
        JASDF Base Operations or Misawa Ground Control. At the request of Misawa Ground Control,
        the snow removal operations supervisor (USAF & JASDF) shall suspend all operations and evac-
        uate the runway immediately. Vehicles shall hold behind the runway hold short line, at least 100
        feet off the edge of the runway shoulder. The AFM/designated representative and/or 3 AW Aero-
        drome Officer (AO) shall make a runway inspection after snow removal is complete or suspended.
        The Tower shall hold all aircraft until the condition of the runway is received.
        4.26.4. Snow removal operations/priorities will be IAW 35 FW Snow & Ice Removal Plan unless
        otherwise coordinated through the AFM.
     4.27. Large Force Employment (LFE) Procedures. LFEs will be coordinated and flown IAW the
     Local Operating Procedure between the 35 FW and Sapporo ACC.
     4.28. Aero Club Operations. Not applicable at Misawa AB.

        USFJ agencies shall be assigned a crash net station number shall be IAW AFI 13-203, Air Traffic
        Control, and AFI 13-213, Airfield Management. Any agency requiring assignment of a secondary
        crash net station shall fill out AF Form 3215, Communications-Computer Systems Require-
        ments Document, and send it to 35th Communications Squadron/Customer Service Center
        through the AFM. The AFM will make a recommendation to the 35 OSS/CC, IAW AFI 13-213,
        for approval/disapproval of all additions and deletions. All stations must be equipped with noise
        reduction feature that filters out background noise.
        5.1.2. Need for Early Warning. Early warning of possible emergency situations must be given to
        all appropriate base agencies. This precautionary action shall enable agencies to prepare and
        respond in a timely manner to actual emergency declaration, cable arrestment, and/or runway clo-
        sure. Only use the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and SCN to relay information critical to
        aircraft and airfield operations. Exercise information may be passed over the PCAS and the SCN
        when authorized by 35 OSS/CC.

     5.18. Airfield Fuel Spill Classifications/Procedures. AM Ops will ring out the SCN for all fuel spills
     classes when notified through a reliable source (e.g., Tower, CP, MOC, etc.).
        5.18.1. Class I spills involve an area less than 2 feet in any plane dimension. The using agency fire
        guards determine if the spill creates a fire hazard to aircraft or equipment. As a rule, Class I spills
        need only to be monitored until the aircraft is dispatched.
        5.18.2. Class II spills involve an area not over 10 feet in any plane dimension, or not over 50
        square feet in area, and not of a continuing spillage. Class II spills require using agency to post a
        fire guard and immediately notify the Fire Department through MOCC or AM Ops.
        5.18.3. Class III spills involve an area over 10 feet in any plane dimension, or over 50 square feet
        in area or of a continuing spillage. Post using agency fire guards and immediately notify the Fire
        Department through MOCC or AM Ops.
        5.18.4. Oil and hydraulic fluid spills shall be removed by the agency responsible for the spill.
     5.19. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.

        quency (243.0) for a test, lecture, or a demonstration, the Life Support Section shall advise AM
        Ops when the event shall start and end, and where it shall be held. The device shall not be keyed
        for more than three sweeps. Emergency locator transmitter testing is only authorized during the
        first 5 minutes of each hour.
NOTE: Several types of aircraft at Misawa have the capability to direction find (DF) on UHF signals.
     5.20. SOF Use of Guard Frequency. The SOF may use UHF guard (243.0) when an immediate emer-
     gency situation exists. All other uses for Guard (i.e., weather recalls) shall be coordinated through the
     Tower watch supervisor.
     5.21. Mishap Response. Units should not release names of individuals allegedly involved in an air-
     craft incident or accident to agencies outside US Air Force channels unless directed by their com-

     ditions and determine pertinent restrictions.
  9.5. Engine Test/Maintenance Run-up Procedures.
     9.5.1. All engine run-ups must be coordinated with AM Ops and Tower. To preclude unauthorized
     engine runs, MOCC shall inform AM Ops of a pending engine run-up. AM Ops shall notify the
     Tower prior to the start of the engine run-up. The run-up operator shall call Tower via radio and
     provide the aircraft's location, tail number, and type of engine run-up clearance desired (idle, take-
     off rated thrust, and so forth). The run-up operator shall monitor ground control frequency during
     the engine run and notify the Tower of termination. Tower shall in turn notify AM Ops of termina-
     tion time.
     9.5.2. During all engine runs, two-way radio contact with the Tower is mandatory. A spotter shall
     be on the ground to ensure jet/prop blast does not in any way create a hazard. The spotter shall
     keep visual and inter-phone contact with the cockpit/flight station for the duration of the engine
     run.

     engine(s) are clear. For takeoff rated thrust, particular attention shall be given to vehicle traffic.
     9.5.4. For engine runs after major fuel repairs, MOCC shall contact the Fire Department Control
     Center and request a standby vehicle. The fire department shall dispatch an appropriate Aircraft
     Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicle to the standby location. In the event an ARFF vehicle is not
     available, the Fire Department Control Center will request a JASDF crash vehicle to perform
     standby duties.
56                                                                             35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


        9.5.5. All run-ups in excess of the aircraft flight manual (preflight or post-flight) requirements,
        made by a flight crew as part of trouble shooting or operational checks, shall be considered main-
        tenance engine runs. In these instances, the aircraft shall taxi or be towed to the proper spot.
        9.5.6. During quiet hours, (2200L to 0600L daily), wing assigned (F-16) aircraft engine run-ups
        above idle will be coordinated with the appropriate maintenance commander. NAF Misawa engine
        runs during quiet hours will be coordinated and approved through the NAF Commanding Officer
        (CO) first prior to requesting final permission and approval through AM Ops. See also paragraph
        4.21.8. for additional information.
        EXCEPTION: Hush house engine runs, F-16 idle engine runs, and low power P-3 engine runs do
        not require waiver authority but must still be approved through AM Ops.
        9.5.7. Unauthorized engine runs shall be treated as a potential aircraft theft in accordance with 35
        FW AT/FP/S OPLAN.

        9.6.2.1. The AFM shall ensure:
            9.6.2.1.1. As a minimum, one airfield inspection is accomplished each day and a FOD/
            BASH check shall be made before the start of normal flying activity.
            9.6.2.1.2. As a minimum, one airfield check is accomplished each day to check nighttime
            airfield lighting serviceability.
            9.6.2.1.3. During periods of peak bird migration through the Misawa airfield, additional
            bird checks are accomplished at mid-day and just prior to sunset. During this period, bird
            siting surveys will be accomplished and forwarded to wing safety (35FW/SEF).
            9.6.2.1.4. Additional inspections/checks are made following high winds, heavy rains, air-
            craft arresting system engagements, reported/suspected blown tires, completion of grass
            mowing operations, or natural/manmade disaster involving the airfield.
            9.6.2.1.5. A monthly joint airfield inspection comprised of representatives from AM,
            ATC, Safety, SOF, Security Forces, and CE (waivers and pavements), will be accom-
            plished and documented.
                9.6.2.1.5.1. When deemed necessary, additional joint inspections may be accom-
                plished and documented. These inspection will normally be made just before, during,
                and at the end of each major construction, repair projects, or any other activity affect-
                ing the airfield environment and consist of members from AM, civil engineers, safety
                and other offices as required.
     9.6.3. During all inspections/checks, emphasis shall be placed on foreign objects, broken or
     burned-out lights, runway surface, ramp area pavement, or any other obstacles which might be a
     hazard to operations. All hazards/discrepancies found during an inspection shall be recorded in
     detail, to include the type of discrepancy, location, and estimated severity of the condition. Gen-
     eral conditions of the lighting system shall be noted. Any discrepancy found during hours of dark-
     ness which has not yet been corrected shall be made a matter of record.
     9.6.4. When FOD is reported or suspected on the runway:
        9.6.4.1. Tower shall:
            9.6.4.1.1. Suspend takeoffs and landings (except for emergency landings, rescues, and
            alert scrambles).
            9.6.4.1.2. Immediately notify AM Ops and RAPCON.
            9.6.4.1.3. Notify all aircraft under their control of the temporary runway closure.

NOTE: SOF has OG authority to waive an airfield inspection for FOD and emergencies. JASDF Wing
Operations Center (WOC) or Aerodrome Officer (AO) has the authority to waive airfield inspection after
an emergency if the 35 FW is not flying and the SOF is not in the tower/on duty. A drag chute released on
the runway is considered FOD.
        9.6.5. All airfield inspections/checks shall be documented on the PACAF Form 7 and on AF Form
        3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation, log in AM Ops. All outages, problems, and discrep-
        ancies found during an inspection/check, shall be documented and reported as required. Emer-
        gency deficiencies noted on all inspections shall be handled by service call; all others shall be
        handled by Civil Engineer Work Request, AF Form 332.
        9.6.6. When a reported discrepancy is a hazard, AM Ops shall notify the AFM, JASDF Base
        Operations Commander, JCAB, and associated flying units (as necessary).
            9.6.6.1. The AFM or designee will:
               9.6.6.1.1. Evaluate the hazard.
               9.6.6.1.2. Ensure proper reporting procedures are accomplished to notify the agency
               responsible for corrective action.
        9.6.7. The Tower shall be notified of any condition which could affect aircraft movement.
        9.6.8. When responding to an IFE and the SOF/WOC does not require an inspection, document
        the information to include the name of SOF on duty (or WOC for JASDF aircraft) and time. All
        SOF calls will be documented on AF IMT 3616.
     9.7. Taking of Photographs/Flightline Photo Pass Procedures.
        9.7.1. Photography within the permanent flightline and restricted areas is prohibited unless the
        request is coordinated and approved by 35 FW/Public Affairs.
NOTE: The AFM or designated representatives are exempt from approvals to take pictures of pave-
ments, airfield violations, and/or potential problems associated with the airfield, in-flight and ground
emergencies. Visual Information personnel in possession of a Photography Badge are authorized to take
photos of the flightline and restricted areas. Additional procedures are outlined in 35 FWI 31-101, Instal-
lation Security Instruction.
     9.8. Quiet Hour Procedures.
        9.8.1. Procedures. The 35 FW/CC delegates authority to the 35 OG/CC for implementation and
        execution of all quiet periods/field closures in accordance with this instruction.
            9.8.1.1. Request, Coordination, and Approval. All requests will be submitted by the respective
            OPR to the 35 OG/CC through 35 OSS/OSO (Scheduling Office) at least 30 days in advance
            of the event. The OPR for the ceremony should contact 35 OSS/OSO via phone (226-9134/
            3841), Fax (226-2868), or e-mail (35 OSS/OSO All Personnel) to provide all required infor-
            mation. Events for which HQ PACAF Public Affairs or Protocol are the OPR, should first be
            coordinated with the respective offices in the 35 FW prior to being submitted to 35 OSS/OSO
            . Once approved by the 35 OG/CC, 35 OSS/OSO will be responsible for notifying the OPR
            and the AFM (AM Ops). Misawa AM will then notify the following agencies of any field clo-
            sures and/or quiet periods, giving as much advance notice as possible:
               9.8.1.1.1. Air Traffic Control Tower.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                  59


            9.8.1.1.2. Command Post.
            9.8.1.1.3. Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC).
            9.8.1.1.4. Transient Alert.
            9.8.1.1.5. U.S. Navy tenant units.
            9.8.1.1.6. 13 FS.
            9.8.1.1.7. 14 FS.
        9.8.1.2. Execution. During field closures, all aircraft activity within Misawa’s airport/airspace
        will cease. If required, the SOF will coordinate with the 35 OG/CC or his designated represen-
        tative to delay the start of field closures/quiet periods to allow for DV arrivals/departures, to
        allow aircraft that have already taxied to takeoff, or to account for any other unanticipated
        occurrence. When quiet periods are imposed on only part of the airfield (i.e.; north or south
        ramp only), ATC will route aircraft so as to avoid the quiet area. If any event is concluded in
        less than the allotted time, the senior officer responsible for the event should contact AM Ops
        (226-3110) and/or Command Post personnel (226-9899) to allow the field to be reopened.
     9.8.2. Quiet Hour Categories.
        9.8.2.1. A quiet period will be classified as a Category One through Four event and should be
        associated with either the north or the south ramp where applicable. If in doubt, personnel
        should follow the most restrictive definition and obtain further guidance from 35 OSS/OSA at
        226-3110/3111.
            9.8.2.1.1. Category One: Field closed and all quiet for the entire field. All aircraft engines,
            AGE, and similar noisy equipment must be shut down for the designated time period.
            Vehicles that produce a low noise level may continue to operate on ramps and taxiways,
            but not in the immediate vicinity of the event (except for emergency vehicles and those
            vehicles required to transport passengers and participants to and from the area). This cate-
            gory will mainly be used for high-visibility events such as Wing Change of Command,
            concerts, etc.
            9.8.2.1.2. Category Two: Field closed. Vehicles that produce a low noise level may con-
            tinue to operate on ramps and taxiways, but not in the immediate vicinity of the ceremony
            (except for emergency vehicles and those vehicles required to transport passengers and
            participants to and from the area). This category will be used during most aerial demon-
            strations.
               9.8.2.1.2.1. North Ramp Event: No restrictions on south ramp.
               9.8.2.1.2.2. South Ramp Event: No restrictions on north ramp.
            9.8.2.1.3. Category Three: Straight-in landings will be allowed, after coordination/
            approval. No multiple approaches. Vehicles that produce a low noise level may continue to
            operate on ramps and taxiways, but not in the immediate vicinity of the event (except for
            emergency vehicles and those vehicles required to transport passengers and participants to
            and from the area).
               9.8.2.1.3.1. North Ramp Event: No taxi operations or engine/equipment runs except
               for EOR operations. Taxi from Runway 10/28 to squadron/transient parking is allowed
60                                                                           35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


                   provided the desired parking area or route to parking is not located near the event site.
                   No restrictions on south ramp.
                   9.8.2.1.3.2. South Ramp Event: Taxi operations to Runway 10/28 from the north ramp
                   are allowed. Engine/equipment runs are not allowed on the south ramp. This category
                   will be used for most events inside the static display hangar. No restrictions on north
                   ramp.
               9.8.2.1.4. Category Four: Field closed, but straight-in landings will be allowed. No multi-
               ple approaches. Taxi operations and idle engine runs are allowed on either ramp. Vehicles
               may continue to operate on ramps and taxiways. This category will mainly be used for
               events taking place at Risner Circle.
        9.8.3. Definitions.
           9.8.3.1. Field Closed. The entire airfield will be closed. No takeoffs or landings are permitted,
           except for aircraft involved in aerial demonstrations, or if the quiet period category modifies
           the closure as shown in paragraph 9.8.2.
NOTE: An aircraft with an in-flight emergency will always be permitted to land. In this case, the SOF
and or ATC will follow standard procedures regarding landing, taxiing, parking, etc., commensurate with
the emergency.
           9.8.3.2. Straight-in, Full Stop Landing. Aircraft will land via a straight-in approach and must
           hold at the End of Runway (EOR) until cleared to taxi to parking by the SOF or the 35 OG/CC.
        9.8.4. Safety. No procedure in this instruction will limit the exercise of good judgment on situa-
        tions involving flying or ground safety.

10. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo/Ordnance/Weapons
     10.1. Hazardous Cargo.
        10.1.1. All agencies at Misawa AB that submit hazardous cargo for air shipment, or anticipate
        reception of such cargo, shall provide AM Ops with the net explosive weight (NEW), Department
        of Defense classification, withdrawal distance, and fire fighting time. AM Ops shall relay this
        information to all appropriate agencies.
        10.1.2. Hot Cargo Area. The primary Hot Cargo Pad (HCP) is located at the north end of Twy C3,
        as depicted in Attachment 2. Alternate Hot Cargo Pads have been sited on the AMC Ramp and
        949 Ramp. See Table 1. for sighting requirements for HCPs.
        10.1.3. Procedures. Transient aircraft transporting hazardous cargo to the primary HCP shall pro-
        ceed to Twy B3 where a "Follow Me" vehicle will escort the aircraft to the HCP via Twy C3.
        NOTE: Transient Alert will ensure adequate wingtip clearance of aircraft transitioning to/from the
        HCP if there are aircraft parked in front of D54 and/or D58, and contact airfield operations for
        assistance/coordination in moving these aircraft (as required).
        10.1.4. All other use of the Hot Cargo Pad must be coordinated through AM Ops (35 OSS/OSA).
     10.2. Ordnance/Weapons Procedures.

        10.2.1.1. Loading is the physical positioning of the ordnance item on the aircraft and does not
        involve fusing and/or arming.
        10.2.1.2. Fusing is the physical positioning of a fusing device in the ordnance.
        10.2.1.3. Arming is the procedure which connects (electrically) the explosive unit to the air-
        craft, removal of safety pins, and plugging in the pig tail, or other procedures which render the
        unit ready to use, except that which is required to be activated by the pilot after becoming air-
        borne. In some cases, an electrical connection is a part of the loading procedure, but in each of
        these cases, there is a safety device or a similar action required to complete the arming or ren-
        der the unit operationally effective.
        10.2.1.4. De-arming is the procedure which renders the fusing device safe; disconnection of
        electrical circuit to the explosive unit, or any other means to ensure the explosive does not acti-
        vate.
        10.2.1.5. Downloading is the physical removal of the ordnance item from the aircraft and is
        preceded by de-arming.
        10.2.1.6. Hung ordnance is ordnance which cannot be fired or dropped because of weapon,
        rack, or circuit malfunction.

12. Anti-Hijack Procedures/Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy
     12.1. General.
        12.1.1. This chapter provides procedures to prevent the hijacking of United States Forces (USF)
        or Air Mobility Command (AMC) civil contract aircraft by overcoming the threat prior to taxi or
        takeoff.
        12.1.2. The hijacking threat posed to military aircraft requires continuing attention by command-
        ers at all levels to ensure safe and effective conduct of the USF mission. The hijacking of a USF
        aircraft could create a serious international incident and cause concern for the return of personnel
        and aircraft. Any attempt to hijack a USF aircraft shall be resisted. Resistance may vary from dis-
        suasion to direct physical confrontation. The decision on the course of action to be taken may have
        to be made on the spot by those faced with the actual situation, based on their best judgment of
        available factors and alternatives. Air Force policy emphasizes prevention and directs resistance.
        12.1.3. Aid to hijacked AMC civil contract aircraft and Japanese civil aircraft shall only be given
        as requested by the aircraft commander, contract administrator, or the Japan Civil Aviation
        Bureau.
     12.2. Responsibility and Procedures. The action to be taken in instances of attempted, threatened, sus-
     pected, or actual hijacking rests with the nature of the incident. Specific tasks within the area of
     responsibilities are as follows:
        12.2.1. The DAFM shall develop and coordinate procedures to resist unauthorized flight (35 FW
        AT/FP/S OPLAN).
        12.2.2. All personnel having knowledge of a suspected threat, actual hijacking, or theft of an air-
        craft shall immediately report the incident to AM Ops, Command Post, Security Police, or the
        MOCC. The Security Police, Command Post, or MOCC shall, in turn, notify AM Ops.
        12.2.3. AM Ops shall:
            12.2.3.1. Activate the secondary crash alarm system and pass all known information.
            12.2.3.2. If notification to AM Ops of suspected unauthorized aircraft movement is received
            by a source other than over the primary crash alarm system, AM Ops dispatcher shall contact
            Tower via hot line to confirm unauthorized movement prior to activation of the secondary
            crash alarm system.
            12.2.3.3. AM Ops is the only agency authorized to direct Initial Response Force actions
            against unauthorized aircraft movement.
            12.2.3.4. Notification over the secondary crash alarm system shall be made as follows: "AN
            UNAUTHORIZED AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT IS IN PROGRESS. THE AIRCRAFT IS A
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                 65


          (type), (tail number), (location), (heading), INITIAL RESPONSE FORCE - TAKE BLOCK-
          ING ACTION."
          12.2.3.5. In the event of failure of the secondary crash alarm system, 35th Security Forces
          Squadron Security Force Control Center (SFCC) may receive notification from AM Ops via
          hot line or land line, in that order.
       12.2.4. Tower personnel must take part in host base security by following directives covering the
       subject of unauthorized movements of aircraft. The Tower shall deny taxi clearance to any aircraft
       until a flight plan or other coordination has been accomplished with AM Ops. In the event of a
       known/suspected unauthorized aircraft movement, Tower shall notify AM Ops. Upon confirma-
       tion of unauthorized aircraft movement, Tower shall:
          12.2.4.1. Attempt to contact suspect aircraft.
          12.2.4.2. Direct all aircraft under Misawa Ground Control to "Hold Position" until termination
          of operation.
          12.2.4.3. Activate the primary crash alarm system when an unauthorized aircraft movement is
          determined or an attempt to contact the suspect aircraft is unsuccessful.
NOTE: If in the judgment of Tower personnel, a delay would result in the aircraft reaching the runway
prior to the Initial Response Force, earlier activation is authorized.
          12.2.4.4. When activating the primary crash alarm system, state:
              12.2.4.4.1. "Unauthorized aircraft movement in progress."
              12.2.4.4.2. Type of aircraft.
              12.2.4.4.3. Location.
              12.2.4.4.4. Direction of travel.
              12.2.4.4.5. Any other applicable information.
          12.2.4.5. Direct the Initial Response Force to the suspect aircraft as deemed necessary.
   12.3. Landing of Hijacked Aircraft. Requests for permission to land by hijacked non-US military and
   non-US civil aircraft shall be denied. US aircraft shall be allowed to land.
   12.4. No Flight Plan Arrivals. All aircraft with the intention of landing "full stop, ops stop, or
   taxi-back" operations at Misawa AB must have a flight plan on file with AM Ops.
       12.4.1. On notification of an inbound aircraft, to include helicopters without flight plan informa-
       tion on file, the Tower shall:
          12.4.1.1. Immediately notify AM Ops of the call sign, type aircraft, and any other known
          information.
          12.4.1.2. Time permitting; have the aircrew contact AM Ops via PTD.
          12.4.1.3. Request AM Ops to attempt to obtain a flight plan prior to Tower approving the
          landing of the no flight plan arrival.
66                                                                              35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


        12.4.2. For confirmed or unconfirmed no flight plan arrivals, the Tower shall direct the aircraft to
        the hot cargo area after landing. Helicopters shall be held on the landing helipad. The aircrew shall
        be advised to contact AM Ops on PTD frequency (313.6).
            12.4.2.1. AM Ops shall notify Central Security Control (CSC) via hotline to implement 35
            FW AT/FP/S OPLAN.
            12.4.2.2. For confirmed or unconfirmed no flight plan arrivals include all actions particularly
            those of the AFM shall act as on-scene commander or reference 35 FW AT/FP/S OPLAN.
            12.4.2.3. 35 SFS shall:
                12.4.2.3.1. Provide precautionary protection for priority resources.
                12.4.2.3.2. Cordon off the aircraft and set up an entry control point.
                12.4.2.3.3. Isolate and control crew members/passengers at the direction of the on-scene
                commander.
     12.5. Landing of third Country Aircraft.
        12.5.1. Because of the location of Misawa AB, the possibility of a third country aircraft landing
        here is very real. JASDF at Misawa AB and Chitose AB fulfill air defense requirements for the
        Northern Air Defense Force Sector and therefore shall respond accordingly should a third country
        aircraft attempt to land at Misawa AB.
        12.5.2. AM Ops will pass all pertinent information to the Command Post. Command Post will
        execute appropriate checklist(s).
        12.5.3. Any agency receiving information about a third country aircraft attempting to land at Mis-
        awa AB should contact AM Ops.
        12.5.4. The Tower shall not activate the primary crash alarm system, but shall relay all known
        information via the hot line to AM Ops.

13. Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP)
     13.1. General. The Commander, Naval Forces Japan will transmit an intent message to U.S. Forces
     Japan concurrently informing Misawa AB. U.S. Forces Japan will transmit the final plan to the 35 FW
     Commander.
     13.2. Jet Patterns.
        13.2.1. Rwy 28. Maintain 280 degrees until attaining 1,600 feet. At 1,600 feet, initiate turn to
        crosswind. Maintain 1,600 feet until past base housing area, descend to base leg altitude (1,100
        feet), then turn for base leg to initiate approach. On the first pass during a FCLP period, pilots shall
        call abeam with gear down, and fly the remainder of the pattern dirty. Aircraft shall then proceed
        down and commence a descending turn to roll out with 3/4 mile straight-away. The ball call shall
        be made, upon acquisition, to the landing system officer (LSO). After touch and go or low
        approach, aircraft shall continue on runway heading until reaching 1,600 feet and commence turn
        downwind to take proper spacing.
        13.2.2. Rwy 10. Altitudes are the same as above and the pattern is left traffic.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                    67


       13.2.3. Propeller Type Aircraft. Procedures are the same as paragraphs 13.2.1. and 13.2.2. above,
       except the pattern altitude is 1,100 feet and the 180o position is at 3/4 of a mile abeam.
       13.2.4. DELTA Pattern. The "DELTA" or overhead holding pattern shall be used to clear the pat-
       tern. The DELTA pattern is basically the same shape as the FCLP pattern at an altitude of 2,500
       feet or as assigned by the Tower according to weather conditions.
   13.3. Pattern Entry. The FCLP pattern shall be entered from either an instrument approach, a VFR
   entry, or a direct entry after takeoff as explained below.
       13.3.1. Instrument Approach Entry. On initial contact, aircraft shall inform Approach Control that
       entry into the FCLP pattern is desired. Approach Control shall coordinate with the Tower to
       sequence VFR and IFR aircraft. After a touch and go or low approach, aircraft shall be directed to
       switch to Tower frequency (as assigned). Pilots shall contact the Tower after switching frequen-
       cies and request downwind turn and FCLP entry. Pattern procedures and altitudes outlined in para-
       graph 13.2. apply.
       13.3.2. VFR Entry. Aircraft shall contact the Tower on assigned frequency when approaching the
       funnel IP for the break. Break altitude is 2,100 feet for jets (1,100 for props) descending to 1,100
       feet (800 for props) as indicated in paragraphs 13.2.1. and 13.2.2. above.
       13.3.3. Direct Entry. Aircraft shall hold short of the active runway and contact Tower on assigned
       frequency with number and type of aircraft, and request for direct entry into the FCLP pattern.
       Procedures in paragraph 13.2. above apply.
   13.4. Pattern Exit. Normal pattern exit shall be through final landing after an FCLP pass. Pilots shall
   call abeam for full stop landing on the last pass and shall receive clearance to land from the Tower.
   The pattern may also be exited via normal VFR departure, when requested from the Tower.
   13.5. Maximum Number of Aircraft.
       13.5.1. VFR Pattern. A maximum number of six aircraft are authorized in the pattern.
       13.5.2. Special VFR (SVFR) Pattern. A maximum number of four aircraft are authorized in the
       pattern.
NOTE: The Tower may limit the number of aircraft in the FCLP pattern due to congestion or anticipated
inbound traffic.
   13.6. Weather Criteria. Day or night visual FCLP patterns may be conducted as long as Misawa is
   operating under VMC. If IMC, FCLP aircraft may request SVFR from Approach Control, and when
   SVFR is approved, may conduct FCLP subject to the following restrictions:
       13.6.1. FCLP aircraft are required to have a ceiling of at least 2,100 feet and visibility of at least
       2 miles for SVFR approval.
       13.6.2. FCLP aircraft operating SVFR within the Control Zone shall maintain radio contact with
       Misawa Tower. In the event of radio failure, the pilot shall make a full-stop landing on the next
       approach.
       13.6.3. SVFR operations shall be suspended:
          13.6.3.1. 10 minutes prior to the ETA of an IFR flight, until it has landed, or has departed the
          control zone after a touch and go or low approach.
68                                                                             35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007


            13.6.3.2. 5 minutes prior to the takeoff of an IFR departure until it has left the control zone.
     13.7. Control.
        13.7.1. Misawa Control Zone is 5 NM radius of the airport extending from the surface up to and
        including 6,000 feet.
        13.7.2. Non-FCLP aircraft entering VFR shall take interval on FCLP pattern aircraft, as assigned
        by the Tower, and land in sequence.
        13.7.3. All FCLP aircraft shall have Tower clearance prior to entering the FCLP pattern. The
        Tower shall establish the pattern and coordinate the entry/departure of all aircraft. When estab-
        lished, the Tower may turn the FCLP pattern over to the LSO using the terminology, "Paddles,
        Tower, FCLP pattern released to your control."
        13.7.4. Misawa Tower shall have overall control and responsibility, and may take control of all
        aircraft whenever an emergency or inbound traffic requires. The Tower may resume full pattern
        control, using the terminology, "Paddles, Tower, Tower has control of the FCLP pattern."
        13.7.5. The LSO shall acknowledge receipt and termination of LSO control of the FCLP pattern.
        13.7.6. The Tower shall give initial clearance for touch and go's to each aircraft. Thereafter, no
        further permission for touch and go's is required from the Tower until the aircraft is ready for full
        stop at the completion of the FCLP period.
NOTE: As specified in OPNAVINST 3721.1H, LSOs are not classified as ATC personnel and shall not
be used to provide ATC services. Separation between FCLP aircraft, only within the FCLP pattern and
maintenance of pattern discipline, is the responsibility of the LSO. Misawa Tower retains final responsi-
bility and authority for the separation and control of aircraft in the airport traffic area, including the FCLP
pattern.
        13.7.7. All aircraft in the FCLP pattern shall have an operational two-way radio. Additionally, the
        LSO shall have an operational two-way radio in the LSO cart, and in the event of failure of the
        LSOs radio, the FCLP pattern shall be terminated.
     13.8. SVFR Procedures.
        13.8.1. An ATC clearance shall be issued to all aircraft entering the special VFR FCLP pattern.
        The clearance shall be issued using the terminology, "Cleared to enter the FCLP pattern, maintain
        SVFR conditions while in control zone."
        13.8.2. All aircraft in the SVFR FCLP pattern shall have an operational two-way radio. In the
        event of radio failure, the pilot shall maintain the interval and make a full stop landing on the next
        approach.
        13.8.3. The Tower shall establish the pattern and shall coordinate the entry and departure of all
        aircraft. When established, the Tower may turn the FCLP pattern over to the LSO.
        13.8.4. All aircraft shall comply with the provisions of paragraph 13.6.
        13.8.5. All external lights on bright with top anti-collision lights on (if selection is available) for
        all aircraft performing FCLP.
35FWI13-201 9 MAY 2007                                                                                      69


      13.8.6. Lights on bright and flash for all aircraft making landings or aircraft with radio failure
      desiring a final landing. In addition, aircraft with radio failure shall display taxi/landing lights on
      final.
   13.9. LSO Cart and Optical Landing System (OLS) Coordination. Navy must coordinate with the
   ATC Liaison who will notify the AFM and pertinent JASDF officials before placing the LSO cart or
   the OLS on the airfield.
      13.9.1. Navy assumes responsibility for safety of individuals in close proximity of the runway
      during OLS operations. Personal will not enter the runway surface and remain in constant radio
      communications with the ground controller and shall notify the ground controller of their final
      destination (FLOLS East or West) prior to towing OLS onto the taxiway.
      13.9.2. ATC shall advise of C-5 aircraft activities (i.e., taxing on the airfield and/or in flight within
      20 miles from the airport).
   13.10. Emergencies.
      13.10.1. Pilots experiencing emergencies away from the field while FCLP is in progress should
      inform Misawa Tower as soon as possible to allow low fuel state airborne aircraft to land prior to
      the emergency landing. When the emergency aircraft is within 5 miles straight in, the LSO, or
      Misawa Tower, shall inform all other aircraft to take interval, wave-off, or Delta if a fouled run-
      way is anticipated.
      13.10.2. Pilots declaring an emergency while in the FCLP pattern shall inform the LSO and
      Tower of the nature of the emergency and intended action. Pilots shall attempt to allow other pat-
      tern aircraft to make full stop landings prior to the emergency landing if an extended fouled run-
      way period is anticipated. Pilots requiring immediate landings shall be given priority.
   13.11. Night Operations. FCLP flights shall terminate not later than 2200L to comply with estab-
   lished quiet hours.
