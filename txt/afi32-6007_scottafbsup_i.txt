                                           Chapter 2

                                  CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT

2.1. Project Feasibility Determination
   2.1.1. Prior to the CSAF approval for the start of PH Project development a series of project
   criteria are checked to determine if a proposed installation’s housing is a candidate for
   privatization. The requirements stem from both statutory and OSD-level guidance and a
   project must meet or exceed all of the requirements before approval is granted. These criteria
   are again checked at the OSD concept approval and prior to congressional notification for
   award.
   2.1.2. The criteria include:
       2.1.2.1. The life-cycle cost of a project must be equal to or less for privatization than a
       traditional military construction and management approach. The current SAF/FM policy
       for life cycle costing for a housing privatization project can be found at the website in
       attachment A3.2.
       2.1.2.2. The government’s participation in a MHPI can not exceed 80% of the total value
       of the project in a debt transaction or 33% (cash investment)/ 45% (land or facilities
       investment) in an equity transaction in accordance with the law. The participation amount
       includes both the value of the housing conveyed and any scoring required supporting the
       project.
       2.1.2.3. The amount of the government direct loan, if authority is utilized, should be less
       than the proposed SO’s private loan amount(s). HQ AF/ILEH, SAF/FMC and OSD will
       consider an exception to this criterion on a case-by-case basis.
       2.1.2.4. The leverage calculation (equivalent military construction cost of a project
       divided by the amount of scored dollars required for the project) should be equal to or
       greater than 3 to 1; however, HQ AF and OSD will consider candidate projects with a
       leverage ratio less than 3 to 1 on a case-by-case basis.
       2.1.2.5. Final scoring reports shall be submitted to HQ USAF/ILE and SAF/FMC no
       later than 10 duty days after completion of negotiations and closing of a housing
       privatization transaction. HQ USAF/ILEH and SAF/FMC shall approve any changes to
       the loan terms of a project during negotiations or redistribution of proceeds prior to
       signing the final closure documents.
2.2. Site Visits.
   2.2.1. Installations and MAJCOMs will work with the PSC’s via AFCEE, to schedule visits
   to meet project milestones.
   2.2.2. Installations and MAJCOMs will maximize IPT participation during the PSC and
   AFCEE visits to ensure that visit objectives are achieved and the project meets installation
   requirements.
   2.2.3. The Air Force will provide timely Government-furnished materials and comments on
   PSC deliverables.
 16                                         AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011


2.3. Program Adjustments.
   2.3.1. Projects approved in the FHMP will be executed in the fiscal year of appropriation
   and will not be accelerated or deferred without specific approval of the AF/ILE. Once the DD
   Form 1391 is provided to Congress for authorization and appropriation, projects will be
   subject to military construction (MILCON) procedures for scope, cost changes, and
   approvals. After OSD concept approval, no substantive changes shall be made to a project’s
   scope or scoring without written approval from HQ USAF/ILEH, ILE or IEI per published
   guidelines, reference AF/ILE ltr of 17 Nov 03. This approval must be obtained prior to the
   issuance of any substantive solicitation amendments that modify the scope of the project.
   Congress will be notified of changes to the projects when the congressional notification of
   intent to solicit is issued.
   2.3.2. The DD Form 1391 will document and control all PH project accountability. Scoring
   or scope changes of 15 percent or less require approval by AF/ILEH, greater than 15 percent
   and up to 25 percent require approval by AF/ILE and greater than 25 percent require
   approval by SAF/IEI and prior congressional notification. The MAJCOM/CE will submit any
   request for change to the appropriate level. A ―marked-up‖ DD Form 1391 must accompany
   the request.
   2.3.3. The MAJCOM/CE will forward to the ESG a proposed development and solicitation
   schedule for approval no later than one month after the CSAF approves an MHPI project for
   inclusion in the Family Housing Master Plan. Any subsequent changes to a project’s
   schedule must be submitted in writing by the MAJCOM/CE to the AF/ILE for approval.
2.4. Project Inserts. To insert a candidate privatization project, MAJCOMs will forward their
request to AF/ILEH for action. Inserts may be difficult to accomplish based on the lack of
appropriated dollars to cover scored costs and budgeted P727 dollars to cover development costs.
2.5. Project Cancellation. When privatization is no longer practical for a housing project
identified in the FHMP as a privatization candidate, the MAJCOM/CC will send a memorandum
to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Installations and Logistics (AF/IL) requesting cancellation of the
project (providing a full justification for the decision) and authority to proceed with the
alternative MILCON identified in DD Form 1391. The funding of design funds to affect the
MILCON project will be the responsibility of the MAJCOM.
2.6. Program Reporting. By the end of every quarter, AFCEE and each MAJCOM will
provide updated milestones to AF/ILEH on its active projects, to include environmental impact
analysis process completion dates, projected and actual OSD concept approval dates,
congressional notifications (solicitation and award) and closing dates. Any changes to the
milestones will be in accordance with 2.3.3. AFCEE will provide updated PSC consultant and
portfolio management costs at the same time. AF/ILEHM will consolidate the dates and costs,
provide a narrative update and coordinate the package through the CSAF and the Secretary of the
Air Force (SECAF) before sending to OSD (H&CS).
2.7. Unsolicited Proposals. Unsolicited proposals may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Each unsolicited proposal should be considered to determine whether the proposal will:
   2.7.1. Not exceed the entire housing requirement of the installation, as identified in the most
   recent housing requirements and market analysis (HRMA), unless the proposal delineates
   how the Government will provide no direct or in-direct funding to additional construction

   2.7.2. Prove financially feasible as documented in a pro forma and be financially acceptable
   to the Government as documented in an economic analysis.
   2.7.3. Meet existing privatization project criteria, e.g., participation, life cycle cost, and
   leverage.
   2.7.4. Offer a unique or innovative approach that cannot be offered by others in private
   industry or the public community. Unique approaches and competition will be validated by
   the results of an Air Force request for interest (RFI). AF/ILE will pursue approvals through
   the Air Force IPT, ESG, CSAF, and DUSD (I&E), as deemed necessary.
   2.7.5. Be prepared without Government supervision, endorsement, direction, or direct
   Government involvement, but instead independently originated and developed by the offeror.
   2.7.6. Not be an advance proposal for a known privatization requirement that can be
   achieved through competitive methods.
2.8. Standardizing Reports and Briefs.
   2.8.1. When preparing briefings for the Air Force or OSD, MAJCOMs will follow the
   standard format found on the AFCEE Web site at attachment A3.4.
   2.8.2. The MAJCOM/CE will review and approve all reports or briefings prior to submission
   to the ESG, OSD or Congress.
2.9. Waivers. Waivers to policy identified in paragraph 4.2.14 must be requested by installation
commanders via MAJCOM/CEs to AF/ILEH.
2.10. Inherently Governmental Activities. The Government cannot contract out its fiduciary
or decision-making responsibilities to a contractor. Following are representative examples, which
are not all-inclusive, illustrating some of the inherently governmental activities the PSC may not
perform:
   2.10.1. Giving legal advice to Government.
   2.10.2. Approving the draft and final request for proposal (RFP).
   2.10.3. Determining whether a proposal complies with the RFP.
   2.10.4. Amending or interpreting the RFP.
   2.10.5. Deciding to exclude/include offeror from step one or whether to exclude any offeror
   from the competitive range in step two.

   2.10.13. Entering into legally binding agreements on behalf of the Government, and giving
   legal advice thereon.
   2.10.14. Determining whether an offer or amendment was submitted on time.
   2.10.15. Approving the need for and content of evaluation notices, clarifications, oral
   discussions or negotiations.
   2.10.16. Deciding to terminate efforts to close a transaction, or selecting a next-in-line best
   value offeror with whom to attempt closing.
   2.10.17. Validating an unsolicited proposal.
   2.10.18. Complying with those functions applicable to the EIAP, as generally described in
   32 CFR 989 and AFI 32-7061.
2.11. Phase I – Project Identification Key Components.
   2.11.1. Housing Requirements and Marketing Analysis (HRMA).
      2.11.1.1. The HRMA determines accompanied and unaccompanied housing
      requirements (E4 and higher with more than 3 years time in service) at an installation.
      HRMA results identify housing requirements by rank and number of bedrooms for 5
      years in the future. It is conducted at least every 3 years or when there is a major mission
      change.
      2.11.1.2. HRMAs are reviewed and approved by the installation commander, MAJCOM,
      and AF/ILEH. Installations and MAJCOMs will validate deviations from an approved
      HRMA to AF/ILEH.
   2.11.2. Housing Community Profile (HCP).
      2.11.2.1. The HCP documents the condition of military family housing, identifies
      construction requirements to bring housing and communities up to Air Force standards,
      and analyzes whether improvement or replacement investment is the most economical
      decision. The HCP represents the minimum military housing construction requirements
      and is the basis for privatization project development decisions. An HCP update will not
      be completed for those bases where the housing is fully privatized. HCP updates in
      progress at the time privatization project development is initiated will be completed
      through the installation commander’s approval of the 50 percent submittal of the HCP
      update document.
   2.11.3. Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP).
      2.11.3.1. The Air Force FHMP articulates the Air Force housing investment strategy and
      identifies privatization candidates, anticipated scored cost, scope and year of execution.
      The FHMP incorporates information from the HRMA and the Housing Community
      Profile (HCP) to estimate the required scoring cost for privatization. It is used by the Air
      Force to prepare the Program Objective Memoranda (POM) and Budget Estimate
      Submission (BES).
      2.11.3.2. FHMPs are reviewed and approved by the installation, MAJCOM, AF/ILEH,
      CSAF and SECAF. Installations and MAJCOMs will validate deviations from an
      approved FHMP to AF/ILEH.
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                        19


   2.11.4. Project Programming (DD 1391).
      2.11.4.1. Purpose. The purpose of the DD 1391 is to acquire authorization for the project
      and funding appropriations for scoring cost, if any, associated with a PH project. The DD
      1391 identifies the project end-state scope (number of units resulting from demolition,
      renovation, and construction) and the estimated scoring cost documented in the FHMP. It
      also includes the scope of traditional MILCON projects that could be accomplished with
      the available funding if the privatization initiative proves infeasible.
      2.11.4.2. Approvals. DD Form 1391s are reviewed and approved by the installation, the
      MAJCOM, and AF/ILEH. DD Form 1391s for PH are submitted by the installation,
      through the MAJCOM to AF/ILEH as part of the same budget cycle as other FH DD
      1391s. Any changes to an approved DD Form 1391 will conform to paragraph 2.3.2.
2.12. Phase II – Project Definition Key Components
   2.12.1. Preliminary Pro Forma.
      2.12.1.1. The preliminary pro forma determines if the project is economically feasible
      from a private developer perspective and calculates scoring cost. It provides one feasible
      solution and as such, it serves as a Government estimate.
      2.12.1.2. The pro forma is reviewed and approved by the installation, MAJCOM,
      AFCEE, AF/ILEH, and the SAF/FMCE. AFCEE will validate pro forma deviations from
      policy and guidance to AF/ILEH and SAF/FMC. It is vital that all information be shared
      among these offices as pro formas are developed. Installations and MAJCOMs validate
      and receive approval from AF/ILEH when pro forma scoring cost exceeds the estimated
      scoring cost from the FHMP. Any updates to the pro forma must be reviewed and
      validated by AFCEE. AF/ILEH will work with the MAJCOM to source additional funds,
      if required, and notify SAF/FMBIC of the funding changes. Any funds in excess of the
      scored cost, but less than the programmed amount to meet other AF requirements, belong
      to AF/ILEH. SAF/FM guidance on preparing a preliminary pro forma is available at
      attachment A3.2.
   2.12.2. Preliminary Economic Analysis (EA).
      2.12.2.1. The EA is a tool to evaluate the viability of the privatization scope as compared
      to other alternatives available to the Government to revitalize the housing and is prepared
      by the PSC. It uses the project modeled by the pro forma for the privatization alternative.
      The EA calculates the life-cycle costs for various methods the Government could use to
      achieve its housing goal of revitalizing deteriorated housing (i.e., privatization and
      identical MILCON). Refer to AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, and SAF/FM guidance on
      the web site at attachment A3.2.
20                                      AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011


     2.12.2.2. EAs prepared by the Project Development Team and reviewed, certified and
     approved by the installation and MAJCOM. It should then be reviewed and coordinated
     by AF/ILEH and SAF/FMCE. The MAJCOM will validate EA deviations from policy
     and guidance to SAF/FMCE. Updates will be reviewed by AFCEE. To continue pursuing
     privatization, installations and MAJCOMs will validate and receive ESG and OSD
     approval when the life-cycle cost of housing privatization exceeds the life-cycle cost of
     the identical MILCON alternative. SAF/FM guidance on preparing a life-cycle cost
     analysis is available at attachment A3.2.
  2.12.3. Concept Plan Brief.
     2.12.3.1. The purpose of the Concept Plan Brief is for installation’s parent MAJCOM to
     present the PH project scope (number and type of units, type of work, ranks), authorities,
     transaction documents, pro forma and EA results, and milestones to the ESG and DUSD
     (I&E) for concept approval.
     2.12.3.2. AFCEE contracts to prepare the Concept Plan Brief. The MAJCOM staff
     presents the Concept Plan Brief to higher authority. Concept Plan Briefs are reviewed and
     approved by the installation, the MAJCOM, AF/ILEH, the Air Force IPT, the ESG, the
     CSAF, OSD(CS&P), and DUSD(I&E). MAJCOMs will coordinate any deviations to the
     standard Concept Plan Brief with AF/ILEHM prior to presentation. The format for the
     OSD Template is available on the OSD web site at attachment A3.1.
  2.12.4. Request for Proposal (RFP).
     2.12.4.1. The purpose of the RFP is to describe the existing conditions, project
     requirements, proposal submittal requirements, and evaluation standards to industry.
     2.12.4.2. The most current version of the generic RFP is mandatory for projects. The
     most current version of the generic RFP can be found on the AFCEE Web site at
     attachment A3.5.3.
     2.12.4.3. Approvals. RFPs, including revised financials, are reviewed and approved by
     the installation and the MAJCOM, then forwarded to AF/ILEH for review and approval
     by the AFIPT, ESG, and OSD. Once AF/IPT and OSD approvals are received, SAF/IEI
     and SAF/FMB will notify Congress of the intent to solicit the project.
     2.12.4.4. Any agency can recommend changes to the Generic RFP. Proposed changes
     should be forwarded to AFCEE/HDP for review. AFCEE will review and evaluate the
     proposed change and, if recommended, they will forward to the ESG for approval.
  2.12.5. Credit Scoring Report.
     2.12.5.1. The purpose of the Preliminary Credit Scoring Report is to provide insight into
     the impacts of budget scoring when offering federal credit for housing privatization. This
     report must be prepared using the latest version of the OMB Credit Subsidy Calculator.
     2.12.5.2. The most current guidance and template for the Budget Scoring Analysis can
     be located in the SAF/FM web site identified in attachment A3.2.
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                     21


     2.12.5.3. Approvals. The MAJCOM execution office or their appropriate Privatization
     Support Contractor will create the Credit Scoring report. The report will be reviewed and
     approved by AF/ILEH, SAF/FMCE, the ESG and OSD. Once the ESG and OSD
     approvals are received, SAF/IEI and SAF/FMB will notify Congress of the intent to
     solicit the project.

                                          Chapter 3

                                        EXECUTION

3.1. Phase III – Project Acquisition Key Components.
   3.1.1. Industry Forum.
      3.1.1.1. The purpose of the Industry Forum is to communicate the project requirements
      and receive comments from industry and local government officials. The forum is
      presented as a coordinated effort between the MAJCOM program manager, installation
      leadership, and privatization support contractor to educate the local community,
      interested private companies and other functions on the aspects of an installation’s
      privatization initiative. It is not mandatory that an Industry Forum be held, but it is
      encouraged. Experience has shown that Industry Forums provide an opportunity to
      present clarifying information from both Government and private sector teams.
      3.1.1.2. The Air Force, OSD, or Congress do not have to approve the content of the
      Industry Forum; however, an informal notice should be sent by AF/ILEHM through
      SAF/FML and SAF/LLP as a courtesy to congressional representatives and senators from
      the project’s district and state so they are aware of the upcoming project.
   3.1.2. Source Selection.
      3.1.2.1. The OPR for the Competition Plan (CP), or the Selection Plan (SP) when used
      for sole source transactions, policy and guidance is the execution agent. AFCEE is the
      OPR for the CP execution and provides supplemental guidance and templates. The
      MAJCOM is the OPR for the SP execution and provides supplemental guidance and
      templates. Evaluation teams consist of personnel from the installation, MAJCOM, and
      AFCEE, with advisors from the Air Force IPT and ESG.
      3.1.2.2. The selection briefing to the Air Force and OSD will follow the approved
      template at attachment A3.3. A briefing may not be required by OSD following the
      submission of the briefing slides, OSD will provide AF/ILEH that determination.
      3.1.2.3. The selection process is financed using P727 funds. MAJCOM’s will program,
      forecast and control these funds through the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and
      Execution System and Financial Plan processes.
      3.1.2.4. Approvals.
          3.1.2.4.1. SAF/IEI may delegate to the respective MAJCOM commander by project,
          the authority to solicit, evaluate, and negotiate final agreements, to select an offeror
          for final closing of approved family PH initiatives, to administer the housing project,
          and to require members who lease housing units to make lease payments through pay
          allotments pursuant to 10 U.S.C.§ 2882. This delegated authority is subject to
          limitations and conditions in paragraphs 3.1.2.4.2 and 3.1.2.4.3. AF/ILEH may
          request SAF/IEI delegation following ESG approval of the concept.
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                          23


          3.1.2.4.2. The MAJCOM commander may redelegate authority for selecting an
          offeror for final closing to the vice commander, however, further delegation of
          selection authority is not allowed. The MAJCOM vice commander can redelegate
          approval authority to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer for actions leading up to the final
          source selection.
          3.1.2.4.3. The AST may submit a recommendation for the final selection to the SA
          for approval. In turn, after receiving SAF/FMCE approval of all updated financial
          data (including final certified EA and pro forma based on details provided by the SO,
          and the final Budget Scoring Analysis), the SA submits their final selection to
          SAF/IEI for authorization to close. MAJCOM’s will provide all advance information
          AF/ILEH for review and transmittal to OSD(H&CS) no less than 10 days prior to the
          OSD briefing on the selection.
   3.1.3. Transaction Closure.
      3.1.3.1. SAF/IEI has authority to approve the project with OSD(H&CS) concurrence.
      OSD(C) has authority to approve funds transfers to the Family Housing Improvement
      Fund (FHIF) once OMB has approved the scored amount for the project and
      Congressional Notification periods are complete.
      3.1.3.2. Following the selection and approvals by the ESG and OSD, congressional
      notification will be made of our intent to award the project. This notification period gives
      congressional members the opportunity to comment on the proposed award. During this
      period, the apparent SO will be notified of his proposed selection so negotiations on the
      final legal documents can commence that will lead to closing of the project. However, no
      tenant leases will be signed, no public announcements will be made, and no town hall
      meetings will be conducted identifying the probable SO until after the congressional
      notification period, as found in the latest report language or statute, has ended and
      approval is given by AF/ILEH to announce the SO.
3.2. Technical Requirements.
   3.2.1. Each privatization project should have a strategy to address how it will manage
   severable and nonseverable housing areas. Nonseverable housing areas should be filled first
   with military families. HQ USAF will move toward full base privatization initiatives,
   keeping financial and severability considerations in the equation. When long-term
   noneligible tenants become necessary and increased force protection risks arise from
   sustained non-DoD residency in waterfall scenarios, project solicitation documents shall
   require successful offers shall relocate installation fence lines and provide off-base access to
   severed housing areas. Relocation of installation boundary fence lines and off-base access
   road construction must be approved by SAF/IEI.
   3.2.2. Construction.
      3.2.2.1. PH will comply with all building codes, standards, regulations, and applicable
      local, county, state and federal laws unless specifically waived by the AF in writing. The
      Government will provide Title II construction oversight to ensure that local standards are
      met, but the SO has the responsibility for construction quality as specified in project
      solicitation or transaction documents.
24                                         AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011


     3.2.2.2. New construction or whole-house renovations of PH will comply with the
     accessibility guidelines of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) of 1988. The Uniform Federal
     Accessibility Standards (UFAS) do not strictly apply; however, installations have the
     latitude to require that new construction and whole-house renovations comply with the
     UFAS as well as the FHA (whichever is more stringent where the standards differ).
     3.2.2.3. The maximum density for new construction shall not exceed six duplex or
     multiplex units per acre and no more than four single-family units per acre.
     3.2.2.4. Project solicitation documents shall require installation and apparent SO
     personnel will conduct a visual inspection of all lead-based paint containing components
     and areas within housing targeted for privatization prior to conveyance of the housing
     from the AF to the SO. Any lead-based hazards identified will be eliminated prior to
     conveyance of the housing using P-722 funding. The AST will ensure SO’s renovation
     plans call for all lead-based paint to be abated during the SO’s initial renovation and
     construction period.
     3.2.2.5. The project solicitation documents shall require the SO be responsible for
     inquiring as to whether the Government has records of the location, type, quantity, and
     characteristics of Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) in any family housing unit or
     other leased structures prior to renovation, maintenance, repairs, or construction that may
     disturb suspect materials. If the Government does not have adequate records to
     substantiate the status or presence of ACM, the project solicitation documents shall
     require the SO to obtain the necessary confirmatory samples and obtain analysis by a
     state certified laboratory for the analysis of bulk materials for asbestos. The Government
     shall not be responsible for any handling, removal or containment of ACM, or to the
     extent consistent with applicable law, for any liability related thereto. The project
     solicitation documents shall require the SO perform any and all asbestos work in
     accordance with all applicable laws, the SO be responsible for removal and disposal of all
     ACM in the improvements on the Leased Premises, and incorporate a disposal plan,
     which identifies the proposed disposal site. All records pertaining to asbestos/lead must
     be safeguarded IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule and record keeping
     requirements.
  3.2.3. Utility Privatization. If the base utility system and military family housing are both
  being privatized, utilities in the housing area shall be included in the HP RFP when the
  inclusion of the utilities is logical and technically feasible. HQ AFCESA/CC will be the
  primary authority for feasibility determination with HQ AFCEE/CC as the coordinating
  authority. If the base utility system is not being privatized or if the utilities in the housing
  area will be privatized separate from the base system, The installation and MAJCOM will
  first look to convey the utility systems within the housing system to the SO as part of the HP
  transaction. (If it is not possible to convey the housing system to the SO they will look to
  create consider a utility billing arrangement such that the SO pays secures service from the
  local market utility provider.) If delivery is through the installation’s infrastructure, the local
  utility provider will rates and reimburses the Air Force for any wheeling charges. incurred as
  the utility pass through the installation’s infrastructure. If necessary neither arrangement is
  possible the installation and MAJCOM will structure the transaction so that the SO is
  provided utility service by reimburses the installation on a reimbursable basis in accordance
  with AFI 32-1061, Providing Utilities to US Air Force Installations. or utilities privatization
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                          25


   contractor for all appropriate charges. Bases receiving Western Area Power Administration
   (WAPA) electricity should contact AFCESA/CESM to ensure that privatization will not
   result in loss of the low cost WAPA power allocation.
   3.2.4. Ancillary Facilities.
      3.2.4.1. Ancillary facilities may be provided as part of privatization projects if they
      primarily serve the residents, and if the SO does not charge for the use of these facilities.
      3.2.4.2. Housing offices and maintenance facilities for SO management and key
      maintenance staff may be project requirements.
      3.2.4.3. Ancillary facilities may include community centers, swimming pools, and other
      recreational areas.
      3.2.4.4. By law, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), the Defense
      Commissary Agency (DeCA), and the installation Services have the exclusive right to
      provide resale merchandise, services, and recreational operations or activities on DoD
      installations and Air Force housing privatization projects. The project solicitation
      documents shall preclude the SO from providing any resale merchandise, services, or
      commercial recreational operations or activities unless approved by the appropriate
      authority (i.e. AF/ILV or Commander, Defense Commissary Agency).
      3.2.4.5. Facilities owned or occupied by these entities can be included in privatization
      initiatives with the approval of AF/ILV and the appropriate Boards. The project
      solicitation documents shall require the SO compensate AAFES, DeCA, and the
      installation nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) for the undepreciated or
      surcharge investment in any facilities or improvements conveyed with the project where
      these entities have an investment.
   3.2.5. The EIAP process must start early in the privatization concept development and
   continue throughout the privatization process in accordance with 32 CFR 989 and all
   applicable regulations. Prior to executing the Transaction Documents, both an EBS and
   Environmental Assessment will be executed. If the EBS designates the land in the project to
   be either category 5 or 6, the project may not be conveyed; however, it may be leased. If the
   land is designated category 7, use of that land for PH is not authorized until the category is
   upgraded.
3.3. Transaction Structuring
   3.3.1. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) or Non-FAR. Air Force housing privatization
   is primarily a real estate transaction not funded directly from appropriated funds and, thus,
   the FAR does not apply to the transaction. However, components of the transactions have
   processes that may be deemed ―FAR-like.‖ As such, Installation and MAJCOM JAs should
   consult the FAR for guidance when determining the best course of action when addressing
   FAR-like issues.
   3.3.2. Long-term Leases. To the extent practicable, projects will use long-term ground leases
   and avoid conveyance of land underlying existing housing or other Government land.
   Exceptions, including finances, current and future land use, and school impact aid issues, will
   be fully justified in the Concept Plan Brief.
 26                                       AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011


   3.3.3. Legal Jurisdiction of Federal Property. Legal jurisdiction of Federal property can be
   exclusive, proprietary, or concurrent as defined by AFH 32-9007, Managing Air Force Real
   Property. Installations may have different jurisdictions on different real estate parcels.
   Jurisdictional status is subject to change at the discretion of the Federal and state
   governments. Jurisdiction is not changed by leasing property but may change when
   conveying property.
   3.3.4. To calculate the appropriate utility allowance, the PDT should determine the cost per
   unit type for electricity and gas or heating oil for each type of unit to be privatized. Costs
   should be calculated using a five-year average of past usage and charges based on the
   installation’s current utility rate changed Non-DoD/Non-Federal organizations for use in
   formulating the project’s conceptual pro forma. The plan for the SO to provide utility service
   to tenants may be a cause for concern to the local utility and/or state regulatory utility
   commission. The MAJCOM should consult with the AFCESA Utility Rates Management
   Team if there are utility regulatory or utility contract problems encountered in the housing
   privatization process at least six months prior to solicitation. The project solicitation
   documents shall require the SO, recalculate the utility allowance recalculated following
   completion of a major renovation or construction phase of the project or on an annual basis.
   The installation commander will approve recalculated rates.
   3.3.5. General Officer Quarters (GOQ), Special Command Positions (SCP), Designated
   Quarters, and Prestige Housing.
      3.3.5.1. Project transaction documents will incorporate special requirements for GOQs,
      SCPs, E-9 prestige housing, and other designated quarters as determined by the
      installation supplement to AFI 32-6001.
      3.3.5.2. Certain areas or groups of houses may be identified as designated quarters,
      however, the installation commander reserves the right to refer individuals identified as
      K&E to PH.
      3.3.5.3. The project solicitation documents shall require any GOQ, SCP, designated, and
      E-9 prestige housing quarters not count toward the vacancy rate when determining if the
      SO applies the priority fill list in 4.2.15.3.5.
3.4. Execution Funding and Use of Funds.
   3.4.1. Scored Costs.
      3.4.1.1. Scored costs are funded from the specific appropriation for the PH initiative and
      are transferred into the FHIF no sooner than 30 days after congressional notification by
      the OSD(C). Transfer of funds notification should occur concurrently with the
      congressional notification of intent to award.
      3.4.1.2. OSD(C) Directorate of Military Construction requests transfer of funds authority
      from the Senate Appropriations Committee (SAC) and House Appropriations Committee
      (HAC). OUSD(C) Construction Directorate prepares letters for signature.
      3.4.1.3. Scored costs are funded using P713 funds unless P711 funds have already been
      appropriated.

   3.4.2. Family Housing Privatization (P727) Funds.
       3.4.2.1. A sub-project of the Family Housing Operations Budget Programs Activity
       Codes (BPAC) (P727) will be the sole source of funds used to develop, acquire, and
       execute housing privatization. This sub-project is considered a congressional interest item
       and will not be increased from the amount enacted without prior approval of the
       congressional appropriations committees. BPAC P727 provides costs for:
          3.4.2.1.1. Environmental assessments, baseline surveys or supplemental studies,
          initial pro forma and economic analysis development, and all required property
          surveys.
          3.4.2.1.2. Industry forums and RFPs.
          3.4.2.1.3. Project management office costs to include all contract costs, temporary
          duty (TDY), training and non-material support costs.

       contract requirements to support execution of an MHPI.
   3.4.3. Family Housing Operations (P721) Funds. P721 funds may be used to fund
   environmental surveys and studies; however, P721 funds may not be used to perform any
   abatement, remediation, or other environmental projects. Such projects will be funded with
   P722 or Housing Military Construction dollars. Other Government-specific functions
   associated with maintaining housing management operations are funded with another sub
   project within the FH operations and maintenance (O&M) appropriation budgeting process.
   The Housing Manager has the responsibility for budgeting for these funds. The FAS/Asset
   Manager will validate any P721 costs associated with PH.
3.5. Financial.
   3.5.1. Reserve and Escrow Accounts.
       3.5.1.1. The project solicitation documents and transaction documents shall require the
       SO set up a federally insured, interest bearing lockbox account with federally insured,
       interest bearing sub-accounts to provide for (a) operation of the property in accordance
       with the terms and provisions of the Air Force lease, (b) demolition, rehabilitation,
       construction and other work comprising the project, (c) funding of certain accounts
       described herein for the continued maintenance of the property as required by the Air
       Force lease, and (d) timely repayment of the construction, permanent and direct
       government loan and the payment of certain related fees and expenses. All project
       revenues generated by the transaction will flow through the lockbox account to the
       appropriate sub-account. The sub-accounts may include:
          3.5.1.1.1. Operating Reserve Account. An operating account maintained at a level
          equal to one-twelfth (8.33 percent) of the annual budgeted operating expenses.
          3.5.1.1.2. Impositions Reserve Account. An impositions escrow account maintained
          for estimated taxes and insurance premiums payable in the next 12 months. Insurance

     the capital repair and replacement plan approved by the Government. Replacement
     Reserves shall cover sustainment costs including annual maintenance and scheduled
     repair activities to maintain the inventory of real property assets through its expected
     service life. It also covers major repairs or replacement of facility components that are
     expected to occur periodically throughout the life cycle of facilities. This work
     includes regular roof replacement; refinishing of wall surfaces; repairing and
     replacement of heating and cooling systems; replacing tile and carpeting; and similar
     types of work. The Replacement Reserves shall not include restoration,
     modernization or historical preservation.
     3.5.1.1.5. Other Eligible Tenant Security Deposit Account. The project solicitation
     documents shall require a tenant security deposit account be maintained in
     accordance with local state laws for other than referred occupants. The project
     solicitation documents shall also specify that referred tenants not pay security or pet
     deposits.
     3.5.1.1.6. Utility Reserve Account (if applicable). The project solicitation documents
     shall specify that once the individual housing units have been metered, the Utilities
     Reserve Account will be used to cover any additional utility costs the residents paid
     out-of-pocket due to utility rate spikes in accordance with the transactional
     documents. The resident may apply to the SO for reimbursement of the overage
     amount paid to the utility providers due to utility rate spikes and once the
     reimbursement is approved, the SO will refund the difference.
     3.5.1.1.7. Reinvestment Account Funds.
        3.5.1.1.7.1. These funds are accumulated in the reinvestment account of a
        privatization project after all project obligations and debt service requirements are
        met.
        3.5.1.1.7.2. Funds are used for construction, operations, maintenance, demolition
        or quality of life and site enhancements to restore PH facilities accelerated
        deterioration due to lack of sustainment, excessive age, natural disaster (storm
        damage), fire, accident, or other causes. Reinvestment also includes alteration of
        facilities solely to implement new of higher standards (including regulatory
        changes), quality of life enhancements, to accommodate new functions, or to
        replace building components that typically last more than 50 years. Cost of each
        enhancement must include construction costs and any O&M costs required to
        support the improvement during the current budget year. Future budgets need to
        ensure the appropriate accounts project for projected O&M and capital repair or
        replacement costs.
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                        29


             3.5.1.1.7.3. Reinvestment Account funds will not be used for any construction,
             maintenance, operations, or demolition requirements addressed within another
             approved lockbox sub-account.
         3.5.1.1.8. Windfall Income Account (if applicable). A windfall income account will
         be established and will require the SO to establish and maintain a federally-insured,
         interest-bearing account into which the SO will deposit any windfall income. The
         lockbox agreement will specify when funds are to be deposited, and when, how, and
         why the funds are to be disbursed. Windfall income includes that portion of the SO’s
         gross income attributable to net decreases in members’ ―Out-of-Pocket‖ (OOP)
         payments as reflected in changes in BAH due to legislation or policy changes over the
         term of the project. The SO is not required to contribute to this account until the
         initial development is complete. Funds generated during the initial development will
         be utilized to reduce government participation (direct loan, scoring amount) in the
         approved Concept Scope.
         3.5.1.1.9. Performance Incentive Account. A performance incentive account
         (optional account) may be maintained to ensure the continued quality performance of
         the SO.
  3.5.2. Taxes.
     3.5.2.1. Project Concept Plan Briefs, RFPs, and proposals will ensure that tax
     consequences of the project, regardless of any jurisdictional changes or changes in state
     or local taxation legislation or policy, are the sole responsibility of the SO. SO proposals
     shall address the use made of any tax savings resulting from the difference of its final pro
     forma and actual tax liability.
     3.5.2.2. Appraisals will be required to be prepared, in most instances, by taxing
     authorities, within six months prior to closing when the Government is conveying land
     and/or improvements.
  3.5.3. Government Financing.
     3.5.3.1. Financing of PH construction is the responsibility of the SO. The Air Force will
     not provide a Government loan for construction financing.
     3.5.3.2. Only at the end of construction or at the end of a construction phase of a multi-
     year project will the Air Force grant permanent financing, typically as a second mortgage
     lender in a debt transaction. Debt transactions will meet all statutory requirements.
     3.5.3.3. Use of loan guarantees will be extremely selective and must be fully justified in
     the development of the concept. Justification will be included in the DD Form 1391, the
     preliminary scoring report, and the final scoring report.
  3.5.4. Financial Criteria.
     3.5.4.1. Net operating income (NOI) from existing units conveyed to the SO by the Air
     Force is considered a Government contribution to the project until the units are renovated
     or demolished. The pro forma and the scoring report will demonstrate that the NOI from
     existing units is fully used in the funding of construction or renovation.

     3.5.4.2. Pro forma data is considered source-selection sensitive and as such will not be
     released outside Government channels.
     3.5.4.3. The Government-estimated scored costs will not be publicly disclosed, unless
     approved by the ESG.
     3.5.4.4. OMB-furnished risk, recovery, and inflation rates will be used. AFCEE Housing
     Privatization Division (AFCEE/HDP) will notify each PSC as soon as it receives notice
     from SAF/FMC that rates have changed. For current rates, see the SAF/FMC web site at
     attachment A3.2.
     3.5.4.5. The Air Force may provide a direct long-term loan at OR below-market rates, in
     accordance with SAF/FM, OSD, and OMB policies. Refer to direct loan policy found on
     SAF/FM web site in attachment A3.2.

          4.1.5.4.4. Annual report detailing the findings of its annual site visit, including
          trends, comments, and recommendations.
          4.1.5.4.5. Report summarizing compliance for each project on a periodic basis.
          4.1.5.4.6. Financial reporting in conjunction with DFAS, as required by the Federal
          Credit Reform Act of 1990, Circular A-11, etc. to appropriate government offices.
          4.1.5.4.7. SO’s Extraordinary Costs or Expenditures report identifying any excessive
          costs by unit.
4.2. Operations and Management.
   4.2.1. Authorized Use. PH is intended to serve as single family dwellings, permanent
   occupancy of a PH unit by more than one family is not authorized. The prescribed use of PH
   can be found in the transactional documents. AFI 32-6001, Chapter 2, provides general
   guidance on use of family housing, whether PH or Government owned/operated.
   4.2.2. Conversion of a unit to purpose other than a Family Housing dwelling must be
   addressed in the transactional documents or the documents should be amended to reflect the
   conversion. For additional guidance, refer to Chapter 2 of AFI 32-6001 if conversions are not
   directly addressed in the transactional documents and to AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property
   Facilities, as applicable.
   4.2.3. Reporting Requirements. The Asset Manager will collect, maintain, and transmit PH
   data (e.g., data required by the transaction documents, PH occupancy statistics required by
   the PEP, GOQ occupancy data, and furnishings cost data [see AFI 32-6003]) to AFCEE and
   MAJCOMs, as prescribed in 4.1.4 and 4.1.5. The project solicitation and transaction
   documents shall require the SO transmit financial and operations data, including the
   Extraordinary Costs and Expenditures report, account data, insurance certificates and policies
   and tax receipts to the AF Portfolio Manager periodically which they use to compile the
   reports prescribed in 4.1.5.4.
   4.2.4. Designating PH by Grade. To meet the intent of DoD 4165.63-M, DoD Housing
   Management, to provide ―access to safe, secure, quality, affordable, well-maintained housing
   in a military community where they chose to live,‖ future PH transactions should not exclude
   any grade within grade categories (junior enlisted (E-1 to E-6), senior NCO (E-7 to E-9)) for
   which PH is being constructed, unless specifically detailed in the transaction documents.
   4.2.5. Rent Determination. The project solicitation and transaction documents will require
   rent to be based on the with-dependent BAH received by the eligible military member as
   identified in the initiative’s demographics:
      4.2.5.1. Eligible military members in PH, including military members married to military
      members, receive BAH at rates determined by OSD. For military members married to
      military members, the rental fee will be established based on BAH at the with-dependent
      rate for the senior ranking member minus the calculated utility allowance for the type of
      unit rented. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall require civilians
      declared eligible for PH pay the equivalent market rent for the type of unit occupied.
      4.2.5.2. For other eligible residents IAW 4.2.15.3.5, the tenant lease determines the rent.

     4.2.5.3. Rental rates for members in PH designated for general officers, SCPs, and K&E
     positions who are single or not accompanied by family members, and there are no other
     on-base facilities (i.e., unaccompanied officer quarters [UOQ] or unaccompanied enlisted
     personnel housing [UEPH]), will be identified in transaction documents and are normally
     at the member’s without-dependents BAH rate.
     4.2.5.4. The project solicitation and transaction documents will structure rent for targeted
     military families so that families should not have Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) expenses. In
     addition, it will be specified that rent will be paid in arrears and will equal the military
     member’s BAH at the dependent rate less a utility allowance (110 percent of the
     estimated cost of utilities).
     4.2.5.5. Rental Payments by Allotment.
        4.2.5.5.1. Authority in Section 2882 of Title 10 U.S.C. will be used for PH.
        4.2.5.5.2. Eligible members who lease PH must pay rent by payroll allotment as
        required by 37 U.S.C. § 701. Typically, eligible members and civilian employees pay
        the first month’s rent to the SO to allow time for the allotment to begin (NOTE:
        Payment for eligible members is normally in arrears and due at the end of the month).
        The eligible member must adjust any allotment changes based on increases or
        decreases in rent (BAH, promotions, and demotions) at least annually or as set forth
        in the tenant lease.
        4.2.5.5.3. The housing office assists members in preparing and submitting allotment
        forms.
        4.2.5.5.4. The housing office will take appropriate action to forward other allotments
        to appropriate financing centers. These include financing centers for the Army, Navy,
        Marines, Coast Guard, Reservist, and other agencies as appropriate.
     4.2.5.6. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify that rent for
     occupants other than referred military families be unrestricted, but, at no time shall rent
     be lower than that charged to accompanied active duty Target Tenants for that unit-type
     unless approved in writing by SAF/IEI or designated approval authority.
     4.2.5.7. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify that residents
     may ―rent up‖ by voluntarily paying more than their BAH to obtain an additional
     bedroom or larger house designated for a grade above their own. ―Renting up‖ should be
     used sparingly so as to not radically alter the demographics or financial requirements for
     which the project was designed. Any resident who does ―rent up‖ must sign a statement
     that they recognize they are renting a unit above their bedroom or size requirement and
     are paying the increased amount out of pocket.
     4.2.5.8. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify that members
     may voluntarily occupy a unit less than their authorization, but only at their full BAH
     minus the utilities allowance. In this case, the member cannot pocket the difference.
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                        37


  4.2.6. Local Moves and Non-temporary Storage. Air Force funding for Government directed
  local moves and non-temporary storage for PH is authorized under Joint Federal Travel
  Regulations (JFTR) Volume 1, Uniformed Service Personnel, Chapter 5, Part D, Paragraph
  U5355, Section B. See AFI 32-6001 for additional guidance. The project solicitation and
  transaction documents shall specify the SO be responsible for funding local moves and non-
  temporary storage when moves are for the convenience of the SO. The asset manager will
  ensure that the SO pays for drayage. The Government will pay for moves from private off-
  installation housing to PH or from FH to PH. The Government does not pay for moves from
  PH to FH unless it is a Government-directed move.
  4.2.7. Utilities Costs and Allowances.
     4.2.7.1. Tenants residing in PH are responsible for paying their utility costs. The project
     solicitation and transaction documents shall specify that for AF referred members, a
     utility allowance will be calculated annually by the SO and validated by the Air Force for
     each unit type in a project based on the utility rate installation’s charge Non-DoD/Non-
     Federal organizations. Further the project documents shall indicate this allowance be
     deducted from the member’s BAH, and the remainder becomes the rent payment. If the
     referred member’s utility costs exceed the utility allowance, the member pays the
     difference out-of-pocket. Conversely, a member may benefit by conserving utilities.
     4.2.7.2. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify the SO pay
     members’ utilities until utility meters are installed. Eligible members will surrender their
     entire BAH to cover the cost of utilities and rent during this period.
     4.2.7.3. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify utility meters be
     installed on each unit within 12 months of closing, upon completion of new construction,
     or upon completion of renovation, whichever is later. The documents shall also specify
     utility meters will not be required for existing units scheduled for demolition within a 5
     year timeframe, and in that instance the SO will retain the full BAH and pay the utilities
     until the units are demolished.
     4.2.7.4. The project solcitation and transaction documents will specify he utility
     allowance for each unit type calculations be based on 110 percent of average utility
     consumption.
     4.2.7.5. Estimated consumption will be calculated using Energy Star® or a similar
     methodology as detailed in the transaction documents and approved by the installation
     commander.
     4.2.7.6. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify utility
     allowances and rents be recalculated and revalidated annually, incorporating actual
     consumption data and revised BAH entitlements until a 5-year average of actual data can
     be used in the calculations.
     4.2.7.7. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify tenant utility
     allowances be recalculated, and the rent adjusted accordingly, immediately following a
     utility rate increase of 10 percent or more over the same quarter of the previous year.
     When applicable, the documents shall indicate the SO may then access the utility reserve
     account for supplemental rent, and continue to receive supplemental rent until the
     Government includes the utility increase in members’ BAH.
38                                       AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011


  4.2.8. Security/Pet Deposits. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify
  that security and pet deposits from eligible members are not allowed without SAF/IEI
  approval; however, these charges may be collected from non-eligible members as defined in
  paragraph 4.2.15.3.5 when authorized to occupy PH.
  4.2.9. Reconnection and Reinstallation Charges.
     4.2.9.1. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify the SO
     reimburse the tenant for telephone, internet and cable/satellite reconnection and
     reinstallation fees when the SO directs a move. The asset manager will ensure that the
     tenant is reimbursed for the fees. Members are allowed reimbursement only to restore the
     same level of services established before the move.
     4.2.9.2. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify that
     reconnection and reinstallation charges incurred as a result of a Government or SO-
     directed eviction are not authorized.
  4.2.10. At least six months prior to solicitation of a housing privatization initiative, the
  installation will coordinate with the local community to define levels of service and support
  to PH in accordance with the proposed jurisdiction of the development. Prior to project
  closing, appropriate Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and Memorandum of
  Understanding (MOU) must be signed and properly recorded. The SO shall coordinate with
  installation personnel and the asset manager to secure any additional MOAs or MOUs that
  are appropriate to support the project.
  4.2.11. Assistance Programs.
     4.2.11.1. If the Federal Government transfers (or conveys) title to tax-exempt land to the
     SO, the land is no longer considered Federal property for Impact Aid purposes, and the
     school district receives low-level Impact Aid for children living in housing on that
     property if a parent is on active duty.
     4.2.11.2. If the Federal Government retains title to land not subject to taxation and leases
     the land to a private SO, the land remains Federal property for Impact Aid
     purposes. Local school districts will continue to calculate its Impact Aid based on the
     number of eligible children living in PH on this land, even if the housing is owned by the
     SO and subject to state and local taxation.
     4.2.11.3. The 2000 Reauthorization Act, 20 U.S.C. 7703 (b)(5)(C)), introduced a
     grandfather clause for children who continue to live on such property after it has been
     transferred to another entity and becomes subject to state taxation. If an installation
     privatizes housing by transferring both the land and improvements, children residing
     there at the time of the transfer will be deemed to be residing on Federal property for
     Impact Aid purposes. The Asset Manager will notify the appropriate local school district
     authorities of any changes to jurisdiction or ownership of land underlying the
     installation’s Privatized Housing ownership within 60 days of the announced change.
     4.2.11.4. The concept plan will address the potential of transferring any school
     population from one school or school district to another. The PDT will continue to
     evaluate the impact on school population as they develop and solicit the project. Close
     coordination with local school officials is essential to a successful MHPI.

  4.2.12. Commercial Activities.
     4.2.12.1. DoD 4165.63-M, Chapter 2, paragraph C2.6, sets guidelines for limited
     commercial activities to be carried out in FH and PH. Commercial activities are defined
     as business enterprises conducted for profit by family members assigned to the unit.
     4.2.12.2. Specific limitations and authorizations will be established in the transaction
     documents and in the terms of the tenant lease.
     4.2.12.3. Family child care in PH is permitted specifically by AFI 32-6001 and AFI 34-
     276, Family Child Care Programs. Approval must be coordinated between the tenant,
     SO, and installation as defined in the transaction documents. Modifications to the unit to
     accommodate family childcare are at the expense of the tenant, must be approved by the
     SO in advance, and must conform to the tenant’s lease. The unit must be restored to its
     original condition at the end of the tenant’s occupancy unless specified otherwise in the
     tenant’s lease. Regardless of whether PH is located on or off base, installation and local
     licensing laws apply.
  4.2.13. Eligibility.
     4.2.13.1. Military Members. All members of the military service assigned to the
     installation, covered by support agreements, or Independent Duty personnel who are
     commissioned officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel on active duty and
     eligible for BAH at the with-dependent rate, and accompanied by dependents (or will be
     within 30 days), or military-married-to-military without dependents, are eligible for PH
     as identified in the transaction documents. For overseas locations, the dependents must be
     command sponsored to reside in PH. The military member should sign the PH lease or
     provision shall be made for a family member to sign utilizing the appropriate power of
     attorney.
     4.2.13.2. Civilian Employees. The commander will establish procedures to determine the
     eligibility of civilian employees required to occupy PH as a condition of employment.
     Occupancy is limited to the period of service at the installation.
     4.2.13.3. Foreign Personnel/Students. The project solicitation and transaction documents
     shall specify when foreign personnel/students are assigned PH, the rental rates for the
     units will be established at the time of assignment and will not increase for the period of
     occupancy. See AFI 32-6001, Table 4.1, Rule 6 and Note 2, concerning how to determine
     BAH rates.
  4.2.14. Applications and Waiting Lists.
     4.2.14.1. Applications. Management of the housing application process (including
     referrals for PH) should comply with transaction documents, AFI 32-6001, and other
     applicable Air Force guidance. Installation-specific processing requirements must be
     approved by the MAJCOM/CE.
     4.2.14.2. Unauthorized Applications. All referrals to PH must be made through the
     housing office. Eligible members are not authorized to apply for PH if evicted for cause
     from a Government-sourced FH or PH unit unless authorized by the installation
     commander. Military members who have not been determined eligible by the housing
     manager are not authorized to apply for available PH.

     4.2.14.3. Managing Waiting Lists.
         4.2.14.3.1. The installation family housing flight will make the referral to the SO.
         4.2.14.3.2. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify the SO
         maintain the waiting list for PH.
         4.2.14.3.3. The installation’s asset manager will obtain reports from the SO regarding
         personnel on the waiting list, wait times, and other information required by
         transaction documents.
         4.2.14.3.4. The status of waiting lists for PH will be maintained in publicly
         accessible forums (e.g., kiosks, Internet). These lists must not include personal
         information restricted by the Privacy Act, such as social security numbers.
  4.2.15. Referrals.
     4.2.15.1. Housing Categories. Housing Categories. Referral to PH is based the eligibility
     of the military member as established in the transactional documents and AFI 32-6001,
     Chapter 2.
         4.2.15.1.1. Specific PH units as GOQs or SCPs must be designated when required.
         4.2.15.1.2. Certain areas or groups of PH units may be identified as prestige housing
         for E-9s or the highest ranking NCOs at the installation.
         4.2.15.1.2. (SCOTTAFB) The following homes have special designations requiring
         selective assignment: 1602, 1606, 1607, 1610, 1611 Dyess Court.
     4.2.15.2. Referral Priorities. The Air Force will not guarantee occupancy of PH units.
     Freedom of housing choice by eligible military members (except where restrictive
     sanctions apply) will be preserved. All eligible military members assigned to the local
     area are required to process through the housing office upon arrival and prior to signing a
     lease for PH. The project solicitation and transaction documents specify SOs only accept
     referrals coordinated with the housing flight chief or FAS.
         4.2.15.2.1. The housing flight will provide referrals to the SO for all eligible
         members within the target demographics and explain features of PH developed to
         meet the needs of the military family.
         4.2.15.2.2. Each grade provides a certain rental income stream (BAH less utilities) to
         the SO. PH units are restricted to certain grades to maintain the income flow
         identified in the transaction documents. The rent structure must ensure that referral of
         military families to PH does not jeopardize the project income. The project income
         stream is to be based on the total income anticipated from the original project target
         demographics.
         4.2.15.2.3. Over time, varying demographics may require a change to transaction
         documents and the mix of units available in the PH complex. The rent structure must
         ensure that the Government maintains flexibility in referral of eligible members to the
         project as demographics change. The income stream for the project must not be
         compromised.
AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011                                                       41


        4.2.15.2.4. The asset manager will review and recommend to the installation
        commander any demographic and referral changes.
        4.2.15.2.5. Upon arrival at an installation, members may apply for both PH and FH,
        if available. If the eligible member chooses PH they are considered adequately
        housed for the duration of their assignment at the installation and are not eligible for
        FH unless their category of housing changes, e.g., change in rank or number of
        dependents. Any move based on change of category is at the member’s own expense.
        For other exceptions to move from PH to FH, see paragraph 1.8.1.7. of this
        instruction, Chapter 5 of AFI 32-6001, and a specific projects transactional
        documents. In general, the effective date of these applications for FH is the walk-in
        date on which the member applies.
     4.2.15.3. Vacancy Management and Referral Priorities for Noneligible Tenants.
        4.2.15.3.1. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify vacancy
        rates be determined by dividing the total number of vacant available PH units by the
        total number of available PH units in the inventory. In addition, it shall be specified
        that units are not considered available when:
            4.2.15.3.1.1. The unit is undergoing change of occupancy M&R that prohibits
            occupancy.
            4.2.15.3.1.2. The unit does not meet standards contained in the transactional
            documents.
            4.2.15.3.1.3. The unit is within 30 days after the issuance of a certificate of
            occupancy.
            4.2.15.3.1.4. The unit is being held for an incumbent of a designated position,
            including GOQs, E-9 prestige, and SCPs.
            4.2.15.3.1.5. The unit is under a signed lease.
        4.2.15.3.2. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify the SO
        may rent to other than eligible members at market rates in accordance with the
        priority list provided in paragraph 4.2.15.3.5 only when vacancies have exceeded 5
        percent for more than 3 consecutive months. The documents shall specify if this
        situation occurs, the SO may fill only the number of vacant units necessary to bring
        the vacancy rate to 5 percent using referred non-eligible members. For example, if a
        5-percent vacancy rate is equivalent to 41 vacant units and there are 42 vacant units
        for 3 consecutive months, then the SO may fill only one unit with a referred non-
        eligible member, thus reducing the vacancy rate to 5 percent. The documents shall
        specify the SO be responsible for maintaining a referral list for non-eligible renters.
        The housing office may refer non-eligible renters to the SO to be placed on this list.
        The documents shall specify the SO must make this referral list available to the
        housing office at all times.
        4.2.15.3.3. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify the
        commander may agree, on a case-by-case basis, to permit previously non-eligible
        renters (see paragraph 4.2.15.3.5) to occupy vacant units if eligible members do not
        require the units, even though more than 95 percent of the units are occupied.
42                                       AFI32-6007_SCOTTAFBSUP_I 10 MARCH 2011


        4.2.15.3.4. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify tenant
        leases for non-eligible members be limited to 1 year, and the authority of the SO to
        continue to rent to other than eligible members be reevaluated at the end of the lease
        term.
        4.2.15.3.5. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall specify if the PH
        vacancy rate exceeds 5 percent for more than 3 consecutive months, the SO may offer
        units to previously non-eligible members in the following order after coordinating
        with the housing flight chief:
            4.2.15.3.5.1. Category 1. Other active duty military member families not assigned
            to the installation.
            4.2.15.3.5.2. Category 2. Unaccompanied military members assigned to the
            installation.
            4.2.15.3.5.3. Category 3. Federal civil service employees.
            4.2.15.3.5.4. Category 4. Retired military members and families.
            4.2.15.3.5.5. Category 5. Guard and reserve military members with dependents.
            4.2.15.3.5.6. Category 6. Retired Federal civil service members.
            4.2.15.3.5.7. Category 7. DoD contractor permanent employees (US citizens).
            4.2.15.3.5.8. Category 8. The project solicitation and transaction documents shall
            specify the SO will qualify the general public by income level and other
            established credit criteria. This category will not be utilized for on -base PH until
            the installation commander formally assumes any additional force protection risk
            created by the presence of persons in this category. If the risk is unacceptable to
            the installation commander, compensatory measures (such as, relocation of
            noneligible tenants, additional security fencing, etc) must be taken to mitigate the
            risks to a level acceptable to the installation commander. At a minimum, all
            general public persons authorized to live in PH shall have a criminal background

otherwise would have received from property tax. The amount paid by the Federal Government
is approximately half the amount the state determines as the average cost to educate each child.
The local area must cover the rest of the education costs, which is primarily done with local sales
and property tax. Many states have the right to claim both high impact aid for those students who
