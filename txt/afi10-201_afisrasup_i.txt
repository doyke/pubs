                                           Chapter 1

                                SORTS GENERAL POLICY

1.1. SORTS. SORTS is an internal management tool for use by the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Services, Unified Commands, and Combat Support Agencies. It is the
single automated reporting system within the Department of Defense (DoD) functioning as the
central registry of all operational units of the US Armed Forces and certain foreign
organizations. SORTS has a threefold purpose: it provides data critical to crisis planning,
provides for the deliberate or peacetime planning process, and is used by the Chief of Staff
United States Air Force (CSAF) and subordinate commanders in assessing their effectiveness in
meeting Title 10, “United States Code,‖ responsibilities to organize, train, and equip forces for
combatant commands. All units with a United States Air Force (USAF) Personnel Accounting
Symbol (PAS) code will be registered in SORTS.
   1.1.1. As a monitoring system of measured units and resources, SORTS indicates the C-level
   of selected resources and training status required to undertake the full mission set for which a
   unit was organized or designed. It also collects and distributes Service-unique information
   regarding a measured unit.
   1.1.2. The Air Force (AF) uses SORTS status information in assessing readiness,
   determining budgetary allocation and management action impacts on unit level readiness,
   answering congressional inquiries, analyzing readiness trends, and supporting readiness
   decisions.
   1.1.3. SORTS provides broad bands of information on selected unit status indicators which
   include the commander’s assessment of the unit’s ability to execute the mission set for which
   it is organized or designed. Measurement criteria is designed and developed by Functional
   Area Managers (FAM) to provide valid assessments regarding unit readiness. Commanders,
   or their designated alternates, assess measurements against their mission set to determine if
   they provide a realistic indication of the unit’s readiness. It is critical that reporting
   commanders identify those areas that are rated less than desired in order to promote and
   justify corrective action (including funding, personnel and equipment allocations.).
       1.1.3.1. SORTS is not designed to function as a detailed information management
       system objectively counting all conceivable variables regarding personnel, training, and
       logistics.
       1.1.3.2. SORTS is not designed to be used as input for the performance appraisal of a
       unit or a unit commander.
           1.1.3.2.1. SORTS indicates a unit’s ability to undertake their full mission (Primary
           DOC Statement) or particular mission(s) (Secondary or Tertiary DOC Statements).
           1.1.3.2.2. SORTS may also provide indications of the efficacy of resource allocation
           decisions and the impacts of budgetary constraints on resourcing unit requirements.
       1.1.3.3. A fundamental premise of SORTS reporting is integrity. Commanders must ―tell
       it like it is‖ (in accordance with (IAW) paragraphs 1.10.7 and 1.10.8) and not allow
       masking of deficiencies to affect their ability to provide capability or other readiness
 10                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


       related information. Risk must be balanced with responsibility. Effective management of
       unit resources requires accurate information at all levels.
   1.1.4. When deployed/employed in response to a crisis or operations order (OPORD),
   SORTS provides both an assessment of a unit’s status based on ability to execute the mission
   set for which it was organized or designed and, when appropriate, the mission against which
   it is employed.
   1.1.5. Records Maintenance. Records prescribed by this instruction will be maintained IAW
   Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
   1.1.6. In the event of conflict between this AFI and MAJCOM Supplements or Unit DOCs,
   AFI guidance will take precedence. Concerned parties will contact the HQ USAF/XOOA
   office for resolution.
1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual
(JTF) HQs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air
National Guard, AF Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a
CJCS or combatant command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan 8044
Revision 03 or Volume 3 of the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned in the
―Forces For Unified Commands‖ document. Measured units will be named on a DOC Statement
(DOCS) and must report SORTS in accordance with their DOCS. One exception is training units
that report only Major Equipment Location and Crew Information (MEQLOCN). Measured unit
SORTS reporting begins as soon as possible after a unit activates and continues until the unit
deactivates.
   1.2.1. Provisional and task organized combat, combat support and combat service support
   units are also designated as measured units. The Service component or Combatant
   Commander (CC) directing the establishment of a measured unit will determine the
   organizational reporting structure of the unit.
   1.2.2. Air Force measured units may include any units registered in SORTS. Registered units
   include PAS coded units, fragments of PAS coded units and composite units such as fleets
   (e.g., airlift, tanker, etc.). Composite reports are in addition to and do not replace normal
   measured unit SORTS reporting requirements.
   1.2.3. SORTS measurement baseline. Regardless of the source of a unit's tasking or the
   extent of unit capability tasked in OPLANS, etc., SORTS measurement is based on the unit's
   full wartime requirement for which it was organized or designed. This baseline is reflected in
   the definition of C-1. This baseline can exceed the unit's OPLAN tasking(s). To fulfill this
   measurement requirement, the unit's primary DOC Statement must include the maximum
   tasking(s), including both in-place and mobility wartime missions, the unit can
   simultaneously support within its current resource authorizations. When properly updated
   with a unit’s complete in-place and mobility tasking(s), the AFWUS is a single source
   reference for a unit's designed capability. Units are required to measure and report on all
   resources identified on their DOC Statement(s) even if the resources are not yet delivered
   (e.g., equipment for a newly assigned UTC) or if it is not possible to accomplish a task, such
   as small arms qualification. If required, waivers for SORTS reporting must to be coordinated
   through HQ USAF/ XOOA.
       1.2.3.1. Personnel Measurement Baseline.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            11


           1.2.3.1.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
           measuring personnel is the unit's full wartime requirement for personnel based on
           either Unit Manning Document (UMD) authorizations or UTC requirements. See
           paragraph 3.1 Training is not measured in the personnel measured area.
           1.2.3.1.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS do not report the personnel measured area.
           See Attachment 4.
       1.2.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measurement Baseline.
           1.2.3.2.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
           measuring equipment and supplies is the unit's full wartime requirement for the items
           being measured. The required numbers for the items are based on authorization
           documents such as Allowance Standards (AS), Air Staff-level functional area
           guidance, MRSP lists, equipment and supplies lists, or UTC requirements, depending
           on the unit's mission(s). See Chapter 4. Equipment condition is normally not to be
           measured in the Equipment and Supplies O/H measured area.
           1.2.3.2.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS will base the equipment and supplies O/H
           area on the unit's full wartime requirement for the equipment items and the condition
           of the items being measured. See Attachment 4.
       1.2.3.3. Equipment Condition Measurement Baseline.
           1.2.3.3.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The Equipment
           Condition measured area measures the condition of possessed equipment and
           supplies. See Chapter 5.
           1.2.3.3.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS include equipment condition
           measurements in the equipment and supplies O/H measured area. See Attachment 4.
       1.2.3.4. Training Measurement Baseline.
           1.2.3.4.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
           measuring training is the personnel assigned to the unit that require the training event
           or category being measured. See Chapter 6.
           1.2.3.4.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS measure training in the training measured
           area. Measured training is based on the unit's full wartime requirement of personnel
           for the training event or category being measured. See Attachment 4.
1.3. Frequency of SORTS Reporting. All measured units (Active, Reserve, and Guard) will
continuously monitor changes in the overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit
location. Units must report no later than every 30 days (in order for messages to process by the
mandated 31 day maximum) or when changes affect the unit’s Overall C-level, the four
measured area levels, associated reason codes, deployed reason codes, get well/get worse date
changes, and when desired by the measured unit commander. See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.4,
for further information.
   1.3.1. Command Reporting Organizations (CRO) submit waiver requests for reporting
   requirements or changes to reporting frequency through HQ USAF/XOOA to the Joint Staff
   (JS). Units submit their waiver requests to their CRO.

   1.3.2. Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96 hours of the oldest
   individual unit’s; Report Date of Change of Category Information (RICDA).
   1.3.3. If unit status has not changed since the last report an OVERALL set must be
   submitted to reflect an updated RICDA date and any remarks in the database will be updated
   with the current date.
   1.3.4. (Added-AFISRA) Measured units must submit a SORTS report within 24 hours after
   the ―Effective Date‖ of their new Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement in the
   Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS).
1.4. SORTS Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, ―Classified National Security
Information,‖ requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities. Also, this
EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and declassification
decisions. The procedures for classification and marking of classified documents are specified in
DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking
Classified Documents; and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.‖
   1.4.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating, in a new form, already classified information and marking newly
   developed material consistent with the classification that applies to the source information.
   1.4.2. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry
   forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the original source.
   1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels,
   numbers used to compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS),
   reason codes associated with their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a
   minimum, classified CONFIDENTIAL. Products that contain data from two or more
   measured units is classified SECRET NOFORN. Additionally, individuals classifying
   SORTS reports must consider other classification guidance including OPLANS. The
   association of the unit with its OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at the level of classification of
   the OPLAN(s), usually SECRET. Information that is not SORTS based and does not show a
   deficiency may still require classification through channels other than SORTS. Unit and
   Wing Security Managers should be consulted in these events.
       1.4.3.1. SORTS Worksheets/Briefing Slides reflecting measured unit data, as described
       above, will be given the same classification level as the material from which it was
       derived. Although sources (worksheets, e-mails, etc.) used to compile a unit’s SORTS
       data may be unclassified, once compiled and associated with SORTS ratings, it becomes
       classified at the highest level associated with the data (see Table 1.3).
       1.4.3.2. Aggregate SORTS data will be classified at the same or higher level as the
       highest classified component parts or segments of SORTS data. SORTS data converted to
       a new type information must be evaluated for its impact on national security if released.
       See Table 1.3 for further guidance.
       1.4.3.3. C-5 Authorization messages (giving that a unit is authorized to, not that they are
       reporting C-5) are Unclassified provided notification does not contain the unit’s current
       C-level (C1-5) or specific information, e.g., limiting factors, operational plans, etc.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                              13


   1.4.4. Classification Authority. The JS SORTS database is classified SECRET. Information
   extracted from this database is classified IAW CJCSM 3150.02, ―Global Status of Resources
   and Training System (GSORTS),‖ and must contain derivative classification markings
   consistent with DoD 5200.1R, except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification
   rules apply when extracts contain exempted data. If no classified source exists, use CJCSM
   3150.02 as classification authority. Use "Derived From: CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of
   Resources and Training System (GSORTS), Declassify On: (date)‖ to mark material when
   this reference is used as classification guidance. The date of declassification is four years
   from the date of the document for CONFIDENTIAL and eight years for SECRET. If other
   sources direct a classification higher or for a longer period, list the classification guidance as
   the authority and list the specific sources on the file copy.
   1.4.5. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of SORTS data and aggregate
   information will be determined by CJCS. The HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and
   Space Operations (HQ USAF/ XO) is the authority to extend or accelerate downgrading
   classification of SORTS data following an initial determination by CJCS.
   1.4.6. (Added-AFISRA) Controlling and Maintaining Classified SORTS. Control and
   maintain classified SORTS data according to AFI 31-401 and DOD 5200.1-R, paragraph
   C6.4.3.2. Store data in an approved General Services Administration (GSA) security
   container.
1.5. Releasing SORTS Data to Outside Agencies. CJCSI 5714.01, ―Release Procedures for
Joint Staff and Joint Papers and Information,‖ sets the policy for release of SORTS data to
agencies not on original distribution.
   1.5.1. Policy: All holders of SORTS data must take action to protect against unauthorized
   disclosure and to preserve the statutory relationship of the CJCS, as principal military
   adviser, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as military advisors to the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF). Authorized holders of AF SORTS data can release it only to military
   components, or assigned or apportioned units, with a valid need-to-know and appropriate
   clearance. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated through HQ USAF/XOOA.
   1.5.2. Specific policies for auditors, the Congress, and the general public: Auditors and
   inspectors of the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the Office of the DoD Inspector
   General (IG) have legal authority under Public Laws 96-226 and 97-252 for access. Only the
   President and SecDef can deny final access. Refer denial proposals to HQ USAF/XOOA for
   submission to the JS.
       1.5.2.1. Release data to Congress and its committees, staff, and investigators according
       to DoD Directive 5400.4, ―Provision of Information to the Congress.‖
       1.5.2.2. Responses to requests for SORTS data from the public under provisions of the
       Freedom of Information Act must be coordinated with HQ USAF SORTS, JS, and the
       Freedom of Information Act processing office.
   1.5.3. Preferred Methods for Release. Only the minimum amount of information will be
   released to satisfy a request. Preferred methods in rank order are:
       1.5.3.1. Access to a specific part or parts of the database in a controlled environment.
       1.5.3.2. Access to a major subset or the entire database in a controlled environment.
 14                                             AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


      1.5.3.3. Release of a specific part or parts of the database or minor subset.
      1.5.3.4. Release of a major subset of the entire database.
1.6. Information Reported in SORTS.
   1.6.1. Reported Unit Identification Code (RPTDUIC) set. This set establishes the identity of
   each individual reporting unit by their Unit Identity Code (UIC).
   1.6.2. Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) set. Set applies to all registered units, includes the
   Unit Descriptor Code (UDC), unit abbreviated name (ANAME), UTC, Unit Level Code
   (ULC), Major Command (MJCOM for BIDE) under which the unit is organized, and unit
   Long Name (LNAME). Only CROs (MAJCOM SORTS office or equivalent) report this data.
   1.6.3. Reporting Organization (RPTNORG), Losing Organization (LOSING), Gaining
   Organization (GAINING), and Transfer Status (TRANSFER) sets. The RPTNORG set
   includes each unit’s CRO (Reporting Organization UIC (RPTOR) field) and Subordinate
   Reporting Unit (SBRPT). Only CROs report LOSING, GAINING, and TRANSFER sets to
   manage unit reporting organizations.
   1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all
   registered units, includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with
   Operational Control (OPCON), Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home
   Geographical Location (HOGEO) and Present Geographical Location (PRGEO), Activity
   Code (ACTIV), and Percent Effective (PCTEF). Only CROs report this data with the
   exception of PCTEF, which is reported by the measured unit.
   1.6.5. Reserve Component Organization Status (RESERVES) set. Includes duty location,
   activity, mobilization or call-up date, and gaining command for units mobilized. HQ Air
   Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) report this data
   according to CJCSM 3150.02.
   1.6.6. Personnel Strength Status (PERSTREN) set. The Air Force reports wartime
   authorized, assigned, possessed, deployable, and tasked deployable strengths. Unit
   authorizations are maintained by the MAJCOM and in the UMD. MAJCOMs will provide
   guidance for units to identify wartime personnel authorizations. In peacetime, the Air Force
   Personnel Center (AFPC) reports assigned and available data. When CJCS directs an
   increased reporting frequency, measured units report personnel strength status as directed.
   1.6.7. Resources and Training Status (Type of Report (TREAD), OVERALL,
   PERSONNEL, Equipment Supplies O/H (EQSUPPLY), Equipment Condition (EQCONDN),
   TRAINING, FORECAST, Category Limit (CATLIM) and Remarks fields. Fields apply to all
   measured units that report status for one or more DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements
   (AF Form (AFF) 723 or approved facsimile) summarize and provide source information for
   the mission(s) for which the unit is organized or designed. All unit SORTS data is available
   to all authorized Global Command and Control System (GCCS) GSORTS customers. While
   there are exceptions, Unified Commanders and the JS primarily look to joint data elements
   (Overall C-level and reason code, the four measured area levels and reason codes, and the
   associated remarks). AF FAMs look at detailed data, analyze information for trends, and
   direct appropriate actions in response to lowered C-levels.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            15


       1.6.7.1. Plain language supplemental remarks can be reported for any SORTS data field
       that contains information. These remarks are a critical component of the SORTS report
       and are frequently used as a management tool.
       1.6.7.2. Remarks are allowed in the database through 3 increments of 2000 + 2000 +
       1000 characters for a maximum total of 5000 characters per remark. On rare occasions a
       remark may be limited to 2000 or less characters.
   1.6.8. Major Equipment Location and Crew Status (MEQLOCN) set. MEQLOCN is
   reported in unit SORTS reports for those units possessing major equipment (aircraft,
   missiles, etc.). This set includes major equipment (MEQPT) and crew status at a unit's
   present and deployed locations. See Attachment 5 for further guidance.
1.7. SORTS Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement (AFF 723) or approved
facsimile). CJCS SORTS policy requires a unit’s Overall C-level to be based on an assessment
of those resources and training required to undertake a unit’s wartime mission(s). The purpose
for a SORTS DOC Statement is to provide units with a single source document of the
information necessary and the location of the references specifying resources to measure and
report in SORTS. They also provide a narrative description of the unit’s wartime mission(s). All
SORTS DOC Statements will be completed on a standard or computer generated AFF 723 or an
XOOA approved facsimile.
   1.7.1. There are three types of SORTS DOC Statements. The Primary Mission DOC
   Statement must reflect the unit’s full wartime mission set (all unit wartime missions, i.e., in-
   place, mobility, Air Expeditionary Force (AEF), etc.) and is assigned DOC Number
   (DOCNR) one. Secondary Mission DOC Statements will reflect all resources necessary to
   undertake a major portion of the primary mission and are numbered sequentially using
   DOCNRs 2 through 9. Units with more than eight secondary missions will coordinate with
   HQ USAF SORTS for additional DOCNRs. Secondary DOC Statements are normally
   written for single missions such as mobility. Tertiary Mission DOC Statements will reflect all
   resources necessary to undertake ancillary missions. A Tertiary DOC Statement is normally
   given a DOC number from A-J (K-Z are reserved per HQ USAF SORTS).
   1.7.2. SORTS DOC Statements are not used to establish, organize, design, equip, or task
   units. Need statements, ASs, UMDs, OPLANs, UTCs, AFWUS, etc., serve these functions.
   1.7.3. In coordination with the CRO, FAMs must ensure SORTS DOC Statements are
   written to reflect the wartime capability units are committed to deliver at execution.
   1.7.4. SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the MAJCOM SORTS DOC Statement
   Approval Authority (e.g., ANG SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the ANG SORTS
   office (ANG/ XOOX)). DOC Statements involving multiple MAJCOMs, such as gaining unit
   issues, must be approved by all MAJCOMs involved.
   1.7.5. CROs must provide the following agencies with the SORTS DOC Statement upon
   approval by the CRO.
       1.7.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS.
       1.7.5.2. Interested MAJCOMs.
       1.7.5.3. Initial gaining MAJCOMs.
16                                             AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


     1.7.5.4. Parent MAJCOM functional offices.
     1.7.5.5. Parent MAJCOM manpower offices.
     1.7.5.6. Subordinate reporting organizations.
  1.7.6. HQ AFRC and the NGB will provide interested parties a copy of SORTS DOC
  Statement(s) within 45 days of approval.
  1.7.7. Subordinate reporting organizations must make SORTS DOC Statements available to
  measured units, direct support units, and functional offices.
  1.7.8. Recipients at all levels must review new SORTS DOC Statements and forward any
  comments to the FAM.
  1.7.9. SORTS DOC Statements must be reviewed annually by the MAJCOM staff and the
  measured unit commander. Unit commanders must sign the unit DOC Statement upon
  assumption of command or after annual review has been completed. Signature does not
  acknowledge agreement/disagreement. Signature indicates the review has been accomplished
  and the commander and their designated alternates understand the SORTS reporting
  requirements in the DOC Statement. Current SORTS DOC Statements must be marked with
  the last review date and maintained for the duration of the initial DOC, i.e., if current DOC’s
  effective date is 1 Jan 2001, and you have a SAV in Mar 2003, records must show the initial
  review and one annual. All unit commander documentation must be shown for the life of the
  DOC. The MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office is responsible for the tracking and
  initiation of annual reviews. When an annual review is conducted, notify HQ USAF SORTS
  of the review date via e-mail or the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN)/Defense
  Message System (DMS). When altered or outdated the impacted SORTS DOC Statement
  must be replaced or rescinded, as applicable. The applicable MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA
  SORTS office will ensure that HQ USAF SORTS receives the current SORTS DOC
  Statement via electronic mail media; (e-mail or AUTODIN/DMS) or an automated DOC
  Statement system.
     1.7.9.1. Unexpected changes to unit DOC Statements must be accomplished within 60
     days of changes in unit data, i.e., Unit & Mission Identification, Measured Resource areas
     (personnel, equipment, training), or any item that would affect unit reporting
     requirements. Expected changes must be accomplished 30 days prior to the change.
     1.7.9.2. DOC Statement pen and ink changes will only be completed for administrative
     purposes. Administrative changes include DOC effective date, spelling or grammatical
     errors, etc. All pen and ink changes will be originated by the OPR for the DOC Statement
     and submitted to all agencies that originally coordinated on the DOC undergoing the
     change. Any change to DOC content, such as Unit data, UTC identification, unit
     reporting instructions, or other material that effects the actual reporting of information
     requires a new/revised DOC Statement submitted through normal coordination channels.
     1.7.9.3. For coordination timelines and detailed instructions on preparing DOC
     Statements, see Attachment 2.
     1.7.9.4. (Added-AFISRA) Units will conduct DOC statement annual reviews based on
     current DOC statement effective dates. Results of review are due to AFISRA/A3XF by
     last duty day of that month. Upon assumption of command, new commanders must
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                          17


       complete an initial DOC statement review within 30 days of assuming command, but this
       will not affect the date of the scheduled annual review calendar.
   1.7.10. (Added-AFISRA) Within         AFISRA,     SORTS      DOC     statement   coordination
   procedures include the following:
       1.7.10.1. (Added-AFISRA) Due to the unique nature of our intelligence mission, the
       HQ AFISR Agency solicits input from the DOC tasked Organization through the
       Wing/Center Subordinate Reporting Organization (SRO). Once the inputs from the
       Squadron, Group, Wing/Center and applicable Functional Area Manager (FAM) (as
       applicable) have been received by AFISRA/A3XF, A3XF will draft a new or revised
       DOC statement.
           1.7.10.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) The DOC Statement will be coordinated with the
           Unit, Group, Wing/Center and program management offices before beginning
           approval process.
           1.7.10.1.2. (Added-AFISRA) The AFISRA/A3XF provides an electronic copy of
           the draft SORTS DOC Statement package to all interested agencies. Interested
           agencies include, at a minimum, the functional directorate offices (internal
           coordination) and the SORTS DOC Statement approval authority. Note: All draft
           DOC statements will be coordinated through classified channels ―SIPR‖.
            1.7.10.1.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/A3XF ensures SORTS DOC Statements
            meet format and content requirements (see AFI 10-201, paragraph A2.8). If changes
            are necessary, AFISRA/A3XF corrects the SORTS DOC Statement and staffs to the
            approving office.
            1.7.10.1.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) The SORTS DOC Statement approval authority
            reviews and approves each statement. For AFISRA units, this is the A3, Director of
            ISR Operations.
            1.7.10.1.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Upon approval of unit SORTS DOC Statements,
            AFISRA/A3XF ensures all names on the AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, are
            legible and delivers the coordinated package, including the hard copy original AF
            Form 1768 signed by the SORTS DOC statement approval authority (or authorized
            facsimile) and all electronic copies of SORTS DOC Statements to measured Unit,
            Group, Wing/Center and HQ Air Force.
           1.7.10.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) All OPR/OCR’s will review and correct the SORTS
           DOC Statement for formatting errors and other issues which may need further
           validation by the Functional Area Manager (FAM).
           1.7.10.1.4. (Added-AFISRA) AFISRA/A3XF verifies the accuracy of unit type
           code (UTC) requirements listed on each SORTS DOC Statement, response time and
           source, and gaining command data. If changes are necessary, AFISRA/A3XF corrects
           the SORTS DOC Statement and forwards it to A3 for final approval/signature.
1.8. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Normally, a unit has a single SORTS DOC Statement, called the Primary Mission
DOC, which reflects all the unit assigned/tasked wartime mission(s), including the most stringent
contingency mission. The Primary DOC Statement Overall C-level for a unit is the primary
 18                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


readiness indicator available to the Joint/Air Staffs and component commanders, and is based on
the capability of a unit to accomplish it’s full wartime mission set(s). DOC Statements will not
be written to only reflect an AEF steady state commitment; such commitments may be added in
the Remarks section at MAJCOM option. See Attachment 2 for details.
   1.8.1. If a unit’s total wartime mission is composed of significantly different component
   missions (mobility, generation, nuclear, conventional, etc.), the parent MAJCOM may elect
   to produce multiple SORTS DOC Statements for that unit. Multiple SORTS DOC Statements
   will be organized as follows:
       1.8.1.1. The primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will be assigned DOCNR 1 and
       will encompass all the missions assigned to a unit. There will be only one primary
       mission SORTS DOC Statement.
       1.8.1.2. Any major portion of a unit’s total wartime mission requiring assessment
       separate and apart from the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement is referenced in a
       secondary mission SORTS DOC Statement. Examples include conventional munitions
       delivery, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, nuclear munitions delivery, mobility, in-
       place generation, etc.
       1.8.1.3. Ancillary portions of a unit’s total wartime mission that require assessment
       separate and apart from the Primary or Secondary SORTS DOC Statement are referenced
       in a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Examples would be individual UTCs,
       force protection, operational risk management, etc.
       1.8.1.4. Primary DOC Statements will only address a single set of resources listed on a
       unit’s DOC and are limited to only resources authorized to that unit or Direct Support
       Unit (DSU). A unit’s Primary DOC Statement (for SORTS C-level assessment purposes)
       must not reference resources already measured under another unit’s DOC Statement. Two
       units cannot measure the same resources, however, a unit’s Secondary or Tertiary DOC
       Statement(s) may reference the same Primary DOC resources for a secondary mission
       assessment. This does not constitute double counting of resources as this procedure is
       intended to provide a separate assessment of single missions or capabilities.
   1.8.2. Overall C-level data for the Secondary or Tertiary SORTS DOC Statement is reported
   in the Subordinate Overall (SUBOVRAL) set.
1.9. Measuring Unit Resources using DOC Response Time. Air Force units must be ready
for deployment and/or employment within a specified time, referred to as the unit’s DOC
response time. Measurement of unit resources is based on the measured resource areas expected
to be mission ready by the DOC response time and the expected Overall C-level at the DOC
response time.
   1.9.1. Response Time. Resource status is a calculated forecast of a mission or alert response
   time of up to 72 hours (CJCSM 3150.02). Units with multiple missions and/or response times
   also apply these rules. Multiple response times should be applied accordingly to resources
   required by each response time. SORTS Primary DOC Statements list the shortest of multiple
   response times that all unit resources are expected to be ready or recalled.
   1.9.2. Using Response Time. Air Force units project C-level status within their response
   time. When projecting resource status, units will count all resources (as available, that are
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                           19


   expected to be ready by the response time). Consider the following factors, as a minimum,
   when projecting unit resource status:
      1.9.2.1. The unit’s actual deployment posture.
      1.9.2.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled
      maintenance/routine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift
      length.
      1.9.2.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not change
      from current projections.
      1.9.2.4. Allocate resources to units under a parent organization based on the subordinate
      unit’s place in the deployment sequence.
1.10. Category-Levels (C-levels) and Associated Remarks. C-levels reflect the degree to
which unit resources meet prescribed levels of personnel, equipment, and training.
   1.10.1. C-1. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake the full
   wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area
   status will neither limit flexibility and methods for mission accomplishment nor increase
   vulnerability of unit personnel and equipment. The unit does not require any compensation
   for any deficiencies.
   1.10.2. C-2. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the
   wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area
   status may cause isolated decreases in flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment, but
   will not increase the unit's vulnerability under most envisioned operational scenarios. The
   unit would require little, if any, compensation for deficiencies.
   1.10.3. C-3. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake many, but
   not all, portions of the wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource
   and training area status will result in significant decrease in flexibility for mission
   accomplishment and will increase vulnerability of the unit under many, but not all,
   envisioned operational scenarios. The unit would require significant compensation for
   deficiencies.
   1.10.4. C-4. The unit requires additional resources or training to undertake its wartime
   mission(s), but it may be directed to undertake portions of its wartime mission(s) with
   resources O/H.
   1.10.5. C-5. The unit is undergoing a Service-directed resource action and is not prepared,
   at this time, to undertake the mission set for which it is organized or designed. Within the
   CBDRT report, units will use C-5 to indicate when they have no NBC defense equipment or
   training requirements, See Attachment 4.
   1.10.6. C-6. The unit is not required to measure assets in a specified area. C-6 (not a rating)
   may not be used as an Overall C-level.
   1.10.7. Overall C-level. Only the commander, or officially designated representative, of the
   measured unit is authorized to assign an Overall C-level. Commanders may not modify
   calculated resource area category levels, but are expected to use judgment in the
   commander’s assessment and to raise or lower the overall category level when appropriate.
20                                             AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


  Higher echelons of command may add remarks to a unit’s SORTS report to further explain a
  situation or deficiency but may not change subordinate unit C-levels.
  1.10.8. Assigning the Overall C-level. Based on unit readiness, unit commanders assign the
  Overall C-level each time it is reported. Normally, the lowest level of the four measured
  resource areas is reported as the Overall C-level provided it is a realistic indication of the
  unit’s readiness (based on the C-level definitions). As a reminder, the measured area data
  cannot be arbitrarily changed from calculated values (must be reported per the specified
  formulas and tables). If the lowest measured area level is not a realistic indication of the
  unit’s Overall C-level, commanders can assess the Overall C-level to a level that better
  indicates unit readiness. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments
  and may raise or lower the overall C-level. At a minimum, commanders should consider the
  following factors when determining the overall unit C-level: inspection results, assistance
  team results, program readiness reviews, and the number of critical personnel in support of
  Small Scale Contingencies (SSC) deployments. Units attaining an Operational Readiness
  Inspection (ORI) or Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI) Marginal or Unsatisfactory inspection
  result will consider lowering the Overall C-level and providing remarks outlining
  deficiencies and resource improvement timetables. The remarks should reflect training
  requirements and/or resource actions necessary to satisfactorily accomplish the inspection
  and anticipated completion dates. The commander will provide rationale for any assessment
  in a remark using the Overall Reason Organization not C-1 (REASN) label. The following
  factors should also be considered:
     1.10.8.1. Personnel subjective factors:
         1.10.8.1.1. Availability of personnel who do not have the required Air Force
         specialty code (AFSC) or skill level but are able to accomplish mission tasks.
         1.10.8.1.2. Unusually high/low formal education level, morale, or unit cohesion.
         1.10.8.1.3. Personnel turnover rates that impact mission accomplishment.
         1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation
         mission.
     1.10.8.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H subjective factors:
         1.10.8.2.1. Item shortages having a larger effect than indicated by equipment fill rate.
         1.10.8.2.2. Availability of older items able to substitute functionally and inter-operate
         with required items.
         1.10.8.2.3. Status of plans to move resources from temporary peacetime locations, to
         wartime locations.
         1.10.8.2.4. Differences between standard fill rates and various assessment tools.
         1.10.8.2.5. Individual protective equipment items availability (e.g., mobility bags).
         1.10.8.2.6. The availability of special equipment that may be used to increase the
         chance for success under adverse conditions or add flexibility to mission
         accomplishment.
     1.10.8.3. Equipment Condition subjective factors:
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                         21


         1.10.8.3.1. Demonstrated      maintenance   surge    capabilities   during   exercises,
         inspections, or operations.
         1.10.8.3.2. Depot programmed and unscheduled maintenance status probability.
         1.10.8.3.3. Status of modification programs and their impact on daily operations.
         1.10.8.3.4. Mission Ready rates.
     1.10.8.4. Training subjective factors:
         1.10.8.4.1. Availability of qualified training personnel (rated and non-rated), of
         equipment and/or facilities, and of areas, ranges, and flying hours.
         1.10.8.4.2. Major training event time lapses or a high turnover of key personnel.
         1.10.8.4.3. Completion of any specialized training that increases the chances for
         mission accomplishment.
     1.10.8.5. Other subjective factors:
         1.10.8.5.1. The unit’s ability to operate in a nuclear, biological, and chemical
         environment, see CBDRT.
         1.10.8.5.2. Another unit’s C-level when also required for a specific mission.
         1.10.8.5.3. Host or tenant mission requirements.
         1.10.8.5.4. Ability of contractors to provide contingency or wartime services.
         1.10.8.5.5. Ability of unit assigned foreign nationals to perform assigned wartime
         tasks during contingencies or wartime.
  1.10.9. Assigning C-5 as the Overall C-level. A parent MAJCOM may authorize use of C-5
  for units undergoing a service-directed resource action and which are not prepared to
  undertake the mission set for which they are organized or designed. C-5 cannot be reported in
  any measured resource area and C-5 status will not exceed one year for Active Duty or three
  years for Guard/Reserve units from the designated start date of the conversion or transition.
  C-5 is only used when authorized by the parent MAJCOM and one of the following
  conditions exists:
     1.10.9.1. Unit Transition. Unit transitions include modernization/conversion of major
     equipment (F-4s to F-16s), modernization/upgrade of software in major equipment
     (extensive equipment testing/personnel user training), a change in a unit’s mission (which
     can be accomplished without changing the major equipment involved), and/or a change
     in a unit’s home station location (higher headquarters approval may be required). When a
     unit is undergoing a transition and the first measured area C-level falls to C-4, C-5 may
     be authorized. Report C-5 as the Overall C-level and report the current measured area C-
     levels until the old DOC is rescinded and the new DOC is effective. Units will continue
     to report their Overall C-level as C-5 until all measured areas (except areas authorized to
     report C-6) have improved to C-3. SORTS reports and DOC Statements are based on the
     wartime mission(s) for which the unit is organized or designed. Unit transitions are not
     wartime missions. Therefore, separate DOC Statements will not be written for transitions.
 22                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


      1.10.9.2. Unit Activation or Re-activation. Activating units may be authorized to report
      C-5 as their Overall C-level until all measured areas have reached a maintainable C-3
      (except measured areas authorized to be reported as Code 6) or the end of the designated
      activation period, whichever occurs first.
      1.10.9.3. Unit Deactivation. Deactivating units will continue to report SORTS measured
      areas based on their current DOC Statement. Units may be authorized to report C-5 after
      the first measured area reaches C-4. Units must continue to report SORTS until unit
      deactivation is authorized by the publication of a command order (G-Series) at which
      time the SORTS DOC Statement(s) is/ are rescinded. Once a unit has deactivated,
      MAJCOMs will ensure all pertinent unit data is removed from the database. Necessary
      actions must also be undertaken to remove the unit from tasking documents (OPLANs,
      CONPLANS, service war planning documents such as the AFWUS, etc.).
      1.10.9.4. Units not manned or equipped but required in wartime force structure. HQ
      USAF SORTS will determine what data will be reported for any units of this type.
      1.10.9.5. Units authorized to report C-5 will continue to compute and report measured
      area C-levels at least monthly unless directed to do so more frequently by the parent
      MAJCOM.
   1.10.10. Explaining the Overall C-level. Remarks will be used to explain and amplify data
   contained in a SORTS report. All remarks must be written in plain English and clearly
   explain why the unit is less than C-1, what actions are being taken to resolve the problem,
   what resources are needed, and when the C-level will change. Acronyms may only be used if
   previously defined in the remark in which that acronym is being used. See Chapter 2 for
   further direction.

              overdue reporting unit status.
1.12. SORTS Report Error Messages and Troubleshooting Actions. Errors detected in a
unit’s SORTS report or the headquarters database must be corrected and resubmitted within 24
hours of receipt of a RAMP reporting errors or upon discovery that an error exists in the
database.
   1.12.1. If a reporting unit fails to receive a RAMP message within 72 hours of report, notify
   the parent MAJCOM as soon as possible seeking resolution. HQ USAF will assist in difficult
   or confusing cases.
   1.12.2. Reference Table 1.2, ―SORTS Joint Report AF (SORTSREPAF) Trouble-shooting,‖
   for possible corrective actions to format and logical edit errors. Table contains information
   on common errors but is not all-inclusive.
1.13. SORTS Message Sequence Counter Number.
   1.13.1. Unit SORTS and/or CBDRT reports will be sequentially numbered 001-999.
   Although transcribed in AFSORTSDET as a seemingly singular report, SORTS and CBDRT
   reports are counted separately. Counters will not be restarted for fiscal or calendar years.
       1.13.1.1. When SROs are transmitting single, multiple-part, SORTS messages, the
       counter should be bumped forward to allow the next report in the series to process to
       avoid unnecessary delays.
       1.13.1.2. Only Air Staff or MAJCOM SORTS agencies may request Defense
       Information Systems Agency (DISA) bump the GSORTS message processor counter.
       DISA will coordinate with appropriate headquarters prior to making the change. Any
       additional notifications will be made, as required.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                43


  1.13.2. When units are experiencing difficulties with their message sequence numbers,
  CROs, may use the GSORTS OVERRIDE feature to override the normal sequencing of
  message traffic. Users are responsible for the consequences of overriding.
     1.13.2.1. OVERRIDE message numbering will be sequential (e.g., 001Y, 002Y, 003Y).
     Non-sequential OVERRIDE reporting is not authorized under any circumstance.
     1.13.2.2. Units choosing to use OVERRIDE message sequencing will take immediate
     corrective action on any errors that occur as a result of out of sequence message
     processing.

                                           Chapter 2

           REPORTING CATEGORY LEVEL (C-LEVEL) DATA ELEMENTS

Section Section2A—Measured Categories and General Rules

2.1. General Resource Relationship to Unit Combat Preparedness. C-levels are developed
by the JS and derived through quantitative criteria to define in qualitative terms, the degree to
which a measured unit is capable of performing the wartime mission(s) for which it was
organized and designed. C-levels provide clarity of resource status to advise the Secretary of
Defense, unified commands, and the Services on current force readiness.
   2.1.1. C-levels collectively represent, via a five point scale, the degree to which a unit meets
   standards established within four measured resource areas: 1) personnel, 2) training, 3)
   equipment and supplies O/H, and 4) equipment condition, plus an Overall C-level assigned
   by the measured unit commander.
   2.1.2. While the JCS require only the Overall and measured area C-levels, the AF requires
   units to report actual raw data percentages in each measured area. This gives a crisis
   decision-maker and resource or training manager more detailed status than the C-levels alone
   indicate.
2.2. When To Use This Chapter. Command echelons, above measured units, use this chapter
to ensure C-level data is relayed without change or delay and to comment on its content when
appropriate. Measured units and below will use chapter sections as follows:
   2.2.1. Section 2A. Used to calculate values for C-level data elements and gather data for the
   preparation/transmission of properly formatted SORTS reports.
   2.2.2. Section 2B. Used to gather source document data (see paragraph 2.9 and Table 2.2),
   identify Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC), formulate detailed narratives and forecast changes in
   Overall C-levels, and verify correct reporting of narrative remarks.
   2.2.3. Section 2C. Used to report AF SPECAP data.
2.3. General Policy for C-level Calculations.
   2.3.1. CJCS policy requires all Active, ANG, and AF Reserve operating force and
   provisional combat, combat support, and combat service support units apportioned to or
   deployed in support of an OPLAN, CONPLAN, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03,
   or service war planning documents, e.g. WMP and AFWUS, be designated as SORTS
   reporting measured units. Unit types listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.1 through A2.4, are
   required to report SORTS. Additional unit types identified are necessary for crisis planning
   whether or not those units are currently tasked in plans. The following policy guidelines
   apply to all reporting units:
       2.3.1.1. Two units will not count the same resource as available.
       2.3.1.2. A unit’s Overall C-level will be based only on the resources and training organic
       (assigned, allocated, or direct support) to it or its parent unit. Mobile or transportable
       communications units may include those resources on loan that can be re-deployed within
       the reported unit’s SORTS DOC Statement response time.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                             49


       2.3.1.3. Units calculate and report area levels (P, S, R, and T) for all four measured
       resource areas unless exempted by Table 2.1 Use only published objective criteria for
       measurement. Do not subjectively raise or lower measured resource area levels.
       2.3.1.4. Only measured unit commanders, or their designated alternates, can assign the
       unit’s Overall C-level. Unless factors like those listed in Chapter 4, paragraph 1.10.8,
       warrant a level change, report the lowest of the four measured levels as the Overall C-
       level.
       2.3.1.5. Command echelons, above the measured unit, will not change any reported
       levels or delay the submission of a report. The command echelon may submit additional
       remarks to comment on reported levels or describe assistance actions.
       2.3.1.6. Units not reporting a C-1 in all areas must clearly indicate the reason(s). Refer to
       Section 2B, paragraph 2.11, for specific remark content requirements.
2.4. Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. CJCS policy requires unit C-level
changes to reach the National Military Command Center (NMCC) within 24 hours after a
reportable event or upon direction of the CJCS, the Services, or CRO. GSORTS is the readiness
reporting system for the NMCC. AF units will report C-level changes within 24 hours of the
change for each SORTS DOC Statement. Report when there are changes in the Overall C-level,
Overall Reason Code, measured area levels, measured area reason codes, PCTEF, D, E, F, and G
reason codes (DEFG), GWD updates, forecast dates, or when directed by the measured unit
commander. If a unit is committed to combat operations (i.e., located in a combat zone), report
C-level data as described above or at the frequency and level of detail as directed by the CJCS.
   2.4.1. SORTS measured units will verify and update data elements listed in this chapter
   every 28-30 days or more frequently if specifically directed. Unless otherwise authorized by
   HQ USAF SORTS, databases will never be older than 31 days from the last report based on
   the RICDA date. Units and/ or their designated SROs must ensure that submitted reports
   process. Units will verify GSORTS database accuracy via receiving error-free RAMP and
   subsequent SORTS Database Review messages. Units will compare reports submitted
   against their database reviews (or equivalent products), and ensure that non-receipt of a
   RAMP or review within 72 hours (since time of report transmittal) is reported to the CRO for
   assistance. Units and/or SROs failing to meet listed timing criteria are in direct violation of
   AFI 10-201 and CJCSM 3150.02.
       2.4.1.1. Units will continue to report SORTS when TDY for training, when deployed
       (e.g., Red Flag, natural disaster, crisis, OPORD, Deployment Order (DEPORD),
       Expeditionary Aerospace Force/Air Expeditionary Force (EAF/AEF), etc.), or when
       involved in local training (base phase exercises, inspections, etc.).
       2.4.1.2. Secondary and Tertiary Mission data will be reported using the same timelines
       as Primary Mission data.
       2.4.1.3. (Added-AFISRA) Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. The unit
       commander is responsible for meeting the reporting timelines. Reports must also be sent,
       updating the GSORTS database within 24 hours, when the 3/6/12-month forecast
       changes, data expires, to include GWD or upon direction from AFISRA/A3XF. Reports
       must not be held up in order to submit within the regular monthly reporting window or
       until a scheduled brief to Wing/Center/Group commanders is conducted.
 50                                             AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


   2.4.2. Submit data to the appropriate labels in AFSORTSDET and a new report date in the
   RICDA field (Primary Mission) or Date of Change of Subarea Category Information
   (RICDF) (Secondary or Tertiary Missions). Composite/aggregate unit reports must be
   received within 96 hours of the oldest individual unit report RICDA.
   2.4.3. Report major equipment relocation(s) using the MEQLOCN set upon partial unit
   deployment or unit relocation. The reporting of all fields of the MEQLOCN set pertaining to
   operational ready status of aircraft and mission-ready status of crews will reflect the
   resources available within the applicable response times. See Attachment 5 for further
   guidance.
   2.4.4. CROs will report changes in unit location.
   2.4.5. CROs will submit waiver requests for reporting requirements or changes to reporting
   frequency through HQ USAF SORTS to the JS. Units submit their waiver requests through
   their respective MAJCOM FAM to the CRO.
   2.4.6. If there is no change to a unit’s status since their last report and a new report is due,
   show that data has been reviewed and is current by submitting a report consisting of the
   unit’s AFSORTSDET Overall Page with the RICDA and all remarks reflecting an updated
   date.
   2.4.7. INFO address all AUTODIN/DMS reports to ―HQ USAF SORTS REPORTS
   WASHINGTON DC//.‖ There is no requirement to submit an info copy when using File
   Transfer Protocol (FTP) to deliver messages to the GSORTS processor.
   2.4.8. CJCS policy allows assignment of overall status as of the report time or projection of
   status within the response time of up to 72 hours. Air Force units will report expected C-level
   status within the SORTS DOC Statement response time. The SORTS report will reflect the
   resources that are expected to be available within the DOC response time. Units can assume
   the following:
       2.4.8.1. The unit is in its actual deployed posture as dictated by current situation and
       existing JCS tasking orders. If committed to a smaller scale contingency, units may be
       released to refit and re-deploy to fill their full wartime mission set. Generally, units
       consider deployed resources to be available for their full wartime mission set (see para
       2.8).
       2.4.8.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled
       maintenance/routine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift
       length.
       2.4.8.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not change
       from current projections.
2.5. Forecasting Overall C-level Changes. Use this set whenever the Overall C-level is not a
―1‖, is an assessed Overall C-level (C-1X), a C-level change is predicted, or when the Forecast
Date of Change (CADAT) expires. If concrete indications of an impending change in the unit’s
Overall C-level exist, forecast what C-level the unit will change to (up or down) and the date the
unit will change C-levels. Units coordinate with their MAJCOMS for any assistance needed.
   2.5.1. When a unit forecasts a change in its C-level, the unit must report both the Forecast
   Change Rating (CARAT) for Primary DOCs and the Forecast Subarea Change Rating
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                             51


   (CARAF) for Secondary or Tertiary DOCs. Units must also report the estimated CADAT
   (Primary) and the Forecast Subarea Date of Change (CADAF) (Secondary or Tertiary).
   When a unit reports degraded C-levels and it is unable to forecast a change date, the
   responsible MAJCOM must provide the unit assistance to determine a best estimate forecast
   for insertion into the SORTS report. Forecasts are not required for units reporting C-1 that
   expect no change. If the reporting unit commander assesses the Overall C-level up to C-1X,
   the reporting unit must also report a CARAT and CADAT. The CARAT and CADAT fields
   must be updated every time a SORTS report is submitted.
   2.5.2. Forecast Remark. In addition to the CARAT and CADAT field information, a
   minimum of once every 30 days, unit commanders will provide a C-level forecast at 3, 6, and
   12 months in a remark under the CADAT label. The remark will forecast the C-level at 3, 6,
   and 12-month points in time reflecting same number of forecasted days added to the RICDA
   date of the report. Fill in the AFSORTSDET Overall SORTS page following the example
   format below:
       2.5.2.1. Format the C-level forecasts as:
     (date) 3 MONTH FORECAST/2/P/P06/PERSONNEL PERMANENT
     CHANGE OF
     STATION (PCS) WITH NO REPLACEMENTS TRAINED
     6 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
     12 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
       2.5.2.2. Units desiring to report additional dates or information concerning forecasts may
       do so using a free-text remark. Remarks of this type are in addition to forecast comments
       and may be added immediately following the 12-month CADAT remark or by selecting
       the CADAT label from the remarks listing.
   2.5.3. (Added-AFISRA) The commander’s assessment is only applied to the overall C-
   level field; therefore, base the forecast C-level (change rating [CARAT]) and forecast GWD
   (date of change [CADAT]) on an actual C-level change, not the commander’s assessment C-
   level. Forecast dates (CADAT) will not exceed 12 months without prior FAM guidance.
   2.5.4. (Added-AFISRA) Units will base the forecast remark (CADAT) on the projected C-
   level it expects to be in 3, 6, and 12 months. Base this forecast on a snapshot in time (that is,
   the C-level status the unit will be 3 months from the date of the prepared report), not a
   window period (the lowest C-level expected over the 3- to 6-month period of time).
2.6. Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC). Within the scope of SORTS reporting, remarks must be
created to address any LIMFAC (unit problem) that affects the unit’s ability to accomplish its
wartime mission. A LIMFAC is a problem, deficiency, or condition that decreases or prevents a
unit from accomplishing its wartime mission, and which usually requires assistance from higher
headquarters to resolve. Issues of LIMFAC will be reported under the Current Overall Category
Level (READY) label. In addition to the READY remark, some LIMFAC may require that they
be reported using a remark label for the SORTS area affected and considered when assigning
unit C-levels (SORTS LIMFAC). SORTS LIMFAC may be reflected in the four measured
resource area C-levels, but may be reported throughout a unit’s SORTS report. Examples of
SORTS LIMFAC include; critical AFSC and equipment shortages, problems with aircrew
 52                                              AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


training, personnel experience levels, Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and In-Place
Readiness Spares Package (IRSP) pacing item shortages, etc.
   2.6.1. Units experiencing a LIMFAC that they feel is not reportable in SORTS but requires
   higher headquarters direction will report in accordance with MAJCOM directives.
   2.6.2. LIMFAC impacting the unit’s ability to accomplish its mission(s) are classified at the
   level of the information contained per applicable directives. If no other directive governs the
   classification, the SORTS classification guidance applies.
2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field. PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of
the unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned nontraditional mission. When employed in
support of a nontraditional mission, commanders will report PCTEF. PCTEF reporting is
required upon receipt of an order to execute any of the following missions: Homeland Defense or
Homeland Security missions in support of USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including quick
reaction force and/or ready reaction force missions), peacekeeeping or peace enforcement
operations, humanitarian assistance, consequence management, counterdrug operations, civil
distrubance operations, and natural disaster relief operations (including wildfire fighting
missions). In some cases, a unit executing assigned nontraditional operation will be executing its
wartime tasks in support of that nontraditional mission (e.g., a Civil Engineering unit providing
support to a natural disaster relief operation). In those cases, commanders will use their
discretion to determine if PCTEF reporting is required.
   2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if the
   unit is currently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s
   assessment against this nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to
   assess the unit’s ability to execute its full wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a unit’s
   C-level from deployed resources, commanders needs to use DEFG (see paragraph 2.8).
   2.7.2. When conditions for reporting PCTEF exist, home station units (SORTS reporting
   units only), who own the deployed resource(s) will begin reporting PCTEF upon assignment
   of a mission and issuance of a deployment warning order. Regardless of order receipt,
   PCTEF reporting commences no later than the deployment date and continues until unit
   mission requirements are changed or no longer exist.
       2.7.2.1. Units with multiple tasked or assigned deployment missions will reflect PCTEF
       ratings of the lowest assessed mission accompanied by the unit commander's remarks.
       2.7.2.2. Units will not report individual (single person) deployment tasking in PCTEF.
       2.7.2.3. Use the following definitions to report the commander’s estimate of unit ability
       to undertake one or more assigned missions for which the unit must deploy:
           2.7.2.3.1. Report a PCTEF level of 1 ('1' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
           required resources and is trained to undertake the full mission(s) assigned.
           2.7.2.3.2. Report a PCTEF level of 2 ('2' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
           required resources and is trained to undertake most of the mission(s) assigned.
           2.7.2.3.3. Report a PCTEF level of 3 ('3' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
           required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not all portions of the
           mission(s) assigned mission.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                             53


           2.7.2.3.4. Report a PCTEF level of 4 ('4' in PCTEF field) if the unit requires
           additional resources or training to undertake the current mission(s) assigned. It may
           be directed to undertake portions of the current assigned mission with resources O/H.
           2.7.2.3.5. When no other requirement exists to report data in this field enter a
           question mark "?" to completely remove a previously reported entry.
   2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using plain
   text under the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations.)
   current status, and/or any action underway or planned to remedy a current reduced readiness
   condition for assigned missions. Format the PCTEF remark according to the example below:
        Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased
        effectiveness due to reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking
        cannot be fully supported due to shortage of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h,
        equipment condition, and/or training). To alleviate the situation on (area), the unit will
        (action). Get well date (gwd) is estimated to be (date). Estimated departure/return date
        is (date).
2.8. Policy for Units with Deployed Resources. When assets of a measured unit are deployed
(partially deployed), the parent unit will normally report status on these resources in its C-level.
   2.8.1. When part of a unit is deployed in support of an operation you may count resources as
   available under the following conditions:
       2.8.1.1. For units with mobility only or a dual, in-place generation and mobility
       mission(s): if they are capable of being ready to redeploy from their current location
       within the DOC response time.
       2.8.1.2. For units with an in-place generation mission: if they are capable of redeploying
       to their home station and generating within response time. Generally units with in-place
       generation missions will not be able to redeploy to home station and generate within their
       response time.
       2.8.1.3. Regardless of gaining or losing resources, if the unit reports less than C-1, enter
       the reason under the SECRN label and use remarks to emphasize increase or reduction in
       required and assigned resources because of deployment to build up or augment resources.
       When resources partially deployed are counted as available (could be redeployed within
       response time), see the expanded reason codes in Table 2.6.
       2.8.1.4. Expanded reason codes D, E, F, or G (DEFG) will be used to reflect the
       commander’s assessment of the percent of unit deployable capability that is currently
       deployed. This information is used to assess risk of resources not being made available to
       redeploy. Refer to Table 2.6 for an explanation of these expanded reason codes.
       2.8.1.5. Supported CCs require readiness information specific to a unit’s ability to meet
       employment tasking. Therefore, MAJCOMs must ensure their deployed units meet the
       supported commanders’ information needs through utilization of unit commander
       assessments of PCTEF.
   2.8.2. HQ USAF/XOOA, in coordination with the JS, will decide, on a case-by-case basis,
   the extent of reporting for units deployed to operate; in a stand-alone capacity; as a

  2.10.3. Chapter 4, also AFMAN 23-110, ―USAF Supply Manual,‖ Volume II, Part Two,
  Chapter 26 (WRM information), use for SORTS procedures to check the Equipment and
  Supplies O/H Category Level (S-level) data elements:
     2.10.3.1. S-Level and its reason code in the Measured Resource Area Level for
     Equipment/Supplies O/H (ESRAT) and Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level
     for Equipment/Supplies O/H Not C-1 (ESRES) fields.

       (TCARQ), assigned (TCRAS), and available (TCRAV), respectively or Training Subarea
       (TRSA) percentages 1 through 5 fields, as per Chapter 6.
2.11. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Remarks are a critical component of SORTS and are
required whenever a measured resource subarea percentage drives a measured area level less
than 1, i.e., P-1 (Personnel), S-1 (Equipment), R-1 (Equipment Condition) or T-1 (Training)/(See
Table 2.4, Remarks Guidance Matrix). Remarks will progressively highlight problem areas for
each individual label regardless of whether the reported percentage is the actual driver of the
measured area level, e.g., a unit has equipment and supplies problems in ESSA3 and equipment
condition problems reported in ERSA2 and ERSA4. First an individual remark will be written
for each one of these labels. Then a remark, in some cases the same, will be listed in the next
higher label of both areas. IAW the above that would be the ESRES and ERRES labels. For the
ESRES the same ESSA3 remark will be used. For the ERRES a combination of the ERSA2 and
ERSA4 labels will be added. Lastly, a compilation of all the labels remarked on (ESSA3,
ERSA2, ERSA4, ESRES, and ERRES) will be given in the REASN label. Remarks will be
written in conjunction with the following:
   2.11.1. Use remarks to give supplemental information concerning unit Overall C-level, or
   measured area level, and SORTS LIMFAC. Remarks must be checked and verified for
   accuracy each time any portion of a report is submitted. Revise content and remark date as
   necessary to maintain validity. Remove remarks that no longer apply. If no change in
   content, revise the remark date to prevent it from exceeding 30 days from the last revision or
   when a full report or a partial report that contains remarks is submitted. Remarks will never
   be more than 31 days old.
       2.11.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) Remarks will be used to explain deficiencies and corrective
       actions. Generic entries are not authorized. Remarks will be directly related to
       deficiencies in the UTCs and mission narrative listed in the unit’s DOC Statement. The
       overall purpose of remarks is to highlight DOC Statement capability deficiencies as well
       as explicit description of what portions of the DOC Statement mission, which the unit can
       accomplish, to include a narrative and extent of the missions able to be accomplished.
       Remarks considered by the Group, SRO, CRO, or FAM as inadequate, ambiguous, or not
       in compliance with AFI 10-201 and AFISRA guidance will be corrected by the reporting
       unit and resubmitted into the GSORTS database within 24 hours of notification.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                          57


  2.11.2. As previously described, progressively report on each label requiring a remark.
  SORTS customers often selectively retrieve specific pieces of data from the database and
  need to know the location of the remark that explains the data they retrieve. Write remarks in
  plain English. Acronyms must be defined in each remark area in which it is used. Additional
  uses of a defined acronym in the same remark may reflect only the acronym. As SORTS is
  dynamic and remarks may change from report to report, do not refer to previous message
  numbers. Do not submit remarks referencing other remarks (e.g. See REASN remark), each
  remark must stand on its own content or it will defeat the specific data retrieval programs. In
  general, list resource types with their problems. State numbers required, assigned, and
  available, explain the cause of the problem, if known, identify previously requested
  assistance and remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required, and supply a
  date of expected change for better or worse (see 2.11.5 for GWD specifics).
  2.11.3. Remarks must contain a layperson’s explanation of the problem and its mission
  impact for customers to understand the unit's situation. Remarks must also contain a detailed
  functional explanation of the situation to provide details needed for functional management.
  2.11.4. Explain unit and wing actions taken to resolve shortcomings. State if, and what kind
  of, higher headquarters action is needed.
  2.11.5. Provide a realistic GWD for each shortfall or problem in each remark. Use the day,
  month and year (DDMMMYY) date format, i.e. 01JAN02. If GWD is Unknown, contact the
  applicable MAJCOM FAM for assistance in establishing a GWD.
  2.11.6. Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details needed.
  Each remark can be up to 5000 characters long.
     2.11.6.1. (Added-AFISRA) Before addressing an outside organization in remarks, be
     sure to coordinate the specific remark with that organization to ensure accuracy and
     currency of the remark. For example, before submitting a remark stating you are waiting
     for supplies on order or waiting for delivery of a vehicle from transportation, check with
     the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) for current status.
  2.11.7. For the Personnel area, explain the following areas:
     2.11.7.1. Write a remark using the PRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Personnel Not C-1 (PRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) to
     discuss the personnel area when less then P-1.
     2.11.7.2. When directed to include DoD civilian employees (contractors will not be
     measured) in P-level measurements, report total and critical numbers authorized,
     assigned, and available in a remark using the PRRES label. When commander-assessing
     the Overall C-level, if the availability of any non-measured contract personnel or
     assigned DoD personnel are used to support that assessment, factor in the non-availability
     of those who are obligated to the reserve components during crisis or wartime. Describe
     the services they would have provided in a remark using the PRRES label. Contract
     employee availability due to labor action or failure to perform impacting mission should
     also be explained in detail.
     2.11.7.3. UTC/UMD mismatches exist when one or more of the following conditions
     occur: UTC requirements exceed UMD authorizations or UTC skill and/or grades cannot
58                                           AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


     be matched after all authorized substitutions have been considered. When UTC/UMD
     mismatches reflect a shortage in any AFSC, identify shortfalls in a remark in the PRRAT
     label by listing each involved; UTC, AFSC, number of personnel required by UTC, and
     number of personnel authorized by UMD. To identify shortfalls, compare the most
     current UTC as indicated on the SORTS DOC Statement with the most current UMD
     authorizations. Compare these documents for mismatches. A comparison report is
     available through the Wing Manpower Office upon request. In the event of UTC/ UMD
     mismatches, see paragraph 3.6.1 for measurement calculation requirements.
     2.11.7.4. Regardless of P-level, if personnel shortages exist, identify them in a remark
     using the PERTP label by listing each involved; AFSC, number of personnel authorized
     or required, assigned, available, in upgrade training (UGT), the identifying personnel
     reason     code    (PRC),    corrective    actions,   and      a    GWD      for    each;
     ―AFSC/REQ/ASGN/AVAIL /UGT/PRC.‖ Include a discussion of action(s) taken to
     resolve the problem. Use Chapter 3, Table 3.5, to indicate applicable PRCs.
         2.11.7.4.1. (Added-AFISRA) When the Total Personnel Percentage (PERTP) label
         is used, do not completely re-list the same information under the Primary Reason
         measured resource area level for personnel not C-1 (PRRES) label. The purpose of
         the PERTP Remark is to sufficiently characterize Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
         shortage numbers along with individual AFSC GWD.
         2.11.7.4.2. (Added-AFISRA) In the Personnel remarks, identify individually the
         categories of unavailable personnel to include but not limited to:
            2.11.7.4.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Deployed/TDY.
            2.11.7.4.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) Medical Leave / Duties Not to Include Flying
            (DNIF) [units with Airborne personnel].
            2.11.7.4.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Security.
                2.11.7.4.2.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Non-Adjudicated Clearance.
                2.11.7.4.2.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Awaiting Badge/Building Access.
                2.11.7.4.2.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) Clearance Actions (clearance revoked).
            2.11.7.4.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) Separating/Permanent Change of Station (in
            transit)/Cross Training.
  2.11.8. For the Equipment and Supplies O/H area, explain the following:
     2.11.8.1. Write a remark using the ESRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Equipment and Supplies Not C-1 (ESREF) for Secondary or Tertiary
     Missions) when equipment and supplies O/H is less than S-1. Ensure each subarea field,
     reflecting a percentage of ―less than 90%,‖ is described in the associated remark label;
     e.g., ESSA4. Ensure remarks accurately reflect the specified reason code (Table 4.5) and
     contain all pertinent details such as readiness driver national stock number (NSN), item
     data, get-well date, kit serial number (as applicable), on-hand versus authorized
     quantities, POC, etc. Remarks for each allowance standard equipment shortage resulting
     in a LIMFAC must contain the NSN, quantity short, allowance source code (ASC),
     equipment account number, and an account custodian POC.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            59


         2.11.8.1.1. If Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) pods O/H and mission ready are
         less than 90 percent, provide a remark on ECM pod status using the ESSA4 label.
         2.11.8.1.2. The status of medical WRM project codes not reported in subareas are
         provided using the ESRES label. No remarks are required other than the project code
         and percent filled from the Stock Status Report (i.e., BA: 67%).
     2.11.8.2. Write a remark using the Major Equipment Possessed (MEPSD) label to
     account for a flying unit’s aircraft assigned but not possessed. Report the number of
     assigned backup aircraft inventory (BAI) aircraft total, the tail number and location of
     aircraft in programmed depot maintenance (PDM), on loan to or from another unit, and
     estimated return date(s).
         2.11.8.2.1. Using AFSORTSDET, format the aircraft summary narrative according to
         the example below:
         (date) AIRCRAFT SUMMARY
         AUTHORIZED 16, ASSIGNED 10, POSSESSED 7
         TAIL / LOCATION/ REASON / ESTIMATED RETURN DATE
               00452 / MBPB / PDM       / 23JAN03
                80217 / MBPB      / SPEEDLINE / 23SEP02


         2.11.8.2.2. In the aircraft summary, UAV units will report the number of systems
         authorized, assigned and possessed.
     2.11.8.3. In a RICDA remark, report mobility A-bags (general use) and B-bags (cold
     weather), see AFMAN 23-110 for a list of minimum compositions. Remark will be
     formatted as follows:
      (Date) MOBILITY BAGS
      TYPE           AUTH/REQ               ONHAND
      A-BAG               10                   10

  2.11.9. For the Equipment Condition area, explain the following:
     2.11.9.1. Write a remark using the ERRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Area Level for Equipment Condition Not C-1 (ERREF) for Secondary or Tertiary
     Missions) when equipment and supplies condition is less than R-1. Ensure each subarea
     field reflecting a percentage ―less than 90% ‖ status is described in the associated remark
     label; e.g., ERSA4.
     2.11.9.2. Additionally, aircraft units will provide explanatory remarks for conditions less
     than 75 percent in the ERRES label.
  2.11.10. For the Training area, identify the primary cause of training program limitations.
     2.11.10.1. Write a remark using the TRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Training Not C-1 (TRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) when
60                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


     the training condition is less than T-1. Write remarks for each subarea reported as less
     than 85%; e.g., TRSA1 for units using Method C, Option 1 or 2.
     2.11.10.2. Regardless of training method and option, when multiple subareas are less
     than T-1, summarize problems in a remark using the TRRES and/or TRREF labels.
     Ensure each subarea field reflecting a ―less than T-1‖ status is described in an individual
     label remark, also regardless of method used.
     2.11.10.3. When current or forecast Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
     formal training school allocation deficiencies exist, write a remark using the TRRAT
     label. Begin the narrative remark with ―AETC:‖ followed by the deficiency short title,
     and continue with a detailed summary of current or future deficiency, the current status or
     action taken to resolve the deficiency, additional actions required, and the impact on the
     unit’s ability to undertake its wartime mission. Using AFSORTSDET, format the AETC
     formal training school allocation deficiency narrative according to the example below:
      (date) AETC: (list short title deficiency or future requirement)
      CURRENT STATUS/ACTION
      ADDITIONAL ACTIONS
      IMPACT ON UNIT
      FUTURE REQUIREMENT(S)
     2.11.10.4. When required, CE units report the last date the unit attended Silver Flag
     Training using the TRSA3 remark label.
  2.11.11. Overall C-level data must be explained in a REASN label remark (Overall Reason
  Unit Subarea is Not C-1 (REASF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions). The remark should
  summarize problems in sufficient detail to ascertain unit readiness and prompt review of
  specific measured area remarks. The following situational examples would require a remark:
     2.11.11.1. Which mission(s) the unit cannot fully support or undertake when its Overall
     C-level is less than C-1.
     2.11.11.2. The commander’s rationale, supporting a subjectively assessed C-level and
     area(s) where the commander disagrees with the measured area C-level.
     2.11.11.3. The programmed or estimated date the unit will again be able to undertake its
     major wartime mission if less than C-1 or after undergoing a major equipment conversion
     or transition.
     2.11.11.4. The deactivation date planned for the unit. If within one year of deactivation,
     do not list personnel shortages unless specifically instructed to do so by the MAJCOM.
     2.11.11.5. When a unit fails an ORI or NSI, consider a commander assessed downgrade
     to the unit’s Overall C-level until the deficiency causing the unsatisfactory rating is
     resolved. Units may assume successful re-inspection; when it is required and the
     inspection team provides applicable dates. Provide remarks to explain the condition in the
     REASN and/or REASF labels.
  2.11.12. Using the RICDA label, all SORTS reporting units will include a written remark in
  each Primary, Secondary, and/or Tertiary database supplying the full rank and name of their
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                        61


   primary and alternate SORTS monitors. Minimum entry will include contact telephone
   number(s) and e-mail address(s). Current DOC Statement date will be included as the final
   line of text. EXAMPLE: SORTS MONITORS FOR THE 123XFW ARE PRIMARY TSGT
   JOHN DOE. ALTERNATES SSGT JANE DOE AND A1C MAY JUNE. DSN 999-8888/
   7777. E-MAIL 123XFW@EXAMPLE.AF.MIL. Current DOC Statement date:
   DDMMMYY.
2.12. Overall Reason Codes.
   2.12.1. Assigning a Primary Reason Code (PRC). Units must report a reason code against
   the Overall C-level using the reason codes in Table 2.5, unless reporting C-1. When
   partially deployed, use DEFG (See Table 2.7 for additional clarification on use of PRCs).
   2.12.2. Reporting a PRC. The PRC will be entered in the REASN and/or REASF fields.
      2.12.2.1. When the Overall C-Level is less than C-1, pick that resource area most
      affecting the lowered C-Level. Use P for personnel, S for equipment and supplies O/H, R
      for equipment condition, and T for training.
      2.12.2.2. If the Overall C-Level (14) is changed by commander assessment the X reason
      code will be used. See paragraph 2.13 for supporting reason codes.
          2.12.2.2.1. If the Overall C-level is based on commander assessment of partial
          deployment capability, up or down, the X reason code will be used under the REASN
          remark label and the DEFG will be placed in the SECRN field. Detailed deployment
          remarks under the REASN remark label will be included to reflect DEFG, the
          percentage of the unit’s deployable capability that is currently deployed, and the
          rationale for the commander’s change to the calculated C-Level.
          2.12.2.2.2. If the Overall C-level is based solely on measured area calculations
          (REASN not X and not C-1) and the unit is partially deployed P, S, R, or T will be
          placed in REASN and the DEFG as described below will be placed in the SECRN
          field. A detailed explanation will be included under the REASN remark label. Using
          AFSORTSDET, format the reason summary narrative according the example below:
           (date) PARTIAL UNIT DEPLOYMENT
           REASON CODE (E)/6 F-16 DEPLOYED TO BASE X FOR OPERATION ABC; 1

      2.12.2.3. If the Overall C-Level is C-1, there is no partial deployment reflected (no
      DEFG needed), and one or more of the resource areas are not measured (reported as code
      6), the 6 reason code will be used. No remarks are required for a 6 reason code.
      2.12.2.4. If the Overall C-Level is capped by AF FAMs, (i.e., due to resource allocation)
      below C-1, enter the maximum level possible in the Category Level Limitation (LIM)
      label for primary missions (Category Level Subarea Limitation (LIMF) for secondary or
      tertiary missions) in the CATLIM set. Enter a P, S, R, or T in the Reason for Category

2.13. Assigning a Secondary or Tertiary Reason Code. The Overall C-Level is changed by
the commander, enter X in REASN field and assign a secondary code to explain the primary
reason for the decision to change the C-level (See Table 2.7 for additional clarification on use of
secondary and tertiary reason codes).
   2.13.1. When upgrading, use the codes: PUP for personnel, SUP for equipment and supplies
   O/H, RUP for equipment condition, and TUP for training.
   2.13.2. When downgrading, use the applicable reason code in Chapter 3, Chapter 4,
   Chapter 5, and Chapter 6. Do not use PUP, SUP, RUP, or TUP when downgrading.
   2.13.3. SECRN is mandatory if REASN equals X or if Overall is less than 1 and DEFG is
   reported in REASN and/or REASF fields.
   2.13.4. TERRN will be used if REASN equals X and SECRN equals DEFG when READY
   is less than 1 (Tertiary Reason Unit is Not C-1 (TERRF) field for Secondary or Tertiary
   Missions).

Section 2C—Air Force Unique Data

2.14. Special Mission Capability Data. Special mission capabilities are tasks, equipment, and
missions listed in Table 2.3 Generally, they add flexibility to mission accomplishment and
require specialized equipment or training. The SORTS DOC Statement will state which special
mission capabilities to include in C-Level calculations. It will also state where to report data on
up to four specific capabilities. For each special mission capability:
   2.14.1. Determine the SMCC by using Table 2.3 Enter the code under the SMCC 1 through
   4 fields, as applicable.
   2.14.2. Determine the number of aircraft required to have the capability. Use the SORTS
   DOC Statement to find the number required to have the specialized equipment. Enter the
   number under Special Mission Required Aircraft (SMRA) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
   2.14.3. Count the number of aircraft mission ready and available with the special capability.
   Count only those aircraft mission ready and available and have the required specialized
   equipment mission ready and available according to paragraph 5.7. Enter the number under
   the Special Mission Aircraft Available (SMAA) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
   2.14.4. Determine the number of crews required to have the specialized training. Use the
   SORTS DOC Statement to determine the number required and enter the number under the
   Special Mission Required Crews (SMRC) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
   2.14.5. Count the number of mission ready and available crews with specialized training.
   Count only those crews with specialized training which are mission ready and available
   according to paragraph 6.2.3. Enter the number under the Special Mission Available Crews
   (SMAC) 1 thorough 4 fields, as applicable.
2.15. CBDRT Reporting. To report the status of unit required/authorized CBDRT equipment
and training, see Attachment 4. All measured units will complete a CBDRT report concurrent
with the unit’s primary SORTS report.

                          PERSONNEL MEASURED AREA DATA

3.1. Personnel. A critical part of SORTS readiness reporting is the status of the unit’s personnel
resources. Units compute the personnel P-level based on the percentages of total and critical
personnel available to accomplish the unit’s required wartime mission. For units with an in-place
or dual (in place and mobility) wartime mission, personnel wartime requirements are based on
authorized funded positions in their UMDs. For units with mobility only missions, the
requirements are the manpower details of their UTC(s). The following documents are used as
sources for the personnel measured area: MEML, UMD, SORTS Personnel Availability Roster,
and the MANFOR UTC Detail Report from the Manpower Personnel Module Base-Level
(MANPER-B) system. Personnel measurement is limited to US military and specified DoD
civilian personnel. Foreign national military, foreign national civilian, and contractor personnel
are not counted in the measured personnel area. Active duty units will not count ANG and
Reserve personnel unless gained by the unit as a result of mobilization.
   3.1.1. Total Personnel.
       3.1.1.1. TPAUTH for all units is based on the unit’s UMD and/or its DOC required
       UTCs.
           3.1.1.1.1. For units with an in-place generation mission or an in-place generation and
           mobility mission (see unit DOC Statement), the source document for TPAUTH is the
           unit’s UMD. MAJCOMs must provide instructions to their units on how to identify
           wartime-required and funded positions, i.e. a DOC instruction of "Measure and report
           the availability of unit personnel to fill all funded military positions in your UMD.‖
           3.1.1.1.2. For units with a mobility only mission (see unit DOC Statement),
           TPAUTH is the total of the manpower requirements identified in the deployment
           UTC(s) the unit is required to support. Contact the local manpower office for a UTC
           Manpower Detail Report for each UTC.
       3.1.1.2. TPASG is determined by counting all personnel in a unit from the time they
       arrive at the unit until they depart on a PCS, permanent change of assignment (PCA), or
       separate from the Air Force. All personnel are counted for TPASG regardless of AFSC,
       skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number. Units will use a unit
       manpower personnel roster (UMPR) or similar product provided by their CSS or Military
       Personnel Flight (MPF) to determine total assigned personnel. Before preparing the
       SORTS report, the unit SORTS monitor should coordinate with the unit CSS to ensure
       records in the Personnel System are updated and reflect the true status of unit personnel.
       3.1.1.3. TPAVL is determined by calculating the number of TPASG that are available to
       the unit within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission (see
       paragraph 3.2 for specific availability guidance). TPAVL are counted regardless of
       AFSC, skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number.
       3.1.1.4. DoD Civilian Personnel can be included in personnel counts when they occupy
       wartime-required positions. Only Emergency Essential (EE) (IAW AFI 10-231, ―Federal
       Civilian Deployment Guide”) and ―Key‖ DoD civilians (IAW AFI 36-507, ―Mobilization
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                         71


     of the Civilian Workforce”) are included in calculations in the SORTS personnel area.
     Other DoD civilian and general contractor personnel impacting a unit’s readiness may be
     reported on as part of the commander’s assessment.
         3.1.1.4.1. Do not count civilian personnel in SORTS if they have Reserve or Guard
         commitments during crisis or wartime that can make them subject to recall.
         3.1.1.4.2. MAJCOMs must mark SORTS DOC Statements to include United States
         (US) DoD civilian personnel in the personnel measurement area when they are part of
         the unit’s wartime requirement (either by occupying wartime required authorizations
         and/or as part of the unit’s deployment UTCs). A remark on SORTS DOC Statements
         should indicate if and how a civilian occupation code converts to a military AFSC.
     3.1.1.5. Foreign Local Nationals will not be counted in SORTS due to questionable
     availability during wartime contingencies.
  3.1.2. Critical Personnel.
     3.1.2.1. The reporting of critical personnel is based on the AFSC’s identified by the HQ
     USAF functional area manager as detailed in Table 3.1 Personnel with particular AFSCs
     are considered ―critical‖ if they meet the following criteria:
         3.1.2.1.1. Personnel with AFSC(s) that are essential to fulfilling the unit’s wartime
         mission tasks.
         3.1.2.1.2. Absence of personnel possessing AFSC(s) that would render the unit
         severely deficient or totally unable to execute its wartime mission.
         3.1.2.1.3. AFSC is part of a critically manned career field subject to special
         monitoring.
     3.1.2.2. Officers who have a critical AFSC as their duty or primary AFSC, or enlisted
     who have a critical AFSC as their primary or control AFSC are considered critical.
     3.1.2.3. Enlisted members who are cross training and hold a 3-level control AFSC in
     their new career field present a special circumstance. Those personnel can be counted
     against critical requirements in their former career field so long as they hold the correct
     primary or control AFSC and skill level, their grade meets or exceeds the UMD
     requirement, and their commander determines they are qualified to perform the job.
     3.1.2.4. CPAUR is determined by counting the number of TPAUTH positions that also
     match the AFSC/skill levels listed in Table 3.1.
     3.1.2.5. CPASG is determined by counting the number of critical personnel authorized
     positions that can be filled by a qualified person. To count as qualified, the person must
     have the required AFSC and meet or exceed the required skill level. An officer must have
     the correct duty AFSC and grade and enlisted personnel must have the correct control or
     primary AFSC/skill level compared to the critical position requirement. Critical
     Personnel who are surplus to the unit’s critical personnel requirement in an AFSC will
     not be counted as part of the critical personnel assignment unless they can be used to fill
     a requirement shortage IAW authorized substitutions as defined below:
         3.1.2.5.1. AFSC substitution: AFSC Substitution of critical personnel is only allowed
         when authorized by UTC MISCAP, WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or Functional AFIs.
 72                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


          3.1.2.5.2. Skill-level substitution: The UTC MISCAP, functional AFIs, or the USAF
          WMP-1 annexes govern authorized skill-level substitutions. Substitutions will only be
          made when authorized! IAW CJCSM 3150.02, critical personnel substitutions must
          have the required AFSC and meet or exceed the skill level required. Commanders
          should review the qualifications of any substitutes to ensure the UTC requirement is
          not degraded. Once review is made, substitutes may be included in critical
          calculations.
      3.1.2.6. CPAVL is determined by calculating the number of CPASG that are available to
      the unit within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission (see
      paragraph 3.2 for specific availability guidance).
      3.1.2.7. Critical Personnel overages will not be reported in the CPASG and CPAVL data
      fields but may be reported using a remark under the applicable label (CPASG or
      CPAVL).
   3.1.3. Special Provisions for Personnel Counting.
      3.1.3.1. The SORTS DOC Statement must indicate whether DSU personnel must be
      included in the count.
      3.1.3.2. Units with multiple weapon systems will allocate resources to meet the wartime
      requirements of each system.
      3.1.3.3. Personnel TDY or temporarily attached to a measured unit will not be included
      in the gaining unit’s assigned and available numbers.
      3.1.3.4. Total force organizations or units with a joint mission that have multiple service
      personnel assigned, attached or a combination of active duty and reserve component
      personnel will use their respective service or component unit UMD to determine total
      personnel requirements, e.g., a total force wing requires support from the Army, Navy,
      and Air National Guard. The Army operating location (OL) has a UMD of 20 personnel,
      the Navy OL 20 personnel, the ANG unit 100 personnel and the Active Duty unit 150
      personnel, the total requirement is 290. Critical personnel will be assessed using the same
      guidelines based on specific AFSC/MOS requirements listed in the UMD or UTCs
      required to support.
      3.1.3.5. AFRC and NGB personnel attached to an active duty unit, for training purposes,
      will not be included in personnel numbers.
      3.1.3.6. If a unit is assigned a fragmented portion of a UTC (split-tasking), report the
      UTC portion that has been assigned on the unit DOC Statement. Split-tasking will be
      reflected by using a minus sign (-) immediately after the UTC. {example: FFGK5(-)}.
      The portion of the UTC that is assigned, or is not assigned, is then spelled out within the
      Remarks section of the DOC Statement (See Attachment 2 for further DOC Statement
      guidance).
      3.1.3.7. Individual Mobility Augmentees (IMAs) will only be counted when assigned as
      part of a mobilization or Reserve Call-up. Unit’s reporting IMA numbers in their
      personnel area will explain how the IMAs are used under a PRRES label remark.
3.2. Determining Personnel Availability. Unit personnel may be considered available if they
are assigned to the unit and meet one of the following requirements:
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            73


   3.2.1. Are present at home station or can be present within the prescribed unit response time.
   3.2.2. Are at a deployed location and can be ready to redeploy within the unit response time.
   3.2.3. Are not restricted from deploying or employing with the unit (this is for units with a
   mobility mission).
   3.2.4. Are counted if their duty status/availability code(s), on a SORTS Personnel
   Availability Roster and the Duty Status Roster, match those from AFI 10-403, and the
   commander determines them available where appropriate. Personnel having a duty
   status/availability code restricting them from deployment (IAW AFI 10-403) may be
   considered available for in-place missions as determined by the commander.
   3.2.5. Use the following SORTS rules to determine personnel availability according to a
   unit’s DOC Statement Mission Title (Section 2).
      3.2.5.1. For in-place generation, alert, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03, or
      surveillance missions, count personnel available if they can be expected to return to their
      assigned duty location within response time.
      3.2.5.2. For mobility missions, count personnel available if they are expected to be ready
      to deploy from their present location within DOC response time.
      3.2.5.3. For combined in-place generation and mobility missions, allocate personnel to
      each mission and then apply the rules for each type mission.
      3.2.5.4. For security forces combined in-place generation and mobility missions DOC
      Statements, allocate all personnel required for UTC or mobility deployment and apply all
      remaining available personnel towards home station force protection.
   3.2.6. When a unit temporarily transfers (lends) personnel to another unit, the supplying
   measured unit will continue to measure and report the personnel in its SORTS unless
   otherwise directed by the MAJCOM(s) involved. Likewise a unit receiving personnel from
   another unit will not measure or count those personnel unless otherwise directed. Temporary
   assignment of personnel will not justify improved SORTS C-levels. However, support from
   other units may be factored into a commander’s assessment for the Overall C-level.
   3.2.7. MAJCOMs should provide additional guidance to assist unit commanders to
   consistently and accurately determine whether members are available and ready to deploy
   within the response time.
3.3. Total and Critical Personnel Percentage Calculation. The lower P-level from total or
critical personnel is used to determine the personnel resource area P-level.
   3.3.1. Total Personnel Percentage. Total personnel are calculated using the following rules:
      3.3.1.1. If 10 or more people are calculated, divide total personnel available by the total
      number of personnel authorized, multiply by 100 and round off to a whole number.
      3.3.1.2. If nine or less people are calculated, use Table 3.2 to derive the percentage.
      3.3.1.3. Enter the percent in the PERTP field.
   3.3.2. Critical Personnel Percentage. Units use one of two methods for computing critical
   personnel percentages; the single percentage computation method or the multiple percentage
74                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


  computation method. The method used is derived from Table 3.1 for each unit type. If the
  entries in Table 3.1, columns B and/or C are separated by commas only, the single
  percentage computation method is used. If the entries in Table 3.1, columns B and C include
  semicolons, the multiple percentage computation method is used. Calculate critical personnel
  using the following rules:
     3.3.2.1. For support, non-combat air forces (CAF) units, space, and missile units, if 10 or
     more personnel are calculated, divide the number of critical personnel available by the
     number of critical personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply the result by
     100 and round off to a whole number.
     3.3.2.2. Single percentage computation method. Total the number of personnel positions
     from TPAUTH that contain the AFSCs and skill levels identified in Table 3.1as critical.
     This number becomes the denominator in the percentage equation.
         3.3.2.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) For Critical personnel, individual AFSC percentages
         will be further broken out in remarks section.
     3.3.2.3. Multiple percentage computation method. Compute a separate percentage for
     each packet of critical personnel. See paragraph 3.5 for an explanation of packets.
     Report the lowest percentage of all of the packets in the PERTC data field.
     3.3.2.4. Percentage computations. The following applies regardless of the method used.
         3.3.2.4.1. Availability of personnel is determined using paragraph 3.2
         3.3.2.4.2. If the number in the denominator of the percentage equation is nine or less
         personnel, use Table 3.2 to derive percentage.
         3.3.2.4.3. If the personnel calculation baseline (denominator in the percentage
         equation) is 10 or more personnel , divide the number of critical personnel available
         by the number of critical personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply
         the result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
         3.3.2.4.4. Enter the percentage in the PERTC data field.
     3.3.2.5. CAF aviation units will calculate their personnel numbers using the following:
         3.3.2.5.1. See paragraph 3.3.2.3 to calculate CAF multiple percentages.
         3.3.2.5.2. Find the number of personnel available for each crew position (i.e., pilot,
         co-pilot, navigator, etc.). Calculate critical maintenance personnel as you would for
         non-combat aircraft units using paragraph 3.3.2.1 guidance.
         3.3.2.5.3. If 10 or more aircrew are calculated, divide the number aircrew available
         by the number of aircrew required for each crew position. Multiply the result by 100
         and round off to the whole number.
         3.3.2.5.4. If nine or less aircrew are calculated, find the percent using the number
         available by crew position (Reference Table 3.2).
         3.3.2.5.5. Enter the lowest percentage between aircrew personnel positions and the
         Critical Maintenance AFSCs in the PERTC field.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            75


      3.3.2.6. Non-CAF aircraft units may elect to use CAF criteria for measuring critical
      personnel including when GTACS CAF units report via aircrew duty position method.
3.4. Personnel Reason Codes.
   3.4.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 3.5, when P-level is less than P-1.
   3.4.2. If the reason code has changed from the last reported, enter the new reason code in the
   PRRES or PRREF data fields.
3.5. Critical Personnel Packet Formulation.
   3.5.1. When a unit’s personnel resources are sufficiently diverse, measuring certain critical
   personnel by the single percentage computation method may mask shortages in critical
   AFSCs and skill levels. In these cases, HQ USAF FAMs may arrange critical AFSCs listed
   in Table 3.1, into groups called packets and separate the packets by semicolons (;). Packets
   will be reflected in the unit’s DOC Statement. Alternatively, UTCs may be substituted for
   AFSC packets when they have manpower details assigned. (Examples: 1C37X, 1C35X;
   3C072, 3C052 or UTC-QFEBA; QFEBB;). The critical personnel packets will be reported
   using the multiple percentage computation method.
   3.5.2. When packets are used, units will calculate a separate percentage for each designated
   packet listed in Table 3.1 using the procedures in paragraph 3.3.2. The lowest percentage of
   all packets will be reported in the PERTC field.
   3.5.3. MAJCOM CAF FAMs may designate non-aircrew personnel packet(s) using
   Table 3.1.
3.6. Commander Assessment and Remarks. Commanders should address the following
personnel issues when submitting a unit assessment, if applicable:
   3.6.1. In the event of UMD/UTC mismatches (paragraph 2.11.7.3), personnel measurement
   calculations will be made based on the UMD requirement for the mismatched position(s).
   Commanders with UTC requirements not on the UMD (not authorized) should assess the
   Overall C-level downward to reflect the impact of the ―missing‖ manpower authorizations
   and remarks should illuminate the specific manpower authorization mismatches with the
   UTC tasked to support. See paragraph 2.11.7.4 for remark requirement.
   3.6.2. Resource capabilities provided by overseas host nation or by foreign national contract
   personnel should be considered in the commander’s assessment when relevant.
   3.6.3. When non-aircrew personnel are not included in the personnel measurement, flying
   unit commanders must assess these required capabilities when assigning an Overall C-Level.

                                           Chapter 4

      EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES ON HAND (O/H) MEASURED AREA DATA

4.1. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reporting. Equipment and supplies O/H measurement is
used to indicate the resource status of authorized equipment and supplies required to support the
unit’s wartime mission(s), as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement. This measurement
may indicate budget and supply problems when details are known. Resources measured in this
area are reported in the EQSUPPLY set.
   4.1.1. Equipment and supplies O/H reporting is based on a unit’s wartime requirement.
       4.1.1.1. Units with an in-place generation or combined in-place generation and mobility
       mission, use the applicable documents (AS, Air Staff-level functional area guidance,
       UTC LOGDET, etc.) as the base line for equipment and supplies measurement as
       supplemented by Table 4.4 subareas. These subareas will normally reflect those items on
       the applicable documents that are critical to mission accomplishment.
       4.1.1.2. Units with a mobility-only mission, use LOGDET, plus any applicable Air Staff-
       level functional area guidance, as the baseline for equipment and supplies measurement
       as supplemented by Table 4.4 subareas for each UTC it is required to support.
       4.1.1.3. Units compute the equipment and supplies S-level, for combat essential and
       support equipment and supplies, based on the availability of wartime required equipment
       and supplies. Equipment and supplies items are considered available if they are assigned
       to the unit and are physically present or can be present within prescribed unit response
       times.
       4.1.1.4. For equipment and supplies deployed in support of Small Scale Contingencies
       (SSC), equipment and supply items may be considered available to units with mobility
       missions if unit personnel can make the equipment and supplies ready to redeploy within
       the DOC response time.
       4.1.1.5. For in-place (generation), in-place and mobility, or mobility-only missions, the
       full wartime requirement of equipment and supplies is determined by the applicable
       authorizing or requirements documents.
   4.1.2. The formula for equipment and supplies computations is the number of equipment and
   supplies available divided by the wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
4.2. Equipment and Supplies Subareas (ESSAs). This measured area allows measurement of
up to nine subareas. Consider the following:
   4.2.1. In-place/Generation or Generation and Mobility Missions. Use the SORTS DOC
   Statement, LOGDET, IRSP, ASs, and Air Staff-level functional area guidance, as necessary,
   to determine equipment types and numbers authorized/required.
       4.2.1.1. For IRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid tainting results with
       large numbers of expendable items that current assessment tools cannot model their
       mission impact (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            87


       4.2.1.2. MAJCOMs report strategic airlift aircraft spare engines under a fleet status
       report.
   4.2.2. Mobility Missions. Use DOC Statement to determine the types of equipment and
   supplies to measure and use UTC LOGDET and applicable Air Staff-level functional area
   guidance to determine specific equipment and supply items required.
       4.2.2.1. If more than one UTC is measured, add their individual requirements together.
       4.2.2.2. For MRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid skewing the count
       with large numbers of expendable items whose mission impact cannot be modeled using
       current assessment tools (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
   4.2.3. Item Possession. To determine the number of items a unit will possess within it’s
   response time, the unit must have actual responsibility for the items according to applicable
   supply regulations. The following items are not considered possessed:
       4.2.3.1. Additional or BAI in excess of the number authorized or required. Include
       backup aircraft if MEASG does not exceed MEARD.
       4.2.3.2. Items in PDM or Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) depot
       modification.
       4.2.3.3. Items temporarily in the hands of another unit due to long term maintenance
       (lasting more than seven days or for crash or battle damage repair) are not considered
       possessed by the receiving unit. If the unit has items on loan from another unit, the items
       from the other unit will not be counted.
       4.2.3.4. Items loaned to another unit to augment their resources will be considered
       possessed by the owning unit. Receiving unit will not use these resources for SORTS
       reporting. Items will not be double-counted. Units receiving equipment on loan should
       consider a commander’s assessment of the Overall C-level based on support.
   4.2.4. MRSP and IRSP:
       4.2.4.1. Include XD-coded repairable items, but not XB/XF-coded expendable items.
       Large numbers of XB may mask problems with higher value XD items (BEAR base
       squadrons excluded). Include only items serviceable/repairable within the response time.
       4.2.4.2. Include the possessed primary operating stock (POS).
       4.2.4.3. Add the items O/H for each measured subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   4.2.5. Electronic Attack (EA) Pods. If Pods are O/H and mission ready, but are less than 90
   percent mission capable, provide a remark on EA Pod status using the ESSA4 label.
4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report
SORT S data against stated SORTS DOC Statement mission. Each unit must determine and
report their status on the basis of critical BEAR equipment and supplies (support) assigned.
Report using only the assets the unit is authorized. Specific equipment allowances are included
in AFI 25-101, Chap 7 ―USAF Bear Base Systems,‖ and in AS 157, 158 and 159.
   4.3.1. The following measured units report on the designated BEAR systems:
 88                                           AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


       4.3.1.1. 49 Material Maintenance Group (MMG) Holloman AFB, NM for assigned ACC
       BEAR assets.
       4.3.1.2. 609 Air Support Squadron (ASUS) Shaw AFB, SC for assigned USCENTAF
       BEAR and Harvest Falcon assets.
       4.3.1.3. 607 ASUS Osan AB, Korea for assigned PACAF Harvest Eagle, T-550, and
       BEAR assets.
       4.3.1.4. 435 Materiel Maintenance Squadron (MMS) Sembach, Germany for assigned
       USAFE BEAR assets.
       4.3.1.5. 60 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), Travis AFB, CA and 305 LRS,
       McGuire AFB, NJ for assigned AMC Swift BEAR assets.
   4.3.2. BEAR base equipment is grouped by UTC and is designed to provide a functional
   capability. UTCs also include support MRSPs that are required to make UTC end items
   functional. When determining UTC capability support, MRSPs must be considered along
   with equipment items. Spare MRSPs provide repair parts and are considered separately.
   Spare MRSP will provide for 30 days of operations without re-supply. See Air Force
   Handbook (AFH) 10-222 for breakdown of BEAR Base sets and packages.
4.4. MRSP and IRSP Authorizations. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations loaded into a unit’s
Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) and requisitioned 90 days prior to authorization/activation
date are assessed beginning on the authorization date. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations start at
the same time as the unit’s specific tasking date for its wartime requirement.
   4.4.1. Revised MRSP or IRSP authorizations are provided a minimum of 30 days and a
   maximum of 60 days grace period for reporting S-levels. This includes annual MRSP
   reviews or major RSP reconfiguration changes.
   4.4.2. Report new authorizations starting 30/60 days after they are loaded into the SBSS, or
   as soon as the sorties/aircraft (for ASM or WSMIS-SAM assessed units) or the RSP percent
   filled (where ASM or WSMIS-SAM are not assessed) of revised authorizations equal or
   exceed that of outdated authorizations, whichever occurs first. Continue to report the
   assessment of the outdated authorizations until the conditions are met for the new
   authorizations, but comment on the status of the new authorizations in the remarks, e.g. new
   MRSP authorization loaded (date).
   4.4.3. Assets available in POS to fill MRSP shortages are counted as O/H in MRSP when
   computing fill percentages in SORTS.
       4.4.3.1. The MRSP percent fill is based on total authorized units, excluding
       Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) XB and XF items. The MRSP
       fill percent is computed as follows: O/H (XD) MRSP divided by (XD) MRSP
       authorization multiplied by 100 = (XD) MRSP percent fill rate.
       4.4.3.2. Assets due in from maintenance (DIFM) within DOC response time and not
       awaiting parts (AWP) are also counted as O/H. The O/H MRSP quantity is computed as
       follows: serviceable MRSP + applicable POS + Forward Supply Points (FSP) + (DIFM
       AWP) = O/H MRSP.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                          89


   4.4.4. Units with an in-place DOC have specific IRSP guidance. Each unit with an in-place
   DOC is provided a total wartime requirement.
      4.4.4.1. The total wartime requirement is computed as follows: IRSP + POS O&STQ
      (Order And Ship Time Quantities).
      4.4.4.2. The O/H IRSP quantity is computed as follows: serviceable IRSP + serviceable
      POS + O/ H repairable assets O/H repairable assets coded AWP = authorized units,
      excluding ERRC XB and XF items.
      4.4.4.3. The IRSP fill percent is computed as follows: O/H IRSP quantity divided by
      total wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
4.5. Subarea Percentage Calculations.
   4.5.1. Calculate the subarea percentages. If ten or more items are authorized or required
   divide the number of items possessed within the DOC response time by the number of items
   authorized or required. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the
   number of items authorized. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage and round off
   to the nearest whole number. This whole number is the subarea percentage.
   4.5.2. If nine or less items are authorized or required select appropriate percentage from
   Table 4.2, unless Table 4.4 directs otherwise. Note the derived percentages. If a percentage
   has changed since the last report, enter the new percentage under the appropriate subarea
   label from Table 4.4.
4.6. Combat Essential and Support Equipment O/H Percentage Calculations.
   4.6.1. Determine unit combat essential versus support specification using Table 4.1,
   Column A (unit type), Column B (combat essential equipment) and Column C (support
   equipment).
   4.6.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment percentage for each area use
   the following rules:
      4.6.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, use the lowest percentage found for those
      subareas.
      4.6.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate that percentage with
      the same procedure used for the subarea calculations.
   4.6.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed since the last report, enter
   the new percentage in the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and the EQSSE label
   for support equipment.
   4.6.4. Note the derived combat essential/supporting item counts. For aircraft units, if the
   item counts have changed since the last report, enter them in the following labels:
      4.6.4.1. The number authorized in the label MEARD.
      4.6.4.2. The number assigned in the label MEASG.
      4.6.4.3. The number possessed in the label MEPOS.
      4.6.4.4. If MRSP fill rate was used in spares assessment, enter it in the RSP field and
      enter an X in the Spares Assessment Driver (ARUSD) field.

4.7. Equipment and Supplies O/H S-Level Calculations. To convert area percentages into an
S-level use the following rules:
   4.7.1. Aircraft units:
       4.7.1.1. Convert EQSEE field to an S-level by using Table 4.6.
       4.7.1.2. Convert EQSSE field to an S-level by using Table 4.7.
       4.7.1.3. Select the lower of EQSEE and EQSSE S-levels.
   4.7.2. Non-aircraft units:
       4.7.2.1. Select the lowest percentage value from EQSEE and EQSSE percentages.
       4.7.2.2. Convert percentage into an equipment and supplies O/H S-level using Table 4.3.
   4.7.3. Note the derived equipment and supplies O/H S-level. If the S-level has changed since
   the last report, enter it in the ESRAT label. Use the Measured Resource Subarea Level for
   Equipment/Supplies O/H (ESRAF) for secondary or tertiary missions.
   4.7.4. If Table 4.1 lists nothing to report for the combat essential and support equipment
   O/H percentages, report S-6 in ESRAT and SNM in ESRES.
4.8. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reason Codes. Select the most specific reason code from
Table 4.5 when the equipment and supplies O/H S-level is less than S-1. Note the selected
reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report, enter the new reason code in the
label ESRES. Use the label ESREF for secondary or tertiary missions.
4.9. Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM) and Weapon System Management Information
System Sustainability Assessment Module (WSMIS-SAM). When the SORTS DOC
Statement references ASM or WSMIS-SAM units must use Table 4.9 to find the spares subarea
percentage. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement if there is a major problem with the ASM
assessments. When there is a validated problem with ASM, MAJCOMs may direct the use of
WSMIS-SAM as a secondary or tertiary means of providing an assessment of capability
attributed to spare parts. The following rules apply for ASM and WSMIS-SAM:
   4.9.1. No ASM or WSMIS-SAM available. If ASM or WSMIS-SAM is not available, and
   when authorized by MAJCOM, use the RSP (XD2 only) fill rate to report, using Table 4.9,
   rules 1-4. Report percentages in the RSP and ESSA1 fields. Enter an X in the ARUSD field.
   4.9.2. For units with strategic airlift aircraft (C-17, C-5, C-141), use percent SORTIES
   achieved over 30 days (reference Table 4.9).
       4.9.2.1. Enter Y in the ARUSD field.
       4.9.2.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9).
       4.9.2.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
   4.9.3. All other aircraft units (non-strategic airlift) use the aircraft availability spares
   assessment method (reference Table 4.9).
       4.9.3.1. Enter Z in the ARUSD field.
       4.9.3.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9).
       4.9.3.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                              91


   4.9.4. Guidance for specific aircraft availability (ACFTA) options to be used for each
   aircraft type is included in the notes to Table 4.9. Units will contact their MAJCOM office
   with any questions as to which ACFTA Option is appropriate.
   4.9.5. MAJCOMs will promptly notify HQ AFMC Logistics (HQ AFMC/LGXX) of specific
   modeling disconnects with ASM. Notifications should be made within 48 hours of discovery,
   but not later than 72 hours.
   4.9.6. When ASM is used spare engine assessments will be made using Table 4.8 reporting
   the percentage in the ESSA2 field. The ASM assessment does not include spare engines.
4.10. Non-Returnable Deployed Resources. Occasionally, a unit may own equipment that is
required to be left in the contingency AOR after unit personnel redeploy to their home station.
Equipment defined as non-deployable/non-returnable because of use in a particular AOR will be
immediately reported as non-available in the units SORTS report. Unit S-level will reflect the
computations derived from lack of specified equipment.
   4.10.1. MRSPs. MRSPs having SBSS MRSP details that are partially or totally transferred to
   either a MAJCOM Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) or to the deployed SBSS account are
   still the responsibility of the owning base for SORTS reporting.
   4.10.2. The owning LRS will contact the RSS or deployed account to obtain an R26 for the
   transferred items and calculate these assets as available, if they can be redeployed within the
   response time.
   4.10.3. ASM will be used in conjunction with R26 merge program to assess the deployed
   unit’s MRSP (or mission support kit, MRSK, if partially deployed) along with the MRSPs at
   the home base for SORTS.
4.11. BEAR Base Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. Required equipment and
supplies S-levels are based on critical equipment and MRSP authorized for items identified in the
BEAR Base SORTS Critical Item List, as applicable. Authorized suitable substitutes may be
used. The BEAR Base Critical Item List is produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC)
Logistics and should be used to calculate these levels.
4.12. Aircraft Engine Computations. These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104, ―Selective
Management of Selected Gas Turbine Engines‖ and must be used to determine required war
readiness engines. Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime requirement, must be
included in computations. All aircraft with engine holes will have serviceable engines allocated.
The number of net serviceable spare engines will then be compared to the WRE requirement and
the reported percentage is the factor to be entered on the S-level checklist. Engines installed in or
obligated to BAI, cannibalized (CANN), and unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available
within response time, may be considered by the unit commander to subjectively upgrade the S-
level. This can include engines projected available through the pipeline, jet engine intermediate
maintenance, or logistics support center provided that serviceability and Ready For Issue (RFI)
requirements are met.

Note: If 11 or more engines are required, compute and report the actual percentage available.
This table
is used in conjunction with Table 4.7. Units reporting at squadron level, use the number of
engines
required for the squadron. Units reporting at wing level, use the number of engines required for
the wing.
These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104 and must be used to determine required war
readiness
engines. Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime requirement, must be included in
computations.

All aircraft with engine holes will have serviceable engines allocated. The number of net
serviceable
spare engines will then be compared to the WRE requirement and the reported percentage is the
factor to be entered on the Aircraft and Equipment and Supplies O/H S-level checklist. Engines
installed
in or obligated to BAI, CANN, and unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available within the
response
time, may be considered by the unit commander to subjectively upgrade the S-level. This can
include
engines projected available through the pipeline, jet engine intermediate maintenance, or a
logistic support
center provided that serviceability and RFI requirements are met.

                  EQUIPMENT CONDITION MEASURED AREA DATA

5.1. Equipment Condition Reporting. The equipment condition measured area is used to
measure the combat essential and support equipment that can be made ready within the unit’s
response time to undertake the unit’s assigned wartime mission. This measure is also used to
indicate maintenance and equipment reliability, serviceability and operational status of assets.
Units compute the equipment condition R-level for combat essential and support equipment
based on the availability of wartime required equipment. Equipment items are considered
available if they are possessed by the unit and are, or can be, made mission ready within the
prescribed unit response time. The formula for equipment condition computation is: the number
of equipment items mission ready and available divided by the number possessed (not to exceed
the wartime requirement number) multiplied by 100.
5.2. Equipment Condition Subareas (ERSAs). The equipment condition measured area
allows units to measure up to nine subareas. Consider the following for all missions:
   5.2.1. Use SORTS DOC Statements, equipment lists, Air Staff-level functional area
   guidance, LOGDET, AS’s, etc., as necessary, to determine equipment types; then measure
   the number possessed.
       5.2.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) SORTS Monitors will calculate Equipment Condition Sub
       Areas (ERSAs) in the same structure as Equipment and Supplies Sub Area Percentage
       (ESSAs). (i.e., ERSA 1 is the same type of equipment reported in ESSA 1)
   5.2.2. Add number of items possessed for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
5.3. Subarea Percentage Calculations. Determine the number of items mission ready and
available for each subarea. Accomplish the following:
   5.3.1. Add number of items MRA for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   5.3.2. Forecast the number of items that could be MRA by response time.
   5.3.3. Calculate the subarea percentages:
       5.3.3.1. If there are ten or more items possessed accomplish the following:
           5.3.3.1.1. Divide the number of items MRA by the number of items possessed.
           5.3.3.1.2. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the number of
           items authorized.
           5.3.3.1.3. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
           5.3.3.1.4. Round percentage to nearest whole number (this is the subarea
           percentage.).
       5.3.3.2. If there are nine or less items possessed select the appropriate percentage from
       Table 5.2, unless Table 5.4 contains other instructions. Note the derived percentages. If a
       percentage has changed since the last report, enter the new percentage in the appropriate
       subarea label from Table 5.4.

5.4. Combat Essential and Support Equipment Condition Percentage Calculations:
   5.4.1. Find the unit type in Table 5.1, Column A. Use Column B for combat essential
   equipment and Column C for support equipment.
   5.4.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment condition percentage for
   each area accomplish the following:
       5.4.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, select the lowest percentage for those subareas.
       5.4.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate the percentage with
       the same procedure used for subarea calculations.
   5.4.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed, enter the new percentage
   in the EQREE label for combat essential equipment or EQRED label for support equipment.
   5.4.4. Note the derived number of combat essential items. For aircraft units, determine the
   number of aircraft that are mission ready and available.
       5.4.4.1. If the number of aircraft that are mission ready and available has changed since
       the last report enter the new number in the label MEMRA.
       5.4.4.2. The number of aircraft reported in the labels MEASG, MEPOS, and MEMRA
       fields will not be greater than the number reported in the label MEARD.
       5.4.4.3. The actual number of aircraft authorized, possessed, and mission-ready and
       available is reported in the MEQLOCN set.
5.5. Equipment Condition R-Level Calculations.
   5.5.1. To convert area percentages into an R-level use the following rules:
       5.5.1.1. Select the lowest percentage value from the combat essential and support
       equipment condition area percentages.
       5.5.1.2. Aircraft units use Table 5.3 to convert the combat essential equipment condition
       percentage into an R-level.
       5.5.1.3. Non-aircraft units use Table 5.6 to convert the equipment condition area
       percentage into an R-level.
   5.5.2. Note the derived equipment condition R-level. If the R-level has changed since the
   last report, enter the new R-level in the ERRAT label (Equipment Condition Measured
   Resource Area Category Subarea (ERRAF) label for secondary or tertiary missions).
   5.5.3. When an AF directed resource change depletes mission ready and available
   equipment, reference paragraph 1.10.9.
   5.5.4. If Table 5.1 lists nothing to report for the combat essential equipment condition and
   support equipment condition percentages, report R-6 in ERRAT and RNM in ERRES (see
   paragraph 4.7.4).
5.6. Equipment Condition Reason Codes.
   5.6.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 5.5, when the equipment condition
   R-level is less than R-1.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                            151


   5.6.2. Note the selected reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report,
   enter the new reason code in the ERRES or ERREF label.
5.7. Equipment Considered Mission Ready and Available (MRA). Most equipment is
considered mission ready if the equipment is safe to use and in the condition to perform the
functions for which it was designed.
   5.7.1. Aircraft, missiles, and major weapons systems must comply with the following:
       5.7.1.1. Have a full or basic system list of items for the stated working mission
       (MAJCOMs are the authority on which system to use).
       5.7.1.2. Be configured with suspension equipment (i.e., dash 21 items and alternate
       mission equipment) that is required by the MAJCOM.
       5.7.1.3. Have all peacetime inspections or time compliance technical order actions
       completed or waived for wartime use.
   5.7.2. In-Place Generation, Alert, or Surveillance Missions. Consider items available if the
   items will be ready at their duty location within response time.
       5.7.2.1. Consider strategic air defense aircraft available when these aircraft are within the
       United States or Canada.
       5.7.2.2. Consider strategic airlift aircraft on operational missions available regardless of
       their location.
       5.7.2.3. Consider strategic tankers on operational missions available if the aircraft will be
       ready to deploy within the response time.
   5.7.3. Mobility Missions. Consider items available, regardless of location, if the items are
   expected to be ready within response time. Equipment items left in a contingency AOR,
   while personnel reconstitute or redeploy, will be reported as non-available if equipment
   condition cannot be ascertained.
   5.7.4. Combined In-place Generation and Mobility Mission. Allocate equipment to each
   mission type and apply the guidelines for each specific mission type.
   5.7.5. Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 Mission. Consider items available if the items are
   expected to be ready within response time.
   5.7.6. Equipment items loaned to another unit to augment their resources. Will be
   considered possessed by the owning unit. Items will not be double counted. Receiving unit
   will not use these resources for SORTS reporting.
5.8. BEAR Base Equipment Condition Measured Area. Equipment condition R-levels are
based on fully mission capable critical equipment authorized for items identified in the BEAR
Base Critical Item List produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) Logistics. Use the
standard command checklists to calculate this area.
5.9. Required Remarks for Aircraft Units. If referencing aircraft grounded for mission
capable (MICAP) parts, provide the National Stock Number (NSN), part nomenclature, and the
name of the system which needs the part. If the aircraft is unavailable due to scheduled or
unscheduled maintenance, provide the Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC). Also provide the

NOTES:
1. Rule 43 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to transmit
and receive secure communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM HAVE QUICK,
and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios and be mounted in a
mission ready and available tactical vehicle.
2. Rule 43 A TAC kit is MRA when the following items are MRA: TACP Close Air Support
System, laser range finder, thermal imager/laser spot viewer, and GPS receiver.
3. To compute percentage divide the quantity MRA by the quantity authorized and multiply the
result by 100. This must be done for each UTC, use the lowest percentage to determine the
support equipment condition.
4. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear support
equipment.
5. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft; even
if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP).
6. Rule 12 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to transmit
and receive secure communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM HAVE QUICK,
and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios and be mounted in a
mission ready and available tactical vehicle.

NOTES:
1. Where different, values for US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) CRCs are enclosed in
parentheses.
2. Compute maximum number of customers that could be supported by assigned telephone
switch(es); considering available instruments, cable, j-boxes, termination units, switch capacity,
central processing unit (CPU) function, and any other factor impacting service availability.
3. Consider ability to terminate one AUTODIN circuit (UGC-144, etc.)
4. C2 channels require transmit and receive capability over radios in 4 OMs and external radios.
5. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link,
down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TSC-100A GMF SHF
SATCOM hub. Numbers of carriers are TSC-100A available.

6. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link,
down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TSC-94A GMF SHF
SATCOM.
7. TROPO requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, transmit, receive,
demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TRC-170.
8. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR link.
9. Net control requires capability to automatically configure, monitor, test, and control circuits
and trunks transitioning the facility using TSQ-111 or TSQ-188.
10. To compute multiplexing package capability divide available capability of assigned
multiplexers (TSQ-146, FCC-100, RMC, etc.) by designed capability and multiply by 100.
11. Compute ERSA4 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein. Where a
rating crosses two scores, assume higher score unless driven lower by another rating (e.g. 1 TSC-
100A Carrier). Where no criteria exists for an area, failure to meet minimum criteria will drive
score no lower than minimum criteria noted (e.g. no message traffic capability = 70 percent).

considering available instruments, cable, j-boxes, termination units, switch capacity, CPU
function, and any other factors impacting service availability.
2. Consider ability to terminate two DMS circuits (primary and alternate) at a record
communications facility and two TCP.IP nets (NIPRNET or SIPRNET).
3. Operating RF Links requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of the link.
4. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, uplink,
downlink, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using LMST, USC-60A, or
DDT.

circuits and trunks:
a. Systems under Note 5b fully operational and sufficient other components to support TDC
communication equipment as identified in the MISCAP.
b. Facilities, processor, patch and test, timing subsystems, and automatic digital test (ADT) fully
operational. c. Ability to manually configure, monitor, test, and control circuits and trunks using
other facility.
6. Compute ERSA1, ERSA2, and ERSA3 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas
measured herein. Where no criteria exists for an area, failure to meet minimum criteria will drive
the score no lower than the minimum criteria notes (e.g., no RF link capability =70%) unless
driven lower by another area.

                                  TRAINING MEASURED
                                      AREA DATA
6.1. Training. Training measurement is used to indicate the status of training needed to support
the mission for which a unit is designed, as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement.
 198                                             AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


Measured units will calculate a training measured area T-level using either Training Method B
(Crew Training) or Training Method C, Option 1 (Unit Training) or Option 2 (CAF Aviation
Unit Training).
   6.1.1. Option 1 is used to provide fidelity, flexibility, and a macro view of the unit’s training.
   6.1.2. Option 2 is used by CAF aviation units, command and control reporting units, and
   those assigned to a wing (89AA UTC - active duty only) with Aircrew Position Indicator
   (API) codes 1 (pilot), 2 (navigator, observer or air battle manager), and A (career enlisted
   advisor (CEA)) plus 6, or B for CEA, (attached flyer at wing level and below) and 8, or D for
   CEA, (attached flyer above wing level) used to achieve WMP-5 sortie rates (e.g. Wing
   Safety, Tactics, STANEVAL, IG, etc.).
       6.1.2.1. Wing crews with RPI 6 and 8 attached to a squadron for training and wartime
       service are normally measured in the organization of assignment when tasked against that
       unit’s requirements. Personnel resources cannot be counted against requirements in more
       than one unit.
       6.1.2.2. Weapons load crews (AFSC 2W1X1) are unique among maintenance personnel,
       in that they perform their duties as formed and certified crews with specialized
       certification requirements for each crew position. T-levels for 2W1X1 personnel,
       assigned to a weapons load crew, may be determined using Training Method B if and
       when it is allowed by current reporting structure and guidance.
6.2. Using Training Method B: Crew Training.
   6.2.1. Find the number of crews authorized or required.
       6.2.1.1. Aircraft units reporting against a mobility, SIOP, or combined in-
       place/generation and mobility mission:
          6.2.1.1.1. Check the MISCAP of the UTC listed in the SORTS DOC Statement for
          crew ratio or use crew ratio listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
          Factors, Attachment 36-1, separated by aircraft type.
          6.2.1.1.2. For each UTC, multiply the crew ratio by the primary mission aircraft
          inventory (PMAI) authorization on the SORTS DOC Statement to get the number of
          crews required. Add the separate UTC amounts together to get the total number of
          crews required.
       6.2.1.2. Aircraft units reporting against an in-place/generation or alert mission:
          6.2.1.2.1. Check AFI 65-503 to determine the crew ratio associated with the unit’s
          aircraft type.
          6.2.1.2.2. Multiply the crew ratio by the PMAI authorization on the SORTS DOC
          Statement to get the number of crews authorized.
       6.2.1.3. The AF Space Training manager in coordination with the AF Space FAM will
       ensure space operations unit crew requirements are set and based on unit DOCs.
       6.2.1.4. Aeromedical evacuation unit crew requirements are determined by adding
       together the number of crew UTCs tasked to the unit.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                           199


     6.2.1.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change under
     the TCARQ label.
     6.2.1.6. Weapons load crew requirements are determined by adding the number of crews
     tasked by aviation UTCs or for SIOP generation (if applicable).
  6.2.2. Find the number of crews assigned.
     6.2.2.1. For aircraft units, use AFI 65-503 for crew composition unless modified by the
     MAJCOM because of unique mission requirements.
     6.2.2.2. All other units, use Table 6.1 for crew composition.
     6.2.2.3. Weapons load crew composition is determined IAW AFI 21-101.
     6.2.2.4. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember.
     Do not limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by AFI 65-503. Count
     crewmembers as assigned from when they sign in on a permanent change of station until
     they sign out.
     6.2.2.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change under
     the TCRAS label. Total crews assigned may not exceed total crews authorized or
     required.
         6.2.2.5.1. Count weapons load crew members as assigned once they are designated to
         a position and have entered initial weapons load crew training.
         6.2.2.5.2. Standardized load crews (SLC), assigned to weapons standardization, will
         be apportioned equally to flying squadrons for determining assigned load crews.
  6.2.3. Count the number of crews mission ready and available.
     6.2.3.1. Count a crew mission ready and available (MRA) when all positions are filled
     with MRA crewmembers.
         6.2.3.1.1. If they meet the mission ready criteria in the training directive listed in the
         SORTS DOC Statement.
         6.2.3.1.2. Determine     crewmember       availability   case-by-case     according    to
         paragraph 3.2.
         6.2.3.1.3. Do not count overhead crewmembers (e.g., wing training officers, etc.).
     6.2.3.2. Enter the total of crews MRA under the TCRAV label.
     6.2.3.3. Count weapons load crews as mission ready and available when all positions are
     filled with position-certified weapons loaders IAW AFI 21-101 and the Unit Committed
     Munitions List.
  6.2.4. Calculate the training percentage.
     6.2.4.1. If ten or more crews are assigned, divide crews MRA by crews assigned.
     Multiply the result by 100 and round off to the nearest whole number.
     6.2.4.2.
 200                                              AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


Table 6.3. will be used to determine the overall T-level.
       6.2.4.3. If nine or less crews are assigned use Table 6.2.
       6.2.4.4. Enter the percentage under the TRUTC label.
6.3. Using Training Method C, Option 1 - Unit Training. Use this training method to report
subareas specified on the SORTS DOC Statement for the unit types in Table 6.4.
   6.3.1. Determine the number of personnel required to have the training specified in each
   subarea. Some units may have more personnel assigned than are authorized by UMD or
   required by UTC. All individuals must be trained, but not all may be measured in the training
   measured area. Using Method C, Option 1, the number you establish as assigned requiring
   training may not exceed UMD-authorized or UTC-required total personnel.
       6.3.1.1. If a single type of training is listed, determine if everyone is required to have it.
            6.3.1.1.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the number of total
            personnel assigned as the number required to be trained.
            6.3.1.1.2. If everyone is not required to have the training, use the number of total
            personnel assigned that require the training, (e.g. 25K/40K aerial port training).
       6.3.1.2. If there is more than one type of training listed, (e.g. chemical warfare and
       weapons), determine if everyone is required to have the training.
            6.3.1.2.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the total personnel assigned
            as the number required to be trained. (Consider limitations in paragraph 6.3.1).
            6.3.1.2.2. If less than all assigned personnel are required to have each type of
            training, add together the number required for each type of training. This number
            could be more than the number of personnel requiring training.
   6.3.2. Count the personnel who have the training specified in each subarea.
       6.3.2.1. Personnel are counted as trained if they have completed, or are expected to
       complete, the required training within the response time.
       6.3.2.2. If everyone is required to have all training, count only those personnel who have
       all the training.
       6.3.2.3. If personnel are required to have each type of training, count those personnel
       who have received each type of training. In this method, you can count the same
       individual more than once. To determine the T-level, continue with paragraph 6.5.
   6.3.3.

Table 6.3. will be used to determine the overall T-level.
6.4. Using Training Method C, Option 2: CAF Aviation Unit Training.
   6.4.1. Calculations by type of training and crew composition will be compared against the
   percentage conversion Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and Table 6.8 to derive the percentages
   reported in the specific TRSAs. The lowest of the resulting TRSAs will drive the T-level
   reported in the TRRAT label in the OVERALL set.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                       201


  6.4.2. As a minimum, the following three training events will be measured. All five subareas
  may be used depending on MAJCOM requirements. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in
  paragraph 6.5.4.
     6.4.2.1. TRSA1 - Basic Mission Capable (BMC).
     6.4.2.2. TRSA2 - Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
     6.4.2.3. TRSA3 - Special Capability (SPECAP).
  6.4.3. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember.
  However, don't limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by appropriate
  training directives for the weapon system. Count crewmembers as assigned from when they
  sign in on a permanent change of station or become attached on temporary duty until they
  sign out.
  6.4.4. Single Position Crews:
     6.4.4.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
         6.4.4.1.1. Determine the number of required BMC/Mission Capable (MC) designated
         crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required
         based on non-CMR flying positions within the wing and its subordinate units. If the
         BMC changes, detail the changes in a TRSA1 remark.
         6.4.4.1.2. Determine the number of required CMR/Mission Ready (MR) designated
         crew members, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required
         based on the PMAI specified by the SORTS DOC Statement.
             6.4.4.1.2.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
             6.4.4.1.2.2. Add the Squadron Commander and Director of Operations (DO)
             (ANG/ AFRC only).
             6.4.4.1.2.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
         6.4.4.1.3. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crew members,
         assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required based on all
         positions identified in the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and
         ready aircrew program tasking messages that specify special capability-trained
         aircrews. Calculations will be made only on those SPECAP requirements that match
         those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs may add to this table when approved by HQ
         USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect
         his ability to undertake his DOC mission. If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes
         in a TRSA3 remark.
  6.4.5. Multi-Position Crews:
     6.4.5.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
         6.4.5.1.1. Units with multi-position crews will perform calculations similar to single
         position crews except against each crew position individually. This is required before
         TRSA, TRUTC, and T-level percentages can be determined.
 202                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


          6.4.5.1.2. Determine the number of required BMC designated crewmembers,
          assigned or attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the non-CMR flying
          positions within the wing and its subordinate units. If the BMC changes, detail the
          changes in a TRSA1 remark.
          6.4.5.1.3. Determine the number of required CMR/MR designated crewmembers,
          assigned and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the PMAI specified
          by the SORTS DOC Statement.
              6.4.5.1.3.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
              6.4.5.1.3.2. Add the Squadron Commander and DO (ANG/AFRC only).
              6.4.5.1.3.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
              6.4.5.1.3.4. For Air Control Squadrons, determine the number of required
              CMR/MR designated crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, in each
              position, based on the UTC manpower requirements.
          6.4.5.1.4. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crewmembers,
          assigned and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on all positions
          identified in the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and tasking
          messages that specify special capability-trained aircrews. Calculations will be made
          only on those SPECAP requirements that match those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs
          may add to this table when approved by HQ USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess
          other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect his ability to undertake his DOC mission.
          If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes in a TRSA3 remark.
6.5. Calculating and Explaining the Training T-Level.
   6.5.1. Training Method C, Option 1: Unit Training, determine T-level using the following:
       6.5.1.1. Calculate the subarea percentage using applicable tables, as required. Otherwise:
          6.5.1.1.1. If ten or more personnel are required to have the training, divide the
          number of trained personnel by the number of assigned personnel required to have the
          training (not to exceed the wartime required number).
          6.5.1.1.2. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
          6.5.1.1.3. Round the percent to the nearest whole number.
          6.5.1.1.4. If nine or less personnel are required to have the training, use Table 6.2 to
          determine the percentage.
       6.5.1.2. Calculate the training percentage. Determine the unit type in Table 6.4 in
       column A. Across from the unit type in column B, determine whether the entry lists
       subarea labels.
          6.5.1.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, choose the lowest subarea percentage as the
          area percentage.
          6.5.1.2.2. If the entry lists types of training or another document, calculate an area
          percentage using the same procedure as for a subarea.
          6.5.1.2.3. If changed since the last report, enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                        203


     6.5.1.3. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.3 to determine the T-
     level to be reported in the TRRAT field. Use the Measured Resource Area Level for
     Training (TRRAF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.2. Training Method B: Crew Training, determine T-level using the following:
     6.5.2.1. If ten or more assigned, divide the number of crews mission ready and available
     by the number of assigned (not to exceed the wartime required number). Multiply the
     result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
     6.5.2.2. If nine or less assigned, use Table 6.1.
     6.5.2.3. If the percentage of crews changed since the last report, enter the change in the
     TRUTC label.
  6.5.3. Training Method C, Option 2: Single Position Crews, use the following to determine
  the T-level:
     6.5.3.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
         6.5.3.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2 to derive percentage trained.
         6.5.3.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number
         assigned.
     6.5.3.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding training
     table (BMC/Table 6.6, CMR/ Table 6.7, and SPECAP/Table 6.8).
     6.5.3.3. Convert the column A percentage into the column B reported percentage.
     6.5.3.4. Enter percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in TRSA2;
     and SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in paragraph 6.5.1.
     6.5.3.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
     6.5.3.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and
     Table 6.8 to determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for
     Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.4. For Training Method C, Option 2: Multi-position crews, use the following to
  determine the T-level:
     6.5.4.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
         6.5.4.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2 to derive percentage trained.
         6.5.4.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number
         assigned.
     6.5.4.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding training
     table (BMC/Table 6.3, CMR/Table 6.4, and SPECAP/Table 6.5).
     6.5.4.3. Convert the corresponding percentage in column B.
     6.5.4.4. Enter the percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in
     TRSA2; and SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in 6.5.1.
     6.5.4.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
204                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


      6.5.4.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and Table
      6.8 to determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for
      Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.5. Regardless of option used, assign training reason codes when the training T-level is
  less than T-1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 6.5 to explain it. If changed,
  enter it in label TRRES. Use TRREF for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.6. For units that conduct required training and must use alternate workaround facilities or
  methods due to environmental restrictions on normal exercise or major training range areas,
  commanders should note this limitation through a TRRAT or TRSA remark and indicate an
  appropriate reason code from Table 6.5.

NOTES:
1. Rule 24 Report based on the combined total percentage of UTC-tasked NCC personnel
who've completed the training as specified. However, if any of the following six categories are
more than one T-level different from the combined average, report the lowest level of those
categories.
a. Crew Commander
b. Operations Controller
c. HelpDesk Technician
d. Network Management (includes Network Services Technician and Infrastructure Technician
crew positions).
e. Network Administration (includes Messaging Technician, Application Services Technician,
and Configuration Management Technician crew positions).
f. Information Protection (includes Boundary Protection Specialist, Intrusion Detection
Specialist, and Vulnerability Assessment Specialist crew positions).
2. Rule 24 Report based on the combined total percentage of UTC-tasked NOSC personnel
who've completed the training as specified. However, if any of the following nine categories are
more than one T-level different from the combined average, report the lowest level of those
categories.

3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat Air Forces.
4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual Information (VI)
mobility mission, members must complete the COMCAM Contingency Support course at least
once. Such training is considered valid as long as the member is assigned to subsequent
COMCAM or VI units. Assignment outside such a mobility environment not including extended
TDYs, short tours or specialized training under one year nullifies currency of this training,
requiring the member to re-accomplish. COMCAM and/or VI unit commanders may, at their
discretion, choose to send members to the training beyond the minimum requirement as
readiness dictates. Air Force Aircrew Survival Training (for appropriately qualified aircrew
personnel) may substitute for the COMCAM Contingency Support course, consistent with the
rules described above.
5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general assessor,
technical course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise (Hardstand) as an engineer.
6. Rule 43 TACS will be considered current if they meet all air-strike control currency
requirements to include Night, Live, Laser, and basic TAC requisites (IAW AFI 13-112, Vol 1).
7. Rule 43 Units will include TRUTC remark to report the total number of combat mission ready
JTACS broken out by officer and enlisted numbers.
8. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear support
equipment.
9. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft; even
if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP)

REVISION 03, or WMP in a SORTS DOC Statement.
Deploy/Deployment— To relocate a unit, or an element thereof, to a desired area of operations
or to a staging area. Deployment will be accomplished with all required personnel and
equipment. Deployment begins when the first aircraft, personnel, or item of equipment leaves the
home base. The force is deployed when the last component of the unit has arrived.
Deployed (for SORTS Assessment)—These resources are not currently at home station by
reason of execution of a properly authorized movement order or Joint deployment order.
Additionally, not recallable by a commander ’s Leave and TDY recall message. Normally,
deployment in support of training exercises or Joint exercises would not preclude recall or
release of forces by the exercising commander.
Designed Operational Capability (DOC)—A summary of a units mission and resources for
which it has been organized, designed, and equipped.
Desire List—An inquiry product run by the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) to reflect a listing

Desire List is a flexible product in that various personnel aspects can be queried.
Direct Support Objective (DSO)—The supply support parameter used in both the Dyna-
METRIC and Aircraft Sustainability Models to indicate the minimum number of mission capable
aircraft necessary to generate a unit's required wartime sorties. The DSO is used in the
computation and assessment of Readiness Spares Packages.
Direct Support Unit (DSU)—Military organization whose resources are measured in SORTS
but are reported under the unit identification code (UIC) of another unit (e.g., aircraft
maintenance, pararescue, etc.). They are also called resource units.
Detachment—1) A part of a unit separated from its main organization for duty elsewhere and 2)
A temporary military unit formed from other units or parts of units.
Dyna—METRIC Microcomputer Analysis System (DMAS)—DMAS is a PC based spares
capability assessment program similar to WSMIS-SAM. O/H spare parts data is gathered at the
unit level and the assessment process is done locally vice central processing provided by
WSMIS-SAM.
Element—The nomenclature used to account for manpower authorizations and to identify Air
Force personnel on duty with agencies outside the Air Force. Although not a unit for
organizational purposes, an element may function as a unit if so designated and a commissioned
officer eligible to command either assumes command or is appointed on orders as commander.
Employment—Employment involves the tactical use of aircraft in a desired area of operation. In
airlift operations it is the movement of forces into or within a combat zone or objective area,
usually in the assault phase. Also, it is the strategic, operational, or tactical use of forces and
materiel in an area or theater of operations.

Major Equipment—Combat essential equipment that is key to a unit's capabilities as defined in
its authorization documents and central to its ability to undertake its mission (e.g. an F-16 to an
F-16 squadron or transportable communications equipment to a combat communications
squadron).
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)—A data system designed to
support contingency and general war planning with predefined standardized manpower and
equipment force packages. MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment,
is composed of two subsystems: the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the
Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR).
Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)—The MEFPAK component which provides:
The title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint Chiefs of Staff unit type code. The
capability statement containing the definition of unit capability. The manpower detail by
function, grade (officers only) and Air Force specialty code required to meet the defined
capability.
Measured Units—Air Force active duty, Reserve, and Air National Guard units that are
registered in SORTS with a unit descriptor code (UDC) which identifies the unit as combat,
combat support, or combat service support.

and combat service support units of the operating forces, including Active duty, AF Reserve, and
Air National Guard, and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or
combatant command-directed OPLAN, CONPLAN, SIOP, Service war planning document or
assigned in the ―Forces For Unified Commands‖ document are designated as measured units
(units that report SORTS).
Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)—A short paragraph associated with each UTC that
describes significant employment information. The MISCAP briefly explains mission capability,
and states the types of bases to which a unit can be deployed (i.e., BEAR base, standby
deployment base, or limited operating base).
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in a unit’s primary tasked mission; a prerequisite for CMR and BMC status.
Mission Ready and Available (MRA) Aircraft—MRA aircraft have operational full system list
(FSL) or basic system list (BSL) items for the stated mission and are available within the
response time. The aircraft are configured with required suspension equipment, weapons are
uploaded, servicing is completed, and pre-flights are done. The major command determines
which list will be used, which items are required, and the aircraft configuration.
Mission Ready and Available Crews—Primary duty crews who are mission ready and
available to undertake the unit's specified wartime tasking. The measured unit commander
determines crew availability.
Mission Ready and Available Equipment—Equipment that is available and in condition to
perform the functions for which designed within the response time.

Mobility Mission—A wartime mission for which the measured unit will normally mobilize and
deploy to another area of operation prior to employment.
Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)—An air transportable package of war reserve
materiel spares, repair parts, and related maintenance supplies required to support planned
wartime or contingency operations of a weapon or support system for a specified period of time
pending re-supply. MRSP may support aircraft, vehicles, communications systems, and other
systems as appropriate.
Notional Tasking—The condition of being prepared to execute a mission set against a planned
requirement that is in fact not tasked, but representative of a probable task in contingency or
deliberate planning actions. Units sourced to the Air Force War and Mobilization Plan against
apportioned requirements that are not currently tasked to any OPLAN, CONPLAN, or
OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03 are notionally tasked to be able to deliver their
Designed Operational Capability within their response time if allocated to a crisis or sourced to a
TPFDD.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in Combatant Command (command authority) and is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands
and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary
to accomplish the mission.
Operating Location (OL)—Part of a unit that is geographically separated from its parent unit. It
is used to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned to the parent unit so the
command supervision or other features provided by a detachment are not needed. An OL has
none of the administrative attributes of a unit.
Operation Plan—A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is in the form of
directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting
plans and orders. The designation ―plan‖ is usually used instead of ―order‖ in preparing for
operations well in advance. An operation plan may be put into effect at a prescribed time, or on
signal, and then becomes and operation order (CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and
Training System (GSORTS)). Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operational Plan
(OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03), for the conduct of military operations. Plans are
prepared by Combatant Commanders in response to requirements established by the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements
tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans (OPLANs) are prepared in either
complete format of an OPLAN, or as a concept plan (CONPLAN).
OPLAN is an operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis
for developing an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to
execute the combatant commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these
resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in time—
phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked
operation. The plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as
described in the JOPES manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and formats.
CONPLAN is an operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                              261


expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
combatant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary
by the combatant commander to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are
not calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. Operational control includes authoritative
direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish
missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through the
commanders of subordinate organizations; normally this authority is exercised through the
Service component commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to
organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational
control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not, in
and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline,
internal organization, or unit training.
Organic Equipment—Equipment authorized, required, and under the direct control of the unit.
Overhead Crew—A person or a group of people assigned or attached to the organization in a
status other than that of primary duty crew (e.g., wing training officers, safety officers,
maintenance officers, etc.) who maintain mission ready status. Overhead crewmembers WILL
NOT be counted in the personnel or training C-level calculations. They may be assessed
subjectively in the unit’s.
Overall C—level—Commanders of measured units and operations officers who maintain
mission ready status may be counted in the personnel and training C-level calculations.
Pacing Item—An individual line item whose shortage more closely reflects support capability
rather than overall fill rates.
Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft for which actual responsibility has been given to a measured unit
for operational use. Aircraft temporarily absent but remaining under the operational control
(OPCON) of the measured unit are considered possessed aircraft. This includes aircraft
possessed by a unit’s supporting maintenance facilities until the aircraft are lost from the unit
according to AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.
Possessed Equipment—Equipment for which the measured unit has been given actual
responsibility according to applicable supply regulations for operational use.
Primary Air Force Specialty Code—The awarded AFSC in which an airman is most highly
qualified to perform duty.
Primary Aircraft Authorization Aircraft—authorized to a unit for performance of its
operational mission. The primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation of operating
resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hour funds (CJCSM 3150.02,
Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Primary Duty Crewmember—A person assigned or attached to a measured unit for the explicit
purposes of operating that unit’s primary mission weapon system.
Primary Mission—The wartime mission that is most resource demanding. The only exception is
when a unit has a less resource demanding mission of higher priority (e.g., OPERATIONS
PLAN 8044 REVISION 03).
Registered Units—Units that have the potential to support, by deployment or otherwise, a CJCS
or combatant command-directed operations plan, contingency plan, Single Integrated Operations

Capabilities Plan. The six volumes of the WMP extends through the Six Year Defense Program
to provide continuity in short and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides current
planning cycle policies and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations.
It establishes requirements for development of mobilization and production-planning programs
to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces. The WMP encompasses
all functions necessary to match facilities, manpower, and material with planned wartime activity
(AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).
War Reserve Material (WRM)—Material required, in addition to mobility equipment, RSP,
and primary operating stocks needed to support wartime activities reflected in the US Air Force
War and Mobilization Plan until the industrial base has generated sufficient deliveries to equal
planned wartime consumption (AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).
Wartime Mission—A task or group of tasks assigned to a unit in an approved operations plan
and expected to be executed during some level of armed conflict whether incident, limited war,
or general war.
Wartime Resources—Personnel, equipment, and organic supply assets required to accomplish a
unit’s wartime mission.
Weapon System Management Information System— Sustainability Assessment Module
(WSMIS-SAM) —AFMC/LGI managed module of WSMIS that provides aircraft spare parts
capability assessments using the USAF War and Mobilization Plan Volume 5 (WMP-5) as the
source for standard operational scenarios. WSMIS-SAM combines O/H and authorized spare

 DESIGNED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (DOC) STATEMENT (AF FORM 723 OR
               APPROVED FACSIMILE) DEVELOPMENT

A2.1. Designed Operational Capability Statements. A SORTS DOC Statement identifies a
measured unit and references the unit’s wartime mission(s). Its purpose is to provide a summary
of the mission for which a unit is organized or designed (or equipped, when tasked). The SORTS
DOC Statement is a hard copy management tool used to describe a unit’s mission and provides
details for its SORTS measurement criteria. SORTS DOC Statements are not used as a tasking
source. SORTS DOC Statements list resources and training requirements based on WMP-1, 3,
and 5, command instructions, OPLANS, CONPLANS, and other AF or MAJCOM directives.
All reporting units are provided a primary SORTS DOC Statement that is designed to assist them
to report C-level status to satisfy JCS SORTS requirements. Additionally, units may be provided
other subordinate missions on their DOC Statement, by the MAJCOM, to satisfy unique
requirements. See Chapter 1 for policy on writing SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.1.1. DOC Statements will be developed using an AFF 723 or an approved computer
   generated facsimile.
   A2.1.2. Sections of the SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723). A unit SORTS DOC
   Statement is divided into six sections: Unit Identification, Mission Identification, Measured
   Resources Areas (MSRA), Amplifying Notes, Gaining Command list, and
   Coordination/Review.
       A2.1.2.1. Section I, Unit Identification, includes the measured unit ANAME, HOGEO, a
       representative UTC of the unit type named on the DOC, and the six-character UIC. This
       section also includes the DOC Mission Title, DOCID, and Geographic Location Code
       (GEOLOC).
       A2.1.2.2. Section II, Mission Identification, includes a mission tasking narrative and
       mission specifics (i.e., response time and source, aircraft and missile mission-design-
       series (MDS), planning UTCs the unit is required to support for the unit’s mission(s),
       direct support units’ UICs, ANAME, and OPLAN(s) to which the unit is sourced to
       support). For weapon systems with a range of sortie rates and duration listed in the
       WMP-5, specify the single sortie rate and duration highlighted for planning purposes as
       the wartime flying scenario for SORTS in a unit SORTS DOC Statement, Section II, Part
       B.
       A2.1.2.3. Section III, MSRAs, will include the required measured resource areas.
          A2.1.2.3.1. Section IIIA, Personnel. MAJCOM FAMs will determine if the Total
          Personnel MSRA is determined using the UMD or only UTCs IAW paragraph 3.1
          Additionally, they provide packets for packet methodology of measuring Critical
          Personnel (included in Table 3.1). Use of the packet methodology can allow
          shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS.
          A2.1.2.3.2. Section IIIB, Equipment and Supplies O/H. The Equipment and Supplies
          O/H MSRA section lists the combat essential and/or support equipment and supplies
          that the unit is required to measure in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet
          methodology for measuring equipment and supplies O/H when included as subarea
 266                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


          measurements (ESSAs) in tables listed in Chapter 4. Use of the packet methodology
          allows shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS. This section also includes space
          for additional remarks.
          A2.1.2.3.3. Section IIIC, Equipment Condition. The Equipment Condition MSRA
          section lists the combat and/or support equipment the unit is required to measure and
          report in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet methodology to measure
          equipment condition when included as subarea measurements (ERSAs) in Chapter 5
          tables. Use of the packet methodology allows shortfalls to be more visible within
          SORTS. This section also includes space for additional remarks.
          A2.1.2.3.4. Section IIID, Training. Air Force units use either Training Method B or
          C. Training Method C is comprised of two options, Option 1 and 2. Option 1 is used
          to report unit training. All Active, Reserve, and National Guard units with a CAF
          mission will use Option 2 to support the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). Method B is
          used by aviation units outside CAFs. This section also includes space for additional
          remarks.
       A2.1.2.4. Section IV of the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) provides space for
       amplifying notes. Amplifying notes further guide unit SORTS monitors and commanders
       in understanding the scope of the desired SORTS report and additional details required
       accomplishing the report.
       A2.1.2.5. Section V, Gaining Commands. Lists initial AF gaining commands if the unit
       is to be under OPCON of another command after mobilization.
       A2.1.2.6. Section VI, Coordination and Review. Coordination blocks will be used for
       initial SORTS DOC Statement issue to capture interested parties’ concurrence and the
       review blocks for annual review.
A2.2. Units Required To Have A SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Not every unit in the Air Force is required to have a SORTS DOC Statement. Units
tasked against an OPLAN, Concept Plans, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, or have standard
UTCs coded as simultaneously available for deployment under war time surge conditions (DWS
or DWX), or other tasking documents, are required to have SORTS DOC Statements. Applicable
units will report SORTS regardless of whether currently in plans or available to be included in
these plans. Provisional or task organized units will be provided a SORTS DOC Statement when
they are required to report. Aircraft/Non-Aircraft-Combat units or separately deployable DETs,
Aircraft-Combat Support Elements, Non-aircraft-Combat Support Elements, and Combat Service
Support Elements listed in Table A2.1 must possess a valid SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.2.1. Permanently separated DETs planning to be geographically separated from their
   parent unit will act as measured units and report their own C-level data. These units will have
   an independent PAS code. OLs A, B, etc. will be included in the SORTS DOC Statement and
   SORTS report of their parent unit, when appropriate.
   A2.2.2. DOC Statements must be provided to units as soon as possible after the unit is
   activated by the publication of G-series orders. Units must start reporting in conjunction with
   the effective date of the DOC Statement. The DOC Statement remains in force until the unit
   is inactivated by the publication of a G-Series order.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                              267


A2.3. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statements (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Most units will have only one SORTS DOC Statement called the Primary Mission
SORTS DOC Statement. The Primary Mission SORTS DOC Statement encompasses all
missions for which the unit is organized or designed (primary mission). MAJCOMs may elect to
have a unit report on parts of the overall mission set. If the parts of a unit’s total wartime mission
are significantly distinct, the parent MAJCOM may elect to produce multiple SORTS DOC
Statements for that unit. Any major part of the overall mission (mobility, generation, nuclear,
conventional, etc.) will be a secondary mission and be described on a Secondary Mission SORTS
DOC Statement. Any subordinate portion (UTC, section, flight, etc.) will be a tertiary mission
and be described on a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Units should not use the
SORTS mission rank ordering to prioritize training or resource allocation requirements. Do this
only when directed by the MAJCOM through the planning process.
   A2.3.1. Procedures for Secondary or Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement development
   and approval are the same as the unit’s Primary Wartime Mission SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.3.2. Some resource area P, S, R or T-levels may be the same for secondary or tertiary
   missions as for primary mission resource area Levels. SORTS DOC Statements must include
   enough information on how to measure resources that it is clearly understood.
   A2.3.3. Some units have several missions (survive to operate, Operation Security
   (OPSEC)/Communication Security (COMSEC), SABC, etc.) contained within the primary
   mission. The capability exists to measure these as elements of the primary mission. These
   ancillary missions of the primary mission are not secondary or tertiary wartime missions.
   SORTS DOC Statements are not normally required for these ancillary missions.
A2.4. Source References for SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Thefollowing are examples of references, information, data, and source documents
for SORTS DOC Statements:
   A2.4.1. SORTS Files are record files for units and contain the following information:
       A2.4.1.1. The Unit BIDE. Several fields in the SORTS BIDE set contain information
       which must be used to update the unit SORTS DOC Statement. If the unit data in the
       SORTS BIDE is incorrect, MAJCOM SORTS offices are responsible for immediate
       correction.
       A2.4.1.2. The Unit’s UIC is the six-character code that identifies the unit. It is created by
       adding the letter F to the front and the number zero to the end of the last four characters
       of a unit’s PAS code. Subordinate organizations to the PAS code holding unit may be
       registered in SORTS using the ―parent‖ unit’s PAS. Adding F to the front and a unique
       letter or number at the end (A, B, 1, 2, etc.). Provisional units may be registered by
       replacing the second F with an H and the character following that reflects it relationship
       to the parent.
       A2.4.1.3. The UTC in Section I of the SORTS DOC Statement is the five-character code
       from the unit’s registration BIDE. This UTC is the unit’s Deployment Indicator (DEPID)
       Code 9 non-deployable UTC.
       A2.4.1.4. The Unit ANAME is the standardized unit abbreviation from AFPD 38-5, Unit
       Designations, if available and a unit designation (number).

   A2.4.2. Air Staff and MAJCOM FAM Tasking Documents may be used to obtain specific
   information on tasks and UTC configurations.
   A2.4.3. USAF WMP-3 is divided into three parts and contains information on Combat
   Forces and the AFWUS. WMP-3, Part 1 identifies AF General Purpose Combat Deployable
   Forces, Part 2 identifies Combat Support Deployable Forces (LRS, medical, chaplain,
   comm., etc.), and Part 3 is a list of USAF UTCs approved for use in planning and is the
   catalog of capabilities the AF offers to the supported CCs to build OPLAN taskings. The
   AFWUS is the system of record to record the UTC taskings of wings/units and to provide AF
   planners with a list of USAF UTCs available for tasking. MAJCOMs must disseminate this
   UTC availability information to their wings/units to ensure the units know what UTCs they
   are tasked to support. The AFWUS lists which units will provide UTCs, DOC Statements
   define what UTCs units are designated to support, and the MISCAP defines what specific
   capability the UTCs can provide.
   A2.4.4. USAF WMP-5 describes basic planning factors and data used for aircraft sortie and
   flying hour data.
   A2.4.5. A current manpower detail listing (MP-4 report) from a standard MANFOR retrieval
   may be used to determine current manpower and critical AFSC configurations for tasked
   UTCs.
   A2.4.6. A current Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) extract can be used to
   list tasks in various plans.
   A2.4.7. Refer to Table A2.2 for AFI references for SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.4.8. USAF WMP I, Annex F, lists medical unit response times.
A2.5. SORTS DOC Statement Preparation.
   A2.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS Office will:
       A2.5.1.1. Forward copies of initial SORTS DOC Statements to air staff-level functional
       offices of primary responsibility, as required, for review and coordination.
       A2.5.1.2. Keep a master file of all initial and reviewed SORTS DOC Statements.
       A2.5.1.3. HQ USAF/XOO reserves the right to challenge any SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.5.2. MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will:
       A2.5.2.1. Develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS DOC Statements. All
       MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS
       DOC Statements using prepared system software, Microsoft Word Template, JetFlow, or
       MS Access. If an AF Form 723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and
       ensure alternate methods provide all information on the AFF 723, Sections I through VI.
          A2.5.2.1.1. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed SORTS DOC Statements
          with the initial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC, PACAF, etc.).
          A2.5.2.1.2. AFRC and ANG will suspense gaining MAJCOM DOs/XOs with a date
          45 days after gaining MAJCOM receipt of the draft SORTS DOC Statement. If no
          response is received by the suspense date, then AFRC or ANG will assume
          MAJCOM concurrence on the SORTS DOC Statement as written.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                           269


       A2.5.2.2. Provide HQ USAF SORTS with copies of all DOC Statements. MAJCOMs,
       who provide DOCs via web pages, must send an electronic mail (e-mail) to HQ USAF
       SORTS informing of new or updated DOCs. MAJCOMs that do not provide access to
       DOC Statements via web page must send an e-mail with the current DOC Statements
       attached. DOCs briefed in the Air Staff JQRR will be e-mailed regardless of availability.
       A2.5.2.3. The CRO will send the approved DOC Statement to the SRO.
       A2.5.2.4. Submit requests for new DOCIDs, not listed in Table A2.3, to HQ SORTS at
       least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date. This will provide adequate
       time to update computer programs.
       A2.5.2.5. Maintain a copy of all unit SORTS DOC Statements under their command.
   A2.5.3. Measured units and subordinate reporting organizations will:
       A2.5.3.1. Maintain a copy of each unit’s SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723).
       A2.5.3.2. Make sure the unit commander reviews the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723)
       as required per paragraph 1.11.11.1.8.
A2.6. SORTS DOC Statement Annual Review. MAJCOM FAMs will review their respective
SORTS DOC Statements on an annual basis and prior to the statement anniversary date. If there
are any changes, FAMs must submit a new SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) to the local
SORTS office for processing IAW paragraph A2.5 Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU will
ensure HQ SORTS, all interested MAJCOMs, and reporting units receive a SORTS DOC
Statement annual review document that lists the unit UIC, ANAME, location, and DOCID.
Discrepancies should be addressed to the SORTS office that initiated the review. All SORTS
DOC Statements, other than initial statements, must have a current review date (less than one
year old). Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU SORTS office will be responsible for tracking
annual reviews and notifying FAMs when an annual review is due.
A2.7. SORTS DOC Statement Unit Tasking Changes. As a norm, SORTS DOC Statements
must be revised at least 30 days prior to any significant expected change(s) in unit tasking to
include, but not be limited to, changes in types of major equipment, unit mission, or unit
response time. Unexpected changes that may require DOC revision must be made no later than
60 days after changes are known.
   A2.7.1. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOA, and DRU develop and coordinate changes to unit SORTS
   DOC Statements. All MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will complete an AF Form 723. If
   the AF Form 723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and provide all information
   from the AFF 723, Sections I through IV. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed
   changes to SORTS DOC Statements with initial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC,
   PACAF, etc.) IAW A2.5.2.1.2.
   A2.7.2. Submit one copy of each unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement to HQ USAF
   SORTS as an attachment to e-mail or DMS message. Coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS for
   points of contact and addresses (if e-mail is not possible, coordinate for an alternate means to
   submit a unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement(s).
   A2.7.3. Accomplish actions listed from paragraph A2.5.2.3 through A2.5.3.2.

A2.8. SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) Instructions. Reference Figure A2.1 through
Figure A2.8 for samples of SORTS DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements will normally be
classified according to derivative classification guidance.
   A2.8.1. Part I, Unit Identification.
       A2.8.1.1. Measured Unit. Use the abbreviated name from SORTS BIDE set, ANAME
       field, that is paired to the UIC entry.
       A2.8.1.2. Home Location. Use the home geographic name and country or state code
       from the GEONA (geographic name) and CRTCD (country code) fields in the GEOFILE
       (geographic location file).
       A2.8.1.3. To establish a UTC use one of the following methods: 1) Use the DEPID Code
       9 UTC from the UTC label in SORTS. This is a non-deployable, in-place UTC, assigned
       by HQ USAF and used by the JCS for categorization of the unit type or 2) use a UTC
       from the tasked set that is most representative of the unit mission.
       A2.8.1.4. UIC. Use the code from SORTS BIDE set, UIC field.
       A2.8.1.5. DOC Mission Title. Select a long mission title from Table A2.3 that best
       describes the unit mission. If no available long mission title adequately describes the unit,
       recommend a new one to HQ USAF SORTS.
       A2.8.1.6. GEOLOC. Use the code from SORTS in the label HOGEO.
       A2.8.1.7. DOCID. Paired with the mission title entry, select the DOCID from Table
       A2.3 that was chosen for the DOC mission title.
          A2.8.1.7.1. For new titles, use the area letter and XX99 (e.g., SX99) as an interim
          DOCID. Request a new DOCID from HQ USAF SORTS using the format in Figure
          A2.9. Interim DOCIDs are valid for 90 days.
          A2.8.1.7.2. Submit request for changes to DOCIDs not listed in Table A2.3. to HQ
          USAF SORTS at least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date to
          provide adequate time to update computer programs. Tables in this instruction will
          follow with the next update cycle.
       A2.8.1.8. DOCNR. Only the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will use DOCNR
       1. Major portions of the unit’s mission, listed in secondary mission SORTS DOC
       Statements, will use DOCNR 2 through 9. Subordinate portions of the unit’s mission,
       listed in tertiary mission SORTS DOC Statements will use DOCNR A through J.
       A2.8.1.9. Mission Rank. Select primary, secondary or tertiary via paragraph A2.3.
   A2.8.2. Part II, Mission Identification.
       A2.8.2.1. A. Mission Tasking Narrative. Describe the unit’s wartime mission in plain
       text using missions in AF Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-1, Air Force Task List. This is a
       summary of the mission capabilities the unit brings to the tasks for which it is designed.
       List major tasks and their purposes (e.g., provide rapid intra-theater mobility for all
       military forces) for each mission (JCS/ AF) and any special mission capabilities the unit
       is organized or designed to provide. Special mission capabilities are included when they
       are essential for mission success.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                         271


        A2.8.2.1.1. The most resource demanding OPLAN or set of UTC(s) mission
        capabilities should be referenced if it is used as the basis for unit reporting.
        A2.8.2.1.2. Address secondary missions, tertiary missions, additional, or special
        capabilities separately in the SORTS DOC Statement Section IV.
     A2.8.2.2. B. Mission Specifics.
        A2.8.2.2.1. Response Time. Enter the response time that upon which the C-level is
        based (from OPLAN, WMP-3, UTC, etc.). Enter the shortest time in hours (01 - 72
        hours) by which all unit resources are to be generated or prepared for deployment.
        Aircraft units response time source is the WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
            A2.8.2.2.1.1. For units with alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03,
            or surveillance missions, use the time required to employ all tasked forces. For
            aircraft units, the response time source is WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
            A2.8.2.2.1.2. Units with a mobility mission will use the time to begin loading of
            common user or organic lift before deployment (i.e., ready-to-load date at origin).
            A2.8.2.2.1.3. Active duty and specifically identified Reserve and Guard SF units
            must be able to deploy within 24 hours after notification per WMP 1, Annex T.
            A2.8.2.2.1.4. Reserve and Guard units not specifically identified must be able to
            deploy within 72 hours of notification.
            A2.8.2.2.1.5. Ensure response time for Reserve and Guard units includes 24
            hours for mobilization or call-up plus time allocated for preparation once
            mobilized. SF units will comply with Attachment 2, paragraphs A2.8.2.2.1.3
            and A2.8.2.2.1.4.
            A2.8.2.2.1.6. When response times exceed 72 hours or a source reference does
            not exist, use the default time of 72 hours IAW JCS policy. Do not use this default
            time for other than SORTS reporting.
        A2.8.2.2.2. Source. List the source for the response time. When the source reference
        does not exist, exceeds the default time, or if the default time was used, list ―AFI 10-
        201‖. Indicate the paragraph number of the source used within the provided brackets,
        e.g., [3.2.1.]. When "AFI 10-201" is listed as the source, reference the source
        document and paragraph number for the response time in part IV Amplifying Notes.
        A2.8.2.2.3. MDS. Use the WMP-3, Part 1 or USAF Program Document to enter the
        number and type of major equipment and PMAI. Do not include BAI. List the MDS
        for missiles (e.g., ICBMs).
        A2.8.2.2.4. Sorties/Flying Hours (aircraft units only). Use sortie factors in WMP-5 to
        enter sortie rates and sortie duration, and rates the unit is required to perform for its
        wartime mission(s).
     A2.8.2.3. UTCs Required to Support. Enter the UTCs for force packages that the unit is
     expected to be able to simultaneously support. These UTCs are the AFWUS UTCs with a
     Nonsourced Unit Type Code (NSUTC) of ―DWS‖, ―DWX‖ (the total number of standard
     UTCs coded as ―DW_‖ (DWS and DWX) represent the maximum number of standard
     UTCs the unit can deploy simultaneously during wartime surge and any UTCs associated
272                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


      with the unit's in-place wartime mission(s). All of these UTCs must be included in Part II
      of the DOC Statement and reported in the unit's SORTS C-Level.
         A2.8.2.3.1. For alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, and surveillance
         missions, use the unit’s in-place UTC (coded as ―non-deployable‖ in AFWUS), or
         other deployable UTCs required for home station support during wartime.
         A2.8.2.3.2. For mobility missions, list standard, deployable UTCs (AFWUS NSUTC
         codes of ―DWS‖ and ―DWX‖ as a minimum). Since UTC detail is used for
         measuring/reporting SORTS, ensure UTC detail is complete.
         A2.8.2.3.3. Use a combination of both deployable and in-place generation UTCs for
         combined in-place generation and mobility missions. Functional managers are
         responsible for de-conflicting the UTCs and providing guidance on which UTCs a
         unit can be expected to simultaneously support. Use remarks sections to illuminate
         how each tasking should be considered in light of others that may conflict (i.e.,
         assumptions in planning may exclude one or the other tasking like Operations Plan
         8044 Revision 03 and conventional mobility).
             A2.8.2.3.3.1. Units may be resourced to be able to provide combinations of
             UTCs that would in aggregate exceed their total assets, (i.e. parent-child UTCs)
             but they must not be postured/tasked in the AFWUS or plans beyond their
             authorized resource levels. UTC combinations that cannot be de-conflicted (i.e.
             Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03/mobility) should be delineated on the AF Form
             723, Section IV, Amplifying Notes. The assumptions on which a dual tasking lies
             must be provided or referenced.
             A2.8.2.3.3.2. If a unit shares a UTC tasking with another unit (split tasking), or is
             not required to support the entire UTC, place a hyphen (-) after the applicable
             UTC, and note the details in Part IIIA, Additional Notes. All units supporting the
             tasking will list the UTC in their SORTS DOC Statement. Each SORTS DOC
             Statement will list all of the units supporting the split UTC tasking.
             A2.8.2.3.3.3. Commander assessments will be based on providing either/or
             combinations of resources, not all simultaneously in these cases. When the unit
             commander must assess specific resource combinations, they should be listed. All
             instances of Parent-Child UTCs must first be approved by the USAF War and
             Mobilization Plans Division (AF/XOXW).
      A2.8.2.4. Direct Support Units UICs. Enter direct support unit UICs and ANAMEs.
      A2.8.2.5. OPLANs (Optional). List those OPLANs and other documents that the unit is
      tasked to support. Identify plans by command and number (e.g., United States
      Commander European Command (USCOMEUR) OPLAN 4102). This will classify the
      SORTS DOC Statement IAW the OPLAN classification guidance. If no specific OPLAN
      is identified, enter Command Directed.
  A2.8.3. Part III, Measured Resource Area.
      A2.8.3.1. Personnel Measured Area. Check the applicable box(s).
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                        273


        A2.8.3.1.1. Total. Place an X in this box to indicate total personnel is to be reported,
        regardless of UMD or UTC, along with critical personnel listed in Table 3.1 and
        emergency essential and Key DOD civilians.
        A2.8.3.1.2. UMD and UTC. FAMs with alert, generation, combined in-place
        generation and mobility, or surveillance units will place an X in the UMD box to tell
        the unit to use the wartime requirements described in the UMD. Missions with
        mobility only taskings will have an X placed in the UTC box to tell the unit to use
        manpower details of UTCs listed in Section IIC of the SORTS DOC Statement. Units
        with a combined generation and mobility mission will list the UMD as the source
        document. Intelligence units may use MEMLs when matched by the UMD. The
        ―civilians‖ block will be marked with an X when US emergency essential or Key
        DOD civilians are part of the unit’s wartime requirement. Add additional notes as
        required.
        A2.8.3.1.3. Critical. Place an X in this box if the unit has critical AFSCs or packets
        listed in Chapter 3, Table 3.1 Critical personnel are those identified as essential to
        the launch, recovery, or turn around of a unit’s weapon system, or the direct
        accomplishment of the unit’s specified wartime mission. They are critical because
        their absence would materially effect the mission.
        A2.8.3.1.4. Civilians. Place an X in this box when the unit has emergency essential
        or Key DoD civilian requirements on UTC manpower details or coded emergency
        essential positions on the UMD. This directs units to include DoD emergency
        essential and Key civilian personnel requirements in C-level reporting but not
        personnel hired by host nation or contractors. Host nation or contractor personnel
        resources should be considered in commander assessment when relevant.
        A2.8.3.1.5. Additional Notes. Use this area to amplify other personnel measured area
        entries.
        A2.8.3.1.6. Split UTC tasking details (i.e. UIC, AFSCs, number of requirements,
        etc.). Include adequate details for the unit known to have resources it provides for the
        split UTC tasking and which it measures in SORTS. Also include the names and
        locations of the other unit(s) supporting the split UTC taskings.
     A2.8.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC
     Statement lists general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general
     categories of support equipment and supplies to be measured. For each subarea in a
     category, list equipment followed by the subarea label (e.g., vehicles (ESSA4). If no
     subareas are used, use the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and EQSSE for
     support equipment. Source document names can replace long lists. Add additional notes
     as needed.
        A2.8.3.2.1. Combat Essential Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table
        4.1, Column B and subarea equipment types from Table 4.4 for which the unit has
        equipment authorizations. Aerial port, LRS, and mission support units will also use
        Table 4.8, Table 4.10, and Table 4.11.
274                                           AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


         A2.8.3.2.2. Support Equipment and Supplies. Enter all equipment subareas in Table
         4.1, Column C and subarea equipment types in Table 4.4 for which the unit has
         equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 4.10.
            A2.8.3.2.2.1. Spare engines and MRSP/IRSP for Strategic airlift units will be
            reported by MAJCOM in their fleet report and will not be reported at the unit
            level. Units report nothing in fields ESSA1 and ESSA2.
            A2.8.3.2.2.2. Units will ensure engine requirements in their DOC reflect the most
            recent WRE requirements.
         A2.8.3.2.3. Additional Notes. Use this area to explain equipment and supplies O/H
         area entries to include:
            A2.8.3.2.3.1. Spares assessment driver for aircraft units. Indicate ASM, WSMIS-
            SAM, or RSP fill rates. Continue to use ASM unless your MAJCOM has
            authorized use of the WSMIS-SAM as an interim measure for reporting the spares
            subarea percentage. ASM is the primary means of determining the spares subarea
            percentage followed by the WSMIS-SAM (if approved by MAJCOM and HQ
            USAF/XOOA), then RSP fill rate when directed by parent MAJCOM.
            A2.8.3.2.3.2. All units with aircraft using ASM derived percentages for spare
            assessment will report IAW Table 4.9 Use the ASM as a commander’s tool to
            assess the unit’s overall C-level (if appropriate) and then report the ASM sortie
            percentage, ASM problem parts, and parts status in the ESSA1 remark.
      A2.8.3.3. Equipment Condition Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC Statement
      lists general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general categories of
      support equipment to be measured. Add additional notes as needed.
         A2.8.3.3.1. Combat Essential Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table
         5.1, Column B and subarea equipment types from Table 5.4 for which the unit has
         equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port, LRS, and mission support units
         will also use Table 5.14 through Table 5.16.
         A2.8.3.3.2. Support Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table 5.1,
         Column C and subarea equipment types from Table 5.4 for which the unit has
         equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 5.17.
         A2.8.3.3.3. Additional Notes. Use this area to explain equipment condition area
         entries to include long-term non-reportable items (e.g., excluded subsystems), sources
         for numbers required, and directions for special mission capabilities equipment if part
         of the unit’s full wartime requirement.
      A2.8.3.4. Training Measured Resource Area.
         A2.8.3.4.1. Training Method Used. The Air Force uses two training methods. Place
         an X in the appropriate Training Method block. (Training Method B and Training
         Method C, Option 1 or 2).
         A2.8.3.4.2. List the source document(s) for the training standard. If standards are not
         listed in a single document, list the most significant source in the area provided, and

         A2.8.3.4.3. Additional Notes. Include additional training directives used, directions
         for special mission capability, equipment, and the types of training for each subarea
         from Table 6.4 followed by the subarea label. If there are no subareas, use TRUTC.
         Source document names can replace long lists.
  A2.8.4. Part IV, Amplifying Notes. Use this part of the SORTS DOC Statement to include
  the following:
     A2.8.4.1. For flying units, list capabilities being measured. Also, list special capabilities
     being reported but not measured. FAMs will select these special capabilities only from
     Table 2.3.
     A2.8.4.2. Any requirement for special capabilities reported in the TRSA2 field and the
     AFSPECAP set.
     A2.8.4.3. Overflow from additional note entries or descriptions of assumptions used for

               BASIC IDENTITY DATA ELEMENT (BIDE) REPORTING

A3.1. Basic Identity Data Element Purpose. Data entered through the BIDE set into the
SORTS database provides users with authoritative unit identity information. The BIDE set data
enables SORTS to fill its role as the central registry for all military units of the DoD. All AF
units with a PAS will be registered in SORTS.
   A3.1.1. Units with classified PAS codes (up to an including SECRET) will be registered. If
   the unit has a PAS code, the UIC will end with a zero ―0‖. In special cases, if the unit does
   not have a PAS code, the unit is formed from the parent unit. Use the parent UIC and
   substitute the 0 with a letter (A through Z). Units cannot reuse a previously registered unique
   UIC. If a subordinate unit merges with the parent UIC, then subsequently separates from the
   parent UIC again, the previous UIC should not be used for at least two years.
   A3.1.2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC
   first two digits of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX)
   will use the third through fifth character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth
   character that best indicates the provisional unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41
   FW (FFABC0) to 41 FW Provisional [just the headquarters element] (FHABCA) or 66 AS
   (FFSSS0) to 66 AS Provisional [whole unit deployed] (FHSSS0). Provisional units with a
   unique PAS code will be registered using the last four of that PAS for the second through
   fifth characters of the UIC. When the unit is registered, the ORGLOCN sets must be entered
   in addition to BIDE set.
A3.2. BIDE Set Usage. The BIDE set is used in the following four specific instances for
SORTS message processing:
   A3.2.1. Used by the RPTOR to initially register an organization in SORTS.
   A3.2.2. Used to change previously reported data.
   A3.2.3. Used to delete data on a unit that inactivates/deactivates or was registered in error.
   A3.2.4. Used to validate unit registration.
A3.3. HQ USAF Responsibilities.
   A3.3.1. In concert with the JS and other Services, perform a semi-annual UIC validation.
   A3.3.2. Notify RPTOR of any known database discrepancies for immediate corrective
   action.
   A3.3.3. Maintain an updated version of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities. All CROs prepare
and submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active, AF
Reserve, and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.
   A3.4.1. RPTORs will register their units when they are listed in the PAS directory or G-
   Series orders, unless permission is granted by HQ USAF/XOOA to register them before they
   are listed. RPTORs must ensure unit registration data is kept current and available in the joint
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                        299


   database. This includes adding or deleting missing or outdated information. Periodic
   comparisons will be undertaken to align PAS and BIDE records.
   A3.4.2. Individual measured units and SROs will not be responsible for BIDE reporting.
   A3.4.3. BIDE Data Validation to JCS. Use of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool will
   suffice as HQ USAF initial validation of BIDE data to the JS.
A3.5. Unit Registration.
   A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To
   initially register a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN
   sets (according to Table A3.1, Table A3.2, and Table A3.3) using the ADD transaction
   code.
   A3.5.2. Changing Unit Registration Data. Using the CHANGE transaction code, report all
   mandatory and conditional fields that have changed since the unit’s initial registration.
      A3.5.2.1. After an initial BIDE report has been submitted use the TRANSFER set to
      change the RPTOR.
      A3.5.2.2. To delete existing data on a unit or when a unit has been registered in error,
      submit the BIDE report using the DELETE transaction code.
A3.6. AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
   A3.6.1. Reports and Checklists. The AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool contains three reports
   and their associated checklists: BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN. Associated checklists
   allow plain language to be entered and then automatically converted into the appropriate
   codes/formats to be transmitted to the GSORTS processor.
      A3.6.1.1. The BIDE checklist contains all the necessary data to build a complete BIDE
      set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or selecting the correct
      data from a list, and some data being derived.
          A3.6.1.1.1. The Basic Identity Status screen displays the current UIC in the upper
          left portion of the checklist.
          A3.6.1.1.2. Enter the appropriate data into the Basic Identity Status checklist and
          select the ACCEPT button.
      A3.6.1.2. The RPTNORG checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a
      complete RPTNORG set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or
      selecting the correct data from a list.
          A3.6.1.2.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion of the
          RPTNORG checklist.
          A3.6.1.2.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.
          A3.6.1.2.3. Enter all appropriate data into the checklist and select the ACCEPT
          button.
      A3.6.1.3. The ORGLOCN checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a
      complete ORGLOCN set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or
      selecting the correct data from a list.

          A3.6.1.3.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion of the
          ORGLOCN checklist.
          A3.6.1.3.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.
          A3.6.1.3.3. Enter all appropriate data into the checklist and select the ACCEPT
          button.
A3.7. BIDE Message Preparation. Use the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry tool to compose the
BIDE message text.
   A3.7.1. Select Compose BIDE message from the File Menu.
       A3.7.1.1. Select the MSG HEADER button from the Select UIC window.
       A3.7.1.2. Enter the sending unit name, UIC, and ZULU time difference from its location.
       A3.7.1.3. Select the ACCEPT button.
   A3.7.2. The Select UIC window uses three UIC sets: BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN.
       A3.7.2.1. Select the appropriate UIC from each set type that you want to appear on the
       message. Multiple UICs may be selected from each set type.
       A3.7.2.2. Select the ACCEPT button and this will build your message in USMTF
       format.
A3.8. BIDE Message Verification. Verify a correct sequence number on the BIDE message.
   A3.8.1. In the Message window select SEQUENCE button to display the Sequence window.

         NUCLEAR CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE REPORT (CBDRT)

A4.1. Reporting CBDRT C-Level. An inherent part of every unit’s mission is the ability to
survive and operate in a nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) contaminated environment. IAW
CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resource and Training Systems (GSORTS), all SORTS
measured units are required to provide a separate readiness assessment in a CBDRT based on the
unit’s ability to perform its wartime mission for up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear,
Biological, Chemical, Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, in a NBC
environment. This assessment is based on measurements of MRA NBC defense equipment and
the status of individual and unit level NBCC defense training.
   A4.1.1. The separate CBDRT report will be submitted concurrent with the unit’s primary
   SORTS report. The CBDRT includes an overall C-level rating, measured area level ratings
   for (1) NBC defense equipment and supplies and (2) NBCC defense training, and
   accompanying remarks to report a unit’s capability to perform its wartime mission in NBC
   conditions. These measured area ratings are specific to the unit’s NBC defense requirements
   and are to be reported in the CBDRT TREAD report. The CBDRT report may be a factor in
   the commander’s assessment of the unit’s primary overall SORTS C-level; however,
   CBDRT-specified calculation/measurements will not be reported in the regular SORTS
   reports. Units shall use AFSORTSDET version 1.3.8.9 or later to create the CBDRT SORTS
   report.
   A4.1.2. Measured units with no NBC defense equipment or training requirements must still
   submit a CBDRT report. They should report an overall C-5 with a S-6 in the equipment and a
   T-6 in the training areas with a REASON code of ―N‖ IAW AFI 10-201, Table A4.5 Also
   see paragraphs A4.2.2 and A4.3.1.
A4.2. NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies On-Hand Rating (ESRAT). The ESRAT is
based on the percentage of wartime NBC defense equipment that is MRA divided by the quantity
of NBC equipment required. The Equipment and Supplies area of the CBDRT report is broken
down into six categories of equipment (most units will report only Category 1) as shown in
Table A4.1 Report the ESRAT IAW Table A4.3 and enter the appropriate rating (S-level),
based on the lowest calculated equipment category that applies to the unit. For a CBDRT S-level
below S-1, state the reasons in the ESRES remark field of the CBDRT. Include the applicable
supply reason code (Table 4.5). If a unit does not have a requirement for a specific category of
NBC defense equipment, then enter a ―0‖ in that CBDRT equipment category.
   A4.2.1. Reporting ESRAT Percentages. All applicable units will list percentages for each
   category listed on the AFSORTSDET CBDRT page. Once information is filled in, and
   percentages are computed and accepted, a CBDRT ESRAT Remark is automatically
   formatted. Example of an automatic ESRAT Remark follows:
        LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRAT// GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD ESRAT CBDRT

      /MED-MRA/0/MED-REQ/0/MED-PCT/NA                     (DET = detection equipment)
      /CPS-MRA/1/CPS-REQ/1/CPS-PCT/100                    (DEC = decontamination
      equipment)
      /S07-MRA/0/S07-REQ/0/S07-PCT/NA                     (RAD = radiological detection
      equipment)
      /S08-MRA/0/S08-REQ/0/S08-PCT/NA                     (MED = medical
      countermeasures)
      /S09-MRA/0/S09-REQ/0/S09-PCT/NA                     (CPS = collective protection
      system)
      /S10-MRA/0/S10-REQ/0/S10-PCT/NA//
     A4.2.1.1. For the detection category, enter only the data for the detection group with the
     lowest percentage MRA.
     A4.2.1.2. Do not enter data in S07 through S10. These entries area generated by the
     AFSORTSDET program, but are NOT used.
  A4.2.2. Enter plain text remarks identifying deficiencies and get well actions under the
  CBDRT ESRES remark field. The following is an unclassified example of an
  AFSORTSDET formatted ESRES remark:
   LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRES//
   GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD CATEGORY 1 SHORTAGE OF 27 C-1 MOBILITY
   BAGS.
   ADDRESSED TO MAJCOM FOR FURTHER ACTION.
   Estimated get-well date: DDMMMYY//

  A4.2.3. No Equipment Requirements. Units in a nuclear, biological, chemical, and
  conventional (NBCC) low threat area (LTA) (NBCC threat areas are explained in AFI 10-
  2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations) with only an in-
  place mission, as identified by their DOC Statement or tasking system, have no NBC defense
  equipment requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In this case, the unit
  should report a ―6‖ for the Equipment and Supplies subarea in the CBDRT report and ―SNM
  ― in ESRES.
  A4.2.4. Reportable NBC Equipment. (Table A4.1 can be used by MAJCOM FAMs to
  determine what categories their units should measure and report. The FAMs should identify
  which categories units are to measure and report within the add/ remark section of the unit’s
  DOC Statement.) The specific equipment items to measure in each category are listed in
  Table A4.2. Requirements vary based on unit mission and location. For units with both an
  in-place (generation) and a mobility mission, combine the requirements for reporting.

  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) incidents is not included in the CBDRT. The six
  equipment categories and applicable clarifications follow.
      A4.2.4.1. Category 1 Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). Count the number of C-1
      and D/ D-1 bags that are MRA, divided by the number required. AFI 10-2501, Table 8.1
      lists the required contents of C-1 bags. AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS)
      Program, lists the required contents of D/D-1 bags. To be MRA, a bag must contain 100
      percent of required items and each item must be serviceable IAW the applicable technical
      guidance. This 100 percent availability criteria is only for SORTS reporting. Unit
      commanders should follow guidance in AFI 10-403 and other MAJCOM guidance in
      determining risk of deploying individuals with partial IPE. Paragraphs A4.2.4.1.1
      through A4.2.4.1.4 identify unit IPE requirements by location. Paragraphs A4.2.4.1.5
      and A4.2.4.1.7 provide specific measurement and reporting instructions.
         A4.2.4.1.1. Continental United States (CONUS) units with a mobility mission or
         dual in-place and mobility mission: unit C-1 mobility bag requirements are
         established by AFI 10-2501 and MAJCOM guidance and should provide for every
         person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIc of the DOC Statement. When
         directed by the MAJCOM, flying units must have one D-bag equivalent for each
         aircrew member assigned to UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement.
         A4.2.4.1.2. Outside CONUS (OCONUS) units in LTAs:
             A4.2.4.1.2.1. For a mobility mission, the unit must have the equivalent of one C-
             1 bag for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the
             unit’s DOC Statement. As directed by MAJCOM, flying units must also have one
             D-1 and one D-bag equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-
             301, Vol 1.
             A4.2.4.1.2.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, there are no requirements.
             A4.2.4.1.3. OCONUS units in medium threat areas (MTAs):
             A4.2.4.1.3.1. For the mobility mission, the unit has a requirement of one C-1 bag
             equivalent for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the
             unit DOC Statement.
             A4.2.4.1.3.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, a unit has a requirement of a
             C-1 mobility bag equivalent for all military and emergency essential civilian
             personnel assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-2501.
             A4.2.4.1.3.3. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag
             equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
         A4.2.4.1.4. OCONUS units in high threat areas (HTAs):
             A4.2.4.1.4.1. Units have a requirement of a C-1 bag equivalent for all military
             and emergency essential civilian personnel assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-
             2501.
             A4.2.4.1.4.2. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag
             equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                       307


        A4.2.4.1.5. Instructions for units that get their C-1 mobility bags from an LRS:
        MAJCOMs will provide guidance to their reporting units on how to count and report
        on centrally stored bags. Use these criteria when preparing that guidance:
            A4.2.4.1.5.1. To provide consistency in reporting, the supporting LRS should
            calculate a base wide IPE availability percentage for centrally managed bags. This
            is calculated by dividing total MRA bags and bag equivalents by the total required
            (see paragraph A4.2.3.1.5.3 to establish the total centrally managed
            requirement). This percentage should be provided to all appropriate units to use in
            their CBDRT SORTS report. The supporting LRS must count the number of
            MRA tariff and individually sized bags that are or could be built up with
            resources O/H.
            A4.2.4.1.5.2. Units should report their unit IPE requirement (percentage of bags
            available) based on the LRS-provided percentage of available IPE. Units multiply
            the LRS-provided percentage by the number of bags required to determine the
            number of ―unit bags‖ to report as available/O/H.
            A4.2.4.1.5.3. Centrally managed requirements will be a sum of all unit
            requirements (as outlined in paragraphs A4.2.3.1 through A4.2.3.4) minus
            requirements for units that manage their own bags. All OCONUS units in MTAs
            and HTAs have C-1 bag requirements, but some of those units are not required to
            submit SORTS reports. Be sure to include the C-1 bag requirements for those
            units in this centrally managed total, unless those units manage their own bags.
            Per AFI 10-2501, the Installation Readiness Working Group will provide the total
            IPE requirements to the supporting LRS.
            A4.2.4.1.5.4. One bag or bag equivalent can be used to satisfy no more than one
            requirement. The total number of centrally stored bags reported available for all
            units, cannot exceed the number of complete bags (or bag equivalents) that are
            available in central storage plus the number of bags that have been issued to
            currently deployed personnel.
            A4.2.4.1.5.5. Count bags issued for real world deployments as available.
            A4.2.4.1.5.6. MAJCOMs can provide additional procedures in cases where C-1
            bag allocation is applied to priority units on a base.
        A4.2.4.1.6. Flying units must report IPE requirements for all required aircrew,
        ground crew and direct support unit personnel—not just on aircrew.
        A4.2.4.1.7. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
     A4.2.4.2. Category 2 Detection Equipment. Count the detection and monitoring
     equipment listed in Table A4.2, Column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement
     and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 bag detection items
     (i.e., M8 and M9 paper) in this category). To count as MRA, category 2 equipment must
     have enough serviceable batteries and support equipment O/H to support operations for
     up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602. Divide MRA equipment by total number required
     for each detection group in this category. Report the category status based on the
308                                           AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


      detection group with the lowest percent available. UTC requirements are listed in
      LOGFOR, AS, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
         A4.2.4.2.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support requirements for units in
         MTAs and HTAs.
         A4.2.4.2.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.3. Category 3 Decontamination Equipment. Count decontamination equipment
      listed in Table A4.2, column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement and for in-
      place base support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 mobility bag detection items,
      i.e., M291 and M295 decontamination kits in this category). Divide MRA equipment by
      total number required. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF
      functional area guidance.
         A4.2.4.3.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support decontamination
         equipment requirements for units in MTAs and HTAs.
         A4.2.4.3.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.4. Category 4 Radiation, Detection, Indication, and Computation (RADIAC)
      equipment. Count RADIAC equipment listed in Table A4.2, column B, for UTCs listed
      in the unit DOC Statement and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs. Divide
      MRA by total number required. To count as available, Category 4 equipment must have
      the required serviceable batteries and support equipment O/H. UTC requirements are
      listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
         A4.2.4.4.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support equipment requirements
         for units in MTAs and HTAs.
         A4.2.4.4.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.5. Category 5 Medical Countermeasures. See paragraph A4.2.5.1.5.
      A4.2.4.6. Category 6 Collective Protection. Count the number of transportable collective
      protection systems, in Table A4.2, column B, that are MRA. Divide by total number
      required. To count as MRA, a collective protection system must have 100 percent of the
      critical components (those that are needed to make the system fully operational). All
      critical components must be serviceable in accordance with technical data on the report
      date. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area
      guidance. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
  A4.2.5. Reportable Medical NBC Equipment. Medical units will report their equipment
  UTCs as follows:
      A4.2.5.1. In cases of more than one item for a given field, enter the lowest percentage.
      Report only on equipment and supplies the unit is required to maintain. For units that
      possess no CBDRT material, as described below, report codes S-6 in ESRAT and SNM
      in ESRES. For categories two and three, do not report those items contained in C-1 bags.
      If the medical logistics (MEDLOG)/ defense medical logistics standard support
      (DMLSS) end-of-month (EOM) Stock Status Report reflects WRM project at zero
      percent, it represents a requirement with no material O/H and should be reported as such.
      UTCs that contain equipment in categories two, three, and four will still report their
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                      309


     overall Material Availability Percentage (MAP) in the unit SORTS report in addition to
     the itemized reporting in the CBDRT portion of their SORTS report.
        A4.2.5.1.1. Category One Medical IPE Equipment. Follow guidance in A4.2.4.1.
        A4.2.5.1.2. Category Two Medical Detection Equipment. Medical units will report
        the lowest total material readiness percentage of the three detection groups assigned
        to the unit (using the MEDLOG IWB transaction or DMLSS medical treatment
        facility (MTF) catalogue search) as outlined below for the following stock numbers:
         Detection Group A
         6665-01-134-0885 - Water Testing Kit, Chemical Agent, M-272

         Detection Group C - N/A
         6665-01-494-8725 - DoD Biological Sampling Kit (Hand Held Assays)
        A4.2.5.1.3. Category Three - Medical Decontamination Equipment. Medical units
        will report the lowest total material readiness percentage of the two items (using the
        MEDLOG IWB transaction or DMLSS MTF catalogue search) as outlined below for
        the following stock numbers:
         4230-01-251-8702 - Decontaminating Apparatus, M17
         6850-01-357-8456 - Decontamination Kits, M295
        A4.2.5.1.4. Category Four - Medical RADIAC Equipment. Medical units will report
        the lowest total material readiness percentage of the four items assigned to the unit
        (using the MEDLOG IWB transaction or DMLSS MTF catalogue search) as outlined
        below for the following stock numbers:
         6665-01-320-4712 - ADM - 300, Kit A
         6665-01-426-5071 - ADM - 300, Kit B

        A4.2.5.1.5. Category 5 - Medical Countermeasures. Report the total materiel
        readiness percentage for DET A, Project Code BA as reflected on the MEDLOG
        WRM Stock Status Report or the DMLSS, Gross Readiness Percentage as reflected
        on the Assemblage Status Report. Medical countermeasures requirements are outlined
        in AFMAN 23-110, Vol 5, Air Force Medical Materiel Management System –
 310                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


           General. See AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training for detailed
           measurement and reporting instructions.
           A4.2.5.1.6. Category 6 - Medical Collective Protection. Medical units will calculate
           percentages for UTCs; FFCPA, FFCPB, FFCPC, FFCPD, and FFCPW, whose critical
           equipment MAPs are at 100 percent (using the MEDLOG inquire WRM balance
           (IWB) transaction or DMLSS Assemblage Status Report, Gross Readiness Percentage
           (use the ESRAT)). If the critical equipment material availability percentage is less
           than 100 percent, the equipment is not considered MRA, and will be reported at zero
           percent, regardless of how much of the other material in the UTC is O/H. Divide the
           total number of these UTCs that are MRA by the number of UTCS required, and
           multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage to be reported under the ESRAT label.
            Example Calculations:
            FFCPA Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)
            FFCPB Critical O/H = 99 percent (Not MRA, count as 0)
            FFCPW Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)


            UTCs O/H/UTCs Required = percent
                    2            3           = 67 percent (report in ESSA6)
A4.3. Individual and Unit NBCC Defense Training Rating (TRRAT). The training portion
of the CBDRT report has two categories: individual NBCC defense training and unit NBCC
defense task qualification training (TQT). Determine the percent of personnel (or crews) who are
current in each training category. Based on the category with the lowest percent available, report
NBCC defense training status IAW Table A4.4 and enter the appropriate T-level rating
(TRRAT). TRRAT is calculated IAW applicable training methods of Chapter 6, Method B
(paragraph 6.2); Method C, Option 1 (paragraph 6.3), or Method C, Option 2 (paragraph
6.4). For units measuring under Method C, Option 2, use Table 6.3 Flying units shall report
training status for all required aircrews, ground crews and direct support unit personnel. For a
CBDRT T-level below T-1, insert the applicable training reason code (from Table 6.5) in the
TRRES field and explain the reasons in TRRES remarks. If a unit does not have a requirement
for a specific category of NBCC defense training, then enter a ―0‖ in the required category.
   A4.3.1. No Training Requirements. Units in LTAs with only an in-place mission have no
   NBCC defense training requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In this
   case, the unit should report a ―6‖ representing a non measured training subarea in the
   CBDRT report and TNM in TREAS.
   A4.3.2. Individual NBCC Defense Training. Count the number of military and emergency-
   essential civilian personnel who are current in individual NBCC Defense Training, divided
   by the total number of personnel assigned who are required to have the training (AFI 10-
   2501).
       A4.3.2.1. Units with a mobility mission: Every person assigned to a deployable UTC as
       listed in Part IIC of the unit’s DOC Statement is required to be current in this training.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                           311


       A4.3.2.2. Units assigned in either MTAs or HTAs: Every military and emergency-
       essential civilian assigned to the unit must be current in this training.
   A4.3.3. Unit NBCC Defense Task Qualification Training (TQT). Count the number of
   military and emergency-essential civilian personnel who are current in NBCC Defense TQT,
   divided by the total number of assigned personnel required to have the training. General
   NBCC Defense TQT requirements are listed in AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 10-2602. To be
   TQT trained, unit personnel must be task trained using the general and functional NBCC
   defense tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) listed in AFMAN 10-2602, Attachment 4,
   all published HQ USAF functional area TTPs per AFMAN 10-2602, paragraph A4.1.2, and
   all unit identified TTPs per AFI 10-2501, paragraphs 2.11.2, 9.3.5, and 9.7.8.
   A4.3.4. The lowest percentage of paragraph A4.3.2 or A4.3.3 is used to assign a training
   level (T-level) under the TRRAT field IAW Table A4.4 State the reasons for a below T-1
   status in the TRRES field and the applicable training reason code from Table 6.5.
   A4.3.5. Training Remarks. TRRAT remarks are automatically formatted by the
   AFSORTSDET CBDRT page and list number of personnel who require training, the number
   who are current in their training, and the percent of personnel complete and current for each
   training category (individual NBC defense and unit level TQT). In plain text English,
   TRRES remarks should explain deficiencies and get well actions. The following are
   examples of the AFSORTSDET formatted remarks:

A4.4. Special NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies Reporting Requirements. To provide
visibility to installation-wide requirements and capabilities, CE units have an additional special
CBDRT reporting requirement. MAJCOMs will specify this special reporting requirement in
Section IV of a unit’s SORTS DOC Statement.
 312                                            AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011


   A4.4.1. OCONUS CE Units in NBCC MTAs and HTAs. Once each quarter (in January,
   April, July, and October), report the status of in-place collective protection assets.
       A4.4.1.1. For an in-place mission in MTAs and HTAs, list the number of collective
       protection spaces that are required and the number that are MRA. To count as MRA, the
       shelter must be fully operational (see AFMAN 10-2602). If it is not, none of the spaces in
       that shelter can count as MRA.
       A4.4.1.2. MAJCOMs must specify in-place requirements. If theater or MAJCOM
       guidance is not provided, units should report MRA, rest and relief collective spaces for
       30 percent (assumes each space will support two people over a 24-hour period) of the in-
       place and deployed AF personnel plus the number of collective protection spaces used in
       medical, command and control, and other function-specific facilities. MAJCOMs will
       provide guidance as to how many additional spaces to include for the protection of
       transient aircrew and passengers into the collective protection calculation. Use any
       combination of Class I-IV transportable, fixed facility, or expedient collective protection
       systems to satisfy the total requirement. Do not include collective protection systems
       assigned to deployable UTCs. (See AFMAN 10-2602.)
       A4.4.1.3. In an ESRES remark, provide both the required and the MRA number of
       collective protection spaces. If reporting in-place requirements, this remark and the report
       must be classified SECRET. The following is an Unclassified example of the
       AFSORTSDET CBDRT formatted remark:
        LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRES//
        GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD INPLACE COLLECTIVE PROTECTION SPACES /
        REQ 1300/ MRA 120//
A4.5. Overall CBDRT C-level. Unit Commanders will assign an overall CBDRT C-level
based on the lowest of the ESRAT and TRRAT. CBDRT overall C-level is assigned based on
definitions in paragraph 1.12, relevant to the unit’s ability to operate in CB conditions. An
overall C-level will be entered in the READY field under TREAD = CBDRT report. If
applicable, a primary reason (in plain text) should be stated under the CBDRT TREAD REASN
remark label, while using an applicable reason code from Table 4.5 and Table 6.5 for the area
ratings. CBDRT reports will be submitted in conjunction with the unit’s primary SORTS report.
Commander CBDRT assessments are not applicable to CBDRT reports, however the CBDRT
overall rating can be factored into commander assessments of overall unit readiness in the
primary unit SORTS reports. An example AFSORTSDET CBDRT overall set is shown below:
 OVERALL/U/A/RICDA:YYMMDD/TREAD:CBDRT/READY:3/REASN:S/-/-//
 EQSUPPLY/ ESRAT:3/ESRES:SRA//
 TRAINING/TRRAT:2/TRRES:TNB//
A4.6. CBDRT Data Requirements. Table 4.5 and Table 6.5 list applicable reason codes for
use with CBDRT. No FORECAST Set data is required. Only applicable Equipment and Training
reason codes listed in Table 4.5 and Table 6.5 will be used for CBDRT overall and subarea level
ratings (S-level, and T-level). Use the REASN code from Table A4.5 for the CBDRT overall
rating.

   MAJOR EQUIPMENT LOCATION AND CREW INFORMATION (MEQLOCN)

A5.1. MEQLOCN Description.
   A5.1.1. MEQLOCN is a major equipment location set reported in SORTS for those units
   possessing major equipment (aircraft, missiles, etc.).
   A5.1.2. MEQLOCN is used to report the location and status of major equipment items and
   crews authorized to the unit.
       A5.1.2.1. Includes MEQPT and crew status at a unit’s present and deployed locations.
       A5.1.2.2. Equipment and crews that will be off station for less than 72 hours (with
       response time not a key factor) are not considered deployed and do not need to be
       reported in a separate MEQLOCN set.
       A5.1.2.3. Major equipment in PDM are not reported in a separate MEQLOCN set,
       account for major equipment in PDM in a remark using the ―MEPSD‖ Label.
A5.2. Reporting Information.
   A5.2.1. MEQLOCN sets report on the type of equipment, the number of crews at a given
   location, and the location of deployed equipment and/or crews.
   A5.2.2. Total numbers, reported for unit resource data (equipment and crews), at various
   locations must equal total assigned, possessed, formed, and mission ready.
   A5.2.3. MEQLOCN sets are reported as a stand alone set of a unit’s SORTS report. A unit
   will develop and maintain their MEQLOCN set(s) using the current AFSORTSDET version.
       A5.2.3.1. Submit the MEQLOCN set on a unit authorized or possessing major
       equipment items. Submit the set for each combination of major equipment, type, and
       location to show status at all locations being occupied by the unit. There is no limit to the
       number of MEQLOCN sets a unit may report.
       A5.2.3.2. MEQLOCN sets are reported using an Add, Change or Delete set transaction
       code. The Add transaction code should ONLY be used the very first time a MEQLOCN
       set is added to the database. Any subsequent reporting of the MEQLOCN sets that are
       changing data should utilize the Change transaction. If the set is to be deleted, the Delete
       transaction code is used. If a unit continuously uses the Add transaction code, the number
       of equipment and crews will constantly double with each report, causing the unit’s
       database to have incorrect data.
       A5.2.3.3. When submitting MEQLOCN sets, units should ensure the numbers of
       deployed crews or equipment do not exceed the total number possessed, and change
       accordingly. SORTS reporting personnel must know what is in the database for the UIC
       being reported.
       A5.2.3.4. When a unit deletes the number of previously reported equipment at deployed
       locations, the system will return equipment numbers back to the home or UNIT location.
       A5.2.3.5. Units should ensure that the proper security classification value is applied to
       each MEQLOCN set every time it is reported.
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                        319


      A5.2.3.6. The following examples of USMTF reporting are provided for reference:
          A5.2.3.6.1. Adding a MEQLOCN set should look like the following:
           MEQLOCN/U/A/MEQPT:C-130E/-/MEPSA:30/MEPSD:30/-/-/-/-
           /CREWA:30/CREWF:30/ /
          A5.2.3.6.2. Moving equipment or personnel from the unit to a deployed location:
           MEQLOCN/U/C/MEQPT:C-130E/-/MEPSA:11/MEPSD:11/-/-/-/-
           /CREWA:11/CREWF:11/ -/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/NEWLOC:CNBC//
          A5.2.3.6.3. Moving equipment/personnel from a deployed location to a home
          location:

           /CREWA:6/ CREWF:6/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/NEWLOC:UNIT//
          A5.2.3.6.4. Changing numbers at a unit with a Change transaction:

           MEQLOCN/U/C/MEQPT:C-130E/-/MEPSA:29/MEPSD:29/-/-/-/-
           /CREWA:29/CREWF:29//
          A5.2.3.6.5. Move all remaining numbers from the deployed location to the home
          location with the delete transaction:
           MEQLOCN/U/D/MEQPT:C-130E/TEGEO:CNBC//
          A5.2.3.6.6. Removing the MEQLOCN record when the Aircraft Type identified in
          MEQPT is no longer in the unit’s inventory:
           MEQLOCN/U/D/MEQPT:C-130E/-// or MEQLOCN/U/D/MEQPT:C-130E//

 TRANSPORTABLE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL DATA.
             (UTC PACKAGE DEPLOYABILITY STATUS)

A6.1. Required Actions:
   A6.1.1. Identify the package being reported on. Units may be required to provide a number
   of the same UTC packages. To uniquely identify a package, enter two secondary control
   elements according to the following:
       A6.1.1.1. Check the DOC Statement for the UTC. Enter it under the label UTC each
       time there’s a ―PACKAGE‖ transaction.
       A6.1.1.2. Find the Designated Item Serial Number using the following rules and enter it
       under the Designated Item Serial Number (MESEN) label each time there’s a
       ―PACKAGE‖ transaction.
          A6.1.1.2.1. For Equipment and Personnel UTCs check for a force requirement
          number (FRN) in plan’s time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD). If there’s
          an FRN, use its first three characters as the first three characters and a sequence
          number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) as the last character of the MESEN. If there isn’t an FRN, use
          a four-digit sequence number (e.g., 0001, 0002, etc.).
          A6.1.1.2.2. For Equipment UTCs use the first four characters of the major
          equipment’s serial number as MESEN.
          A6.1.1.2.3. For Personnel UTCs use ―P‖ as the first character and a three-digit
          sequence number as the last three characters (e.g., P001, P002, etc.) of MESEN.
       A6.1.1.3. For the DOC Listed UTC(s) enter a ―Y‖ if tasked or an ―N‖ if not tasked,
       under label DTASK.
   A6.1.2. Show Major Equipment Operational Status for Specified Package. Commanders will
   select the operational status in Table A6.1, which most closely matches the current status of
   the prime equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Prime
   Equipment Operational Status (PEQS). If status is other than ―not applicable‖ or ―prime
   equipment is fully operational,‖ forecast the date the equipment will be fully operational. If
   changed, enter it under label PEQFR.
   A6.1.3. Show Support Equipment Operational for Specified Package. Commanders will
   select the operational status in Table A6.2, which most closely matches the current status of
   the support equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Support
   Equipment Status (SEDY). If status is other than ‖not applicable‖ or ―support equipment is
   fully operational,‖ forecast the date the equipment will be fully operational. If changed, enter
   it under label Support Equipment Forecast Ready Date (SEQFR).
   A6.1.4. Show the Assigned Team Status for Specified Package. Commanders will select the
   team status in Table A6.3, which most closely matches the status of the personnel required
   by the specified package. If changed, enter it under the label for Assigned Team Status
   (TEDY). If status is other than ―not applicable‖ or ―assigned team status is satisfactory,‖
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                       323


  forecast the date the team will be operational. If changed, enter it under the label for Team
  Status Satisfactory Forecast Date (TEAFR).
  A6.1.5. Show the Overall Operational Condition and Deployment Status of Specified UTC
  Package. Commanders will select the overall operational condition and deployability status
  in Table A6.3, which most closely matches the current status of the specified package. If
  changed, enter it under the Expected Availability Category (EXDAC) label. If the status is:
     A6.1.5.1. UTC is redeployable, deployed, or en route, check the actual deployment date.
     If changed, enter it under the label for UTC Forecast Ready Date (UTCFR).
     A6.1.5.2. UTC is committed, forecast the deployment date. If changed, enter in UTCFR.
     A6.1.5.3. Either of the above, show status of the deployed or committed UTCs. If a UTC
     is deployed or committed to deploy, report this data depending on the status showing
     using the EXDAC field:
         A6.1.5.3.1. In the Deployment Control Number (DCN), if reporting that the UTC is
         deployed, committed, or en route, check the deployment tasking number, departure
         control number, or deployment control number issued by the MAJCOM for the
         specified UTC package movement. If the number is unknown, use ―XXXXX‖ as the
         number. If changed, enter it under label DCNDY.
         A6.1.5.3.2. For Equipment Return Date, if reporting UTC is redeployable,
         committed, deployed, or en route, forecast the date the specified package is expected
         to return from deployment. If changed, enter it under the label for Equipment Return
         Date (EQRET).
         A6.1.5.3.3. For GEOLOC Code, if reporting UTC is redeployable, committed,
         deployed, or en route, find the GEOLOC code matching the specified package’s
         present location in the GEOFILE. If changed, enter it under the label for
         Geographical Location of Equipment (GEOGR).
     A6.1.5.4. Other than those above, or if the UTC is fully operational and deployable,
     forecast the date the package will be operational and deployable. Anytime the EXDAC is
     other than ―A‖ enter it under the label UTCFR.
  A6.1.6. Prepare remarks to explain the situation. When they occur, prepare remarks to
  explain any of the situations listed below. Don’t duplicate remarks if situations have same
  explanations.
     A6.1.6.1. When specified UTCs have sub-elements deployed state which sub-elements
     are deployed, the deployment number, the estimated return date, and the UTC operational
     capability remaining. Create the remark under the label EXDAC.
     A6.1.6.2. When a unit has major equipment deficiencies explain the impact the
     deficiencies have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective
     actions taken. Create the remark under the PEQS label.
     A6.1.6.3. When a unit has support equipment deficiencies explain the impact the
     deficiencies have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective
     actions taken. Create the remark under the SEDY label.

1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual
(JTF) HQs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air
National Guard, AF Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a
CJCS or combatant command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan 8044
Revision 03 or Volume 3 of the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned in
the ―Forces For Unified Commands‖ document. Measured units will be named on a DOC
Statement (DOCS) and must report SORTS in accordance with their DOCS. One exception is
training units that report only Major Equipment Location and Crew Information
(MEQLOCN). Measured unit SORTS reporting begins as soon as possible after a unit
activates and continues until the unit deactivates.


1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels,
numbers used to compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS),
reason codes associated with their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a
minimum, classified CONFIDENTIAL. Products that contain data from two or more
measured units is classified SECRET NOFORN. Additionally, individuals classifying
SORTS reports must consider other classification guidance including OPLANS. The
association of the unit with its OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at the level of classification of
the OPLAN(s), usually SECRET. Information that is not SORTS based and does not show a
deficiency may still require classification through channels other than SORTS. Unit and Wing
Security Managers should be consulted in these events.
1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all
registered units, includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with
Operational Control (OPCON), Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home
Geographical Location (HOGEO) and Present Geographical Location (PRGEO), Activity
Code (ACTIV), and Percent Effective (PCTEF). Only CROs report this data with the
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                              329


 exception of PCTEF, which is reported by the measured unit.


1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation mission.


2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field.
PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of the unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned
nontraditional mission. When employed in support of a nontraditional mission, commanders
will report PCTEF. PCTEF reporting is required upon receipt of an order to execute any of the
following missions: Homeland Defense or Homeland Security missions in support of
USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including quick reaction force and/or ready reaction force
missions), peacekeeeping or peace enforcement operations, humanitarian assistance,
consequence management, counterdrug operations, civil distrubance operations, and natural
disaster relief operations (including wildfire fighting missions). In some cases, a unit
executing assigned nontraditional operation will be executing its wartime tasks in support of
that nontraditional mission (e.g., a Civil Engineering unit providing support to a natural
disaster relief operation). In those cases, commanders will use their discretion to determine if
PCTEF reporting is required.
2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if the
unit is currently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s
assessment against this nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to
assess the unit’s ability to execute its full wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a unit’s
C-level from deployed resources, commanders needs to use DEFG (see paragraph 2.8.).
2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using plain
text under the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations.)
current status, and/or any action underway or planned to remedy a current reduced readiness
condition for assigned missions. Format the PCTEF remark according to the example below:
      Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased
      effectiveness due to reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking cannot
      be fully supported due to shortage of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h, equipment
      condition, and/or training). To alleviate the situation on (area), the unit will (action). Get
      well date (gwd) is estimated to be (date). Estimated departure/return date is (date).

 NOTES:
1. X means all AFSCs in source that match remaining characters are critical AFSCs. * means
all suffixed and non-suffixed AFSCs in the source document that match remaining
characters are critical. Consider AFSCs that convert as critical.
2. HQ AF/A3OR, as authorized may augment this table by message. MAJCOM SORTS
offices will disseminate the supplemented message to subordinate units.
3. Rule 2 Aeromedical units use ―X‖ as a prefix to identify flight qualification. In this case,
AFI10-201_AFISRASUP_I 24 AUGUST 2011                                                         337


 ―X‖ does not have the same significance as in note 1 above.
 4. Rule 21 AFSC 6C091 may be substituted for a 64P3.
 5. Rule 13 Number of personnel tasked under UTC is listed on unit DOC Statement. Two
 mobility positions for AFSC 2S0X1 fall under UTC XFBPF, however, the second position is
 non-critical.
 6. Rule 13 Four of the 13 mobility positions per XFBJ1 UTC are critical. The remaining
 nine positions, regardless of AFSC, are non-critical.
 7. Rule 13 The mobility position per XFBKB UTC is critical.
 8. Rule 13 Both of the mobility positions per XFBYC UTC are critical and will not be
 substituted.
 9. Rule 13 One of the three mobility positions per JFBBS UTC. Remaining two positions are
 not critical.
 10. Rule 32 Aircraft operations support, theater hub (non-aircraft), depot munitions activity
 (STAMP/ TARRP), and units providing nuclear capabilities.
 11. Rule 24 Emergency essential and key DOD civilians must be identified and coded as
 such in their position description.
 4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report
 SORTS data against stated SORTS DOC Statement mission. Each unit must determine and
 report their status on the basis of critical BEAR equipment and supplies (support) assigned.
 Report using only the assets the unit is authorized. Specific equipment allowances are
 included in AFI 25-101, Chap 7 ―USAF Bear Base Systems,‖ and in AS 157, 158 and 159.

NOTES:
 1. Rule 43 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to
 transmit and receive secure communications on HF/Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM
 HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios and
 be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.
 2. Rule 43 A TAC kit is MRA when the following items are MRA: TACP Close Air Support
 System, laser range finder, thermal imager/laser spot viewer, and GPS receiver.
 3. To compute percentage divide the quantity MRA by the quantity authorized and multiply
 the result by 100. This must be done for each UTC, use the lowest percentage to determine the
 support equipment condition.
 4. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear
 support equipment.
 5. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft;
 even if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP).
 6. Rule 12 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to
 transmit and receive secure communications on HF/Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM
 HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios and
 be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.

NOTES:
1. Consider availability of appropriate Promina trunk cards (S/A and TRK-3) and logic
modules (PLM), network timing, encryption.
2. Consider availability of appropriate Promina user cards (Data and voice processing) and
external routers.
3. Measure availability of critical network management tools: Air Force Network
Management tool (e.g. HP Open View, Smarts-In-Charge, Cisco Works, Foundry Iron View,
etc.), Remote Internetworking Device Management tool (e.g. Systems Management Server,
Remote Access Terminal Services [RATS], etc.)
4. Measure availability of critical information protection tools: Firewall, Proxy server,
Internal control tools, intrusion detection tools.
5. Measure availability of critical core services: Messaging, E-mail, Domain Name System
(DNS), Active Directory Domain Controllers, Dynamic Host Control, Protocol (DHCP)
server, E-mail relays, storage devices, backups, Web Server.
6. Compute based on total capacity (in-use and spare) of assigned switches.
7. Compute based on number of available information transfer nodes.
8. Compute based on number of facilities served by base cable and fiber plant.
9. Compute ERSA1 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein. Where
a rating crosses two scores (e.g. 1 SDP trunk), assume higher score unless driven lower by
another area.

3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat Air
Forces.
4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual Information (VI)
mobility mission, members must complete the COMCAM Contingency Support course at
least once. Such training is considered valid as long as the member is assigned to subsequent
COMCAM or VI units. Assignment outside such a mobility environment not including
extended TDYs, short tours or specialized training under one year nullifies currency of this
training, requiring the member to re-accomplish. COMCAM and/ or VI unit commanders
may, at their discretion, choose to send members to the training beyond the minimum
requirement as readiness dictates. Air Force Aircrew Survival Training (for appropriately
qualified aircrew personnel) may substitute for the COMCAM Contingency Support course,
consistent with the rules described above.
5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general assessor,
technical course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise (Hardstand) as an engineer.

 6. Rule 43 TACS will be considered current if they meet all air-strike control currency
 requirements to include Night, Live, Laser, and basic TAC requisites (IAW AFI 13-112, Vol
 1).
 7. Rule 43 Units will include TRUTC remark to report the total number of combat mission
 ready JTACS broken out by officer and enlisted numbers.
 8. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear
 support equipment.
 9. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft;
 even if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP).

A3.1. 2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC first
two digits of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX) will use the
third through fifth character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth character that best
indicates the provisional unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41 FW (FFABC0) to 41
FW Provisional [just the headquarters element] (FHABCA) or 66 AS (FFSSS0) to 66 AS
Provisional [whole unit deployed] (FHSSS0). Provisional units with a unique PAS code will be
registered using the last four of that PAS for the second through fifth characters of the UIC.
When the unit is registered, the ORGLOCN sets must be entered in addition to BIDE set.
A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities. All CROs prepare
and submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active, AF
Reserve, and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.
   A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To
   initially register a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN
   sets (according to Table A3.1, Table A3.2, and Table A3.3) using the ADD transaction
   code.

           AFISRA SORTS STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT (SAV) PROGRAM

A8.1. (AFISRA) SORTS SAVs.
  A8.1.1. (AFISRA) The AFISRA SORTS Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) is designed to assess
  SRO and unit reporting compliance, with baseline standards, according to AFI 10-201, AFI
  90-201/AFISRA Supplement, and this supplement. In addition, AFISRA will provide
  operational requirements, training, and suggestions for improving Wing/Center SRO overall
  effectiveness.
  A8.1.2. (AFISRA) SAVs will be scheduled and conducted annually. The schedule will be
  emailed to each SRO, Group and/or Unit. A message will be sent to specific units, as
  applicable, if a date change is necessary. Note: Every effort will be made to ensure that the
  SAV is conducted prior to a Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI), Operational Readiness
  Inspection and/or Surety Inspection.
  A8.1.3. (AFISRA) The most current UCI SORTS Checklist will be used as the basis of
  measurement for all SORTS programs. The most current UCI SORTS Compliance and
  Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL), AFISRAICL 90-210, Compliance and
  Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL) – Status of Resources and Training System will
  be located on the AF e-Publishing website.
  A8.1.4. (AFISRA) The SAV will be conducted in conjunction with SRO training, as
  applicable. The SRO (primary and alternate) appointed by the Wing/Center and Group
  commanders must be present for this training. Training will be documented and maintained
  according to paragraph 1.11.10.2.1.6 Measured Unit commanders must ensure their SORTS
  Representatives (Measured Unit Monitors) are available to provide the SORTS program
  information to the SAV team members for review. In addition, measured unit SAVs will be
  scheduled by the SAV team after arrival on station, and not before, unless otherwise
  determined by AFISRA/A3XF. SRO or Group (as applicable per location) will notify all
  unit monitors (primary and/or alternate) to be available for the duration of the SAV. Also,
  the unit commander must inform the Wing/Center or Group SORTS manager during
  coordination of the SAV, if they would like a one-on-one in and/or out brief.
  A8.1.5. (AFISRA) The SAV team will provide the SRO with a message and/or e-mail
  confirming arrival/departure dates, team composition, Entry Authorization List (EAL) and
  in-brief/out-brief availability not later than 5 days before arrival. Team visits will normally
  be 3-5 days. The SRO will verify if the Wing/Center or Group commander/alternate desires
  a SAV team chief in/out-brief and coordinate, appropriately. If an out-brief is desired, an
  appointment should be made for the last duty day of the visit.
