                                             Chapter 1

                                             PURPOSE

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. The purpose of the aircrew Stan/Eval program is to provide commanders a tool to
     validate aircrew readiness and the effectiveness of unit flying, including documentation of
     individual aircrew member qualifications and capabilities.
     1.1.2. Aircrew includes the total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, combat systems
     operators (CSOs), air battle managers, and flight surgeons), career enlisted aviators (1AXXX
     Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew personnel (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force
     Specialty Code) responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the aircraft and
     onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the aircraft’s mission.
     See also AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service.
        1.1.2.1. Includes members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to an
        authorized operational flying position.
        1.1.2.2. This program is not required for cadets participating in US Air Force Academy
        (USAFA) airmanship programs.
1.2. Objectives.
     1.2.1. Provide a system to assess and document individual aircrew proficiency and capability
     to accomplish assigned flying duties.
     1.2.2. Develop and ensure standardization of operational procedures for weapon system
     employment.
     1.2.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate operational, training, and administrative
     directives.
     1.2.4. Evaluate and revise operational directives, procedures, and techniques as required.
     1.2.5. Recognize trends and recommend/initiate changes to training programs and directives.
1.3. Waiver Authority.
     1.3.1. Unless otherwise specified, AF/A3O is the waiver authority for policy guidance in this
     instruction. Except as provided in this instruction, or by direction of the approving authority,
     the MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements on a case-by-
     case basis.
     1.3.2. Request waivers through applicable Stan/Eval channels to MAJCOM/A3, (or
     equivalent). As applicable, MAJCOM/A3s will forward requests to AF/A3O, with an info
     copy to AF/A3O-AI.
     1.3.3. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and
     approved through higher level coordination authority.
     1.3.3. (AETC) Policy and procedures are enacted to provide quality and consistency in
     training and evaluation whether at an undergraduate or graduate level. Occasionally, unique
     circumstances may warrant special consideration and possible waiver of policy provisions.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                      9


  At the same time, because it is important to preserve fidelity of training, evaluation, and
  policy implementation throughout the command, a process must be established for review of
  proposed waivers.
     1.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) Unless otherwise stated in this supplement, AETC A2/3/10 is
     the waiver authority for waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this

     exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual
     circumstances. (T-3)
     1.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) AETC commanders will submit all T-2 waiver requests to
     AETC/A2/3/10 via the Task Management Tool (TMT). (T-2) Waiver requests must
     provide justification why the individual or unit cannot comply with requirements. (T-2)
     AETC/A3VO and the units will file a copy of approved waivers according to AFI 33-
     360, Publications and Forms Management.
     1.3.3.3. (Added-AETC) NGB/A3 and AFRC/A3 are the waiver authorities for their
     respective gained units. NGB and AFRC units will submit waiver requests IAW the
     appropriate MAJCOM procedures.

                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.

       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).
       3.2.1.6. Chair the SEB.
       3.2.1.7. Establish procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated Stan/Eval software.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
       3.2.2.1. (AETC) Unit OGVs will ensure squadron programs are standardized to the
       maximum extent practical (T-3). Unit FEs will conduct periodic supplemental
       evaluations of each squadron to ensure compliance with group standards (T-3).
       Document inspection results with corrective action if required.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).

       (T-3).
       4.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) Receive briefings addressing evaluation philosophy, grading
       procedures, and policies from the SQ/CC and OG/CC (or designated representative).
       Note: ANG may substitute OGV for SQ/CC (T-3).
       4.2.1.3. (Added-AETC) For initial FE certification (that is, for an individual who has
       not previously been a FE in any MDS), monitor a ground evaluation, emergency
       procedures evaluation (EPE), mission brief, and mission debrief performed by a certified
       FE (T-3).
       4.2.1.4. (Added-AETC) Document training listed in paragraphs 4.2.1.1 through 4.2.1.3
       of this supplement in a format defined in the local supplement (T-3).
   4.2.2. The chief of the respective MAJCOM or NAF Stan/Eval function will select and
   designate in writing HHQ flight examiners. Copies of the designation memo will be sent to
   all units where HHQ flyers are attached to fly.
   4.2.2. (AETC) AETC/A3V is the certifying official for MAJCOM FEs and will certify
   them by signing an AF Form 4348. The AF Form 4348 will be sent to all units where FEs are
   attached to fly. AETC/A3V in coordination with AETC/A3Z will certify non-AETC gained
   Air Advisor Flight Examiners by signing a Memorandum for Record to document
   certification. ANG units will follow NGB guidance.

      4.2.4.1. The USAF advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
      4.2.4.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and Reserve
      (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
      ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as flight examiners.
4.3. Flight Examiner Functions.
   4.3.1. Conduct aircrew evaluations IAW Chapter 5 and document IAW Chapter 7.
   4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors (N/A for senior flight examiners, see paragraph
   4.4.2).
   4.3.3. Administer evaluations only within their weapon system/aircrew specialty and only
   evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification and/or certification.
   EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2.
      4.3.3.1. Waiver authority for flight examiners to evaluate mission/skill sets in which they
      are not certified is the OG/CC. For senior flight examiners (see paragraph 4.4), waiver
      authority is the next commander in their flying chain of command
   4.3.4. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
   requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
   MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examiner. MAJCOMs may establish procedures in
   their supplement for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside of NAFs/units within
   their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.5).
      4.3.4.1. (Added-AETC) FEs may give evaluations outside their squadron (within the
      same group) with the concurrence of both SQ/CCs. Evaluations conducted outside the
      group require concurrence of the OG/CCs or their equivalents.
   4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
   and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   4.3.5. (AETC) The permission briefing will include a review of all areas being evaluated.
   (T-2) Post-mission, the FE will ensure the examinee understands the overall grade, along
   with any remarks, restrictions, or recommendations to be entered on the AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. (T-2)
   4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
   (applies to both the examinee as well as any accompanying aircrew).
   4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
   supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
   or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
   4.3.8. (Added-AETC) Units will adhere to a pyramid style evaluation structure where
   higher level FEs or FE qualified supervisors evaluate subordinate aircrew and lower level
   FEs to the maximum extent possible (not required for evaluations required by a formal
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                          21


  course of training). (T-2) This in no way shall restrict unit leadership’s discretion to conduct
  evaluations on assigned/attached aircrew. An FE will not evaluate his or her rater (See Table
  4.1). (T-2)
     4.3.8.1. (Added-AETC) If there is no representation for a specific aircrew position at
     HQ AETC, the next lower echelon FE becomes the top of the pyramid, no waiver is
     required.
     4.3.8.2. (Added-AETC) Examinees requiring a MAJCOM FE will consult AETC/A3V
     for availability. Units will coordinate with the appropriate AETC/A3V branch to schedule
     MAJCOM FE administered flight evaluations no later than the third month of their flight
     evaluation zone. (T-2) AETC/A3V may delegate if no appropriate FE is available.
     4.3.8.3. (Added-AETC) When there is no qualified FE available above the examinee in
     the pyramid structure or chain of command, the highest available FE, including an
     additional duty FE, will administer the evaluation. Document the circumstances in the
     additional comments section of the AF Form 8.
     4.3.8.4. (Added-AETC) The pyramid evaluation system does not apply to the EPE or
     the rear cockpit pilot (RCP) evaluation.
     4.3.8.5. (Added-AETC) At Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, the government flight
     representative is an OGV equivalent.
     4.3.8.6. (Added-AETC) FEs augmenting MAJCOM inspection teams are considered
     MAJCOM equivalent FEs for pyramid evaluation purposes.
     4.3.8.7. (Added-AETC) Normally, FEs will not evaluate personnel they have
     recommended for upgrade or primarily instructed during the final phase of training. (T-3)
     4.3.8.8. (Added-AETC) Additional duty FEs will not administer evaluations to other
     FEs. (T-3) An additional duty FE is defined as one who is not occupying one of the
     following positions: SQ/CC, DO, and DOV; OG/CC, CD and OGV; WG/CC; and
     MAJCOM stan/eval (or equivalent). Exception: Individuals at the top of the pyramid
     may be evaluated by any certified FE.
     4.3.8.9. (Added-AETC) Reviewing Officers. SQ/CCs will designate in writing those
     individuals and/or positions authorized to be AF Forms 8 Reviewing Officers. (T-3)
     4.3.8.10. (Added-AETC) Final Approving Officer. The final approving officer will
     be the examinee’s assigned SQ/CC or the SQ/DO if the SQ/CC is unavailable or has
     already signed the AF Form 8. (T-3) For attached examinees not assigned to a squadron
     (including FTU students), the attached FTU SQ/CC (or the SQ/DO if the SQ/CC is
     unavailable or has already signed the AF Form 8) will be the final approving officer. (T-
     3) AETC/A3V is the final approving officer for all AF Forms 8 completed for general
     officers, wing and group commanders who report directly to AETC, and for air advisor
     AF Forms 8 when no wing or group structure exists. ANG units will designate
     appropriate Final Approving Officers in writing.
     4.3.8.11. (Added-AETC) Notify the examinee’s rater of the examinee’s performance.
     (T-3) If the rater is not the FE, reviewing officer, or final approving officer, document the
     rater’s notification in the Examiner’s Remarks section in the Additional Comments block.
     (T-3) Note: Not required for general officers or students in formal training.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
   5.1.2. (AETC) Examinees will not be evaluated in multiple crew positions. (T-2)
   Exception: CSO instructors may be evaluated in the T-1 right seat, I-1 position, and I-2
   position.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft

  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. (AETC) AETC/A3V is the approval authority for waivers under the
        exception in the basic AFI. Send waiver requests via TMT through AETC/A3VO. (T-
        2) NGB/A3 and AFRC/A3 are the waiver authorities for their respective units. NGB
        and AFRC units will coordinate waivers IAW the appropriate HQ policy.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.

     5.2.4.2. (AETC) AETC aircrews will follow MDS-specific guidance for specialized,
     universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrews. Submit initial cadre requests to
     AETC/A2/3/10 through AETC/A3V.
         5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
         whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
         requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
         serve as the student.
         5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
         subsequent periodic evaluations.
         5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
         evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
         MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
         AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency
     exceeding six months (as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1), completion of
     a qualification evaluation in a different MDS, a recheck following a failed evaluation, or
     a commander-directed downgrade. A requalification evaluation requires AF Form 8/8a
     documentation.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                         27


        5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
        guidance for that periodic evaluation.
        5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
        1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
        The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
        those items for which the individual is non-current and which require an evaluation
        IAW the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1/2.
        5.2.6.2.3. Completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS. The recheck
        will be IAW the guidance for the periodic evaluation in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS
        Vol 2 and will include, as a minimum, those items for which the individual is
        regaining qualification.
        5.2.6.2.4. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
        IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
        5.2.6.2.5. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.6.2.6. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.6.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but
            the flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period
            and the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion
            of the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.6.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
     5.2.6.3. (AETC) AETC FEs will conduct no-notice evaluations as directed by
     AETC/A3V and are authorized to conduct no-notice flying evaluations any time they
     visit a location. Each OG and SQ will institute an annual no-notice, in-flight evaluation
     program. (T-2) Specific program goals are at the discretion of the OG/CC and SQ/CC;
     however, to ensure the program is used effectively, the unit must use discretion in the
     selection of crewmembers and missions being evaluated. Distribute no-notice evaluations
     (quality of force) proportionately among aircrew positions, weapons systems, and type
     evaluation. (T-3) Publish requirements for the local unit’s no-notice program in the unit
     supplement and document accomplishment in the SEB minutes.
 28                                         AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


          5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
          daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
          5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
          evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal
          preparation” will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
          of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
          examiner.
      5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
      either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
          5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
          the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                         29


         discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
         proficiency.
         5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
         remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
             5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
             or flying.
             5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
             of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
             be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
             5.3.2.2.2.2. (AETC) For students enrolled in an AETC syllabus, enter a date not
             to exceed the last day of the second month following the event requiring
             additional training (for example, 26 Jan 14, Flight Evaluation 31 Mar 14, due
             date). (T-3)
             5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
             additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as “Commendable”
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
     5.3.2.8. (Added-AETC) During senior officer initial and recurring evaluations leading
     to qualification to fly a mobility aircraft (for example, C-17, C-130, C-130J, KC-135, and
     C-21) in a supervised status, flight examiners will grade aircrew members on their ability
     to meet AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 performance standards while receiving verbal instruction.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
30                                          AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
        5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
        5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
        awarding of an overall Q1.
        5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
        the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
        5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
        assigned.
        5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
        5.3.3.2.2. (AETC) When a non-critical area/subarea is graded U, serious
        consideration should be given to assigning an overall grade of Q-3.
        5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
        justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
        5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
        evaluations and EPEs).
        5.3.3.3.1. (AETC) When two or more non-critical areas/subareas are graded U, the
        overall grade must be Q-3. (T-3)
        5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
        justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
        the overall qualification level.
        5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
        requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
        consideration.
        5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
        5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
        EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
        always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
     5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
     only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
     Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                         31


          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
   5.4.1. (AETC) Contractors may use AETC Form 610Q, Contractor Instructor Evaluation
   Record, as an evaluation worksheet and to identify evaluation criteria.
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
32                                         AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


         5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
         Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
         5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
         5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
         5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
         and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
         systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
         5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
         evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
         simulator/ATD, or verbally.
            5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
            evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
            5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
            INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
            cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
            evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.4. (AETC) All additional training items for an EPE must be completed
         before accomplishing the flight phase of the evaluation. (T-3)
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                             33


       5.5.2.1. (AETC) If the lead command has not established specific criteria in the AFI 11-
       2MDS Vol 2, units will define specific evaluation criteria and areas in the unit
       supplement. Exception: AETC/A3Q will define specific evaluation criteria for Air
       Advisor aircraft if no other AFI 11-2MDS criteria exist.
       5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
       training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
       5.5.2.2. (AETC) FEs will use unit safety summaries of aircraft emergencies and
       functional check flight aircraft system trends when developing evaluation profiles. (T-3)
       FEs will include discussion of real world EPs in all evaluations. (T-3)
   5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
       5.5.3.6. (Added-AETC) For initial and requalification evaluations, all ground phase
       requisite items must be completed prior to the flight phase of the evaluation. (T-3)
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
34                                          AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


     5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
     period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
     training required.
     5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
     administer the recheck.
     5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
     Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
     5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
     recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
     evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
     remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
  5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
  evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
  mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
         5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
         being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
         area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
     5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
     completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
     5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
     restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
     limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                         35


      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
      5.6.3.5. (Added-AETC) An initial qualification examinee who is graded Q-2 with
      additional training required will not fly as a qualified crewmember until additional
      training is completed. Complete additional training prior to a student’s release from
      formal schooling. (T-3) Instructors or examiners will administer additional training. (T-3)
      5.6.3.6. (Added-AETC) An IP graded Q-2 on any evaluation will not perform instructor
      or examiner duties until additional training is completed. (T-3)
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.2. (AETC) Schedule periodic evaluations prior to the last month of the eligibility period
   unless extenuating circumstances prevent doing so (T-3).
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended          Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s     may    extend
          evaluation expiration dates for aircrew members for up to six months. Provide
          notification to AF/A3O when extensions are approved (copy to AF/A3O-AI).
          Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM supplements to this
          instruction.
36                                           AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


         5.8.3.2.2. (AETC) Send all requests for evaluation extensions via TMT with
         justification to AETC/A3V. (T-2) Exception: NGB and AFRC units will submit
         extension requests IAW the appropriate HQ policy.
         5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
         of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
         paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
         longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
         see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
         period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
             5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
             5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
             5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
             5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
             5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
             than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
             before or during deployment.
     5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
         5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
         authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
         5.8.3.3.1. (AETC) Approval authority for all wing commanders and group
         commanders who report directly to AETC will be AETC/A3V.
         5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
         administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
         attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
         supervisor.
         5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
         authority.
  5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
  period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
  member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
  5.6.3 apply.
     5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
     evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
     5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
     by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
  5.8.5. FTU students, initial qual and requal aircrew members will complete all requisites and
  flight evaluation within a six month period. The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                          37


   case-by-case basis, document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2, and report this in
   the SEB minutes.
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.2. (AETC) In addition to documenting certification on the AF Form 4348, units will
   document aircrew certifications on the unit letter of Xs according to AETC supplement to
   AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
 38                                          AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 10-3502 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (AETC) Applicability. Universal qualification eligibility will be according to
   MDS-specific volumes 1 and 2.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                      39


   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS Vol 2/MOU.
5.14. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). When RPA aircrew members are not qualified in
certain areas (e.g. launch and recovery), provide comment and document restrictions in the
remarks section of the AF Form 8. See paragraph 7.3.7.1.

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (AETC) Units will use TIMS/GTIMS for aircrew examinations. (T-2) Exception:
   Use of TIMS/GTIMS is not required for end of course tests administered by ATS
   contractors, CAP-USAF, or ANG units.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
       6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
       be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
       references for open book examinations.
       6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
       the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
       safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
       6.4.1.2. (AETC) Published MQFs will not be used to develop open-book examinations.
       The open-book examination will consist of a minimum of 50 questions to a maximum of
       100 questions. However, if they are developed, units will forward one copy of each
       secure question bank (SQB), along with one copy of the open-book examination and all
       subsequent changes, to AETC/A3V within 10 workdays of SQB publication. (T-2)

   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
   6.4.2. (AETC) Closed-book examinations will have a minimum of 25 questions and a
   maximum of 50 questions.
       6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
       specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
       aircrew.
       6.4.2.1. (AETC) AETC/A3V will publish separate master question banks (MQB) for
       each AETC lead-command aircraft. AETC/A3Q will coordinate with AETC/A3V to
       determine the requirement and develop MQFs for any non-USAF Air Advisor aircraft
       consisting of at least 100 questions. The OGV will develop wing MQFs from AETC
       MQBs. Each aircraft MQF should consist of 300 questions. Exception: The 306 FTG
       VFR-only aircraft MQFs will consist of at least 100 questions.
          6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
          administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
          procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
          6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
          Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
          necessary.
          6.4.2.1.2. (AETC) Units will forward edits of lead-command aircraft MQF
          questions to AETC/A3V      (T-2). Where AETC is not the lead command, units will
          forward edits of MQF questions through AETC/A3V to the lead command.
       6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
       MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
       6.4.2.2. (AETC) Units will develop, maintain, and distribute local procedures MQFs.
       (T-2) HHQ approval is not required. Forward copies to AETC/A3V within 10 workdays
       of publication. (T-2) Local procedures MQFs may be combined with MDS-specific
       MQFs.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
 42                                          AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.1. (AETC) Units will ensure all end-of-course examinations satisfactorily cover the
   material of the appropriate requisite exams and ensure a student has the knowledge base to
   pass the actual requisite exams. The syllabus OPR will forward all EOC exams to
   AETC/A3V for coordination with the lead MAJCOM. AETC/A3Q will coordinate with
   AETC/A3V to create and maintain EOC tests for Air Advisor aircraft. When EOC exams are
   randomly generated from a question bank, the question bank must be coordinated. Ensure all
   appropriate security measures are met when transmitting exams. Units will complete a
   review annually and within 30 days of publication changes. (T-3) Procedures will be outlined
   in a unit supplement.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.1. (AETC) AETC/A3V must approve software used for test creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                          43


6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
   6.8.4. (Added-AETC) Boldface steps will be written as depicted in flight manual.
   Abbreviations or contractions of procedures or actions are not allowed unless they are used in
   the flight manual. Minor spelling errors are acceptable as long as the intent is clear and the
   meaning of the action is not changed. For example, “propellor” (instead of “propeller”)
   would be acceptable, but “throttle” (instead of “throttles”) would not be acceptable because
   the meaning is changed. Units may supply a preformatted answer sheet that includes boldface
   titles, step numbers, etc.
   6.8.5. (Added-AETC) Critical action procedures (CAP) answers must contain all
   procedures in the proper sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
      6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
      exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
      6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
      resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
      aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
      results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
      instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
 44                                           AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


6.10. (AETC)Unit Periodic Examinations. (Not applicable to ARC) Each unit stan/eval will
conduct and document periodic testing at least semiannually. (T-3) The MQF will not be used to
develop questions. For other than Boldface/CAPs, periodic exams will be corrected to 100%
prior to the next flight. Units will include guidance in their supplements detailing procedures for
failed or missed exams.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.
   6.10.4. (Added-AETC) Monthly Boldface/CAPS Requirement. At a minimum, all
   aircrew will successfully complete a boldface/CAPS examination prior to the first flight of
   the month. (T-3) (Exception: For units utilizing programs with a 30-day rolling window,
   Boldface/CAPS must be accomplished within the last 30 days.) All aircrew will be placed in
   a no-fly status in the unit Go/No-go until successful completion. (T-3)

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.1. (AETC) 306 FTG units may use locally developed flight evaluation worksheets
   (paragraph 7.3.8.1) as the official flight evaluation certificate for United States Air Force
   Academy (USAFA) cadets. Keep these forms in the examinee’s training folder or other unit-
   designated location and give them to the member when they leave the Academy. (T-3)
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (AETC)Qualifications versus Certifications. Units will document aircrew certifications
on an AF Form 4348 and the unit letter of Xs in accordance with the AETC supplement to AFI
11-202, Volume 1. (T-2) Exception: ANG units will follow NGB guidance.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
46                                           AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


     7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
     the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
     7.3.2.1. (AETC) TIMS/GTIMS will be used for AF Form 8 generation. (T-2) In all
     cases of data entry, if TIMS/GTIMS is unable to comply with AFI guidance, the
     TIMS/GTIMS produced AF Form 8 is acceptable provided the intent of the qualification
     represented is not changed. Exception: ANG units, CAP-USAF, and Air Advisor flight
     training programs need not use TIMS/GTIMS.
     7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
     (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
     7.3.2.3. The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a
     three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
     7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
     “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.

            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
               INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
               8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
               (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
               7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
               instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
            may be used.
        7.3.5.2.3. Date.

        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and
            “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and
            “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).

        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 12” under Qualified and “INSTM-N/A” under

7.6. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (Optional). See Attachment 7 for sample
AF Forms 4348.
7.6. (AETC)AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. Units will document aircrew
certifications on an AF Form 4348 and on the unit letter of Xs according to the AETC
supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2) Exception: ANG units will follow NGB guidance.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
   7.6.1. (AETC) Purpose. AF Forms 4348 should normally be filed in the aircrew member’s
   training folder but may be included in the aircrew member’s FEF. Do not file AF Form’s
   4348 in both places. If included in the FEF, follow the guidance in the basic AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2.
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                          59


     member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
     unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
     7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
     SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
     transcriptions are accurate.
     7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
     directed by MAJCOM.
     7.6.1.5. (AETC) Units may document one-time training on the AF Form 4348 for the
     purpose of tracking completion.
     7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
     entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.
     7.6.3.2. (AETC) For events that don’t require an instructor for certification, enter
     “N/A.”
     7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. (AETC) Except where otherwise specified, the SQ/CC will sign the AF Form
     4348 as the certifying official. (T-3) This authority may be delegated no lower than the
     SQ/DO.
60                                          AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate “Renamed (new
         title)” under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                          61


      7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
      section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
          7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 4348.
   7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
   Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy.
   7.6.7. (AETC) Once properly signed, the AF Form 4348 becomes the certification source
   document. Records maintained during the certification process may be archived or disposed
   of IAW the RDS.
7.7. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member. See
example at Attachment 5.
   7.7.1. Data Entry.
      7.7.1.1. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
      “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
      7.7.1.2. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
      data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
      desired.
      7.7.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those in which
      the qualification levels awarded on portions of a combined evaluation are not all the
      same.
      7.7.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
      any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
      awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
      level.
      7.7.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is completely filled. If additional blocks not
      needed, “Z” out any unused blocks.
   7.7.2. Type Aircraft/Crew Position. Enter MDS used and crew position flown during the
   evaluation as it appears in the Aircraft/Crew Position area under Examinee Identification of

   subject AF Form 8/8a.
   7.7.6. MAJCOM Change. A one-line, undated entry containing MAJCOM title will be
   made for each change in the individual’s MAJCOM based on a Permanent Change of Station
   (PCS)/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). Do not annotate a change of MAJCOM if
   the individual is receiving an evaluation from an evaluator in a different MAJCOM unless
   the individual is enrolled in a formal training program.
   7.7.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942 should
   be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron.
7.8. Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF). The FEF contains the source documents that constitute
the history of flying qualifications for each aircrew member.
   7.8.1. Maintenance.
      7.8.1.1. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF that includes all
      AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and any additional MAJCOM
      and/or unit specified items. EXCEPTION: for flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-
      rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification do not require an
      FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
      7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
      organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
      7.8.1.3. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
      Stan/Eval function of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
      7.8.1.4. For personnel on inactive flying status, the FEF will be maintained with their
      Flight Records Folder (FRF).
      7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
      the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
   7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
      7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
      into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
      maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
      7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
      Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
      7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
      when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
      must be transportable.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                      63


  7.8.3. Contents. Divide the FEF into two sections:
     7.8.3.1. (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and
     any items authorized by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement. Section I may contain
     two sub-sections.
         7.8.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top in chronological order with the most
         recent on top, followed by the AF Form 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.2. Any additional information as directed by MAJCOM and/or unit
         supplement will be placed under the AF Form 942 and 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.3. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s FRF, a
         copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
         Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training
         Record, may be filed in this section behind and MAJCOM and/or unit directed items.
     7.8.3.2. (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8/8a and any related MFRs for all
     evaluations listed on the AF Form 942.
         7.8.3.2.1. AF Forms 8/8a. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most
         recent on top. Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more MDSs or two or
         more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
         – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
64                                         AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the “For Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the
     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
        7.8.5.2.4. (AETC) Do not log the evaluation on the AF Form 942 until the posting
        review has been accomplished. Posting the evaluation on the form 942 IAW
        paragraph 7.7 signifies the posting review has been completed.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                        65


        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (AETC) The stan/eval function will review all assigned and attached
        aircrew members’ FEFs annually. (T-3) Document reviews on the AF Form 942 as
        “Annual Review.” Note: FEFs of nonpermanent party aircrew members do not need
        to be reviewed.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
        7.8.6.2.1. (AETC) Minor discrepancies will be annotated on a minor discrepancy
        log, located behind the AF Form 942 and 4348 (if used), in Section I of the FEF. (T-
        3)
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
        without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
        contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
66                                         AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


         7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
         allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
         and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.
     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations
     and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the
     aircrew member for disposal.

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons and non-
rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.2. (AETC) Flight surgeons will complete requirements listed in MDS-specific volumes
   1 for all aircraft in which they will be qualified.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.2. DELETED.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

                                           Chapter 9

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of the items listed in Table 9.1 in either hardcopy or
   electronic format. If a unit establishes a paper library, it will be organized into volumes as
   shown in the table.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
      9.1.2.1. MAJCOMs will advise user commands when releasing an FCIF item that affects
      a weapon system. FCIF items that affect weapon systems will include designated
      MAJCOM applicability.
      9.1.2.2. FCIF items that contain weapon system data will be controlled IAW the
      applicable distribution statement in the governing Technical Order (TO).
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.3. (AETC) Rules for establishing and maintaining flight crew information file (FCIF)
   volumes are as follows:
      9.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) At a minimum, each flying squadron will maintain an FCIF
      functional publication library and appoint, in writing, an FCIF monitor to ensure proper
      maintenance as directed by this supplement. (T-2) The OG/OGV is responsible for FCIF
      standardization for subordinate flying organizations and is the focal point for any data to
      be entered in the FCIF. The OG/OGV may maintain a web-based FCIF resource, but is
      still required to notify subordinate units of new items. To avoid overwhelming
      crewmembers with unnecessary details, prominent points should be extracted from
      lengthy documents or highlighted if inclusion in Volume I, is necessary. Above the
      OG/OGV level, AETC/A3V is the focal point for FCIF information. AFRC/A3V is the
      focal point for AFRC units.
      9.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) FCIF signoff will be accomplished via TIMS/GTIMS in
      accordance with paragraph 2.3.1.4.1 (T-2) Exception: ANG units, CAP-USAF, and Air
      Advisor flight training programs need not use TIMS/GTIMS.
      9.1.3.3. (Added-AETC) Initial FCIF reviews will be accomplished prior to an
      individual’s first flight. An annual review will also be accomplished prior to the first
      flight at the beginning of each calendar year. (T-3) Prior to each flight, update the FCIF
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                      69


      signoff record if new material was added since the last review. Crewmembers not
      assigned or attached to the unit will annotate the FCIF number and initial next to their
      name on the original copy of the flight authorization. The unit’s go/no-go program will
      track compliance with this paragraph.
      9.1.3.4. (Added-AETC) Aircrew members authorized to join a mission en route may
      participate as primary aircrew members if they receive an FCIF update from a qualified
      and current crewmember (preferably a counterpart) on that mission.
      9.1.3.5. (Added-AETC) Brief applicable FCIF items prior to flight.
      9.1.3.6. (Added-AETC) Unit’s go/no-go program will track compliance with this
      paragraph.
      9.1.3.7. (Added-AETC) Units are allowed to distribute and maintain electronic copies
      of these volumes, to include a fully electronic library. Linking to HHQ internet
      publications sites is authorized. Units may maintain local electronic copies to indicate
      local posting instructions. The origin (basic or supplemental level) of all text must be
      clear. Units will describe electronic backup procedures in their local supplement. Paper
      backup copies are not required. (Note: Units will list additional requirements in their
      local supplements.)

   9.1.4. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
   (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
   add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
   9.1.4. (AETC) Current Read File. In addition to Part A and Part B, units will also
   maintain Part C. (T-3)
      9.1.4.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
      through V.
      9.1.4.1. (AETC) Part A will contain the appointment memorandum for the FCIF
      monitor.
      9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
      temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
70                                         AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013


     before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
     using MAJCOMs.
     9.1.4.2. (AETC) AETC aircrews tasked with operational missions will review the
     tasking MAJCOM’s Part B read file.
     9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
     not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
     9.1.4.3. (AETC) Part C, General Information, will be maintained and include current
     operational and mission guidance of a nonsafety of flight nature. Note: Part C guidance is
     not part of the flight go/no-go program. Units will implement procedures to ensure
     aircrews read and acknowledge items in Part C in a timely manner. (T-3) Command-level
     Part C items may be upgraded to Part B by local units.
        9.1.4.3.1. (Added-AETC) At the OG/CC’s discretion, Part C may include a flight
        crew bulletin (FCB), which contains items of interest extracted from publications,
        directives, messages, etc., not normally available to crewmembers. The FCB may also
        include consolidated Part C items for long-term reference. Active Part B items may
        not be published in the FCB. However, expired or rescinded Part B items may be
        continued in the FCB when the item, although no longer a safety-of-flight issue,
        remains useful and valid in the judgment of the OG/CC or OGV. If FCBs are used,
        publish, at a minimum, on a semiannual basis. (T-3) FCB items will cite the authority
        for inclusion. Structure and format of the FCB will be defined in the unit supplement.
     9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
     separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
     exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
     in the FCIF volumes.
     9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
     9.1.4.6. (Added-AETC) Use AETC Form 446, Flight Crew Information File (or an
     electronic equivalent), as the first page for each Part B or C entry. The entry may include
     attachments or continuation sheets.
     9.1.4.7. (Added-AETC) Conduct quarterly reviews of Part B, and C read files. (T-3)
     Begin Part B and C with a numerical index of current information that includes the
     assigned AETC or OG/OGV control number, date distributed, date of last review, title,
     OPR, date rescinded, and disposition. The review date may be left blank for newly filed
     items that have not been subject to review. File items in Part B and C in reverse
     numerical sequence with the latest item on top. Maintain command-level items until
     rescinded by the issuing agency. Maintain rescinded items in a separate file for 6 months
     according to the AF RDS and continue to reference them on the index until the end of the
     quarter following the quarter in which the item was rescinded. Cross-reference classified
     entries to the location where the item is maintained.
  9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
  Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
  requirements.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                         71


      9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
      authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
      configuration.
      9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
      containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
      Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.

defined in a unit supplement. Areas subject to supplementary evaluations are, at a minimum, unit
operational procedures, training programs, FE quality force and FEFs. The effectiveness of these
programs and others, as defined by the unit commander, is the primary objective of
supplementary evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   9.4.6. At a minimum, supplementary evaluations results will be documented in SEB minutes
   (see Attachment 2).
9.5. DELETED (Moved to Atch 1)

AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_I 30 JANUARY 2013                                                           75


type of an evaluation is either qualified (1) or unqualified (3). Use the grading criteria in
Attachment 9 (Added) as follows:
   9.7.1. (Added-AETC) A qualified rating (1) indicates that the flight examiner examinee
   complied with HHQ and local stan/eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the
   examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the correct grade for each evaluated
   area, awarded the appropriate overall grade and, if required, assigned appropriate additional
   training.
   9.7.2. (Added-AETC) An unqualified rating (3) is awarded when, in the higher level flight
   examiner's judgment, the lower level flight examiner failed to satisfy the requirements of
   paragraph 9.7.1. (Added).
       9.7.2.1. (Added-AETC) The unit SQ/CC or OG/CC, as applicable, determines the flight
       examiner certification status of the FE receiving an unqualified objectivity evaluation. If
       decertified, document the decertification on the FE’s AF Form 4348. (T-2) (Exception:
       ANG units will follow NGB guidance.)
       9.7.2.2. (Added-AETC) The SQ/CC or OG/CC may, at his/her discretion issue a
       commander directed downgrade AF Form 8 for the examinee based upon the higher level
       flight examiner recommendation. If utilized, the commander directed down-grade AF
       Form 8 will replace the SPOT evaluation form 8.
       9.7.2.3. (Added-AETC) If an unqualified rating is awarded to the flight examiner on an
       objectivity SPOT evaluation, the status of the checkride given by the lower-level
       evaluator needs to be determined by the senior evaluator. If the lower-level evaluator is
       deemed unqualified, the senior evaluator will sign the evaluatee’s AF Form 8 in place of
       the original (decertified) lower-level evaluator.
