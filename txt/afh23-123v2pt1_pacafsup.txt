Notes:
1        DIFM status codes that count as pre-repair (before) delayed maintenance days.
2        DIFM status codes that count as post-repair (after) delayed maintenance days.
3        DIFM Status codes that count as repair cycle days.
         DIFM status codes that count as awaiting part(s) days. See AFI 23-101, Sec. 2C, Financial
4        Management for examples of AWP time computations.
         DIFM status code that counts as repair cycle days for ACC and PACAF only. For all others,
5        these codes count as delayed maintenance days.
         When the first AWP due-out is established, the code on the end item DIFM detail record
         will be changed to AWP under program control. When the second AWP due-out is
         established, the code will change from AWP to 02P. Subsequent processing will increment
         or decrement the status code counter as appropriate, i.e., sequential processing will result in
         a code assignment: AWP, 02P, 03P, 04P, etc. 03P, 02P, AWP, FWP. DFM inputs
6        attempting to change the DIFM status code from AWP or (nn)P will reject 325.
         DWO should be assigned to UJC AR/BR requirements when Maintenance determines
         the asset must be retained on the system. This status code applies when an asset request
         for an AWP requirement results in a due-out. There will be no status automatically
         assigned to the DIFM detail that is created and Maintenance has 3 days to determine if
         the reparable asset should be removed from the AWP end item for a bench check, or if it
         is more practical to leave the AWP end item on the system and wait for a sub-
         component replacement item. If Maintenance decides to keep the asset on the system,
         they will assign DIFM status code DWO (UJC AR/BR, retained on system). If
         Maintenance decides to remove the asset for bench check, normal procedures for local
7        repair or delivery to a central repair facility apply.
         Status code FEM will be assigned when the request has UJC AU, BU, or CU, and the
8        delivery destination field contains FEM.
         When the last AWP due-out is released or canceled, the code on the end item DIFM
         detail record will be changed to FWP under program control. DIFM codes attempting to
         change the DIFM status code to FWP will also output a 318 REJ notice (Status Field
         Blank or in Error). When the status of an item changes from FWP, the DFM input must
         contain a force code (F) in position 62 in addition to the new status code. Without the
9        force code, a 318 REJ notice will occur.
         LRS/Materiel Management Activity may assign TIN status code when the item is in their
         possession and the turn-in cannot be processed because the item record is frozen, an identity
10       problem exists, or similar conditions exist. Ensure that processing standards for NRTS code
 6                                            AFH23-123V2PT1_PACAFSUP 4 MARCH 2014


          1 items are adhered to and assign a DIFM location code indicating the supply location. All
          credit DIFM details will have status code TIN (Turn-in to LRS/Materiel Management
          Activity ) assigned under program control at time of turn-in.
11        Status code VHM can only be applied against type organization V or T.
12        These codes count as repair cycle days when changed to a repair-type DIFM status code.
          MWI, PDM, TCG, and TOC are considered a separate category of delayed maintenance
13        time and stored in the Delayed Other Days field on the DIFM detail record.
          Status code MWP counts as awaiting parts days and must be manually updated using DFM
14        input processing.
          Days are not counted as issued DIFM days when items are in DIFM status codes AWP,
15        CTR, DWP, MWI, MWP, PDM, TCG, and TOC.
          When the DIFM status field is changed to CTR, an I125 MGT notice (Contract Repair Only
          the Quantity Indicated Time XXXX) will be printed. This notice will reflect the number of
          items that should be repaired based on the computed requirements. When items are no
          longer required for base support, the number shown in the condemn field of the
          management notice will be for the entire DIFM detail quantity. In this instance, status code
          CTR will not be loaded to the DIFM detail and the items no longer needed should be turned
          in as excess to the base requirements. The TIN (transaction identification number) input
          should have the action taken code 7 in pos. 62 and TRM in pos. 48-50. When a known
          requirement exists, but it is not apparent from the computed requirement, a force code (F) in
          position 62 of the DFM input will allow status code CTR to be assigned and the repair field
16        of the management notice will show the entire DIFM quantity.
          When DIFM status CEH is used the last three digits of the CE work order number must be
17        entered in positions 52-54 of the DFM input or reject 429 will occur.
18        MWI is authorized for use by ICBM and Remote Alaskan Radar Sites maintenance only.

Notes:
1. IEX 6 and E are for Individual Equipment Items.
2. See Ch 10 for proper assignment of these codes.
a. If the LRS CC/AO directs, change the ENC to P for IEX 9 items.
b. If the ENC is changed to P for IEX 9 items, establish local procedures IAW AFMAN23-122,
Ch 5 to ensure the DD 1348-1A output issue document contains the required certificate.
3. IEX D is assigned by Stock Control personnel to improve support for customer requirements.
AFH23-123V2PT1_PACAFSUP 4 MARCH 2014                                                           9


IEX D prevents automatic backorder of items which cannot be requisitioned online. An example
of when IEX D may be used is when the item is assigned a requisition exception (REX) code 4
(do not requisition), REX 5 (requires additional information from the customer prior to
requisitioning), or when the item has a NPPC 2, 3, 5, or 9 and a replacement stock number is
available. See Para. 5.2.47. for more information concerning REX codes. Processing
instructions for each item assigned IEX D should be readily available if rejects occur. This will
ensure processing actions are not unnecessarily delayed. Additionally, processing actions may be
entered in the item record nomenclature field. However, when the nomenclature field is used for
processing instructions, the instructions must be complete and understandable. The intent of
using this method is to provide enough information on reject notices so processing of the
customer request is not delayed. Standard phrases such as: ORDER NHA, USE
1560001234567BF, or ORDER REPAIR KIT should be used instead of local abbreviations.
Caution: Do not use the nomenclature field when processing instructions require extensive
explanation, multiple stock numbers, or information which exceeds the available positions of the
nomenclature. In these cases, use either the exception control card (ECC) image for the REX
assigned (if applicable) or an ECC for the IEX D. The objective is to make it easier to satisfy
customer demands without unnecessary delay. Any method that satisfies this objective is allowed
if locally documented in either a supplement or local operating instruction.
4. IEX G is assigned for Civil Engineering request.
5. The following information applies:
a. If the major command desires, maintain ECC images for IEX P through Z.
b. If local management desires, maintain ECC images for IEX 1 through 9 and A through O.
Normally, ECC images are not maintained for these IEX codes.
6. Assign IEX H to QEC kits and afterburners.
7. Assign IEX 7 to all hazardous material/waste item records. IEX 7 will not be used in place of
IEX 9.
8. Assign IEX 9 to items containing ODCs as determined by the HAZMART/BES. For these
types of items, all customer issue requests must be accompanied by an approved Air Force
waiver.
9. IEX B is not required for serialized small arms which have serialized report code (SRC) A
assigned or COMSEC items which have SRC of C assigned. COMSEC items with MMAC codes
CA, CK, CL, CO, CR, and CY must have SRC C loaded on the item record. SRCs are normally
loaded automatically through Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) (BME) change transactions
received from the Cataloging and Standardization Center (CASC).

5.2.17.4.2. The I004 MGT Notice does not need to be sent to the requesting organization after a
cancellation request.
5.2.17.4.3.2. Copies of the I023 MGT notice can be destroyed after processing.

NOTES:

1. Individual exception control (ECC) images are not required when the ILS-S assigns REX code 1
as a result of processing MILSTRIP status. REX code 1 must be monitored. If a requisition must be
permanently suppressed, process a Stock Control Data Change (FCD) transaction to change the REX
code to 4 or 5.
2. Individual ECC images are not required when the ILS-S assigns REX 3 as a result of processing
stock list changes received through the stock number user directory (SNUD). Retain a copy of the
036 (End of Job), 037 (Reserved), 045 (Reserved) REJ notice, or F470 MGT notice (BVD03) in
stock number sequence until action is taken to delete the stock number from the ILS-S. If the stock
number is not deleted, change to REX code 4.
3. Individual ECC images are not required for stock numbers under the following conditions:
a. REX code 4 is assigned to suppress requisitions for the following items:
(1) Items assigned budget code V (vehicles).
(2) Mechanized Materiel Handling Systems (MMHS).
(3) Bench mock-up/sets.
(4) Gas Cylinders.
(5) Constant Shelter Materiel.
(6) Calendars.
b. When complete processing instructions are loaded in the nomenclature field; e.g., requisition
repair kit.
4. When alpha REX codes are used for purposes other than requisition override, local management
(AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity, LRS/Materiel Management Activity or MAJCOM) will
decide how to manage and use the exception phrase record, ENC, and ECC image.
5. Satellite Procurement Flag. The satellite procurement flag is contained on the satellite OCCR (000-
099). REX code 0 indicates that the stock number contains an exception (opposite) to the flag.
6. ECC images are required to be maintained for each individual item assigned REX code 5 except
when complete processing instructions are loaded in the nomenclature field (for example, order bit
and pieces).
7. REX 2 is assigned to items coded local purchase/local manufacture where no local procurement
source or local manufacture capability exists.
8. (Added) HQ AMC/A4RM will direct use for the following locations as they support the Forward
