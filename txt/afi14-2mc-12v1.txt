                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT provides intelligence personnel the training needed to perform in their
assigned duty positions supporting MC-12 missions/operations. This chapter provides guidance
to assist SIOs in developing and executing their MQT program. MQT execution will take into
account assigned duty position, current qualifications, prior experience and training, currency,
documented performance and/or formal training achieved by each individual. Accomplish MQT
through one-on-one instruction from a qualified trainer, external courses, or other training
opportunities that satisfy the requirements for MQT. Use applicable portions of MQT to create a
requalification program for personnel who are in non-CMR (N-CMR) or non-BMC (N-BMC)
status. (T-2)
   3.1.1. Concurrent IQT/MQT. MQT should typically begin upon completion of IQT;
   however, in situations determined by the SIO, intelligence personnel may begin MQT before
   completion of IQT, if training events and timelines make this option more practical. Member
   must complete IQT before fully completing MQT and being awarded BMC/CMR. MQT will
   be completed within the time specified below. (T-3)
   3.1.2. MQT begins within 45 days (90 days for Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and
   ANG) of the individual’s first duty day at the gaining unit or immediately after the
   completion of IQT. Timelines for completion of MQT for each MAJCOM and reporting
   requirements are specified in the following paragraphs.
       3.1.2.1. Active duty units will complete MQT within 120 days after start.         Notify
       MAJCOM/A2 if training exceeds this timeline. (T-2)
       3.1.2.2. IMAs will complete MQT within 120 days with seasoning days. If no seasoning
       days are available, complete MQT within 365 calendar days, or the execution of one
       year’s cycle of Inactive Duty for Training and Annual Training, whichever is earlier.
       Notify MAJCOM Intelligence IMA Program Manager and AFRC/A2 if training timelines
       are exceeded. (T-2)
       3.1.2.3. ANG units will complete MQT within 120 days with seasoning days. If no
       seasoning days are available, complete MQT within 180 calendar days, or the execution
       of six-months cycle of Inactive Duty for Training and Annual Training. Notify NGB/A2
       and ACC/A2 if training exceeds this timeline. (T-2)
   3.1.3. MAJCOM/A2s will consolidate unit reporting of personnel exceeding allowable
   timelines and notify ACC/A2 on an annual basis.
   3.1.4. AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet. Use the AF Form 4381 to document the
   trainee’s progression through each individual training item. Specific MQT intelligence
   gradesheet elements are located in attachment 3. (T-2)
   3.1.5. Personnel are qualified CMR upon successful completion of MQT and a successful

                                   CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter outlines intelligence CT requirements for CMR and BMC
intelligence personnel. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of basic intelligence
knowledge and performance training items. These training topics ensure intelligence personnel
remain competent in MC-12 operations and aircraft capabilities, threat systems and unit
intelligence functions. The second aspect of CT is the Ready Intelligence Program (RIP), which
identifies specific mission-related tasks intelligence personnel must perform on a regular basis.
4.2. Continuation Training for Basic Knowledge and Performance Tasks. This section
provides a baseline of basic knowledge and performance tasks. SIOs will supplement these
requirements, as necessary. Trainers will use lead-MAJCOM provided training materials and
other resources as needed to provide the most effective and efficient training. CT must reinforce
MQT tasks and facilitate RIP requirements. Compile basic knowledge examinations from the
unit MQF. Annotate completion of CT tasks using the approved online training documentation
system. At a minimum, cover the following topics during CT. (T-2)
      4.2.1. IPOE – to include the steps and elements of the IPOE process as applied to unit
      mission and OPLAN/CONPLAN tasking.
      4.2.2. MC-12 Platform Sensors and Operations – to include sensors, systems, tactics,
      mission profiles, employment and defensive tactics/maneuvers, and capabilities and
      limitations.
      4.2.3. Threat Knowledge – to include potential AOR enemy/adversary aircraft and
      armaments, SAMs, ADA, EW, DEWs, ground, naval, and cyber threat system capabilities
      and limitations with respect to MC-12 operations.
      4.2.4. Visual Recognition – to include identification features and employment characteristics
      of enemy/adversary, friendly and/or neutral weapon systems.
      4.2.5. Intelligence Systems – to include types and functions of intelligence systems, software
      applications and operations, and how intelligence systems support the unit mission.
      4.2.6. Personnel Recovery – to include intelligence PR support procedures, theater Isolated
      Personnel Report/EPA requirements and other PR information contained in the SPINS.
      4.2.7. Force Protection Intelligence – to include intelligence support to FP principles;
      irregular/guerrilla/terrorist forces and organizations; force protection conditions and terrorist
      threat levels; and unit force protection considerations.

   4.2.12. Reporting – to include types of intelligence reports and formats, theater intelligence
   reporting requirements, software applications and transmission methods.
4.3. Ready Intelligence Program. The intent of RIP is to ensure intelligence personnel
perform specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain proficiency in their
duty positions. In order to maximize training opportunities and minimize artificiality, conduct
RIP tasks in conjunction with day-to-day missions or exercises as much as possible. (T-2)
   4.3.1. The task requirements listed in Table 4.1, MC-12 Ready Intelligence Program and
   Currency Requirements, establish the minimum frequency requirements for CMR and BMC.
   Failure to accomplish these requirements will affect the individual’s CMR or BMC status
   and additional training will be required as determined by the SIO.
   4.3.2. Intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks to maintain currency. If
   an intelligence specialist loses currency in a particular area, the individual may not perform
   that task unsupervised until currency is regained. Individuals are responsible for
   documenting RIP task completion.
