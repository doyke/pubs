MEMORANDUM FOR ALL HILL AFB PERSONNEL

FROM: 75 ABW/CC

SUBJECT: The Hill AFB Guidance Memorandum on the Employee Vehicle Certification and
Reporting System (ECARS) Policy

        This is a Hill Air Force Base Guidance Memorandum immediately implementing the
Employee Vehicle Certification and Reporting System (ECARS) in accordance with AFI32-
7040, Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management. It applies to all civilian and military
employees assigned to Hill AFB. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the
extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein
prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

        This Memorandum serves as a local supplement to the 06 September 2013 Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) between Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and the American
Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Council 214 on Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-
7040, Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management, Air Force Guidance Memorandum
1.2, dated 14 June 2013, ECARS Policy. It establishes and defines the conditions under which
Hill AFB will implement ECARS in accordance with the terms of said MOA.

        Effective 27 January 2014, civilian and military employees of Hill AFB will be required
to use ECARS to illustrate compliance with federal and local vehicle emissions requirements.
This requirement is driven by northern Utahâ€™s non-attainment status for particulate matter less
than 2.5 microns. To meet this requirement, each employee must follow the instructions sent to
his/her work email address from ECARS at no-reply@apims.af.mil. These emails are designed
to guide participants through the web-based process of certifying their commuter status and
personal vehicle information in ECARS. Employees will meet this requirement at a frequency as
prompted by ECARS (usually annually). Employees who fail to take the appropriate action(s)
specified in ECARS notifications may be subject to administrative action.

       Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
      This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this
Memorandum, or upon release of an Air Force publication incorporating the guidance,
whichever is earlier.
