This pamphlet is a tool for commanders and key staff who are responsible for base operating
support in a deployed contingency environment. The guide includes functional area checklists
for the five phases of a deployment: (1) pre-deployment, (2) initial bed-down, (3) standup, (4)
sustainment, and (5) redeployment. This guidance applies to all AMC support units tasked with
a deployment. It does not replace nor subjugate Air Force Instructions or Air Force manuals. It
provides general deployment guidance and capability standards for AMC active duty forces and
AMC-gained ANG and AFRC. This publication applies to the ANG when published in the
ANGIND-2. AFRC units will consider information contained herein as informational only. In
accordance with Air Force, CJCS, DOD, or Federal publications, a Combatant Commander’s
guidance takes precedence over guidance listed in this pamphlet. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air
Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/

  tasked home station commander with tools for AEF planning as well as links to regulatory
  guidance.
     1.1.1.1. Has the CC determined details of the tasking to include location, number of
     personnel, number and type of aircraft, and schedule of events?
     1.1.1.2. Has the CC obtained information about the bed-down site from all available
     sources? Remember to include individuals at the site (deployed, US exchange, liaison,
     and training officers), individuals who have previously been there, US Embassy (Air
     Attaché or Office of Military Cooperation), and other US military services.
         1.1.1.2.1. Has the CC reviewed information available on various web sites (e.g., HQ
         AMC/A2 SIPRNET website and links (www.amcin.scott.af.smil.mil))?

     https://www.jllis.mil/USAF and on the SIPRNET at http://www.jllis.smil.mil/USAF. JLLIS is
     a good source for lessons learned across the Joint spectrum of operations. Note: AFI 90-1601
     and the AMC Supplement have information on lessons learned procedures during the deployment
     and requirements for post-deployment after action reports (HQ AMC/A9L is the command focal
     point for lessons learned). Lessons learned for AEF deployments may be accessed at the AEF
     website on both the NIPRNET (https://AEF.AFPC.Randolph.af.mil) and SIPRNET
     (http://AEF.AFPC.Randolph.af.smil.mil).
     1.1.1.4. Has a review of the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report been
     accomplished for en route, deployment, and alternate airfields? Note: This report can be
     obtained at https://www.amc.scott.af.mil/do/doa/dovs.htm or by contacting HQ
     AMC/A3A at DSN 779-3316. Assault and drop zone surveys can be obtained using the
     24-hour automated Fax-on-Demand System (DSN: 576-2899, Com: 618-256-2899) at

       equipment) based on existing situation and conditions.
       1.1.1.7.3. Determine what support is available from the host nation or other services.
       1.1.1.7.4. Has the CC identified points of contact with phone numbers for leasing
       facilities, renting equipment, purchasing utilities, sourcing local supplies and
       obtaining secure storage for pre-positioned and pre-delivered equipment and
       materials?
       1.1.1.7.5. Identify available sources of transportation and characterize the local
       transportation network.
    1.1.1.8. The site survey team should include representatives from Civil Engineers
    (Engineering or Operations, Emergency Management, and Fire Protection),
    Communications, Airfield Management, Combat Crew Communications, Air Traffic
    Control, Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), Contracting, Security Forces,
    Medical, Services, Safety (Weapons, Flight, and Ground), Office of Special
    Investigations (OSI), Logistics Plans and Maintenance, and other functional areas
    deemed necessary.
    1.1.1.9. The site survey team should take a video camera and digital camera to record the
    site for future planning and briefings.
    1.1.1.10. The site survey team should be radio or cell phone equipped and capable of
    moving around independently. Radio frequencies should be coordinated within required
    timeframes with the cognizant communications provider (e.g., the host base
    Communications agency, theater frequency manager, and /or the host nation if
    applicable). Note: If deployed to an overseas area, local contracting for cellular phone
    service may be required to ensure operability. Consider the availability and use of
    IRIDIUM phones.
    1.1.1.11. Has the CC considered sending an advanced echelon (ADVON) team?
    Recommended ADVON team should include the MSG/CC (and a Senior NCO to assist),

12                                                          AMCPAM10-405 27 APRIL 2011


     1.4.1.3. Have all facility requirements been identified to support operations at the
     employed location? The following methodology can help identify requirements: Step 1.
     What organizations are part of the deployment? Step 2. What are the major functional
     areas (e.g., operations, maintenance, munitions, communications, lodging, dining,
     laundry, latrine, shower, etc.) and mission assets (e.g., aircraft, vehicles, antennas,
     computer systems, specialized equipment, etc.) of each organization? Step 3. What are
     the facility requirements for the major functional areas and mission assets in term of (a)
     airfield requirements (pavement dimensions and strengths for runway, parking ramp,
     arresting systems, lighting systems, etc.), (b) functional requirements (gross area for
     offices, specialized equipment, storage, proximity and access to other facilities, etc.), (c)
     utility requirements (water, power, lighting, fuels, sewer, etc.), (d) heating, ventilation,
     and air conditioning (HVAC) requirements, (e) fire and safety requirements, (f) security
     and force protection requirements, and (g) environmental requirements?
     1.4.1.4. Are adequate facilities and utilities available at the site to support the
     deployment? (AFPAM 10-219, Vol 5; WMP, Vol 1, Annex S; MJCS 275-89; AFH 32-
     1084; and AFH 10-222, Vol 1 and Vol 2)
        1.4.1.4.1. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established planning factors dictate the scope of
        facilities for wartime/contingency operations. When these planning factors are
        applied, they will normally yield substantially smaller facility scopes than do the
        factors used for peacetime Operations and Maintenance (O&M) or Military
        Construction (MILCON) planning and construction.
        1.4.1.4.2. Priorities for facility planning and construction should be (1) force
        protection and security, (2) mission-critical, (3) bed-down of forces (lodging, latrine,
        shower, laundry), (4) dining, (5) medical, (6) mission enhancement, (7) quality of life.
        1.4.1.4.3. A planning factor of 12 personnel per tent or 50 square feet per person
        should be used in calculating number of tents for non-wartime deployments longer
        than 30 days (AFPAM 10-219, Vol 5).
        1.4.1.4.4. The type of facility construction (including living, shower, and latrine
        facilities), should be based on the anticipated length of deployment. The initial,
        temporary, and long-term guidelines for facilities are tent construction, modular
        construction, and permanent construction, respectively. Seek component command
        guidance on if, how, and when modular or permanent construction will be pursued.
        The component command will assist in planning, programming, funding, and
        country-to-country agreement issues.
        1.4.1.4.5. Initial facilities requirements can be achieved with HARVEST EAGLE
        and HARVEST FALCON assets. Support for 1,100 people and one aircraft squadron
        at a single location will require one HARVEST FALCON housekeeping set, one
        industrial operation set, an initial flight line set, and follow-on flight line packages.
        Note: A bare base cannot operate using only HARVEST EAGLE and HARVEST
        FALCON assets. Other complementary assets include medical facilities, CE heavy
        equipment, functionally unique tactical shelters, etc.
     1.4.1.5. What are the terrain, soil and weather conditions?
AMCPAM10-405 27 APRIL 2011                                                                     13


     1.4.1.6. Has the airfield been assessed (condition, dimensions, obstacle penetrations to
     imaginary surfaces, lighting, markings, barrier configuration, taxiways, and ramp space)?
     1.4.1.7. Has existing fuel delivery system been assessed (vehicle, aircraft, heating, etc.)?
     1.4.1.8. Has a plan been developed for power generators to include refueling schedules,
     redundancy for priority systems, and load shed procedures to accommodate maintenance
     downtime?
     1.4.1.9. After assessing all requirements, are materials, personnel, and equipment
     available to execute the plan? Have shortfalls in materials and any special equipment
     items been ordered? Have initial manpower shortfalls been addressed with host wing and
     losing/gaining MAJCOM?
     1.4.1.10. Should additional equipment and material be brought from home station as a
     result of bed-down requirements (portable latrines, latrine treatment chemicals,
     construction materials, etc.)?

         1.4.1.16.1. Note: Use of O&M money for minor construction, not greater than
         $500,000, must be strictly observed. (AFI 32-1021 and AFI 32-1032)
     1.4.1.17. Is environmental mitigation required?
     1.4.1.18. Has unit coordinated with gaining MAJCOM’s A7 representative(s) concerning
     all anticipated missions, in-theater lines of communications, and A7 support forces
     available?
     1.4.1.19. Has unit coordinated for host nation support requirements (initial,
     sustainment)?
     1.4.1.20. Do host wing subordinate units know their support roles in bed-down and base
     development?
