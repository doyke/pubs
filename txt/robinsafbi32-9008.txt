                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Appointment Procedures.
   1.1.1. For each facility assigned to a wing or tenant unit, the organization
   Commander/Civilian Leader appoints, in writing, a primary and alternate FM. Provide a
   memo with the content in Attachment 2 for each new FM appointment, or any change in FM
   appointment.
   1.1.2. Where practical, the primary duty assignment of the individual appointed as the FM
   should physically reside in the facility for which he/she is the manager (outlying facilities,
   such as navigational aids, communication facilities, etc., are the exception).
   1.1.3. The FM will be an Officer, Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), or civilian with
   sufficient authority and ability to perform the assigned duties as the authorized representative
   of the Commander/Civilian Leader. The FM should have at least 12 months retainability at
   the time of appointment to lessen the impact of changes on all affected personnel.
   1.1.4. When a facility is occupied by more than one organization, the major user of the
   facility will appoint the primary FM. All other organizations using a portion of a
   multipurpose facility will appoint an alternate FM for their area.
   1.1.5. 78 CEG (CE) provides support to tenant organizations in accordance with the host-
   tenant agreement. This agreement informs the FM of support to be provided by CE and any
   potential limitations.
1.2. Training for FMs. CE provides online training for newly appointed FMs and the required
annual refresher training. This training will be documented in the Automated Civil Engineer
System Real Property (ACES-RP), and a completion certificate will be generated. Additional
one-on-one training can be scheduled with CE Customer Service personnel at building 1555,
DSN 327-7447.

2.2. FM.
     2.2.1. The appointed FMs have full authority to act as a liaison with CE on behalf of the
     Commanders/Civilian Leaders who appointed them.
     2.2.2. The FM, in cooperation with occupants and users of the building, is charged with the
     responsibility for care, custody, and protection of the assigned facility. Every effort should
     be exercised to safeguard the property from damage or loss.

   assistance, submit a E332 (The electronic, web-based system that replaced the manual
   processing of the hard-copy AF Forms 332) to CE identifying the specific problem. Prior to
   opening a breaker panel, all personnel must adhere to Level 0 PPE standards, accomplish Arc
   Flash training (available on the CE Customer Service Share Point site), and have the training
   documented on their AF Form 55, Safety and Health Record.
3.5. Facility Excellence. FMs and building occupants are responsible for adhering to facility
excellence standards by taking an active role in cleaning their areas and presenting a professional
work environment. Inspect work areas for such items as:
   3.5.1. Dead or dying plants.
   3.5.2. Open drawers and overhead cabinets.

                               KEY AND LOCK CONTROL

5.1. General. As a FM, you are responsible for the security of all basic keys that service your
facility. Stringent control and accountability of facility keys cannot be overemphasized. Newly
assigned FMs should obtain the facility keys from the previous FM.
5.2. Key Records. See the chapter on FM records for key record responsibilities.
5.3. Avoiding Duplications. Establish security procedures to make sure there is no duplication
of keys without your personal knowledge or official written approval.
5.4. Personnel Changes. Repossess all keys from personnel going to a permanent change of
station, as well as, those personnel who are departing due to discharge or termination of
employment. Keys issued to personnel going on extended leave or on a temporary duty
assignment for over 30 days should be held for safekeeping.
5.5. Controlled Areas. The organization Commander/Civilian Leader should appoint a
custodian other than the FM for keys that control specialized areas in the facility. These are
areas that organizations use for safeguarding their specialized equipment, sensitive documents,
personal tool kits, etc.
5.6. Additional Keys. Requests for additional keys will be submitted on the E332 signed by the
FM. Request for master keys will not be processed without the concurrence of the Unit
Commander.
5.7. Storage Safes. Safes are not Air Force real property, therefore CE should not maintain or
repair safes. However, because of the amount of safes at Robins AFB and because GSA certified
locksmiths are not readily available off base, CE provides this service. Requests for work to be
performed on safes must be submitted on the E332 and will be considered routine and worked on
a first come first served basis.

                                           Chapter 6

                 SPACE AND SYSTEMS FURNITURE MANAGEMENT

6.1. Recent Issues and Concerns. Over the past several years Robins AFB has experienced a
population growth with new mission beddowns, acquiring BRAC workloads, hiring contractors
to fulfill mission requirements and several reorganization efforts. Continued growth has forced
CE and hosted units to lease workspace off base. We must maintain cognizance and control over
all base facilities to ensure there is adequate space to accomplish all mission requirements.
6.2. Responsible Office for RAFB. The Workspace Management Office, 78 CES/CEAOS, is
the OPR for all space requests, temporary or permanent. The Air Force takes space management
very seriously and has required that the following situations be coordinated through the
responsible office and approved per RAFB policies:
   6.2.1. Vacant Space. If your organization has space that is no longer required, identify it to
   78 CES/CEAOS. Ensure the facility is left orderly and clean when vacated. The FM's
   responsibility will be formally terminated by inspection when the property is vacated by
   using organizations. Cleanliness of the facility will be considered during the final inspection
   performed by 78 CES/CEAOS.
   6.2.2. Desire for Additional Space. If you have a space requirement, 78 CES/CEAOS will
   work with you and associated organizations to satisfy your needs. In conjunction with CE,
   each wing is expected to take proactive approach to their workspace management issues by
   assigning internal workspace management oversight duties as applicable. 78 CES/CEAOS
   will actively work with the FM to resolve workspace needs.
   6.2.3. Renovating Existing Space. On a different but related issue, CE has experienced
   several instances of unauthorized modification or removal of systems furniture workstations
   and the building of private offices and conference/training/computer rooms without proper
   coordination. These actions have resulted in a net loss to our administrative workspace and
   cause building infrastructure problems.
   6.2.4. Contractor Space. Prior to committing space to contractors, each organization must
   submit a request to 78 CES/CEAOS for approval even though space may be available to
   prevent committing space to contractors that is required for government employees.
6.3. Systems Furniture. Finally, each WR-ALC and 78 ABW organization must coordinate
with 78 CES/CEAOS before purchasing new systems furniture or modifying installed systems
furniture.
   6.3.1. Coordinate with 78 CES/CEAOS prior to purchasing and installing systems furniture
   to ensure maintainability and compliance with Robins facility excellence standards.
   6.3.2. Accomplish advanced approval for such action via AF Form 332 with recommended
   electrical vendor(s).
   6.3.3. Ensure any purchase includes the installation of electrical power from existing facility
   electrical outlets to the systems furniture.
   6.3.4. If vendor source is unknown, 78 CES will provide recommended sources.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                    13


6.4. Multi-Use Facilities. FMs must be involved in all space management decisions within
multi-use facilities.

                        PHYSICAL SECURITY OF THE FACILITY

7.1. Published Rules. The FM shall publish rules for opening and closing the facility, including
security measures to be observed during normal duty hours and for after duty hours.
7.2. Facility Manager Responsibilities. Security of the facility is another responsibility of the
FM.
   7.2.1. Establish a standard procedure for making sure the facility is secure from illegal entry
   at all times. Double-check all doors and windows when departing, and ensure all locks are in
   good working order.
   7.2.2. Cooperation. Impress upon all personnel the importance of facility security. Without
   cooperation, the function of FM will become much more difficult. Regardless of who is
   responsible for the breach in building security, the FM has to correct it.
7.3. Procedures for Unsecured Facility.
   7.3.1. Security Police Law Enforcement Patrols conduct regular security checks on base
   facilities. If the facility is required to be secured after duty hours and is found open during a
   check by the 78th Security Forces Squadron, the FM must be present prior to re-securing the
   facility.
   7.3.2. A follow-up DD Form 1569, Incident/Complaint Report, will be sent to the Unit
   Commander for action. Unsecured buildings are a Support Wing Commander‘s interest item
   at Robins.
   7.3.3. If there are questions concerning facility security, contact the Security Police Crime
   Prevention Section, the Resources Protection Section, or the Law Enforcement Desk at
   extension 468-2187.

                                      FIRE PREVENTION

8.1. General. Each FM has specific duties and responsibilities to maintain fire safety conditions
in the facility. In the FM‘s continuity binders, keep a copy of Robins Air Force Base Instruction
32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Prevention Program.
   8.1.1. Ensure all buildings within the FM‘s area of responsibility are numbered visible from
   the road.
   8.1.2. Correct fire hazards and deficiencies in a prompt manner. If necessary, ask the fire
   inspector for advice.
   8.1.3. In case of fire, ensure employees already know how to perform these actions:
       8.1.3.1. Make sure a fire alarm is activated. All automatic fire alarms must be treated as
       a fire unless otherwise determined by the Fire Department.
       8.1.3.2. Evacuate the building or area immediately.
       8.1.3.3. Notify the Fire Department by dialing 911.
       8.1.3.4. Use portable firefighting equipment to extinguish a fire if discovered in its early
       stages.
       8.1.3.5. Meet the fire vehicles and direct the firefighters to the fire.
8.2. Daily Closing Inspection.
   8.2.1. Make a closing inspection at the end of each workday or activity period to ensure
   areas are left in a fire-free condition.
   8.2.2. Public assembly managers must complete the closing items listed in RAFBI 32-2001,
   Chapter 11, and call the base Fire Department at 468-3487 to obtain a closing code.
8.3. Monthly Fire Inspections. Perform monthly fire inspections and accomplish follow-up on
all discrepancies and irregularities noted during fire and safety inspections to ensure corrective
action.
8.4. Scheduled Fire Department Inspections.
   8.4.1. The primary or alternate FM will accompany the fire inspector during scheduled
   inspections and initiate corrective action for fire hazards noted during the inspection.
   8.4.2. After these inspections, the fire inspectors may note fire hazards and deficiencies on
   AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, and provide instructions for required corrective
   actions.
   8.4.3. If this information is not received during the inspection or in a follow-up report,
   contact the base Fire Department for assistance.
   8.4.4. During inspections, fire prevention inspectors pay particular attention to:
       8.4.4.1. The occupant‘s knowledge of fire reporting, evacuation, and use of fire
       extinguishers. Ensure evacuation plans are posted in a highly visible area of the facility.
 16                                               ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012


      8.4.4.2. The adequacy of safe practices to prevent fires.
      8.4.4.3. The control of smoking and the proper disposal of smoking materials.
      8.4.4.4. The condition of electrical equipment and connections. Be sure not to overload
      electrical outlets to also include systems furniture. A typical system furniture
      configuration is limited to 60 amps per four cubicles or 15 amps per cubicle; once this
      has been exceeded, the circuit breaker will pop. The typical computer is 3-4 amps while
      a 4-cup coffee pot or space heater is 15 amps. Occupants must manage their equipment
      accordingly (a person can plug in a computer, printer, monitor, phone, and a small radio
      or one other low amperage device; for example, a LMR battery charger = 2 Amps). It is
      strongly recommended not to plug in a coffee pot or space heater. This is a fire hazard
      and amperage levels may be exceeded.
      8.4.4.5. The adequacy, condition, and accessibility of fire exits and fire doors.
      8.4.4.6. The adequacy, condition, location, and accessibility of portable fire
      extinguishers.
8.5. Fire Extinguishers. Return extinguishers to Building 150, Exchange Shop, when the
annual inspection is due, a problem has been noted, or as directed by the fire prevention
specialist(s).
   8.5.1. When fire extinguishers are outdated and out of the hydrostatic date or are no longer
   serviced by building 150; FMs and using organizations must budget for the purchase and
   maintenance of such fire extinguishers.
8.6. Fire Prevention Records. The FM must keep records on fire prevention per the Chapter
on Records.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               17

                                   CUSTODIAL SERVICES

9.1. General. If a facility receives contract custodial services, make timely and effective
custodian services inspections to ensure that all custodial services performed for the organization
are accomplished in accordance with the custodial service contract.
9.2. Contract Terms. Each FM should be familiar with the terms of the contract, areas to be
serviced, frequencies of service, and the days that services are scheduled. The 78 CES Contract
Management Custodial Contract monitor will brief FMs on the terms of the contract. For
information or questions concerning this service, contact the Contract Management Element at
DSN 327-8909.
9.3. Oversight of Custodial Contractor. Although 78 CEG has Quality Assurance evaluators
for contracts, there are only enough authorized positions to support a single inspector for
evaluating the work of the custodial contractor in the 1,653 facilities on Robins. FMs, therefore,
should inspect custodial services work daily, or as service is provided, and report any
unsatisfactory work to the CE Customer Service Section.
9.4. Unsatisfactory Performance. Immediately report unsatisfactory performance by the
contractor to the 78 CES Contract Management Custodial Contract monitor. Address all
concerns with the custodial service to the custodial contract monitor and not with the contractors
or their personnel. It is the responsibility of the Custodial Contract monitor to settle
discrepancies or problems with the contractor.

                                          Chapter 10

                   BASE BEAUTIFICATION AND LITTER CONTROL

10.1. General. This section establishes policies, assigns responsibilities, and outlines
procedures for the maintenance, repair, and improvement of grounds at Robins AFB, thus
establishing an active base beautification and litter control program.
   10.1.1. Austere funding and manning dictates all base organizations to take an active part in
   the base beautification and litter control program.
   10.1.2. A grounds maintenance contractor is responsible for maintaining nearly all grounds
   on Robins AFB, however, FMs may be required to conduct minor maintenance on a periodic
   basis depending on plant growth.
10.2. Responsibilities.
   10.2.1. CE will:
       10.2.1.1. Provide grounds maintenance services through a contract and in-house forces in
       accordance with HQ AFMC standards, and provide Quality Aassurance and surveillance
       for the grounds maintenance contract. These areas are shown on the GeoBase website
       (https://geobase.robins.af.mil/geo/maps.asp) and generally include large open areas
       where tractor-powered equipment can be used, and areas not assigned to other
       organizations.
       10.2.1.2. Maintain improved, semi-improved, and unimproved grounds, and trees and
       shrubs in unoccupied areas.
   10.2.2. Organization Commanders/Civilian Leaders will:
       10.2.2.1. Enforce grounds maintenance and litter control in their areas of responsibility
       beyond the technical specifications of the grounds maintenance contract. Occupant
       responsibility (to include parking lot islands) extends to the halfway point between
       adjacent facilities, to the natural boundary or, in the absence of both, to a point 50 feet
       from the facility. Under no circumstances is an occupant required to maintain grounds in
       excess of 50 feet from a facility.
       10.2.2.2. Ensure FMs in their area of responsibility and personnel assigned to their
       organization are familiar with this chapter.
       10.2.2.3. Provide policing as required to ensure adequate and complete coverage.
       Keeping refuse containers policed and all covers closed are inherent in these
       responsibilities.
       10.2.2.4. Enforce base mowing and grounds maintenance responsibilities beyond
       contractor responsibilities predicated on facility occupancy. The organization having FM
       responsibility inherits overall mowing responsibility, and an obligation to develop plans
       for support from other occupants of the facility. In facilities with multiple FMs
       representing multiple organizations, overall mowing responsibility will be designated to
       the organization owning the largest amount of square footage in the facility.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               19


       10.2.2.5. Provide grounds maintenance in addition to mowing, to include weed control;
       trimming, edging, and watering of grass; and tree/shrub care.
10.3. Area Policing. Policing will be accomplished to the extent the area is cleared of trash,
small surface rocks, waste and any foreign material or debris which might constitute a hazard to
flying operations, interfere with operation of mowers or other maintenance equipment, or present
an unsightly appearance.
   10.3.1. Organizational policing responsibilities are the same as for grounds maintenance (50
   feet from the facility). To assure proper grounds maintenance and policing, Commanders of
   all organizations adjacent to and utilizing parking facilities will be responsible for providing
   personnel to assist in grounds maintenance and policingupon request by the responsible unit.
   10.3.2. Maintaining all areas of the base in a clean condition is everyone's responsibility.
   Commanders must frequently inform their personnel of the provisions of this directive so
   there is no legal lack of knowledge in the prosecution of violations. Unlawful discarding of
   litter is a violation of this directive and will subject violators to judicial or nonjudicial
   punishment. Utilization of recycling program is mandatory.
   10.3.3. Refuse should be discarded only in receptacles identified for this specific purpose.
   Recyclable products must be segregated and placed in appropriate recycling containers.
   Small refuse cans and central collection receptacles, commonly known as "dumpsters," are
   conveniently located throughout the base. Call 78 CES/CEOS to have dumpsters emptied
   when full, although a normal, periodic trash pickup schedule has been established.
   10.3.4. Litter, trash, and other foreign objects such as, but not limited to, paper cups, paper
   containers, bottles, glasses, and beverage containers, will not be thrown, dropped, or
   otherwise deposited upon the streets, sidewalks, or grounds of Robins AFB at any time.
   Place such objects only in authorized refuse or recycling containers provided for this
   purpose.
   10.3.5. Violators of this prohibition are subject to disciplinary action. In the case of
   dependents, violation of this regulation may result in withdrawal of appropriate base facility
   privileges.
   10.3.6. The base Security Forces will monitor acts against littering and, when appropriate,
   submit a DD Form 1569, Incident/Complaint Report.

                                ENERGY CONSERVATION

11.1. General. This section establishes responsibilities and general procedures for the FM to
monitor and actively promote the conservation of electricity, natural gas, water, and other
utilities in the facility.
11.2. Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct). This federal law requires federal agencies to reduce
energy usage by FY2015 to a level 30% below that of FY2003. Some of this reduction will
come from CE applying new technologies within facilities. However, the majority of the
reductions will come from each individual on base actively participating in reducing energy
usage by turning off unused lights, changing temperature settings, closing outside doors propped
open, limited personal appliances in their work space, and so forth.
11.3. FM Responsibilities. Robins AFB will be issuing and revising the ALC energy
conservations policies; each FM will be the lead on meeting the goals. Follow these mandates,
and keep a section in the continuity binders on energy conservation to document actions.

12.1. General. Environmental compliance requirements are covered by several federal laws and
carry serious penalties for violators. The FM is the primary person responsible for ensuring
adequate environmental protection at each facility.
12.2. Specific Guidance.
   12.2.1. Coordinate with Unit Environmental Coordinators (UEC) to ensure compliance with
   federal, state, AF, and base environmental requirements.
   12.2.2. The Natural Resource Management Flight (78 CEG/CEAN) will provide assistance
   and support as requested on specific areas of concern. Contact 78 CEG/CEAN at 468-9645,
   for assistance.
   12.2.3. Provide recycling containers at the facility. Contact 78 CEG/CEAN if additional
   containers are needed.

   13.1.1. Facility occupants shall not work independently of the FM to alter the facility in any
   manner; or move, remove, or alter the arrangement of permanent water, heating, lighting,
   ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing, water coolers, and related fixtures or other installed
   equipment.
   13.1.2. All occupants of the facility will channel CE work requirements through the FM for
   consolidation. This central control will prevent duplicate requests.
   13.1.3. While occupants should route all routine work to the FM, emergencies can and
   should be called in to CE immediately by anyone to DSN 468-5657 (see paragraphs below
   for examples of emergencies).
   13.1.4. The FM will post procedures for reporting emergency work to CE at the phone
   number above on various bulletin boards in the facility; use as examples those emergency
   requirements as cited in paragraphs below.
13.2. Identification of CE Work Requirements. If required or desired work is beyond the
scope of the FM‘s hands-on maintenance duties as described in a chapter above, then a work
request must be forwarded to CE.
   13.2.1. General. It is the FM‘s responsibility to identify and report all known work
   requirements to CE. It is CE‘s responsibility to estimate, plan, program, schedule, and
   accomplish the requested work in a timely manner in accordance with base priorities.
   13.2.2. Government Purchase Card (GPC). Federal law mandates cost thresholds for certain
   types of work that can result in disciplinary action if violated. It is imperative that customers
   coordinate with CE Customer Service (78 CES/CEOIP); located in the front left of building
   1555, prior to accomplishing any construction, maintenance, and/or repair work using the
   GPC. This will ensure Robins does not exceed the cost thresholds stipulated in AFI 32-1032,
   Planning and Programming Real Property Maintenance Projects Using Appropriated Funds
   (APF) and help to ensure that the contractors chosen to accomplish the work are technically
   competent and reliable.
   13.2.3. Contacting CE. Note that descriptions of the different work priorities are detailed in
   other paragraphs below.
      13.2.3.1. Telephone Calls. Emergency and urgent service calls are called in to DSN 468-
      5657.
          13.2.3.1.1. Emergencies should be called in immediately, regardless of time of day.
          The customer service function operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in order to
          receive and act promptly upon emergency needs.
          13.2.3.1.2. Urgent needs should be called in during normal duty hours of 0700-1630.
      13.2.3.2. Written Communication. All work other than emergency and urgent service
      calls should be sent to CE on the E332.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               23


   13.2.4. Effective communication between the FM and customer service personnel is an
   important part of the FM‘s job.
      13.2.4.1. Be sure to enter in the continuity binders the control numbers for each form that
      is submitted to CE.
          13.2.4.1.1. Status on DSW requests will be provided by 78 CES/CEOIP on a return
          e-mail.
          13.2.4.1.2. Status of E332 requests can be obtained from the E332 system or from
          CE‘s                     GeoBase                      system                   at:
          https://rgemwb9002.robins.af.mil/CFQuery/Geobase/SelectBldgReport.cfm?Bld
          g_no.
13.3. Submitting E332 Work Requests to CE.
   13.3.1. The FM will prepare an E332 form available by link through the CE website for
   routine maintenance and repairs, modifications, alterations/renovations, or new work of any
   kind, to buildings, structures, or component equipment systems.
   13.3.2. All requirements for a single facility should be included on a single E332
   submission. This is a very important duty for the FM. Piece-mealing work drives up the
   overall cost, which is a detrimental approach during these times of austere funding for real
   property needs.
   13.3.3. Description of Work. Provide a complete description of work with uploaded
   sketches, plans, diagrams, photographs, specifications, drawings, and any other data or
   information which will provide a clear and concise description of the location and scope of
   the work requested. Include any referenced regulations and/or instructions with the request.
   Note: If there is known lead and/or asbestos present in the area requiring work to be
   performed.
      13.3.3.1. Focus specifically on describing the requirement and its impact on the
      mission, not the solution to the requirement. CE engineers have frequent difficulty
      finding the appropriate solution to a work request because the requirement has not been
      adequately defined. CE solutions may not meet customer needs simply due to
      misunderstandings in the scope of the work as described.
   13.3.4. Justification of Work. In these austere funding times, it is vitally important that the
   FM provide a full justification for the work. Details must be complete and factual and should
   indicate the urgency of the request, and include impact on the organization/mission if the
   work is not accomplished. If the request is a Safety or Fire related issue, please attach a copy
   of the safety or fire write-up. The statement of requirements must be clear and concise so it
   can be fully understood by reviewing and approving authorities not having ready access to
   any reference documentation cited on the form. Clearly justify required or desired date of
   completion.
   13.3.5. Work approval is based solely on the following criteria:
      13.3.5.1. The request is not a duplicate of an existing requirement.
      13.3.5.2. The request does not ask for work strictly prohibited by Air Force instruction,
      regulation, or policy, or other legally binding requirement.
 24                                                ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012


   13.3.6. After approval, the prioritization of the work and the method of work
   accomplishment will vary depending on funds availability, complexity, scope of work, and
   availability of         in-house man-hours. See the attachments for a summary of the
   processing for work requests.
13.4. Methods of Accomplishing Work Requested to CE.
   13.4.1. Direct Scheduled Work (DSW): Accomplished by in-house CE personnel, a DSW is
   a single or multi-craft (more than one technical trade) request which takes less than 50 man-
   hours to complete. Examples include replacing electrical outlets and/or switch covers,
   adjusting door closures, repairing inoperative light fixtures, repairing running or overflowing
   toilets, etc. They are also used for documenting emergency and urgent work. DSWs
   represent the most common type of request FMs will encounter, and are primarily
   accomplished in-house. All DSWs will be initiated by the FM unless it is an emergency.
   13.4.2. Planned Work Orders. Due to forced reductions in CE staff over the last decade, this
   method of accomplishment is seldom ever seen anymore. Also accomplished by in-house
   CE personnel, a planned work order is a single or multi-craft request which takes more than
   50, but less than 240 man-hours to complete. Examples include installation of a new
   electrical panel, installing a drinking fountain, etc.
   13.4.3. Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER). SABER is a
   contractual method for accomplishing work requirements of smaller scale that do not require
   professional design documents. The purpose is to supplement CE‘s in-house ability to
   accomplish non-complex construction, maintenance, and repair projects in a responsive
   manner.
   13.4.4. Other Contract Projects. All other contract projects are for single or multi-craft
   requests that must be designed by professional designers to be accomplished by a contractor.
   Examples include partial or whole-building renovation, construction of new facilities,
   replacing a roof, etc.
13.5. Prioritizing In-House CE Work. There are four priority levels for CE in-house work:
   13.5.1. Priority 1—Emergency DSW: Work required to correct an emergency condition that
   is detrimental to the mission or reduces operational effectiveness and completed (or
   downgraded to Routine) within 24 hours of notification. Emergency work can include, but
   is not limited to:
       13.5.1.1. Utility line breaks.
       13.5.1.2. Power outages or electrical shorts.
       13.5.1.3. Complete loss of heat or cooling systems if the temperature extremes require
       operation during appropriate season.
       13.5.1.4. Facility deficiencies, if not corrected, that will cause further damage, fire, or
       safety hazards which cannot wait until the next duty day.
       13.5.1.5. Other facility deficiencies which would drastically affect the health and welfare
       of personnel (to include environmental compliance violations such as hazardous material
       releases or spills).
       13.5.1.6. Fire or other disaster.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            25


      13.5.1.7. Natural gas leaks.
      13.5.1.8. Dining hall food service equipment malfunction or failure that would result in
      the loss of critical food service functions.
      13.5.1.9. Malfunctioning refrigeration equipment that could result in food spoilage.
      13.5.1.10. Structural damage creating hazards or affecting security compromise.
      13.5.1.11. The elimination of hazards that have been assigned a Risk Assessment Code
      (RAC) of one or a Fire Safety Deficiency Code (FSD Code) I
   13.5.2. Priority 2—Urgent DSW: An Urgent request is not any emergency but requires
   immediate action or attention. The work will be responded to and completed within five
   workdays of receipt or within five workdays after receipt of materials. This includes
   elimination of fire, health, or safety hazards assigned a Safety RAC of two or three, or FSD
   Code II. Urgent requests might include broken windowpanes, faucets/toilets/urinals running
   continuously, missing roof shingles, or inoperative lights within an office.
   13.5.3. Priority 3—Recurring Work Program (RWP): Recurring work applies to Real
   Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) and other types of equipment in all facilities maintained
   by CE. Recurring work consists of operations, recurring maintenance, and service work that
   is scheduled regularly and for which the scope and level of effort remains the same each time
   the work is scheduled. Examples include replacing HVAC filters, changing the oil in motors,
   running emergency generators at least once a month, annually checking grounds for lightning
   protection systems, and so forth. Recurring work keeps warranties in force and extends the
   useful life of critical facilities, equipment, and utilities.
   13.5.4. Priority 4—Routine DSW: A routine request is work that does not qualify as
   emergency or urgent, but must be accomplished within 30 calendar days after identifying the
   requirement or after receipt of material. When practical, routine requirements are grouped
   into work packages and accomplished as a single undertaking. Routine requests might
   include cracked windowpanes, dripping faucets, missing or broken ceiling tiles, or
   inoperative light over 10 feet, etc.
13.6. Prioritizing Contracted CE Work
   13.6.1. General. This is a complex subject that is only summarized in this RAFBI. For a
   more complete description of the policies and procedures, consult AFI 32-1021, Planning
   and Programming Facility Construction Projects.
   13.6.2. Funded Projects.
      13.6.2.1. Funded work is given the highest priority by CE, however, CE highly
      encourages organizations to provide funding for their project needs whenever they can.
      78 CES/CEOIP may contact the requestor to ensure that they do indeed have the amount
      of funds required to accomplish the work by contract. Misrepresenting the facts on
      funding of work requests can result in CE closely examining all future requests from that
      FM and/or organization.
      13.6.2.2. DMAG projects. 402 MXW funds their projects, however, CE works with
      them to establish the priorities for designing their projects and sending them to
      Operational Contracting for bidding and award.
26                                               ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012


     13.6.2.3. Other Unit-Funded Projects.
         13.6.2.3.1. Many of the Host (Associate) units on Robins AFB must fund their
         project work if the work falls into the Minor Construction category, which is usually
         for new construction under $750,000.
         13.6.2.3.2. Other units on Robins AFB may choose to fund maintenance and repair
         projects that are too low in priority to use the limited shared funds from HQ AFMC.
  13.6.3. Unfunded Projects. Unfunded contract work for O&M projects must compete for the
  dwindling funds from HQ AFMC that are shared by a large number of organizations.
  Working the procedures for these projects takes thousands of labor hours every year. For an
  overview of the procedures for prioritizing these unfunded projects, refer to the Policies and
  Standards section of the CE website. Under the 778 CES/CEP programs folder is a briefing
  on Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization Prioritization, which is the method that HQ
  AFMC strictly follows for dispensing their funds.
  13.6.4. Military Construction Program (MILCON) Projects. MILCON projects are for new
  construction usually over $1,500,000 and have their own prioritization method at Robins
  AFB per the WR-ALC Commander‘s policies. They are line-item managed by HQ AFMC
  and validated, ranked, and line-item managed by the Air Staff and, ultimately, Congress.
  Congress reviews MILCON submittals from all services and selects projects for funding in
  the annual federal budgets.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             27


                                            Chapter 14

                                    SELF-HELP PROGRAM

14.1. General. There are many instances where CE cannot accomplish work in the time frame
requested by the individual or organization. In these instances, the requester has the option of
furnishing the labor and/or material funds from the organization's resources.
14.2. Benefits to Organizations.
   14.2.1. Self-help work is an excellent way to do some important ―people projects‖ that,
   when competing with mission requirements, would normally receive a low priority. This is a
   great way to upgrade your work area and not compete for CE man-hours.
   14.2.2. The FM must ensure that unauthorized self-help work is not being performed within
   the building. Personnel assigned to your facility need to be aware that all self-help projects
   must be approved on the E332 before starting any work, regardless of source of materials.
14.3. Self-Help Examples. The following is a list of typical minor maintenance and
construction tasks which may be authorized for accomplishment. The list is not all-inclusive,
since the size and complexity of jobs will depend upon the capability of the individual self-help
donors. Some examples are:
   14.3.1. Replace ceiling tiles.
   14.3.2. Replace clothing hooks.
   14.3.3. Install/replace door hasps.
   14.3.4. Replace doorstops.
   14.3.5. Repair small holes in drywall.
   14.3.6. Replace/install door stripping and window/door insulation.
   14.3.7. Replace door hinges and screws.
   14.3.8. Replace door closures.
   14.3.9. Replace broken door hinges.
   14.3.10. Replace towel racks.
   14.3.11. Replace toilet paper holders.
   14.3.12. Perform minor rust prevention and treatment.
   14.3.13. Replace faucet washers if cut-off valves are available.
   14.3.14. Replace faucets (swap with old parts, if available).
   14.3.15. Replace commode seats.
   14.3.16. Do touch-up painting.
   14.3.17. Replace broken floor tiles (after area has been cleared of asbestos containing
   materials).
   14.3.18. Replace 110V receptacle covers.
 28                                               ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012


   14.3.19. Replace 110V switch covers.
   14.3.20. As a general rule, no self-help electrical work (wiring, installation of panels and
   outlets, etc.) will be allowed. Personnel will not be authorized to perform maintenance on
   equipment items such as furnaces, boilers, air conditioning system, exterior electrical
   systems, or other utilities, such as gas, fuel, water, and sewer lines.
14.4. Requesting Approval.
   14.4.1. Self-help work must be requested through the E332 system the same as for any other
   work request, except that the donated resources section of the form will be marked.
   14.4.2. By its very definition, self-help work should require little to no CE in-house labor
   support. Hence, all self help work requests requiring more than 50 man-hours of CE in-
   house labor will be disapproved for self-help action and returned to the FM for prioritization
   in the planned work order or contract project program.
14.5. Considerations for Approval. In deciding whether or not to approve the self-help
request, the Work Request Review Board (WRRB) will consider:
   14.5.1. Whether the requester has the technical capability and resources available to do the
   job.
   14.5.2. What Base Civil Engineer (BCE) support will be required if the requester has limited
   capability.
   14.5.3. Whether or not it would be economical for the requester to donate the necessary
   labor and materials for accomplishment under CE supervision. Self-help work may not
   always be cost effective. The CE is ultimately responsible for work on real property and
   consequently may have to correct deficiencies created by self-help work. Therefore,
   materials furnished by the requester must meet Air Force standards of quality and be
   approved by CE.
14.6. Material Support. The Self-Help Supply is managed by the Material Control Section
in78 CES and provides support for minor maintenance not requiring cutting or drilling.
   14.6.1. Building Managers may procure such items as light bulbs and floor tile or other non-
   construction materials at this activity.
   14.6.2. Only FMs are authorized to obtain minor maintenance items over the counter from
   Self-Help Supply
14.7. CE Inspections.
   14.7.1. CE will conduct weekly inspections and a final inspection.
   14.7.2. All CE furnished excess material will be returned to the Material Control Section in
   78 CES.
14.8. Communications Support. Work requests requiring communications support (such as to
install, remove, replace, and repair of telephone circuits or communications cables) requires
approval by 78 ABW/SC.
   14.8.1. Approval is obtained through submission of AF Form 3215, Communications-
   Computer Systems Requirement Document.
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                    29


  14.8.2. The requester must contact the 78th Communications Squadron 30 days in advance
  for any self-help work requiring relocation of communications equipment.
 30                                                  ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012


                                            Chapter 15

                               MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

15.1. Signs – Interior and Exterior. The FM is responsible as the coordinator and requester
for changes to the exterior and interior signage. FMs and building occupants are encouraged to
take pride in their facility by adhering to facility excellence standards, particularly the posting of
interior and exterior signs.
   15.1.1. Taping temporary signs on doors, walls, or windows is prohibited. Consider use of
   stanchions and or frames for temporary signs (such as FPCON conditions).
   15.1.2. Exterior signs must adhere to Robins Air Force Base Facility Standards.
   15.1.3. Condense and consolidate information to minimize the number of signs by using
   designated bulletin boards or other central information centers.
15.2. Non-Fair Wear and Tear of Air Force Real Property. Non-fair wear and tear of Air
Force Real Property will not be tolerated. Non-fair wear and tear can be defined as any willful
damage to a facility or any of its components.
   15.2.1. The FM, in cooperation with all facility occupants, has the primary responsibility to
   prevent facility abuse. Any damage should be reported immediately to the 78 CES/CEOIP.
   Unreported damage to Air Force Real Property clearly indicates that the FM is not
   conducting periodic inspections.
   15.2.2. 78 CES/CEOIP will initiate a repair work order and forward it to the appropriate
   craft for estimate/repairs. In some cases immediate repairs, as opposed to an estimate, may
   be required in order to maintain the integrity of the facility or maintain security, safety,
   and/or fire protection systems.
   15.2.3. 78 CES/CEOIP will initiate a Facility Abuse Letter (Attachment 10) and forward to
   the appropriate unit commander to investigate to determine if liability can be affixed and
   reimbursement for damages is made to the USAF.
   15.2.4. If this damage was the result of misconduct and liability has been affixed, submit a
   work request into the E332 system, so that CE may prepare the required work order to gain
   reimbursement from the individual(s) concerned.
       15.2.4.1. Upon completion of the repair action, 78 CES/CEOIP will submit cost
       breakdowns to the CE Resource Advisor.
       15.2.4.2. The budget office will be notified for the transfer of the using organizations
       O&M funds to the RC/CC and EEIC provided by the CE Financial Section.
       15.2.4.3. If requested for pecuniary liability assessment, an Interim Work Information
       Management System Cost Report can be obtained from 78 CES/CEOIP.
15.3. Portable Space Heaters. Unrestricted use of portable space heaters is not permitted due
to safety, energy conservation and electrical circuit capacity concerns. Their use directly
counters the energy savings we plan to achieve. The BCE may grant waivers to accommodate
documented and validated special medical circumstances. In cases where a facility's heating
ROBINSAFBI32-9008 8 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               31


system is going to be inoperative for an extended period of time (greater than five days), FMs
may request approval to use space heaters until the heating system is fixed.
   15.3.1. All requests to utilize portable space heaters must be submitted to the 778
   CES/CEOIP thru the E332 system. 78 CES/CEOIP will ensure all applicable agencies
   coordinate on the request to address any fire, safety, electrical, and Heating, Ventilation, and
   Air Conditioning concerns.
   15.3.2. Individuals with a special medical circumstance must provide documentation from
   their doctor stating the need for the use of a portable space heater and specifying a
   temperature range for the individual. The FM will submit the request, along with the
   documentation from their doctor, for the use of a portable space heater to 78 CES/CEOIP on
   behalf of the individual/supervisor.
   15.3.3. All space heaters must be Underwriters Laboratory (UL) listed or Factory Mutual
   (FM) approved. Units must have a built-in tilt switch and a screen over the heating elements.
   All space heaters must have an electrical rating of 110 or 120 volts with no more than 550
   watts electrical heat rating, be kept at least 36 inches away from combustible materials, and
   will not be left unattended. Do not plug the portable space heater into an extension cord or
   multi-outlet strip. Safe and proper use of space heaters will be the responsibility of the user
   and the FM.

                                 WHERE CE FUNDS GO

A9.1. Most funded amounts remain constant year by year, such as for service contracts and
utilities.
A9.2. The major changes are in the amount of SRMC and Supplies funds from one year to the
next, which dramatically affects CE‘s ability to support the base population‘s facility needs.
A9.3. Supplies funding goes mostly for materials the CE Shops use to maintain and repair
systems in the buildings.
A9.4. SRMC funds go to construction contracts for infrastructure (central plants, roads, and
utility lines) as well as building maintenance and repair.
A9.5. DMAG funds for MXW facilities are handled separately.

 TIME CALCULATION GUIDE FOR PERFORMING FACILITY MANAGER DUTIES

A11.1. Many Commanders/Leaders and FMs have asked for a guide to estimating the time
requirements to do FM duties. There are many variables, so this is very hard to nail down for
any particular building or organization. Nevertheless, we understand that this is a critical need,
and so we offer the following very rough estimating guide.
   A11.1.1. Basic Time. Just being called an FM requires annual training, daily inspections,
   record keeping, sign posting, and so forth.
   A11.1.2. Size of Building. Using Bldg 255 (86,000 SF) as an example of a mixed usage
   facility, we estimated the amount of time required to support a 100,000 SF building.
   A11.1.3. Adjustment Factors. A brand new building will require more time than a building
   3-9 years old requires. A building over 25 years old requires much more time than a building
   10-25 years old. Occupancy level and type of organization also affect the estimates.
   A11.1.4. Personnel have miscellaneous training, meetings, and activities outside of their
   normal duties. Also, leave and holidays reduce the time available. Therefore, our
   calculations are based upon a person‘s available time for a year being around 1,500 hours.

            3 – 9 Years                   0.7
           10 – 25 Years                  1.0
A11.2. Other Adjustments
   A11.2.1. Adjust upward by size if a higher percentage of space is admin.
   A11.2.2. Adjust downward for mostly warehouse space.
   A11.2.3. Multiply by 1.3 for most DMAG facilities. They have changing requirements more
   frequently.
A11.3. Example
   A11.3.1. Ms Johnson is Primary FM for a mixed usage building of 30 years of age that is

   A11.3.2. Her starting estimate is 400 (basic) + 600 (50% of 100K SF amount) = 1,000 hours.
   A11.3.3. Adjusting for age gives 1,300 hours.
   A11.3.4. Adjusting for DMAG usage gives 1,690 hours, which is more than the full-time
   level of 1,500 hours/year.
   A11.3.5. She needs to be full-time to do the FM duties correctly, and she will need some
   help from at least one Alternate FM.
   A11.3.6. The Alternate FM time initial estimate is (100 + 150) x 1.3 x 1.3 = 422.
   A11.3.7. Add Ms Johnson‘s overage of 190 hours, and the total estimate for the Alternate
   FM is 612 hours, or 40% of full-time.
NOTE: Remember that these are very rough estimates only. They are provided to help our
customers get a ―feel‖ for the time commitments required to run a good facility management
program.
