1. Capabilities-Based Operational Requirements Process Overview. This section identifies
key AFGSC processes supporting warfighter capability needs (requirements) fulfillment.
     1.1. This instruction provides AFGSC and NDO CFLI guidance on development and
     validation of capabilities-based operational requirements within the context of Department of
     Defense (DoD) and AF processes. Capabilities-based requirements must be developed in
     unison with concept development, strategic planning, integrated program planning, and
     acquisition, as well as programming, budgeting and execution functions. The JCIDS,
     Defense Acquisition System (DAS), and Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution
     (PPBE) processes form the principal DoD decision support processes for transforming the
     military forces in support of the National Military Strategy and the National Defense
     Strategy. See Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3170.01, Joint
     Capabilities Integration and Development System and Manual for the Operation of the Joint
AFGSCI10-103 6 JULY 2012                                                                    3


  Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS Manual) for detailed information
  on requirements generation and disposition.
  1.2. AF Capabilities-Based Planning. Within the Air Force, capabilities-based planning is
  described in AFI 10-604, Capabilities-Based Planning, and is rooted in the Air Force
  Concepts of Operation (CONOPS). Capability requirements relative to the Air Force
  CONOPS are identified and prioritized. As a result of the assessment, Headquarters Air
  Force (HAF) will designate a major command as the Lead Command for addressing the
  capability requirement. Capability requirements may be the result of a wide variety of non-
  exclusive conditions such as degradation of an existing system or emergence of a new threat.
  1.3. Concept Development. AFGSC develops operating, functional, and enabling concepts
  for new capabilities in accordance with AFI 10-2801, Air Force Concept of Operations
  Development and AFGSCI 10-281, Concept Development. The enabling concept fulfills the
  requirement for a ―System Level CONOPS.‖ The coordination and approval process for
  enabling concepts is further delineated in AFGSCI 10-281.
  1.4. Architecture Development. CJCSI 3170.01G and CJCSI 6212.01E, Interoperability
  and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security Systems, require
  validation of certified architecture views as part of ICDs, CDDs and CPDs. These products
  are used to assess compliance for net-readiness and interoperability. All AFGSC, NDO
  Service Core Function (SCF), and Air Force Nuclear Command and Control System
  (AFNCCS) architecture products are developed in accordance with the DoD Architecture
  Framework (DoDAF) and certified using the processes identified in AFI 33-401, Air Force
  Architecting.
  1.5. Defense Acquisition System and Capabilities Based Acquisitions. The DAS
  provides the means by which the DoD transforms documented warfighter requirements into
  new or improved weapon systems. Acquisition activities for the AF are conducted by the
  various product centers (e.g. Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Air Armament Center
  (AAC), and Nuclear Weapons Center (NWC)). For additional information regarding AFGSC
  acquisitions activities, reference AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
  Management, Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5000.1, The Defense Acquisition
  System, and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.2, Operation of the Defense
  Acquisition System,
  1.6. Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution (PPBE) System. The PPBE system
  provides the mechanism by which AFGSC justifies funding to pursue materiel and non-
  materiel solutions to AFGSC/CC-prioritized capability requirements. Funding must be
  planned well in advance of program initiation and is dependent upon research and
  development, procurement, operations, and maintenance requirements for new or modified
  capabilities.
  1.7. Information & Resource Support System (IRSS). An electronic staffing and
  repository tool residing on the Air Force SIPRNET Portal. IRSS allows Air Force
  requirements personnel to develop, coordinate, and track capability requirements documents
  (e.g., ICDs, CDDs, and CPDs). All Air Force-sponsored operational capability requirements
  documents and Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) results (up to SECRET) are posted in IRSS.
  Note: The AFGSC point of contact for IRSS is AFGSC/A5PP, AFGSC.A5PP@us.af.mil,
  AFGSC.A5PP@barskdale.af.smil.mil.

        2.7.3. Appointed as System DAA for NC3 Systems, IAW 33-210, Air Force
        Certification and Accreditation Program.
        2.7.4. Ensures IA is incorporated into program solutions.
     2.7.5. Chairs AFGSC, NDO and AF NCCS Architecture Review Boards in accordance with
     AFI33-401, Air Force Architecting.
     2.8. Directorate of Financial Management and Comptroller (AFGSC/FM): Validates
     AoA cost data for requirements analyses.
3. AFGSC Requirements Development. When AFGSC is assigned as the lead command for a
capability requirement, it becomes responsible for the development and documentation of that
requirement. AFGSC/DA5/8 will appoint a RL to execute this responsibility
     3.1. Integrated Concept Team (ICT). When tasked to pursue a capability solution, the RL
     forms and leads an ICT to develop the requirements and associated documents for the
     capability solution.
        3.1.1. The ICT is normally an action officer-level working group and consists of
        members from each interested directorate.          Additionally, other stakeholders,
        representatives from the appropriate systems wing, the PEM, High Performance Team
        (HPT) members, Operational Test Agency/Organization, and members from other
        interested services may be included in the ICT.
        3.1.2. The RL will coordinate with the requirements process manager to present the draft
        requirements to HAF. The process manager, will forward the associated documents to
        HAF and schedule a Requirements Strategy Review (RSR). Once HAF approves the
        requirements, they will schedule an HPT to draft the appropriate requirements document.
        3.1.3. Once the HPT has drafted the appropriate requirements document, it must be
        submitted for coordination. All interested AFGSC organizations should have the
        opportunity to review the draft requirements document. Additionally, the RL will
        coordinate with the requirements process manager to conduct external coordination
        through IRSS and Knowledge Management/Decision support (KM/DS), as required.
     3.2. HQ AFGSC Requirements Oversight Council (GSROC). The GSROC is the forum
     utilized by AFGSC to present requirements documents and associated briefings for command
     endorsement. Unless waived by the endorsing authority, all requirements documents must be
AFGSCI10-103 6 JULY 2012                                                                     9


  reviewed at the GSROC prior to presentation at the Air Force Requirements Oversight
  Council (AFROC) and Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). AFGSC/A5PP is the
  point of contact for review of requirement documents prior to GSROC submission.
     3.2.1. To ensure requirements documents are properly endorsed, a strict timeline must be
     followed in order to meet the AFROC. The AFROC date and associated items due dates
     are formally established. The AFGSC requirements process manager will request
     GSROC topics the first business day following the previous AFROC. AFGSC RLs must
     provide topics to the requestor within 2 weeks of the request and submit documents for
     initial review within 3 weeks of the request. To ensure Division-level endorsement of
     AFGSC requirements initiatives submitted for Headquarters Air Force review or
     approval (e.g. Requirements Strategy Review, High Performance Team briefing slides,
     AFROC submissions, etc.), AFGSC RLs will submit an accompanying endorsement
     memorandum or e-mail. The format is provided at Attachment three. The requirements
     process manager schedules the GSROC and ensures topics are reviewed and endorsed
     prior to AF/A5RP’s AFROC items due date. RLs should anticipate briefing the GSROC
     at least one month prior to a regularly scheduled AFROC. Applicable requirements
     templates and suspense dates are located on AF/A5RP’s Air Force Portal site:
     https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
     af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC1352150FB5E044080020E329A9
     .
     3.2.2. The GSROC will assess the effectiveness of the capability solution related to the
     capability requirement. Additionally, the GSROC will consider technical feasibility and
     fiscal feasibility of each capability solution prior to providing command endorsement.
     3.2.3. Special sessions of the GSROC will be scheduled, as necessary, to accommodate
     special access programs and out-of-cycle requirements documents endorsement.
     3.2.4. AFGSC/A5/8 will provide MAJCOM endorsement of potential ACAT III
     requirements documents and recommend MAJCOM endorsement of ACAT I and II
     requirements documents to AFGSC/CC and AFGSC/CV, respectively. See Attachment
     four for sample endorsement memorandum formats.
     3.2.5. AFGSC/A5PP will facilitate staffing of requirements documents to obtain
     MAJCOM endorsement; however, as the subject matter experts it is the responsibility of
     AFGSC/A5B, AFGSC/A5I, AFGSC/A5Z, as applicable, to staff the package for AFGSC
     CC, CV, A 5/8 signature (dependent on the Acquisition Category). AFGSC/A5PP will
     submit all completed documents to HAF, via IRSS, prior to the AFROC. See Attachment
     five for an illustration showing the document approval process.
  3.3. AFGSC Initial Requirement Documents. AFGSC requirement documents that
  address form, fit, or function of existing capabilities, and do not require submission to the
  JCIDS process will be submitted to AFGSC/A5PP for review and standardization. See
  Attachment 6 for an outline of the AFGSC Initial Requirement Document.
  3.4. Changes to Requirements. Changes affecting previously validated KPPs or mandatory
  KSAs must follow the coordination/approval procedures in AFI 10-601. When a change is
  identified, regardless of the level of requirement (KPP, KSA or attribute), the RL will
  coordinate the proposed capability-based requirements changes, to include funding
 10                                                            AFGSCI10-103 6 JULY 2012


   considerations, with all affected stakeholders. The RL will coordinate all changes to
   determine if they will affect the acquisition program baseline. Changes to KPPs and
   mandatory KSAs must be submitted for GSROC approval. Depending on the program’s
   Acquisition Category, the change may require command-level endorsement by
   AFGSC/A5/8, AFGSC/CV, or AFGSC/CC and submission for AFROC approval.
   3.5. Immediate Warfighter Needs. Immediate Warfighter Needs (IWN) are identified
   through the Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON) process to prevent mission failure or
   loss of life. When an IWN is identified for AF resolution, it is handled in accordance with
   AFI 63-114, Quick Reaction Capability Process. The goal is to provide capability to the
   operator within 60 days of the validated need. The Requirements Process Manager will
   facilitate coordination and validation of Urgent Operational Need (UON) and JUON
   affecting strategic operations from COCOMs. Reference AFI 10-601 for more information
   on UONs/JUONs.
4. Processing Requirements Documents. AF/A5R is the primary higher headquarters interface
for development and approval of AFGSC, NDO SCF, and AF NCCS operational requirements
through the AFROC. AF/A5RP (Requirements Policy) also provides the subject matter expertise
to assist with document development. AF/A5RP’s AF Portal site contains the most recent
information on implementation of the capabilities-based requirements process within the Air
Force. The requirements process manager will coordinate with AF/A5RP to provide facilitators
and a forum for the HPT and to finalize drafts for external (AF/Joint) coordination.
