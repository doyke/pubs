                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume provides guidelines and restrictions for DSOs who operate onboard
AFSOC aircraft. It is an original source document for many areas, but AFSOC mission-specific
areas will remain in their applicable AFI 11-2 Mission Design Series (MDS), Vol 3. DSOs will
be familiar with applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, for aircraft in which they hold qualification. If
conflicting DSO guidance is given in aircraft tactics manuals or handbooks, this volume takes
precedence. It is written for normal and contingency operations to reduce procedural changes at
the onset of contingencies. All DSO operations shall be conducted in accordance with United
States (US) domestic law and international law, to include the law of armed conflict. Training
procedures are included. HQ AFSOC/A3V has overall responsibility for the administration of
this volume. In the absence of clear defining guidance in this instruction, see applicable
AFI 112MDS Volumes. (T-2)
1.2. Applicability. This instruction is applicable to DSO operations. References to units,
personnel, and aircraft in this annex include all gained forces unless specifically exempted by
this instruction.
1.3. Terms Explained.
     1.3.1. “Will,” and “Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. “Should" indicates a recommended procedure.
     1.3.3. “May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. “WARNING” Operating procedures, techniques, etc., which will result in personal
     injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
     1.3.5. “CAUTION” Operating procedures, techniques, etc., which will result in damage to
     equipment if not carefully followed.
     1.3.6. “Note” Operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are essential to emphasize.
     1.3.7. See Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information, for additional
     terms, definitions, and references.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this instruction,
except when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety. Report deviations,
without waiver, through channels to HQ AFSOC/A3 within 24 hours, followed by a written
report.
     1.4.1. Although this instruction provides guidance for DSO operations under most
     circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect the
     crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and immediate action is
     required, the Pilot in Command (PIC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the course
     of action to be taken. Report all deviations or exceptions to this instruction without a waiver
     through channels to HQ AFSOC/A3.
     1.4.2. Unless otherwise indicated, HQ AFSOC/A3 is the waiver authority for operational
     procedure requirements contained in this instruction. HQ AFSOC/A3 may delegate this
AFSOCI11-2DSOV3 12 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  5


   authority to the Commander Special Operations Air Forces (COMAFSOF) for operationally
   assigned Special Operations Forces. Request waivers to this instruction through proper
   command and control channels.
   1.4.3. Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk.
       1.4.3.1. “Tier 0” (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority.
       1.4.3.2. “Tier 1” (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       may put airman, mission, or program strongly at risk, and may only be waived by the
       major command (MAJCOM)/commander (CC) or delegate with concurrence of
       publication approver. When multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate.
       1.4.3.3. “Tier 2” (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put
       the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be
       waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.
       1.4.3.4. “Tier 3” (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance
       has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower

 6                                                  AFSOCI11-2DSOV3 12 DECEMBER 2013


                                            Chapter 2

                              COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

2.1. General. The AFSOC C2 system is based on the principles of centralized monitoring and
decentralized control and execution. The result is a C2 mechanism which keeps the AFSOC/CC
informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while enabling the Wing (Wg), Group (Gp), or
Squadron (Sq) Commander (CC) to exercise control over the day-to-day operations. Defining
guidance for DSO employment is outlined in the HQ AFSOC/AF Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
2.2. Administrative Control (ADCON). The AF ISR Agency exercises ADCON of 361 ISRG
personnel.
2.3. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is the air component to the United States Special
Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM may delegate OPCON of all Air Force Special
Operations Forces (AFSOF) aircraft assigned or allocated to USSOCOM. In circumstances
where OPCON of AFSOF aircraft has been provided to the Theater Special Operations
Commands (TSOC) within a Geographic Combatant Command for theater-based assets, AFSOC
is typically designated as the controlling agency for such assets and assigned aircrew.
Exception: In practice, responsibility for planning and executing AFSOC missions is routinely
delegated to the Wg/CC or Gp/CC. The Wg/CC or Gp/CC, in turn, exercises control of non-
close-hold missions through the command post supporting the wing or group. In the event that
assigned forces undergo a change in operational control, responsibility for mission monitoring
passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command. Changeover will be
accomplished in accordance with the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational Order, Deployment
Order, or Execution Order. Note: For certain close-hold activities, security considerations may
compel the Wg/CC or Gp/CC to shift mission monitoring responsibilities from the command
post to another wing, group, or theater agency. The Wg/CC or Gp/CC will ensure procedures are
established for the responsible agency to monitor mission progress and advise the HQ
AFSOC/A3 or AFSOC/CC as appropriate. For mission monitoring guidance, adhere to
applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3. (T-2)
2.4. SILENT SHIELD. SILENT SHIELD is a capability that includes a specially trained
aircrew member and specifically designed equipment to provide threat warning, enhances SA,
and target cueing to special operation forces (SOF) (see applicable AFTTP 3-1 for expanded
DSO equipment information). When deployed, SILENT SHIELD refers to a team that may
include a mission commander (MC), Team Chief (TC), DSO, Direct Support Analysts (DSA),
computer support and maintenance personnel, as well as all associated mission and mission
support equipment. The size and composition of the team primarily depends on the mission
type, number of aircraft supported, deployment length, and available DSO personnel.
Coordinate DSO support as soon as possible in the pre-deployment planning process to ensure
personnel and equipment are available. This lead-in time also will allow the DSAs to provide
quality intelligence data to the DSOs. Deployment of the DSO and mission equipment with the
mission aircraft (organic) is preferred especially if the forward operating base (FOB) is in or near
a high threat area. This will preclude the possibility of lost support due to airlift delays.
     2.4.1. SILENT SHIELD Personnel.
AFSOCI11-2DSOV3 12 DECEMBER 2013                                                              7


     2.4.1.1. Mission Commander. The MC is normally an officer or Senior Non-
     Commissioned Officer (SNCO) who acts as a liaison to AFSOC flying units and
     administrative point of contact (POC) during the deployment. The MC is an advisor to
     the deployed commanders and is subordinate to the deployed operations officer (DO/A-
     3/J-3 as appropriate).
     2.4.1.2. Team Chief. The TC is a senior DSO, SNCO preferred, who exercises
     supervision of the SILENT SHIELD team and mission. The TC is the operational POC
     for the deployment and is considered the SILENT SHIELD subject matter expert. The
     TC acts as the senior mission planner and may also fly as a DSO.
     2.4.1.3. DSO. The DSO performs the mission as defined in applicable AFTTP 3-1.
     2.4.1.4. Direct Support Analyst. Specially trained DSAs deploy with the DSOs. The
     DSAs are specially trained analysts who are experienced in Signals Intelligence
     (SIGINT) analysis and its application to SOF missions. These analysts provide vital
     technical information to the DSOs as part of mission planning. Additionally, DSAs
     perform mission monitoring and may pass pertinent technical or threat data to the DSO
     in-flight via secure communications. DSAs produce technical reports based on DSO-
     specific debrief items. These reports are separate from normal mission report (MISREP)
     production.
     2.4.1.5. Computer Support Personnel. SILENT SHIELD computer support personnel
     maintain and repair all mission and mission support computers.
     2.4.1.6. Maintenance Personnel. SILENT SHIELD maintenance personnel are trained in
     all aspects of SILENT SHIELD equipment hardware and software. They can perform all
     levels of maintenance short of depot level. Maintenance personnel also provide logistic
     support for mission equipment to the team.
2.5. Pilot in Command Responsibility and Authority. AF Form 4327A, Crew Flight
Authorization, designates a PIC for all flights. The PIC is:
  2.5.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
  2.5.2. Responsible for the welfare of their crew, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
  passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
  2.5.3. Vested with the authority necessary to manage the crew and accomplish the mission.
  2.5.4. The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to a
  higher authority.
  2.5.5. The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting the crew or mission.
  2.5.6. Charged with keeping the applicable commander informed of mission progress and
  difficulties.
  2.5.7. Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a MC.

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for operations with certain degraded equipment.
If the aircraft commander elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems,
coordinate mission requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance
requirements, etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not
adversely impact follow-on missions.
4.2. Responsibility. The final responsibility regarding required equipment for a mission rests
with the aircraft commander. If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to conduct a mission
or mission segment with a degraded or inoperative item or system, this acceptance does not
commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations
with the same item or system inoperative. When the aircraft commander considers an item
essential, designate the component mission essential (ME) on the Air Force Technical Order
(AFTO) Form 781A, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, and the item will be repaired or
replaced prior to departure. (T-2)
   4.2.1. The DSO will inform the aircraft commander of degraded DSO equipment prior to
   crew check-in. (T-2) After crew check-in, when aircraft operations allow, the DSO will
   inform the aircraft commander or designated crew member in a timely manner of any
   changes in mission systems. (T-2)

operations while operating onboard AFSOC aircraft. In addition to the guidance outlined below
refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and the 11-2MDS, Vol 3, General Operating Procedures, chapter for
MDS-specific guidance.
5.2. Checklists/In-Flight Guides. Accomplish all checklists/in-flight guides, as required, with
strict discipline. A checklist/in-flight guide is not complete until all items have been
accomplished.
   5.2.1. Direct Support Operators will use the HQ AFSOC/A3V approved checklist/in-flight
   guide for their duty position when conducting ground or flight operations. (T-2)
   5.2.2. Direct Support Operators may use approved checklist/in-flight guides modified with
   notes, amplifying procedures, and limits provided the checklist/in-flight guides and notes are
   current. Currency of notes is the crew member’s responsibility.

                          GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

6.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for DSO employment on AFSOC aircraft. In
addition to the duties listed in applicable technical orders (TO), directives, and this instruction,
the PIC may assign other duties as necessary. The DSO is primarily responsible for providing
inputs to enhance aircrew situational awareness. In addition to the guidance outlined below refer
to the 11-2MDS, Vol 3, General Operating Procedures, chapter for MDS-specific guidance.
6.2. Mission Planning Factors.
   6.2.1. Mission Planning. Detailed information on mission planning can be found in this
   instruction, AFTTP 3-1, Vol 1 (S), General Planning and Employment Considerations,
   AFTTP 3-1, Vol 2 (S), Threat Reference Guide and Countertactics, and MDS specific
   AFTTP 3-1 (S) and AFTTP 3-3 (U) volumes.
   6.2.2. The DSO, after coordinating with appropriate entities will conduct mission planning
   with the aircrew. The DSO will brief expected scenario inputs based on the analytical data,
   as required. (T-2)
   6.2.3. The DSO is responsible for coordinating with all appropriate agencies to obtain all
   required or anticipated mission planning, professional, and SILENT SHIELD equipment for
   the duration of the flight/deployment. The DSO will ensure all equipment is inventoried and
   inspected prior to flight/deployment. (T-2)
6.3. Preflight/In-Flight Responsibilities. The DSO will: (T-2)
   6.3.1. Brief the crew on SILENT SHIELD equipment configuration and anticipated inputs.
   6.3.2. Ensure the crew is aware of SILENT SHIELD capabilities and limitations, OPSEC
   considerations, and emergency destruction procedures.
   6.3.3. Monitor situational awareness information and relay pertinent information to the crew.
   6.3.4. Advise the crew of any change in the status of mission equipment.
   6.3.5. The DSO is responsible for knowing approximate aircraft location, altitude, and
   intentions at all times.
6.4. Communications Procedures. When missions require the DSO to communicate, they will
obtain proper frequencies, time hack, schedules, call signs, and communications security
(COMSEC) material prior to flight. Depending on the nature of the mission and the
communications, the DSO will keep the crew updated on any pertinent information and will
coordinate with the PIC for authorization to transmit. Any DSO-related COMSEC equipment
loaded during the course of the mission will be zeroized at the end of the mission. (T-2)
   6.4.1. On all AFSOC aircraft, the DSO will coordinate with the crew during mission
   planning regarding interphone connectivity. (T-2)
6.5. Post Mission. In addition to appropriate debriefs, the DSO will also ensure: (T-2)
   6.5.1. Equipment write-ups are passed on to SILENT SHIELD maintenance.

Terms
Command and Control—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command
and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Exercise—A military maneuver or simulated wartime operation involving planning, preparation,
and execution. It is carried out for the purpose of training or evaluation. It may be combined,
joint, or single-service, depending on participating organizations.
Forward Operating Base (FOB)—An airfield without full support facilities used during
mission operations for an undetermined and sometimes extended period of time.
Interfly—Intermixing of crew members from different units in the same aircrew or unit aircrews
flying aircraft assigned to another unit.
Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)—Individuals who perform essential duties in support of a
particular aircraft, aircrew, or mission.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control
may be delegated and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component
commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary
to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include
