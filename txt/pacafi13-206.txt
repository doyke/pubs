This instruction is implemented by AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Air Space, Airfield, and Range Man-
agement. It establishes procedures for the effective utilization of PACAF operational support airlift (OSA)
aircraft, which includes C-12, C-21, UH-1N, and C-135 aircraft. It is directive for all units performing the
PACAF OSA mission and for organizations requesting airlift by PACAF OSA aircraft. This publication
does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) or US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) units and members.
The reporting requirement in this directive (Chapter 6, paragraph 6.2.4.) is exempt from licensing in
accordance with paragraphs 2.11.10 and 2.11.12 of AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports
Management Program: Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Numerous changes and revisions were incorporated in this edition. The most significant changes involved
the re-alignment of 5AF OSA validation responsibilities from the 605 AOS/DOO to the 605 ASUS/LGT.
Of the original 16 chapters, chapters 5, 6, 8, and 13 were consolidated into one, chapter 7 was made into
an attachment, and chapter 12 was incorporated into chapter 4. All references to outdated contact num-
bers, charts, tables, procedures, regulations, etc. were updated and the PACAF Form 292, Operational
Support Airlift (OSA) MILAIR Request was simplified into a one page format.

             PACIFIC AIR FORCES (PACAF) RESPONSIBILITIES AND POLICIES

3.1. Own, operate and maintain OSA aircraft in accordance with applicable directives. (C-12, C-21 and
UH-1N are maintained through CLS).

3.2. Exercise operational control of all OSA aircraft assigned within PACAF. OPCON for UH-1Ns are
delegated to 605 AOS/CC.

3.3. Provide training and standardization/evaluation oversight for all assigned or attached aircrew mem-
bers flying PACAF owned OSA aircraft.

3.4. Monitor pilot manning for UH-1N/C-12/C-21/C-135 aircraft assigned to fly the PACAF OSA mis-
sion. HQ PACAF/DPAOR and HQ PACAF/DOTT will ensure all crewmembers have the appropriate
training accomplished prior to the individual’s report date.

3.5. Support C-12/C-21 airlift requests on a cost-effective basis considering mission requirements and
the priority/urgency of the airlift request.
   3.5.1. Determination of mission requirements will be made using the Priority, Urgency, Justification
   and Category (PUJC) codes specified in DoDD 4500.43. (See Attachment 1) Rank, grade, or position
   by itself, does not justify airlift support.

3.6. Air and ground transportation resources within Korea will be used if possible, before positioning an
aircraft based out of country into Korea solely for in country movement. C-21 missions will not be posi-
tioned in Korea to accomplish passenger movement solely between airfields in Korea unless:
   3.6.1. Specifically directed by NAF/CC or HQ PACAF/DO or higher.
   3.6.2. Support can be combined with other missions originating/terminating outside of Korea.

3.7. Delegate C-12/C-21 tasking authority (except for local training, aircrew evaluations, and functional
check flights) to the appropriate NAF for aircraft based in its area of responsibility. HQ PACAF will retain
authority, however, to direct mission taskings in support of PACAF requirements. Requests will be
approved by NAF/CC or HQ PACAF/DO with the following exceptions:
   3.7.1. Acting NAF/CC and acting HQ PACAF/DO may act as approving authority.
   3.7.2. AOG/CC may act as approval authority for emergency airlift.
   3.7.3. NAF/CC may delegate approval authority to NAF/DO or NAF/LG (or equivalent) for those
   flights, which are non-controversial and routine in nature. If delegated, this approval authority will be
   specified by supplement. HQ PACAF/DO delegates approval authority for non-controversial, routine
   flights to HQ PACAF AMOCC.
   3.7.4. The Operations Group Commander or Unit Commander, as determined by the Operations
   Group Commander, will exercise control of training missions and functional check flights.

3.8. PACAF agencies responsible for contingencies and wartime mobility deployment plans may include
OSA aircraft in applicable plans. Plans will be coordinated through HQ PACAF/DOTT. Notify the appro-
priate NAF, Wing, and flying unit of plans impacting OSA operations.

3.9. Each NAF/CC with OSA C-12/C-21/UH-1N aircraft will designate an operational support airlift
management office validator.
    3.9.1. OSA MILAIR requests by PACAF agencies and personnel traveling within a specific or greater
    part of one NAF AOR will be forwarded to that NAF Validator for review and approval.
       3.9.1.1. Exceptions:
           3.9.1.1.1. Requests by Senior PACAF Officials (0-7 and above or civilian equivalents) require
           PACAF/CV approval. All such requests will be forwarded to HQ PACAF AMOCC Validator
           for review and approval coordination.
           3.9.1.1.2. Requests by dual hatted PACAF personnel traveling on joint business and by
           Non-PACAF Senior officials should be requested through CINCPAC/J43 (DSN 477-1502/
           6671) for validation and component sourcing.
           3.9.1.1.3. Requests within 13 AF AOR should be sent to 5 AF for validation.
    3.9.2. Conflicts, which cannot be resolved at NAF level, will be forwarded to HQ PACAF/DO.

3.10. HQ PACAF AMOCC is designated as the HQ PACAF Operational Support Airlift Management
Office Validator.
    3.10.1. In addition to Senior PACAF Officials, OSA MILAIR requests for HQ PACAF personnel and
    personnel stationed outside of PACAF may be validated through the PACAF AMOCC.
    3.10.2. All requests for C-135 airlift will be forwarded to the PACAF AMOCC for validation and
    approval. PACAF/CC is the final approval authority in allocation of C-135 resources.
    3.10.3. HQ PACAF AMOCC may coordinate CONUS OSA support for PACAF general officers.

     NAF (NAF EQUIVALENT) OSA VALIDATOR RESPONSIBILITIES AND POLICIES

4.1. The 605 ASUS/LG will assign airlift priorities/urgency codes and approve requests for UH-1 heli-
copter airlift within 5 AF. Control of local training, aircrew evaluation, functional check flights, and
scheduling of helicopter airlift will be done by the 374OG through the 459AS/CC.

4.2. NAF Validators will:
   4.2.1. Issue detailed instructions and formats to requesters for aircraft within their scheduling control.
   4.2.2. Validate C-12/C-21 airlift requests on a cost-effective basis considering mission requirements
   and the priority/urgency of the airlift request.
       4.2.2.1. Determination of mission requirements will be made using the Priority, Urgency, Justifi-
       cation and Category (PUJC) codes specified in DoDD 4500.43. (See Attachment 1) Rank, grade,
       or position by itself, does not justify airlift support.
       4.2.2.2. Forward requests by Senior PACAF officials (0-7 and above or civilian equivalents) trav-
       eling on PACAF business to HQ PACAF AMOCC for PACAF/CV approval and validation.
       4.2.2.3. Forward validated requests to the flying units for scheduling. In the event the flying unit
       cannot support a request the Validator or unit will ensure the requestor is notified of the non-sup-
       port.
       4.2.2.4. Keep a copy of each validated request for a period of two years. In addition, a copy of
       each validated DV request flown will be forwarded to HQ PACAF AMOCC on a monthly basis.
   4.2.3. Assist in the preparation of directives for supporting exercise/contingency/wartime airlift
   requirements/operations and to support existing exercise/contingency/wartime operation plans. (See
   paragraph 3.8. above.)
   4.2.4. If there is an alert commitment, complete required paperwork and notify required organiza-
   tions.
   4.2.5. Specify and maintain a monthly OSA Utilization Report for each flying unit for executive
   review and audit purposes IAW paragraph 9.1. of this Instruction.

4.3. NAF Validators should be cognizant of unit training requirements when processing OSA requests.
Close cooperation between NAF Validators and operating units will ensure an optimum schedule to
accommodate mission requests, training requirements, and meet flying time allocation constraints.

                UNIT AIRLIFT SCHEDULING, PROCEDURES, AND POLICIES

6.1. Only after dedicated and critical training missions have been considered and aircraft availability
determined will requested airlift support requirements be considered and scheduled. The DoD Priority,
Urgency, Justification and Category (PUJC) codes, assigned by the OSA Validator, will be used to deter-
mine the scheduling precedence of each request.
   6.1.1. In the event two requests of equal priority conflict with each other, the request with the earlier
   validation date-time group will take priority within the constraints of efficient use of OSA assets.
   6.1.2. A dedicated training mission will not be canceled or used to support a routine airlift support
   requirement unless there is no impact to the scheduled training.
   6.1.3. A priority 2 requirement can pre-empt a dedicated training mission.
   6.1.4. A priority 2, urgency 4 or higher requirement may pre-empt a critical training mission with the
   concurrence of the AOS or AOG Commander, or their equivalent.
   6.1.5. Priority 1 requests will be supported, within resource capability, regardless of time of submis-
   sion.
   6.1.6. Pre-emption of any scheduled support mission by a higher priority request requires the
   approval of the AOS or AOG Commander, or their equivalent. If pre-emption of a DV support mis-
   sion is required, the scheduler will notify the NAF Validator, who in turn, will notify the NAF/DO and
   PACAF AMOCC as soon as possible.

6.2. Schedulers will:
   6.2.1. Notify and coordinate final dates and times of scheduled support with each requestor.
   6.2.2. Notify the NAF Validator and requestor of non-support or pre-emption as soon as it’s known.
   6.2.3. Notify the NAF Validator and PACAF AMOCC of any changes to scheduled DV support mis-
   sions.
   6.2.4. Provide a bi-monthly flying schedule of operational support and training missions to their NAF
   Validator.
   6.2.5. Provide a monthly summary of missions flown to their NAF Validator IAW paragraph 9.1. of
   this Instruction.

6.3. Schedulers will NOT:
   6.3.1. Dedicate a backup support aircraft to a requestor(s) unless directed by the PACAF/CC, NAF/
   CC, or PACAF/DO.
   6.3.2. Dedicate an airlift support mission to a single user without approval from the NAF/DO (or
   equivalent).
   6.3.3. Schedule airlift of fixed wing assets between aerodromes that are within two hours driving
   time.

     6.3.4. Move forward scheduled C-12/C-21 departures within 18 hours of the scheduled departure
     time.
        6.3.4.1. The 18-hour window includes two hours for preflight planning and briefing, twelve hours
        of crew rest, and four hours for mission/crew coordination by airlift operations personnel.
     6.3.5. Add airlift missions to the published schedule no later than:
        6.3.5.1. 18 hours prior to home station departure for missions with a flight duty period of 14 hours
        or less.
        6.3.5.2. 30 hours prior to home station departure for missions scheduled away from home station
        for more than 14 hours and for which the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest has not been
        waived.
            6.3.5.2.1. The 30-hour window includes two hours for preflight planning and briefing, 24
            hours of crew rest, and 4 hours for mission/crew coordination by airlift operations personnel.
        6.3.5.3. Exceptions: Airlift missions to fulfill urgent requirements approved by AOS or AOG
        Commander or higher authority, or airlift missions validated as Priority 1, may be added inside the
        18 or 30 hour windows but must still allow for pre-departure crew rest.

6.4. Changes to Scheduled Missions:
     6.4.1. Every effort must be made to avoid disrupting a scheduled mission once the requester has been
     notified of support. Schedulers, however, may make adjustments to scheduled missions within opera-
     tional constraints and the guidelines of this instruction.

6.5. Changes to Missions in-progress:
     6.5.1. All itinerary changes must be approved by the appropriate NAF Validator or unit operations.
        6.5.1.1. Exceptions:
            6.5.1.1.1. Changes to departure/arrival times may be directed by DV Code 4 or higher.
            6.5.1.1.2. When assigned a dedicated support aircraft, PACAF inspection team chiefs are
            authorized to direct changes of itineraries necessary to accomplish their mission.
            6.5.1.1.3. Deviations deemed necessary by the aircraft commander for reasons of safety of
            flight or emergencies are authorized.

                      REIMBURSEMENT FOR NON-DOD TRAVEL ON OSA

10.1. Under certain circumstances, OSA missions flown in support of non-DoD travelers are revenue
missions. These missions require additional documentation so that DoD, through PACAF, can bill the
non-DoD user for service provided. In brief, if a non-DoD agency requests airlift from DoD and airlift is
approved, DoD should be reimbursed for providing this service. Missions are not reimbursable when a
non-DoD traveler is invited by the appropriate commander and the invitation is approved through normal
procedures.

10.2. The military agency, which acts on behalf of the non-DoD traveler to arrange transportation for
OSA support, must provide the documentation needed to generate billings and provide this information to
the NAF Validator for processing.

10.3. The non-DoD traveler must complete a certificate of acceptance of liability (sample in AFJI
24-503, formerly AFR 76-8) prior to flight. The military agency assisting the non-DoD traveler is respon-
sible for obtaining this certificate of liability and forward it to the appropriate Validator before the mis-
sion. The Validator will identify reimbursable missions to the operating unit, who in turn, will forward
two copies of the mission itinerary report (passenger manifest and actual itinerary flown) to the NAF Val-
idator immediately following mission completion. The Validator will maintain a file copy of the docu-
ment and forward originals to HQ PACAF/FM.

10.4. Once airlift is approved by DoD on a reimbursable basis as outlined in AFJI 24-503, the military
agency acting for the requester must obtain a certificate of acceptance of liability from the traveler and
forward to the appropriate Validator prior to the mission.

             PRIORITY, URGENCY, JUSTIFICATION AND CATEGORY CODES

A1.1. Meeting the needs of many airlift requesters requires management of resources by use of the Pri-
ority, Urgency, Justification and Category Codes (PUJC) as specified in DoDD 4500.43 and listed below.

A1.2. Priority Codes.
   A1.2.1. Priority 1 - Airlift in direct support of operational forces engaged in combat, contingency or
   peacekeeping operations directed by the National Command Authorities or for emergency lifesaving
   purposes.
   A1.2.2. Priority 2 - “Required Use” airlift, or airlift requirements with compelling operational consid-
   erations making commercial transportation unacceptable. Considerations for making commercial
   transportation unacceptable may include time or delivery constraints, team travel restrictions, or secu-
   rity requirements. Missions cannot be supported by any other mode of travel.
   A1.2.3. Priority 3 - Official business airlift which is validated to be more cost effective than commer-
   cial air travel when supported by military aircraft, or official business travel when consolidated with
   another request(s) on previously scheduled missions.

A1.3. Urgency Codes.
   A1.3.1. Urgency 1 - (Combat) Airlift of personnel or material in direct support of, or alerted for sup-
   port of operational forces engaged in general war or national contingency operations.
   A1.3.2. Urgency 2 - (Lifesaving or Operational) Airlift of personnel or material in direct support of
   lifesaving operations or operational forces deployed or preparing for mobilization.
   A1.3.3. Urgency 3 - (Humanitarian) Airlift of personnel or materials in direct support of authorized
   and urgent humanitarian operations.
   A1.3.4. Urgency 4 - (Critical) Airlift of personnel or material which, while not fulfilling a higher
   urgency, would critically impact the outcome of unit requirements if not immediately supported
   exactly as requested.
   A1.3.5. Urgency 5 - (Priority) Airlift of personnel or material not fulfilling a higher urgency, but
   which would have a serious impact on the outcome of unit requirements if not fulfilled. Changes or
   consolidation with other requests would not have adversely affected the unit requirements.
   A1.3.6. Urgency 6 - (Routine) Airlift of personnel or material scheduled as part of an organization’s
   daily/weekly routine or travel that is qualified on a cost effective basis but does meet the requirements
   of a higher urgency code. Changes or consolidation with other requests would not affect unit require-
   ments.

                                              Attachment 2

                       AIRLIFT REQUEST POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A2.1. Applicability. This attachment supplements guidance contained in the basic regulation for agen-
cies and personnel requesting/utilizing OSA aircraft. Dedicated passenger/airlift requesters must review
and comply with guidance in the basic regulation and this attachment. PACAF OSA Validators and Flying
unit schedulers must be familiar with the content.

A2.2. Requirements. Agencies requesting travel are responsible for obtaining area clearance for their
personnel IAW the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide. Passports, visas, and immunization requirements are
the responsibility of the individual traveler. Movement of personal property will be limited to the authori-
zations contained in DoD 4515.13R and AFI 24-101.

A2.3. Non-DoD and Foreign National Passengers. Non-DoD and foreign national travelers are gener-
ally not authorized transportation on DoD owned or controlled aircraft. Before requesting airlift support
for non-DoD or foreign national passengers, requesters will obtain required travel authorization through
transportation channels to the approval authorities as outlined in Chapter 10 of DoD 4515.13R. PACAF/
CC is the approval authority for foreign national travelers in the grades of 0-7 and above, and civilian
equivalents when the travel is in the PACAF AOR. The NAF/CC may authorize travel of foreign nationals
in the grades of 0-6 and below, and civilian equivalents when travel is within the NAF/CC’s AOR. If air-
lift is approved by DoD on a reimbursable basis as outlined in AFJI 24-503 (formerly AFR 76-8), the mil-
itary agency acting for the requester must obtain an acceptance of liability from the traveler and forward
to the appropriate NAF Validator prior to the mission. See paragraph 15 of the basic regulation for further
details. U.S. Coast Guard must process non-reimbursable travel requests through Dept of Transportation
to Dept of Defense for approval prior to requesting OSA support. If not approved as non-TWCF they will
be required to reimburse at the appropriate rate as determined by HQ AMC.

A2.4. Staff Travel on OSA Aircraft versus AMC Channel Aircraft:
   A2.4.1. Many travelers believe OSA transportation is "free." This is only partially correct, since only
   passengers designated on a passenger list are flown without charge to operations and maintenance
   (O&M) TDY accounts. If the passenger is booked through AMC and submits an AMC transportation
   authorization, O&M funds will be billed at AMC tariff rates.
   A2.4.2. Before checking with LGT to make commercial or AMC flight arrangements, PACAF per-
   sonnel should contact the PACAF/NAF Validator as appropriate to request OSA support.
   A2.4.3. PACAF travelers contemplating use of AMC should only submit a request to the AMC pas-
   senger reservation counters if it is determined OSA is not available. PACAF TDY travelers who have
   not been confirmed on an OSA mission can check for availability of seats on an existing OSA mission
   by contacting the OSA flight scheduler no later than 1100 local the day prior to their scheduled AMC
   flight. Cancel earlier reservations made with AMC as soon as OSA seats are confirmed. OSA aircraft
   support will not be used as a backup for other travel requirements, unless directed by HQ PACAF/CC,
   NAF/CC or HQ PACAF/DO.
   A2.4.4. If PACAF dedicated passengers are known to be erroneously manifested as AMC passengers
   (incurring the AMC tariff), the organization/traveler having knowledge of the fact should at once
24                                                                        PACAFI13-206 26 JULY 2000


     notify the appropriate accounting and finance office, in writing, as to the time, date, and location of
     the incident so appropriate annotation can be made on the TDY orders. Upon receipt of the charges,
     the accounting and finance office will dispute the billing by preparing AF Form 1543, Advice of
     Rejection – AMC TWCF-T.

A2.5. Request for OSA Support (PACAF Form 292):
     A2.5.1. All PACAF agencies or personnel requesting airlift will submit a PACAF Form 292, Opera-
     tional Support Airlift (OSA) Request to the appropriate Validator listed in Table A2.1. below. A
     locally approved substitute form, message, or letter equivalent may be used but will include all infor-
     mation contained on a PACAF Form 292. Non-PACAF agencies and dual-hatted Air Force personnel
     traveling on joint business should forward their requests to CINCPAC/J43, DSN 477-1502.
     A2.5.2. PACAF Form 292 or message requests will include the following information:
        A2.5.2.1. Travel Priority. State priority of requested airlift as defined in DoDD 4500.43.
        A2.5.2.2. Purpose of Travel/Remarks. State purpose of travel and provide specific justification
        for use of MilAir over commercial transportation. In addition, state whether AMC transportation
        is/is not available and any special requirements or pertinent information that may apply. For
        non-DoD and foreign national passengers, provide specific source of DoD travel authority and
        state if an acceptance of liability certificate has been signed.
        A2.5.2.3. Desired Itinerary. Provide desired dates and times of pickup and/or arrival for each des-
        tination. If request is supported, flying unit schedulers will coordinate final dates and times as
        required.
        A2.5.2.4. Passenger List. Provide name, grade, social security number, organization, and body
        weight (C-12/C-21 only) of each passenger. (Note: If request is to move cargo, on a separate sheet
        - identify cargo, cargo weight and cube by piece, and total number of pieces. State AFJMAN
        24-204 restrictions, if any and provide cargo manifests as attachments.
        A2.5.2.5. Points of Contact. Provide name, grade, organization/office symbol, station, and on/
        off-duty phone numbers of the person at each pickup point who can receive flight information and
        inform/advise passengers or cargo consignees of changes or delays.
        A2.5.2.6. Commercial Transportation Cost. Provide commercial air and ground transportation
        costs associated with each leg of the desired itinerary for the number of personnel traveling.
        Aggregate the costs to come up with the total cost of commercial transportation. (Note: Cost esti-
        mate is only required for priority 3 C-12/C-21 travel.)
        A2.5.2.7. Baggage Weight. Passenger baggage weight is limited to 30 lbs maximum. If mission
        essential excess baggage is required (above 30 lbs max), provide quantity and justification. Sec-
        ond OSA aircraft for baggage will not be utilized.
        A2.5.2.8. Signature of Senior Traveling Official. Request must be signed by the senior ranking
        official traveling to certify that DoD travel policies have been met. No others can sign in their
        place.
        A2.5.2.9. Signature of Travel Authorizing Official. Only required for Senior officials (0-7 and
        above or civilian equivalents).

                                               Attachment 3

                         C-12/C-21 AIRLIFT OPERATIONS PROCEDURES

A3.1. Unit Passenger Processing/Manifesting Procedures:
     A3.1.1. Concept of Operations. DV passenger will be processed planeside by PACAF security police
     in accordance with current inspection, customs, and immigration requirements. Other dedicated pas-
     sengers will be processed at the locations noted below. Space available passengers will be processed
     at the appropriate passenger terminals. Aircraft Commanders can make alternate arrangements for
     passenger check in locations.
     A3.1.2. Dedicated Passenger Lists/Passenger Manifest. After being notified that a request is being
     supported, the requesting unit is responsible for preparation of dedicated passenger manifests. Fax,
     Email or handcarry the Passenger Manifest to the unit NLT 1200 on the duty day prior to day of flight.
     Local procedures for handling space available passenger manifests may be developed in conjunction
     with AMC terminal personnel, and should be specified by supplement.
     A3.1.3. Release of excess seats to AMC. Release space available seats to the maximum extent possi-
     ble. The aircraft commander will release seats not dedicated to PACAF passengers. Exception: Air-
     craft commander will not release seats when carrying HQ PACAF/CV/DO, NAF/CC, DV-3 or higher
     unless approved by the DV. The NAF Validator or unit will clear seat release with the DV and pass
     information to appropriate AMC personnel. Space available passengers will be manifested through
     passenger terminals. In instances where there are changes to the original NAF-validated passenger list
     or the local base protocol requests adding another protocol-handled passenger to the aircraft and there
     is insufficient time to gain proper NAF validation and/or to have the individual process through the
     passenger terminal, the aircraft commander may manifest the person(s) into aircraft seat(s) that were
     released to the terminal, but not filled. In no case will the aircraft commander turn away a passenger
     provided by the AMC terminal after a seat has been released to and filled by the terminal. Ensure a
     responsible agency has a copy of the updated passenger manifest and crew list. Inform a respon-
     sible agency of the correct people on board prior to departure.
     A3.1.4. Anti-Hijack Screening:
        A3.1.4.1. All dedicated passengers scheduled for airlift are certified for anti-hijack screening in
        accordance with AFI 13-207 and AMCI 24-101. The aircraft commander will certify compliance
        with the anti-hijack program by signing the manifest below the anti-hijack screening statement.
        A3.1.4.2. For other passengers filling seats offered to AMC, normal AMC procedures apply.
        A3.1.4.3. In all cases, the aircraft commander is responsible to ensure any changes to the passen-
        ger manifest or crew list are left with a responsible agency prior to departure.
     A3.1.5. Dedicated Passenger Check-in/Processing:
        A3.1.5.1. DV passengers will be processed planeside in all cases within 30 minutes from the
        scheduled departure time.
        A3.1.5.2. All non-DV passengers will report at the indicated time/date to designated locations as
        noted in Table A3.1. or at a prearranged location by the unit or aircraft commander. Standard
        check-in time will be one hour prior to departure time.
PACAFI13-206 26 JULY 2000                                                                              27


      A3.1.5.3. Aircrews will identify passengers using the manifest and/or dedicated passenger list.
      A3.1.5.4. Non-DV dedicated passengers will carry their own baggage and accompany the aircrew
      to the aircraft.
   A3.1.6. Border Clearance/Customs Processing of Dedicated Passengers:
      A3.1.6.1. At Kadena/Yokota/Osan AB, the security police will process dedicated passengers at
      the required processing time at the aircraft (or in case of inclement weather, at a prearranged
      indoor location).
      A3.1.6.2. At en route stations, aircrews will advise the security police of the required processing
      time at the aircraft (or in case of inclement weather, at a prearranged indoor location).
      A3.1.6.3. Aircrews should request security police/customs processing on flight plans for destina-
      tions at which convenient notification to the security police cannot be made to assure inbound/out-
      bound processing before departure/after arrival.
      A3.1.6.4. The security police will be given required documentation and an anti-hijack certified
      manifest for delivery/forwarding to passenger service at AMC locations or specified responsible
      agency.
      A3.1.6.5. For inbound processing of non-dedicated passengers, the aircrews will inform the AMC
      terminal via command post/dispatch radio of aircraft block time and passengers to be picked up/
      met.
   A3.1.7. Baggage Handling. In most cases, there will be no passenger processing at the AMC terminal.
   The exceptions are when aircraft cabin load may be exceeded; aircrews may request all passengers on
   a sortie to weigh their baggage in the AMC terminal. Passengers will be notified of the requirement to
   weigh baggage as early as possible. Passengers not complying with such a request will not be airlifted
   until baggage is weighed. Where loads exceed limits, passengers will reduce their baggage loads. In
   no situation will a second aircraft be made available to transport excess baggage.
   A3.1.8. Requirement for Travel Authorization. DoD 4515.13R, Chap 2, para A.1, requires appropri-
   ate travel authorizations. The travel authorization for dedicated passengers is the dedicated passenger
   list. Passengers will not be required to turn over additional TDY orders to AMC or aircrews unless
   they are added en route.
   A3.1.9. Dependent Travel. Travel of dependents, accompanied or unaccompanied, in conjunction
   with ordinary leave or environmental moral leave travel will be governed by appropriate regulations.

A3.2. Reporting Procedures for C-12/C-21 Travel of Dedicated Passengers
   A3.2.1. It is the traveler's responsibility to obtain the reporting time and passenger assembly point
   from the appropriate unit or NAF Validator. Non-DV travelers must arrive at the passenger assembly
   point one hour prior to scheduled departure time. Requesting offices will advise all passengers of
   requirements and flight information received from NAF Validators.
   A3.2.2. DVs will be processed planeside and should go directly to the aircraft within 30 minutes prior
   to departure time. All other passengers should meet the aircrew at the time(s) and location(s) listed
   below or where prearranged. Attempt to limit individual baggage to 1 medium bag or 30 lbs total
   (submit excess baggage request to NAF Validators). The AMC passenger terminal is not involved in
28                                                                             PACAFI13-206 26 JULY 2000


     OSA dedicated passenger processing and non-DV passengers must bring their own baggage to/from
     the aircraft and prearrange for their own ground transportation to/from the aircraft.
     A3.2.3. The aircraft commander is the clearing authority for all passengers and baggage. He/she may
     request an inspection of baggage contents and deny the placing of baggage onboard the aircraft.
     A3.2.4. Advise NAF Validator or unit of any mission/passenger changes and cancellations as soon as
     known. Passenger changes can be accepted up to 1300L the day prior to flight by contacting NAF Val-
     idator or unit scheduler at numbers listed below. After normal duty hours, contact NAF Validator via
     NAF Command Center.
     A3.2.5. Normal passenger assembly points are listed below. Contact appropriate NAF Validator or
     unit for further information.
