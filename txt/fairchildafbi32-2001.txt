This instruction establishes policy, procedures and responsibilities for fire prevention. Since
human carelessness is a major cause of fires in the Air Force (AF), the objectives of fire
prevention are to eliminate the causes of fires and to take prompt action to reduce the possibility
of limb loss and injury, or loss of life, should fire occur. To accomplish these goals, all
personnel must be motivated and trained to see and eliminate unsafe acts, conditions and fire
hazards. Effective fire prevention requires a well planned program managed by the fire chief,
enforced by commanders, and executed by the base personnel. This directive implements AF
Instruction (AFI) 32-2001, The Fire Emergency Services and Fire Prevention Program. It
applies to all individuals assigned or attached to or associated with Fairchild Air Force Base
(AFB). All records created by this instruction containing For Official Use Only (FOUO)
information will be marked in accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation
5200.1 Appendix 3 Information Security Program. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AF Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.
