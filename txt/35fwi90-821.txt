SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes include the
updated references to the more current regulations, the deletion of paragraphs that are repeated
from the AFI 90-821, the deletion of Attachment 5, and the reaffirming the primary
responsibility for Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) training and worker awareness on the
work area/shop supervisor, and clarification of supporting training and technical consultation
roles.
1. Introduction
     1.1. This written program supplements and provides information specific to the
     implementation of AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, on this installation. Each work area
     will maintain a workplace-specific written HAZCOM program binder which includes the
     elements described in Attachment 2 of this instruction.
     1.2. Responsibilities. In addition to the responsibilities specified in AFI 90-821, the
     following OPRs will:
        1.2.1. Unit Commanders will:
            1.2.1.1. Ensure the program is prepared, implemented and that all supervisors and
            employees who work with and have potential to work with hazardous chemicals are
            trained according to AFI 90-821 and this instruction. More importantly, commanders
            will ensure the program is effective. The Occupational Safety and Health
            Administration (OSHA) considers HAZCOM a performance-based standard, meaning
            the entire program is deemed a failure if each Airman cannot demonstrate
            understanding and competency.
            1.2.1.2. Ensure the 35 FW Hazardous Materials Management Program (HMMP) and
            Chemical Storage Areas within their units area of responsibility, operate according to
            AF HAZCOM requirements.
        1.2.2. Supervisors will:
            1.2.2.1. Where employees are handling chemicals in sealed containers ONLY and
            containers are not opened under normal conditions:
               1.2.2.1.1. Train all employees on the chemical hazards within their workplace.
               Employees will be trained to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a
               spill or a leak of a hazardous chemical from a sealed container.
               1.2.2.1.2. Ensure labels of incoming containers of hazardous chemicals are not
               removed, covered up or defaced.
               1.2.2.1.3. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be
               maintained, and employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous
               chemicals received do not have MSDSs, they will be obtained as soon as possible.
            1.2.2.2. Obtain Supervisor’s HAZCOM program training through the Public Health
            (PH) office and assure all elements of HAZCOM program are implemented IAW AFI
            90-821, chapter 2.
35FWI90-821 29 MAY 2013                                                                      3


        1.2.2.3. In accordance with AFI 91-202, USAF Mishap Prevention Program, para
        2.3.3.3, document HAZCOM program training and all supplemental hazard
        communication training of assigned personnel on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
        Health Record, or in the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS). This
        information shall be accessible electronically or in hard copy.
        1.2.2.4. Develop and maintain work area/shop-specific HAZCOM program described
        in AFI 90-821, para. 2.5 through 2.9, including a copy of AFI 90-821, this installation
        written HAZCOM program, work area/shop-specific training program elements
        defined in AFI 90-821, para. 2.7, and copies of BE industrial hygiene surveys. Refer
        to Attachment 2 for guidance.
        1.2.2.5. Maintain (or have access to) an inventory of all hazardous materials used in
        the work area/shop and maintain (or have access to) current MSDSs for the materials
        in the inventory. Ensure all employees have access to documentation during all work
        shifts and are aware of the location.
        1.2.2.6. Conduct additional hazard communication training on contaminants as
        required by OSHA expanded standards (29 CFR 1910.1000+) such as Asbestos,
        Lead, and Hexavalent Chromium. Refer to chemical authorization list and associated
        MSDS to identify expanded standards present in a work area/shop. Contact BE for
        assistance in identifying applicable expanded standards.
        1.2.2.7. Enter a process authorization through Enterprise Environmental, Safety, and
        Occupational Health Management Information System (EESOH-MIS) for each new
        hazardous material. Approval by Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), Safety, and CE
        Environmental must be received prior to local purchase of HAZMAT.
        1.2.2.8. Maintain copies of the work area’s most recent BE Routine Occupational
        Health Assessment/Industrial Hygiene surveys, subsequent annual updates, and other
        relevant special surveys. BE survey reports must be publicly posted for ten (10) days
        and maintained for two (2) years minimum, or indefinitely for exposure
        determinations (air sampling reports, noise dose reports, etc).
        1.2.2.9. At least annually, review MSDSs on file and the work area/shop hazardous
        chemical inventory.
        1.2.2.10. Conduct quality control checks of the work area HAZCOM Program at
        least annually using the checklist in Attachment 4.
        1.2.2.11. In consultation with BE, determine whether the type and quantity of a
        HAZMAT used in the workplace qualifies the item to be exempted as a “consumer
        use” item, IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.2.9. Supervisors may document items
        considered consumer use items on a separate inventory list.
     1.2.3. Contractor Operations (35 CONS/LGCC):
        1.2.3.1. The contractor is required to submit information on the use of hazardous
        materials according to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 5352.223.9002,
        Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data.

           CAGE code).
           1.2.4.4. Only accept properly labeled hazardous materials.
           1.2.4.5. HAZMART will be the focal point for all local purchase requests of
           hazardous materials. HAZMART will utilize the EESOH-MIS to forward the request
           to BE, Wing Safety (35 FW/SEG) and the Civil Engineer Environmental Flight (35
           CES/CEAN) for review and approval. This will be accomplished before forwarding
           the request to contracting.
       1.2.5. Tenant Units. Tenant units will participate in the AF HAZCOM program as
       specified in AFI 90-821 and this instruction.
2. Hazard Communication Program
    2.1. Except as stated in para 2.2. of AFI 90-821, the following requirements apply to any
    chemical hazard.
    2.2. Hazard Determination
       2.2.1. The 35th Fighter Wing will rely on the hazard determination of the supplier or
       manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air Force
       activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an
       MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations,
       the producing organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the
       MSDS to USAFSAM. For locally procured products, if an MSDS or document cannot be
       obtained from the supplier, a document meeting the intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) will
       be considered acceptable.
       2.2.2. Workplace supervisors, in consultation with BE, are responsible for determining
       whether the type and quantity of a HAZMAT used in the workplace qualifies the item to
       be exempted as a “consumer use” item, IAW AFI 90-821 para. 2.2.9.1.
       2.2.3. BE will assess health risk of hazards and validate the appropriate use of PPE.
    2.3. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs):
       2.3.1. HAZMART will maintain the MSDS master file containing all hazardous
       chemicals used on Misawa Air Base through EESOH-MIS with the assistance of data
       stewards at Hill AFB.
    2.3.1.1. The BE and CE environmental Flights will maintain access to the MSDS master file
    in EESOH-MIS.
       2.3.2. Workers who require help interpreting MSDS information may contact BE. A BE
       representative will review the MSDS with the employee and provide an explanation of
35FWI90-821 29 MAY 2013                                                                    5

     Bioenvironmental Engineering-on-call technician, via the Command Post.
  2.4. Labeling Procedures
     2.4.1. Container labeling procedures requirements will be performed IAW AFI 90-821,
     para 2.6. Labels may need translation to the predominant language according to Japanese
     Environmental Governing Standards (JEGS) requirements. In addition to required
     labeling information, HAZMAT containers shall have a HAZMART barcode label.
     2.4.2. DD Form 2521, Hazardous Chemical Warning Label or DD Form 2522,
     Hazardous Chemical Warning Label, when available, will be used as a uniform labeling
     system to meet the labeling requirements for:
        2.4.2.1. Existing stocks of unlabeled materials.
        2.4.2.2. HAZMAT manufactured within the Air Force.
        2.4.2.3. Transferring, re-packaging or distributing of bulk quantities of HAZMAT
        into other containers (breakdown quantities). The exception for this rule is when a
        material is placed in an unmarked container and used or returned to the original
        container after task completion or within one work shift, whichever is sooner.
        2.4.2.4. Re-labeling HAZMAT containers IAW paragraph 2.4.2 when labels have
        been accidentally defaced or lost.
     2.4.3. The sources for this labeling information can be obtained from:
        2.4.3.1. HAZMART
        2.4.3.2. Label on bulk or packaged containers.
        2.4.3.3. Hard copy of the manufacturer’s MSDS.
        2.4.3.4. Manufacturer, importer, or other responsible party.
     2.4.4. Label all tanks with the name of the material it contains. This will ensure non-
     compatible materials are not accidentally added to the tank or vat.
     2.4.5. Pipes posing physical hazards (pressure, steam, etc.) or containing hazardous
     materials shall be labeled as feasible. If labeling is not feasible, information on the
     locations and associated hazards will be documented in the Shop HAZCOM binder.
  2.5. Employee Information and Training
     2.5.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using hazardous materials
     receive training using guidance found in AFI 90-821, para 2.7.
     2.5.2. This training may be provided by the supervisor, the organization occupational
     health coordinator, or other formal organization training structure (i.e., maintenance
     trainers). Supervisors will supplement this training to provide information on work area
     specific chemical hazards. Before presenting the workplace specific training, the
     supervisor will ensure that Bioenvironmental Engineering (35 AMDS/SGPB), Public
     Health (35 AMDS/SGPM), Wing Safety (35 FW/SEG), Fire department (35 CES/CEF)
     and the unit safety representative review the information for accuracy. The example
     template      that    can     be   found       on     the    BE      share    point   at
6                                                                  35FWI90-821 29 MAY 2013

     into an Air Force approved Hazardous Material Management System.
  2.8. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
     2.8.1. Non-routine tasks are tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but
     performed infrequently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent, or
     cleaning up spills.
     2.8.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in this work area
     which involve hazardous material (Tab D of the Shop HAZCOM binder). The supervisor
     will ensure work area operating instructions (OIs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks,
     associated hazards, and controls. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TOs)
     or other official documents adequately describe these tasks. Supervisors will ensure
     workers review these procedures before performing any non-routine tasks.
     2.8.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor
     of the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning
     the activity:
        2.8.3.1. The initial workplace specific training program described in this instruction,

support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs are managed and tracked. A
HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation where Logistics Readiness
Squadron (LRS) personnel stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must
have at least one primary HAZMART established by, and accountable to the LRS Commander.
The HMMP team may designate additional unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs
performing all the functions of the primary HAZMART. The HAZMART responsibilities
include the receipt and entry of data on Government-wide Purchase Card purchases of
HAZMAT, and the receipt and entry of data on contractor usage of HAZMAT.

requires a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as defined in Federal Std 313, unless excluded.
The following items are not considered HAZMAT and are exempt: 1) Hazardous wastes; 2)
Tobacco; 3) Wood products; 4) Materials packaged for retail sale; 5) Personal food, drugs, or
cosmetics brought into the work area; 6) Consumer products used in small quantities for non-
occupational uses; 7) Chemicals used for laboratory analytical processes; 8) Pharmaceuticals and
biological materials, including serums and vaccines in their final form.
Label—Any written, printed, or graphic material, displayed on or affixed to containers of
hazardous materials.
Material—Same definition as chemical.
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)—Written or printed material concerning HAZMAT which
is prepared according to 29 CFR, 1910.1200.
Non—routine Tasks—Those tasks identified in a work area’s normal activities but performed
infrequently and/or as temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
(AFSC) or job series.
