                             KEY PERSONNEL LOCATOR (KPL)

3.1. Key personnel locator. The KPL provides users with current information concerning the
status and location of key HAF personnel and MAJCOM Commanders; their alternates or
successors; and how to contact or reach these personnel. Users can enter and modify specified
data for the designated personnel in their organizations.
3.1. (AFSOC)Key Personnel Locator. Key personnel and subordinate commanders utilize the
director’s schedule to update their required information. Contact the AFSOC help desk to
request permissions. Note: The KPL discussed in the basic AFI is only used by the AFSOC
Command Center to provide updates to Air Force.
3.2. KPL Accounts.
   3.2.1. KPL accounts will be requested by emailing the request by SIPRNET email to
   AFDW/A3C at KPL@af.pentagon.smil.mil. Duty/Role accounts will not be created.
   Individual users must each maintain a separate login for security and audit control purposes.
   Questions regarding KPL accounts can be directed to AFDW/A3C at DSN 224-7147 or
   commercial 703-614-7147 during duty hours, 0700-1700 Eastern Time, Monday through
   Friday (excluding holidays) or the AFSWC, DSN 227-6103 or commercial 703-697-6103 at
   all other times. Requests for accounts must include the following information:
       3.2.1.1. Role (―HAF 2-Letter,‖ ―HAF 3-Letter,‖ or ―MAJCOM Command Center‖).
   3.2.1.2. Office Symbol of Principal (e.g., ―AF/A1,‖ ―ACC/CC,‖ etc.)
       3.2.1.3. Rank, Grade, or Title of requesting individual.
       3.2.1.4. First and Last name of requesting individual.
       3.2.1.5. SIPRNET email account of requesting individual.
   3.2.2. Additions and deletions to the KPL (Principals). ―Key Personnel‖ will be added or
   deleted from the KPL using the following criteria:
       3.2.2.1. Additions. AFDW/A3C will add offices to the list as required to track key
       personnel associated with HAF continuity programs. If an office requests an addition to
       the KPL, AFDW/A3C will check to see if the new office has a prominent role in the HAF
       continuity program. If the requesting office does not have a prominent role in HAF
       continuity programs, the request for addition will be forwarded to the AFSWC for
       review. If the AFSWC does not have a requirement to track the requesting Principal (i.e.,
       the CSAF has not provided direction to track the Principal), the request for addition will
       be denied. If the request is approved, the tasked office will be provided a copy of this
       instruction and a guide sheet outlining KPL operating procedures.
       3.2.2.2. Deletions:
          3.2.2.2.1. Offices already on the list may request removal. If the requesting office
          does not have a prominent role in HAF continuity programs, the request for deletion
          will be forwarded to the AFSWC for review. If the AFSWC does not have a
 16                                          AFI10-205_AFSOCSUP_I 21 NOVEMBER 2012


           requirement to track the requesting Principal (i.e., the CSAF has not provided
           direction to track the Principal), the request for deletion will be approved.
           3.2.2.2.2. AFDW/A3C will periodically audit the KPL. Principals whose status has
           not been updated in three or more months will be nominated for deletion and
           forwarded to the AFSWC for review. If the AFSWC does not have a requirement to
           track the Principal (i.e., the CSAF has not provided direction to track the Principal),
           the office will be deleted from the KPL.
3.3. Security. The KPL is maintained on the SIPRNET and is cleared for information up to
SECRET. As travel itineraries for HAF Key Personnel and MAJCOM Commanders are posted,
care must be taken not to post an itinerary that exceeds the security capabilities of the system.
As a general rule, itineraries will be designated a minimum of UNCLASSIFIED, For Official
Use Only. Consideration should be given to classifying itineraries where the Principal transits
high-threat areas as CONFIDENTIAL. SecAF, USecAF, CSAF, and VCSAF itineraries will be
classified SECRET. Other HAF Key Personnel and MAJCOM Commander itineraries will be
classified SECRET if circumstances dictate. Those responsible for the principal’s itinerary,
including the commander, will determine the need to classify and when to declassify the
itinerary.
3.4. KPL Reporting Procedures. The KPL will be updated using the following policies and
procedures:
   3.4.1. Update Time.
       3.4.1.1. HAF Key Personnel status will be updated by the responsible offices no later
       than 0800 Eastern Time, for that duty day.
       3.4.1.2. MAJCOM Commander status will be updated by MAJCOM command center’s
       daily no earlier than 0500Z and no later than 0800Z.
   3.4.2. Update Procedures. Updating the Principal’s status include either No Change or
   Changes procedures.
       3.4.2.1. No Change. If there is no change from the previous status (i.e., the Principal is
       still on station and available; or the Principal is still TDY or on leave), click the ―Verify‖
       button under the ―Last Verified‖ column.
       3.4.2.2. Changes. If there are changes to the Principal’s status the following measures
       must be taken to update the KPL:
           3.4.2.2.1. Click on the ―Edit‖ button under the ―Position‖ column; select the current
           status from the ―Status‖ drop down box. If the Principal will be TDY and/or on
           Leave, in the text box below the ―Status‖ drop down box, provide the date of
           departure for the absence and any significant information that should be visible on the
           main page. Do not insert the entire itinerary in this field.
           3.4.2.2.2. Click on the ―Return Date‖ box and add, remove, or update the estimated

          commander, insert the phrase, ―No Designated Alternate‖ in the text box, below
          the date of departure.
          3.4.2.2.3.2. When a MAJCOM Commander designates an alternate, the
          designated alternate will act for the commander in the commander’s name, as is
          routinely done when the commander is present, and must be able to reach the
          commander by telephone, if necessary.
       3.4.2.2.4. An itinerary must be provided for TDYs and Leaves. Click on the
       ―Manage‖ button under the ―Attachments‖ column; provide a Title and description
       for the travel document and click the ―Browse‖ button to browse to and attach the
       appropriate Commander’s Availability Report (CAR) (see Chapter 4 of this
       Instruction). The CAR must be posted to the KPL no later than 24 hours prior to the
       Commander’s scheduled departure. If the MAJCOM Commander must depart
       unexpectedly or if an unexpected deviation to a published schedule occurs, the
       Commander or his/her designated representative must notify the command center of
       the new itinerary (to include departure and arrival times) as soon as possible.
       Command centers will format the information into the CAR format and post the
       update to the KPL as soon as possible. The note ―Amended Itinerary‖ will be added
       to the text box below the ―Status‖ drop down box and the AFSWC will be
       telephonically notified of the new itinerary/changes immediately after posting the
       information. The ―Amended Itinerary‖ note will be deleted by the AFSWC once they
       retrieve the new/amended CAR.

                                 AVAILABILITY REPORTING

4.1. COMMANDER’S AVAILABILITY REPORT (CAR). The CAR is used by HAF Staff
offices and MAJCOM Command Centers to report on the absence, itinerary, designated alternate
(if one is identified), and contact information when key personnel will be absent for TDY and/or
leave. In addition to providing the general information on the KPL, the CAR will be used to
provide the additional detail needed to allow the SecAF and CSAF to maintain command and
control of forces and run the HAF. The CAR will be attached to the HAF Key Personnel (as
designated in Table 2.1) and MAJCOM Commander’s profile outlining his/her itinerary during
the period of absence. See Figure 4.1 for template and example.

(Added-AFSOC) AFSOC Command Center—The AFSOC Command Center serves as the
higher headquarters (HHQs) full-time 24/7 C2 node. The AFSOC Command Center is a direct
representative of the MAJCOM commander and serves as the focal point for AFSOC operations,
and as such receives and disseminates (laterally, up and down the chain-of-command) orders,
information, and requests necessary for the C2 of assigned forces and operations. Command
Center operations are specified in AFI 10-207, Command Posts.
(Added-AFSOC) AFSOC Directors Schedule—See Directors Schedule.
Command Center— A facility from which a commander and his or her representatives direct
operations and control forces. It is organized to gather, process, analyze, display, and
disseminate planning and operational data and perform related tasks.
(Added-AFSOC) Command Post—The CP is a direct representative of the (installation)
commander and serves as the focal point of the units operations, and as such receives and
disseminates orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of assigned forces and
operations. Note: The
(Added-AFSOC) Concurrent            Absence—The          simultaneous      absence     of     the
Commander/Director and Deputy.
(Added-AFSOC) Crisis Action Team (CAT)—A staff formed by the commander to plan,
direct, and coordinate forces in response to contingencies, crises, natural/man-made disasters, or
wartime situations. The CAT directs, and develops courses of action, advises the commander
and key staff, and executes the commander's and HHQ’s directives. The composition and
function of the CAT is largely mission driven and therefore a MAJCOM or unit commander
prerogative and varies according to the situation. Within AFSOC, the HQ has an executive level
and support level CAT.
Designated Alternate— The individual appointed by the MAJCOM Commander or HAF 2-
Letter Principal to act for the Commander/Principal in administrative and operational matters
while the Commander/Principal is absent from their place of duty. This is not the same as
designating a successor nor does the MAJCOM Commander transfer command.
(Added-AFSOC) Directors Schedule—The AFSOC director’s schedule is the primary tool
used by AFSOC key personnel and subordinate commanders for updating key contact and
location information. The schedule is used by the AFSOC Commander and the AFSOC
Commanders Command Center as the first line of notification information in the event of a need
to contact and/or recall.            The schedule is located on SIPRNET at
http://webapps.afsoc.af.smil.mil/AfsocApps/AfsocScheduler        /DirectorSchedule.      aspx.
Contact the AFSOC help desk for access.
(Added-AFSOC) Dual Absence—See Concurrent Absence.
(Added-AFSOC) Executive Crisis Action Team (CAT)—Most frequently a combination of
the commander’s key senior staff and special staff, formed by the commander to plan, direct, and
coordinate forces in response to contingencies, crises, natural/man-made disasters, or wartime
situations. AFSOC Executive CAT participation and composition may vary according to the
situation.
(Added-AFSOC) Flag (Transfer)—Term used to indicate who is in charge at that moment
(who has the stick) or in the instance of flag transfer, the change in responsibility from the
 24                                         AFI10-205_AFSOCSUP_I 21 NOVEMBER 2012


primary member to a designated alternate or alternate back to the primary (as in holder of the
flag). Note: as referenced in this instruction, flag transfer does not indicate a change-in-
command.
Key Personnel Locator (KPL)— The KPL is a web-based application hosted on the SIPRNET
and is designed to maintain the current location, status, and relevant contact information of HAF
key personnel and MAJCOM Commanders. Travel itineraries and other relevant scheduling
information can be uploaded to the system as additional references and attachments. The KPL
provides for HAF continuity tracking of key personnel and AFSWC emergency notification.
The system was implemented to replace direct e-mail and phone reporting to AFSWC. (SIPR –
http://www.afv-cat.hq.af.smil.mil/presentation/Authorization/Login.cfm)
On Station— For KPL system usage, On Station is to be used at all times while the commander
is at his/her base of assignment. On Station will not be displayed if the commander is on leave
or temporary duty (TDY).
Permanent Duty Station (PDS)— PDS is the base of duty or official station where the
commander is assigned or attached for duty other than "temporary duty." PDS also includes the
local travel area where immediate voice contact can be established.

term.
(Added-AFSOC) Support Crisis Action Team (CAT)—Combination of the key staff and
special staff action officers formed to plan, direct, and coordinate forces in response to
contingencies, crises, natural/man-made disasters, or wartime situations. AFSOC Support CAT
participation and composition may vary according to the situation.
Temporary Duty (TDY)— TDY is duty to one or more locations, other than the PDS, with
return to the PDS upon completion of the TDY.
