SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The Air Force
Instruction (AFI) has the following changes: This revision combines AFI 34-308, Workers’
Compensation Procedures, and AFMAN 34-311, Workers’ Compensation Procedures, and
renames the publication AFI 34-308, Nonappropriated Fund Workers’ Compensation
Procedures. It updates the Department of Labor (DOL) Offices address listing and implements
 2                                                                 AFI34-308 13 OCTOBER 2010


HRO process changes. This revision requires installation-level activities to send DOL Form LS-
202, Employer’s First Report of Injury or Occupational Illness, to HQ AFSVA/SVXHW within
24 hours following the date of an employee's injury. In addition, it provides clarification when
temporary total disability will be paid. This revision reformats the entire publication format to
comply with current publishing standards. This publication applies to the Force Support
Squadron (FSS) and any new flight/division/branch names associated with the merger at
installation or higher headquarters levels.

Section A—Claims Administration

1. Claims Administration. The Air Force Nonappropriated Fund (AFNAF) Workers’
Compensation Program is administered at HQ AFSVA. Installation-level activities develop
initial claims by completing DOL Longshore (LS) forms. HQ AFSVA, Workers’ Compensation
Branch (HQ AFSVA/SVXHW) develops claims, process benefits, and resolves claims.
2. Claims Development. Installation-level activities will provide DOL Form LS-202 to
HQ AFSVA/SVXHW within 24 hours following the date of an employee's injury. All claims
development, benefit processing, claims resolution, and reimbursement of expenses will be
processed by HQ AFSVA/SVXHW, 10100 Reunion Place, Suite 502, San Antonio, TX 78216-
4188.
3. Program Applicability.
     3.1. This program applies to a NAF civilian employee who is:
        3.1.1. A United States (US) citizen or a permanent resident of the US or territory or

        3.3.1. Under applicable local law, treaty, custom, or agreement, and
        3.3.2. Through locally procured commercial insurance or the country's local government.
        3.3.3. Administration of such coverage is prescribed by arrangements made between the

AFI34-308 13 OCTOBER 2010                                                                      3


     4.1.1. The benefit is 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly wage (AWW), with minimum
     and maximum amounts. The benefit is paid every two weeks with the payment due
     approximately 14 days after the employer is notified of the injury.
     4.1.2. HQ AFSVA/SVXHW annually publishes the new minimum and maximum
     compensation rates effective each 1 October based on US DOL announcement.
     4.1.3. The benefit is not payable for the first three calendar days of disability unless the
     period of disability exceeds 14 days. In that event, the first three days are paid
     retroactively.
     4.1.4. Reference Attachment 4 for an example of AWW, benefit calculation and timing
     of payment.
  4.2. Temporary Partial Disability (TPD) benefits are paid during a period an employee may
  do some work following an injury, but the employee's earnings are reduced due to temporary
  limitations resulting from the injury.
     4.2.1. The benefit is paid at the rate of 66 2/3 percent of the difference between the
     employee's AWW at the time of injury and his or her wage earnings after the injury.
     4.2.2. The benefit is payable during the healing period until the injured worker returns to
     work earning at least the pre-injury AWW.
  4.3. TTD and TPD may be supplemented from available sick leave or annual leave so that
  the employee's combined income from the disability benefit and the leave payment equals

         officer, to the examining physician and ask the medical reviewer to complete, based
         on medical examination, the SF 78.
  6.11. In the event disaster occurs, resulting in cataclysmic loss to employees while in the
  course of employment so as to prevent normal procedure, a representative of the HRO
  provides HQ AFSVA/SVXHW by telephone, followed by e-mail or fax with information to
  identify injured employees, treating medical personnel, and the present location of the injured
  employees.
     6.11.1. HQ AFSVA/SVXHW will arrange for contract medical management specialists
     to locate the injured employees and treating physicians to obtain requisite information to
     commence compensation/medical benefits.
     6.11.2. Copies of actions taken by HQ AFSVA/SVXHW during this time are submitted
     to the installation HRO.
7. NAF AOs:
  7.1. Refer to WCCMS to ensure timely payments. For overseas installations only, pay
  compensation within 14 days of the date it becomes due and every 14 days thereafter during
  the period of disability or until the file is transferred to HQ AFSVA/SVXHW. Pay medical
  expenses within 21 days of receipt of an itemized bill and report of service. Record the
  expense or receivable according to AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for NAF Financial
  Management and Accounting.
     7.1.1. Bills for in-patient hospital care or surgery will be submitted                    to
     HQ AFSVA/SVXHW immediately by e-mail, fax or overnight mail for review.
  7.2. Determine the injured employee’s AWW on receiving medical certification that the
  employee is disabled. The AWW is 1/52 of an employee's annual earnings including tips and
  gratuities and other employment for the year before the accident.
     7.2.1. For an employee who has worked in the same employment substantially the whole
     year (minimum of 41 weeks) before the injury, the AWW is obtained by dividing the
     earnings by the number of weeks worked in the preceding 52 weeks.
     7.2.2. For an employee who has worked substantially less than the whole year, the
     AWW is based on the hourly rate of pay times the weekly hours. Where work hours are
     not guaranteed, the AWW is based on the wages of an employee in the same
     classification, in similar employment, who has worked substantially the whole of the
     year. Compute the AWW as above.
     7.2.3. In either case, if the employee has wages from other employment in the preceding
     52 weeks, these are added to the wages earned in the covered employment and the total
     earnings obtained divided by the number of weeks worked to obtain the AWW. If this
     computation is used, the hourly rate method above is not applicable.
     7.2.4. Obtain compensation amounts from the installation HRO for foreign national
     employees covered in foreign countries.
     7.2.5. Preserve a record of the wages used in computing the AWW and submit it to
     HQ AFSVA/SVXHW on file transfer.

  7.3. Using the computed AWW, pay the temporary total disability benefits based on the rate
  schedule published annually by HQ AFSVA/SVXHW. (See paragraph 4.1. above.)
     7.3.1. Compensation is paid for only those days medically confirmed as lost time due to
     disability. For example, an employee whose regularly scheduled week begins on
     Wednesday is released by a treating physician to work as of a Monday. Benefits are paid
     through the Sunday, although the employee does not return to work until the next
     scheduled work day.
  7.4. HQ AFSVA/SVXHW will prepare DOL Form LS-206 on the first payment of
  compensation and prepare DOL Form LS-208 when compensation is stopped or suspended
  for any reason other than transferring the case to HQ AFSVA/SVXHW. Reference Table 1
  for timelines on these and other forms.

  Form 784, evidence of other wages, and proof of payment of benefits, and medical bills to
  HQ AFSVA/SVXHW.
     7.5.1. NAF AOs may close files once received by HQ AFSVA/SVXHW.
     7.5.2. NAF AOs paying compensation for US civilian employees outside CONUS and
     Republic of Korea nationals continue making payments, but provide
     HQ AFSVA/SVXHW with reimbursement requests, copies of all checks processed, paid
     medical bills, electronic fund transfer (EFT) payments processed, and copies of medical
     reports every six weeks.
     7.5.3. Claimant is not entitled to reimbursement for loss of annual leave which was used
     in the attendance of a medical appointment.

                          BENEFIT CALCULATION EXAMPLE

Background: A full-time, 40-hour week employee works Monday through Friday, off Saturday
and Sunday. For the 52 week period prior to 4 January, the date of injury, the employee earned
wages of $19,820. Employee’s hourly rate of pay at the time of injury was $8.40. The first day
of lost time was 5 January with a return to work on 11 January. On 16 February, the employee
became disabled again; returned to work on 23 March. The employee was paid sick leave for 5-
7 January.
A3.1. AWW: The higher rate is always used. Multiplying the hourly rate x 40 would only
yield $336. Dividing the gross wages received over the previous 52 weeks, however, yields
$456 for the AWW.
A3.2. TTD Rate (2008): Reference A3.1 above, minimum/maximum rates change 1
October.
         If Employee AWW is:                                             Benefit Equals:
         Equal/Less than $290.09                                         Employee AWW
         Equal/Greater than $290.10 but equal/less than $435.13          $290.09
         Equal/Greater than $435.14 but equal/less than $1,740.52 2/3 AWW
         Equal/Greater than $1,740.53                                    $1,160.36
Here, the employee’s earnings fall in the third class, two-thirds of the AWW yields a weekly
TTD rate of $304.
A3.3. First payment: The employee is due benefits from 8-10 January. On or about 14

Rating Physical Work Demands. The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), Volume II,
published by the US DOL (4th edition, 1991), rates five categories of the physical demands of
work in terms of strength required:
A4.1. Sedentary Work. Lifting 10 pounds maximum and occasionally lifting or carrying, or
both, such articles as dockets, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as
one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in
carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required only
occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met.
A4.2. Light Work. Lifting 20 pounds maximum with frequent lifting up to 10 pounds. Even
though the weight lifted may be only a negligible amount, a job is in this category when it
requires walking or standing to a significant degree, or when it involves sitting most of the time
with a degree of pushing and pulling of arm and/or leg controls.
A4.3. Medium Work. Lifting 50 pounds maximum with frequent lifting, and/or carrying of
objects weighing up to 25 pounds.
A4.4. Heavy Work. Lifting 100 pounds maximum with frequent lifting, carrying, or both
objects weighing up to 50 pounds.
A4.5. Very Heavy Work. Lifting objects in excess of 100 pounds with frequent lifting, carrying,
or both objects weighing 50 pounds or more.
