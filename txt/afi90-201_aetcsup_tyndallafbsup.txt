This instruction implements AFPD 90-2, Inspector General—The Inspection System. It
establishes policy for conducting the 325th Fighter Wing (FW) Self-Inspection Program and
applies to all 325 FW organizations. This instruction expands upon policies and procedures as
outlined in AFI 90-201_AETCSUP_I, Inspector General Activities. It outlines responsibilities,
lists procedures for use of inspection checklists and disposition of findings, and establishes the
frequency of self-inspections. Overall responsibility for the program rests with the 325 FW
Commander; however, actual operation and management of the Self-Inspection Program is
delegated to the subordinate offices specified in this instruction. . Self-Inspection is an internal
management tool, which enables supervisors to identify and correct management deficiencies
and noncompliance with directives. A formal Self-Inspection program documents deficiencies
and assists supervisors in resolving problems either locally or by elevation to the appropriate
level. Serious and repeat deficiencies can be systematically resolved through conscientious and
regular use of the program, resulting in increased effectiveness of the organization. Every effort
should be made to reduce the administrative burden of unit Self-Inspection programs. The Self-
Inspection program should be an active, ongoing effort at all levels of supervision and is not an
administrative exercise that is implemented in the face of known unit vulnerability to a higher
headquarters inspection. However, a thorough review of the program would be in order prior to
such an inspection Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of
command. This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all direct Supplements must
be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. It
applies to individuals at all levels who prepare, manage, review, certify, approve, disseminate

Inspection book for follow-up and reporting per this instruction.
2.6.3.2.5. (Added) Self-Inspection Reporting. Results of the Self-Inspection will be reported

the wing level. Group/Wing Staff agency Self-Inspection program managers will forward results
to the 325 FW/IG staff. See attachments 1 and 2 of this AFI for appropriate format. Highlight
any LIMFACs, Major/Critical findings, Repeats and any Recommendations for 325 FW/CC
