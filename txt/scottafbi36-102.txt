Terms
Leave Without Pay (LWOP)—An absence from duty in a non pay status. Leave without pay
may be taken only for those hours of duty comprising an employee’s basic workweek. A
temporary status and absence from duty granted upon the employee’s request. Except where
specifically authorized by law or this instruction as a matter of right, granting of leave without
pay is a matter of administrative discretion. The fact that it is a scheduled absence requiring
approval distinguishes it from absence without leave, which is an absence without permission
that may serve as the basis for disciplinary action.
