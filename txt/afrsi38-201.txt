OPR: HQ AFRS/RSXXM (TSgt Jesus Garcia)                Certified by: HQ AFRS/RSX (Col James Browne)
                                                                                             Pages: 9
                                                                                      Distribution: F


This instruction implements AFPD 38-2, Manpower, and AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower
Requirements. It establishes guidance on submission of manpower authorization change requests (ACR)
and organizational change requests (OCR) within Headquarters Air Force Recruiting Service (HQ
AFRS), the four recruiting groups, and 28 recruiting squadrons. It provides directions for the completion
and submission of AFRS Form 1399, AF Recruiting Service Authorization Change Request. This
publication does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
units. Maintain and dispose of records created in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition
Schedule. Attachment 1 contains a glossary of references and supporting information. This publication
replaces guidance found in AETCI 38-201, 15 February 1996, Air Force Recruiting Service Operational
Organization.
1. Purpose:
1.1. Provide guidance on submission of authorization/organizational change requests within AFRS.
1.2. Provide a detailed timeline for the submission of AFRS Form 1399.
1.3. Provide a detailed description on the completion of AFRS Form 1399.
1.4. Provide guidance on review and update of unit manning documents (UMD).
2. Organization and Manpower Requirements:
2.1. HQ AFRS/RSXXM is the office of primary responsibility for the overall direction and management
of ACRs, AFRS Forms 1399, OCRs and UMDs.
2.2. The basic organizational structure consists of sufficient personnel, offices, military entrance
processing stations, flights, squadrons, and groups to accomplish the AFRS mission.
2.3. AFRS group and squadron organizational structures are standardized. AFRS/CC, or CV must
approve any deviation from the organizational structure prior to implementation. Recruiting group and
squadron commanders will not attempt to reorganize their unit based on personalities.
2.4. Moves to accommodate personal desires are prohibited.
2                                                                AFRSI38-201       21 FEBRUARY 2003

2.5. AFRS personnel will not commit any resources (moving personnel, signing leases, and obligating
funds) until an AFRS Form 1399 has been accomplished and approved at the headquarters level.
2.6. Accomplish an AFRS Form 1399 for authorization changes in conjunction with the Real Estate
Facilities Program Call. See timeline for submission of AFRS Forms 1399 outlined in paragraph 6. All
AFRS Forms 1399 submitted outside of the timeline will be considered out-of-cycle and worked based
upon funds available. Refer to AFRSI 32-9002, Real Estate Support for Recruiting Facilities, for
procedures pertaining to real estate related matters. NOTE: Submit AFRS Form 1399 for force
relocation actions as soon as the unit is aware of the action.
2.7. Normally an approved AFRS Form 1399 precedes projected facility actions. Authorization moves
should be cost effective, and coincide with good facility planning while reacting to present and future
production needs.
2.8. The group and squadron support flight commanders (RCG/RSS and RCS/RSS) have the overall
responsibility of managing ACRs. The group and squadron personnel branches are responsible for
maintaining the UMDs, and completing and maintaining AFRS Forms 1399. However, a coordinated
and comprehensive effort by all group and squadron staff functions (for example, operations provides
production and market justification as well as prepares zone maps as applicable; logistics provides
necessary real estate, vehicle, and telecommunications information; system administrators provide
necessary information regarding computer resources, etc.) is critical to the ACR process.
2.9. Base realignments, as well as reorganization actions, upon requirements of the function and clearly
depict the management efficiencies to be realized. Need for training is not sufficient justification for an
ACR request.
2.10. An AFRS Form 1399 is not required for group and squadron headquarters forced relocations, or
relocation actions initiated by HQ AFRS/RSXL. However, an AFRS Form 1399 is required for all
relocation actions initiated by groups or squadrons. HQ AFRS/RSXXM will work requests for
movement orders for all group and squadron headquarters relocations in coordination with HQ
AFRS/RSXL. However, groups and squadrons should notify HQ AFRS/RSXXM via e-mail at AFRS
HQ RSXXM or letter to HQ AFRS/RSXXM, 550 D St West Suite 1, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4527
(as soon as possible if their unit is scheduled to move to ensure action is being worked.
3. Authorization Change Request (ACR) Objective:
3.1. An AFRS Form 1399 is used to submit an authorization change request to realign or move an
authorization from one location to another, and does not change the overall organizational structure of
the headquarters, group, squadron or flight (for example realign an enlisted accessions [EA] recruiter
authorization from 11BA, Smithvalley to 11BB, Jonesvalley, or move an authorization from one
headquarters division, branch or section to another, for example, HQ AFRS/RSO to HQ AFRS/ RSX).
3.2. Use an AFRS Form 1399 for the submission of an authorization change request to convert
authorizations from military to civilian or vice versa, Air Force specialty code (AFSC) changes, grade
changes, skill-level changes, address changes, and zip code changes when none of these change the
overall organizational structure of the headquarters, group, squadron, or flight.
3.3. HQ AFRS/RSXXM will accomplish all necessary AFRS Forms 1399 for authorization changes
directed by AFRS/CC/CV. If an ACR package involves civilian positions, HQ AFRS/RSXP will
provide current and proposed civilian position descriptions to HQ AFRS/RSXXM for inclusion in the
final ACR package. All other authorization changes will be accomplished by the requesting unit and
forwarded through the appropriate channels to HQ AFRS/RSXXM.
4. Organizational Change Request (OCR) Objective:
AFRSI38-201       21 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                   3

4.1. Organizational changes such as requests that involve group or squadron boundary changes, creation
or elimination of branches or sections, realignment of authorizations from group or squadron support
flight to operations flight, etc., do not require the submission of an AFRS Form 1399. Instead, an OCR
package outlining the proposed organizational change and justification for the change is required to be
submitted to HQ AFRS/RSXXM for review and staffing. Upon AFRS/CC/CV approval and direction,
HQ AFRS/RSXXM will work organizational change request.
4.2. As a minimum, include the following in the OCR package:
4.2.1. Letter outlying the proposed organization change to include justification for proposed action,
authorizations impacted, expected benefits (monetary or nonmonetary), potential impact on other units,
cost of request in terms of dollars and resources, any real estate actions required, and whether any
personnel (military and civilian) will be affected by the requested change.
4.2.2. Before and after organizational charts, if applicable.
4.3. HQ AFRS/RSXXM will accomplish the necessary OCR packages for all organizational changes
directed by AFRS/CC/CV. If an OCR package involves civilian positions, HQ AFRS/RSXP will
provide current and proposed civilian position descriptions to HQ AFRS/RSXXM for inclusion in the
final OCR package. All other organizational changes will be accomplished by the requesting unit and
forwarded through the appropriate channels to HQ AFRS/RSXXM.

            include approximate mileage of move, lease termination date, estimated costs involved with
            the proposed move (real estate cost, furniture, equipment, communication cost, etc.),
            delineated maps, and whether or not the office will be closed. If the leased space cannot be
            terminated, provide plans for the disposition of the office space. Indicate if the office is
            collocated with the other services and what service (Army, Navy, Marine, or Reserves). If the
            office is collocated, indicate whether or not requesting to break collocation. Indicate whether
            a major upgrade has been accomplished within the last 18 months. If the facility is the
            primary reason for the move, ensure copies of letters to and from the CoE are included in the
            package outlining attempts made to correct the problems. Provide crime statistics, if
            applicable, for current and proposed location. Also, indicate whether additional vehicles will
            be required for the proposed location and any other pertinent information or rationale for the
            proposed action.
9 (note)    Operations Impact. Initiating unitâ€™s operations NCO signature and justification/impact on
            action being requested. When applicable, provide at least 12 months of production statistics
            to include schools/market data for each office involved. In the justification, include each
            recruiter's current and proposed zone by county/ZIP codes. Where flight, zone, and/or market
            structure do not change, so state. Ensure justification explains how the requested action will
            maximize production potential for the affected recruiting zones. When applicable, attach
            maps showing the area's current and proposed configurations of affected zones. Show how
            recruiting offices affected will be zoned to support authorized recruiters if the request is
            approved. Ensure original road maps for zone changes are submitted with packageâ€”
            photocopies or faxed copies will not be accepted.
     10     Obtain this information from the UMD. Group and squadron personnel may recommend
            numbers for new offices; however, final approval authority of numbers for new offices is HQ
            AFRS/RSXXM.
    11-13   List the complete current address, city, and nine-digit ZIP code. If available, list address,
            city, and ZIP code for the proposed location.
     14     Obtain the Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code from the UMD and only use the last
            four digits. If the office already exists, a PAS code is available. If the office is relocating
            within the same city, the PAS code remains the same for the new location. If the office is
            relocating to a new city, enter "new" under PAS code for the new location.

   16      Obtain the organizational structure code (OSC) from the UMD.
   17      Obtain the Air Force specialty code (AFSC) from the UMD.
   18      Obtain the authorized grade from the UMD; for example, COLONEL = COL; LT
           COLONEL = LTC; CMSGT = CMS; SMSgt = SMS; MSgt - MSG. For civilian positions,
           use "CIV."
   19      Obtain the position number from the UMD (list the complete position number).
   20      Enter the date the requested action is to be implemented if approved. Use the fiscal year-
           then-quarter format; for example, 4th quarter 2002 would be listed as "024."
   21      Obtain information from the UMD. The OSC on the UMD will identify the program type of
           the position. First-line entry for a proposed action is the current location of the authorization.
           Use a minus (-) on the first-line entry indicating where the position currently is located with a
           program type identifier. Table A2.1 lists program type identifiers for field recruiter positions.
           No program type identifiers are used for AFRS headquarters, group, and squadron
           headquarters positions. The second-line entry is the proposed action and location for the
           authorization. Use a plus (+) on the second-line entry indicating where the authorization is
           proposing to be moved. Again, identify the authorization program type, if applicable.



NOTE: Blocks 6 through 9 initiate unit justification. (If additional space is required for justification, use
AFRS Form 1399 continuation sheet or plain bond paper.)
