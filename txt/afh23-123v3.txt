                                             Chapter 1

                                  C001 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview.
     1.1.1. This chapter describes the AFEMS scope, concept, objectives, data system processes,
     file maintenance procedures, management products, policies and specific responsibilities as
     necessary to ensure a continuous accurate storage of equipment item management data.
     1.1.2. This publication may be supplemented at the MAJCOM level or higher, but all
     supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
     certification and approval.
1.2. Scope.
     1.2.1. The provisions of this volume apply to all Air Force activities or personnel involved in
     any aspect of equipment logistics management, as it pertains to C001.
1.3. C001 System Description.
     1.3.1. The AFEMS C001 is designed to provide the United States Air Force (USAF) with a
     dedicated, totally integrated, transaction-driven, processing system that facilitates
     management of equipment resources. AFEMS is a compilation of data from multiple AF,
     Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and base level data systems, which enables the Air
     Force to determine, authorize, account for, and report the types and quantities of equipment
     required to accomplish the Air Force mission. It is used by Air Force Equipment Managers to
     determine, authorize, provide visibility to, and report the types and quantities of equipment
     required to accomplish the Air Force mission, and serves as a primary basis for
     organizational budget/buy programs. AFEMS processes all Air Force data for management
     of support equipment assets. AFEMS allows the Equipment Custodians or Equipment
     Management Elements the ability to create, select, edit, deploy, re-deploy, transfer, and
     reconcile pre-selected deployment packages. It allows the Air Force to comply with the
     Chief Financial Officers ACT of 1990 by reporting and depreciation of in-use and warehouse
     capital assets using depreciation logic and calculations, on-line screens, and reports.
     1.3.2. AFEMS consists of both an Unclassified System and a Classified System. Other
     equipment management components that reside and work congruently with AFEMS include
     the Asset Inventory Management (AIM) component, the Equipment Requirements System
     (ERS) component, the Classified Equipment Requirements Computation (CERC) D039
     component, the electronic Access Request Management System (eARMS) component, and
     the Allowance Standard Retrieval System (ASRS) component. AFEMS is an online
     integrated database, processing 24/7 at Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB), OH.
     1.3.3. The C001 equipment management functions are grouped into six functional areas of
     Organization, Allowance, Asset, Requirements, Item, and Decision Support.
        1.3.3.1. Organization. The organization functional area provides the capability to define
        and maintain organization information such as force structure, organization events, a
        master address table, and War Reserve Materiel (WRM) base code and WRM
        composition codes. Users are able to track all organizations (program document (PD)
        and non-program (Non-PD)) which have support equipment requirements in support of
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     5


     Air Force missions. Organization information is also used to support time-phased
     requirement events and as a control file to edit base records, to indicate event changes,
     and to alert bases when forecast requirements are converted to current requirements (base
     authorizations).
     1.3.3.2. Allowance. The allowance functional area provides the capability to define and
     maintain equipment allowances and quantities of equipment required to perform peace
     and wartime missions. Allowance information is integral in establishing current and
     future (forecasted) requirements and executing user-defined simulations when used in
     conjunction with force structure data. Equipment allowances are grouped into Allowance
     Standards (AS) based on the end item supported for the weapon system, mission or
     organization, known as the Allowance End Item. AS’s are available to equipment users
     through the AFEMS on-line query screens and on the Allowance Standard Retrieval
     System (ASRS). Both are available at https://www.afems.wpafb.af.mil. The ASRS is
     also published on CD-ROM and distributed by the publication office.
        1.3.3.2.1. AS are divided into Mission Application Identity (ID) uniquely identify
        each end item application of the allowance. The allowance Identifier (ID) is a subset
        of the Mission Application Id and Mission Exception Code. Mission exception code
        is a two-position field that allows the same mission application ID to be used for
        more than one allowance ID.
        1.3.3.2.2. The Basis of Issue (BOI) within each Mission Application Id is expressed
        as a narrative, fixed, range or calculated quantity using a formula. These formulas are
        used to determine current allowances and compute future requirements. The BOI
        Indicators and formulas are explained on the Allowance General Text (TGNT) screen
        and in the Allowance Standard Text when the AS is printed.
     1.3.3.3. Asset. The asset functional area provides visibility of physical items or units of
     equipment. Assets are described by condition, serial number and/or vehicle registration
     number, and balance by location to permit visibility for tracking, usage conditions,
     configuration, and life cycle studies.
     1.3.3.4. Requirements. The requirements functional area enables users to establish and
     maintain forecast and current organizational requirements. Requirement information is
     provided quarterly to the item requirements computation (D039) system for determining
     budget and procurement programs. Additionally, this area provides computation of
     vehicle item requirements and maintenance of priority buy and allocation information.
     This area also provides for scheduling of item vehicle depot repair requirements.
     1.3.3.5. Item. The item functional area provides cataloging management data for all
     stock numbers within C001 assigned an expendability, reparability, recoverability
     category (ERRC) of nonexpendable (NF/ND, ERRC S/U); those expendable items
     included in AS or reported as on-hand assets; and items considered as base assigned “L”
     or “P” stock numbers. Cataloging data includes federal supply catalog data,
     interchangeable and substitute (I&S) data, part numbers (PN), and descriptive data for
     excess base assigned stock numbers. Additionally, the item function provides the ability
     to perform equipment management code (EMC) challenges and maintains names,
     addresses, and telephone numbers for the EC, EAE, SCM-R Equipment Activity,
 6                                                               AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


        Command Equipment Management Office (CEMO), AFMC item managers (IM), AMs,
        AFMC program managers, and Air Staff managers.
        1.3.3.6. Decision Support. The decision support functional area aids managers at all
        levels in the decision making process by providing the capability to assess equipage
        posture, perform simulations, compile/obtain functional statistics, and request transaction
        histories and management reports.
1.4. System Objectives.
     1.4.1. The objectives of C001 are: on-line visibility of current authorizations; in-use/in-place

       phased requirements.
1.5. System Restrictions.
   1.5.1. Identification and Authentication Control ensures that individuals are recognized to
   C001. Based on the user profile designation for the classified and/or unclassified system,
   access controls ensure that an individual authorized to perform C001 updates can only
   change information for which access was granted. Every user is granted read access to most
   data on the system(s) for which access was granted.
   1.5.2. While all data within C001 are individually controlled as unclassified, the aggregation
   of certain data elements can result in the generation of classified/sensitive information. The
   rules for determining the sensitivity of aggregated information are detailed in the AFEMS
   Security Classification Guide.
   1.5.3. The C001 establishes and maintains user identification (USERID) information for
   each user. The USERID is used to identify, at a minimum, the user’s name, MAJCOM, user
   profile, and update privileges. Additionally, data discriminators (MAJCOM, manager ID
   code, DODAAC, or organization ID) are used by C001 interactive applications to identify
   access and update privileges. Ch 2 contains instruction on obtaining a USERID.
1.6. Special Features.
   1.6.1. C001 is a relational database management system that gathers and stores equipment
   management data from external interface data systems and through on-line data transaction
   screens, and outputs logistics data to other external interfacing systems.
8                                                              AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


    1.6.2. The following features are established within C001 to maintain cradle-to-grave
    tracking, identify items and requirements needing intensified management, and control the
    level of reporting.
       1.6.2.1. For USAF Centrally Procured (CP) items, permanent procurement history and
       asset information is maintained. A past procurement history is maintained by the contract
       number (procurement instrument identification number [PIIN], Service Provider
       Identification Number [SPIN], Contract Line. Item Number [CLIN]) and includes the
       quantity of assets procured by stock number. A total quantity is maintained for assets
       entering the Air Force inventory through other sources (gain) or leaving the inventory
       (loss).
       1.6.2.2. Asset tracking of shipments, receipts, issues, turn-ins, and inventory adjustments
       for stock numbers assigned EMC 4 or 5. This tracking stops only if the EMC is changed
       from 4 or 5 to 1, 2 or 3. With the exception that base funded excess redistribution
       visibility is maintained for stock numbers assigned EMC 1, 2, and 3.
       1.6.2.3. Conditions of USAF Centrally Procured, base and depot warehouse assets are
       reported to C001 by material condition code and MILSTRAP purpose (depot only). Base
       funded warehouse balances are reported by the SBSS as serviceable and unserviceable.
       1.6.2.4. AS are maintained to determine current allowances and validate authorizations
       and forecasted requirements. MAJCOMs create forecast requirements and C001
       validates quantity authorized for base authorizations. Allowance change notices are
       provided to all affected users on the Message screen. Additionally, C001 provides
       authorization update transactions to the SBSS (D002A) to automatically update
       authorized/in-use detail records in some specific instances. This transaction will be
       provided when:
           1.6.2.4.1. The allowance basis of issue for a stock number is decreased, and the
           current Authorization will exceed the maximum allowance quantity.
           1.6.2.4.2. The stock number in the allowance standard is changed, and the
           authorization is citing the change from stock number.
           1.6.2.4.3. The stock number is transferred to a new allowance and the organization is
           allowed to use it.
           1.6.2.4.4. The stock number is deleted from the allowance standard. The
           authorization will be changed to Allowance Source Code (ASC) 000.
           1.6.2.4.5. There are changes effecting mandatory mobility allowances.
           1.6.2.4.6. There are organization configuration changes which cause the maximum
           allowance quantity to change. This includes deletions, reductions, and mandatory
           mobility.
       1.6.2.5. Registered Equipment Management System (REMS) and vehicle IM functions
       are maintained in C001. The SBSS reports all REMS reportable vehicle assets by vehicle
       registration number. The base transportation function or vehicle IM records the vehicle
       chassis serial number on-line into C001; the vehicle IM assigns new vehicle registration
       numbers on-line and C001 maintains a permanent history. Annually, C001 extracts all
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     9


     vehicle authorizations, in-use/in-place, and allocation and provides this data to the
     vehicle priority buy system.
     1.6.2.6. C001 maintains base funded asset excesses/shortages and provides the SBSS a
     redistribution order (RDO) when a warehouse asset is matched to reported shortages.
     Descriptive data is maintained for reported excess of locally assigned L or P stock
     numbers, when completed by the base reporting the excess.
     1.6.2.7. Users may identify problems and request new functionality by contacting the
     AFEMS Help Desk via e-mail or telecon to identify problems. Contact information is
     listed on the AFEMS Log- On page.
     1.6.2.8. Users may submit a Data Request Record (XJE) anytime they determine the
     balances between AFEMS and SBSS are not in sync.
     1.6.2.9. C001 also initiates reconciliations with SBSS using a system-to-system interface
     to interrogate SBSS for missing data, using a line item reconciliation process. When the
     transaction being processed does not align with the stored record, a reconciliation request
     is sent to SBSS.
     1.6.2.10. C001 also initiates a complete reconciliation for every SRAN reporting to
     AFEMS, on a 6 month cycle. The reconciliation schedule is published on the Support
     Equipment Help page. At the time of semi-annual reconciliation, all rejects/variances
     stored in AFEMS for the SRAN are deleted. As the incoming transactions are processed,
     all edits are performed and rejects/variances are identified.
     1.6.2.11. Small Arms and COMSEC reconciliation transactions are not included in the
     AFEMS reconciliation. Small Arms and COMSEC reconciliations are submitted by the
     base when processing the R46 reconciliation option.

   changes, etc. Supervisors ensure the AFEMS Help Desk is notified when an individual with
   AFEMS access is transferred to another base or AFEMS access is no longer required for the
   individual.
   2.1.8. In accordance with (IAW) Air Force Policy, users must log onto the system at least
   once every 30 days to avoid being suspended for non-use (Guard and Reserve users will have
   90 days before their account is suspended for non-use) and at least once every 120 days to
   avoid being deleted. If the account is deleted, reapply for an account using eARMS.
   2.1.9. If an error message is received when logging in to AFEMS, email the AFEMS Help
   Desk with a digital signature, stating an error message was received when logging onto
   AFEMS. The AFEMS Help Desk notifies the user if they need to reapply or if their account
   has been reactivated and is ready for use.
2.2. User Profiles. When requesting a USERID and password, determination of the correct
profile is the user’s responsibility. There are eight different user profiles to choose from,
depending on the task required to be performed. A read-only profile may also be requested,
which will allow query and read access only. No updates are permitted for the Read-Only
profile. The following paragraphs describe user responsibilities which correspond to user
capabilities for each C001 user profile:

                                  USER FUNCTIONALITY

3.1. C001 design. C001 is designed to provide an equipment management solution for Air
Force managers to rapidly and efficiently respond to changes in organization missions. Most
data in C001 is viewable to all users, but only users assigned specific profiles and data
discriminators may update the data. The data is available through on-line queries and file
maintenance. Reports and datasets may be produced and downloaded to a Personal Computer
(PC).
   3.1.1. The sign-on page contains important messages about the system. Review the messages
   each time you log on. There are also several options across the top of the page, such as;
   Home, Support Equipment, AFEMS Mainframe, Asset Inv Mgt (AIM), Requirements (ERS),
   PacWeb, ASRS Site, System Tools, Contact Us and Logoff.
   3.1.2. C001 creates Notices to alert users of actions requiring attention or to provide
   information. Users should review the Message screen daily to determine conditions effecting
   their account or functionality.
   3.1.3. The on-line screens are available through the “Support Equipment” option. This
   option has all the predefined screens for database query/transaction, assessments, historical
   data, statistical reports, and pre-formatted hard copy reports, or datasets.
   3.1.4. Select desired screen from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen, or by entering
   the functionality in the Function Search or the Favorites menu created by the user. For
   example, if you enter ‘BOI’ in the Function Search bar, the system will display the
   Allowance Standard Inquiry screen. If multiple screens exist for specified search criteria, a
   list is displayed for the user to select the appropriate screen. C001 has 2 types of online
   screens. Usage of the screen varies with each type.
   3.1.5. Interactive screens are employed with fill-in-the-blank design and data fields logically
   grouped to enhance user analysis of retrieved information. Some data on the screen may be
   locked based on the user’s profile. For example, an EC can only update data for their specific
   account, so the Organization Code and Shop Code are locked. Some screens, such as the
   Authorization screen is color coded to show the mandatory fields.
   3.1.6. Screens that are frequently used may be saved as a favorite, and will display on the
   left vertical menu. Depending on the screen, either select the brief case icon in the top right
   corner, next to the HELP (?) icon, or select the “Add to Favs” button in the bottom right
   corner. Use the default name of any name, as desired.
   3.1.7. Interactive information and error messages are displayed on the screen to inform users
   of system activities, such as identifying an erroneous condition or a confirmation message to
   allow the user to cancel or continue processing the transaction.
   3.1.8. All C001 edits are performed according to standard edits. Edits for external
   interfacing systems are prescribed in Ch 5. Explanations of error messages received during
   use of on-line screens are displayed on the screen. Further explanation may be obtained from
   the on-line help or the edit criteria in Ch 5.
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       15


   3.1.9. Errors identified by the edits are displayed on the SBSS Online Reject Program
   (AREJ) screen. Errors are identified as a variance or a reject. A variance means the
   transaction was accepted, but there was an erroneous condition that requires to be fixed. A
   reject means the transaction was not accepted and the data was not updated in AFEMS.
   3.1.10. System Help Availability.
       3.1.10.1. Help is available at both the system, screen and field level.
       3.1.10.2. System Help is available from the SUPPORT EQUIPMENT main menu. The
       left side of the screen has several menu options. Select HELP to open the System Level
       Help page. System Level help provides information such as; Deployment Advisory
       Notices, How to use the system and download datasets, base reconciliation schedule, a
       list of all the online screens and a brief description of each.
       3.1.10.3. Screen help defines the overall function of the screen. It describes the Purpose
       of the screen, a brief overview of the functionality, any cautions about the data and the
       Data Base tables used to display/update from this screen. This is particular useful when
       using Ad Hoc Query or Ad Hoc Reports to identify the appropriate Database tables used.
       3.1.10.4. Accessing Screen Help is dependent on the type screen displayed. Screen help
       is accessed by either selecting the HELP button in the bottom left corner of the screen or
       the HELP icon (?) in the top right corner, depending on type screen.
       3.1.10.5. Field Help, like Screen Help is dependent on the type screen displayed. Field
       help is accessed by either selecting the HELP button in the bottom left corner or placing
       the cursor on the field and press the right mouse button, depending on type screen. The
       field help feature provides the field name, definition, structure, unit of measure (e.g.,
       miles, hours, and minutes), and permissible values.
3.2. AFEMS Mainframe.
   3.2.1. The “AFEMS Mainframe” tab contains the telnet versions of C001. Even though
   WEB AFEMS is CAC enabled, the AFEMS Mainframe option is not and will require a
   separate Userid and Password. Contact the AFEMS Help Desk for assignment and assistance.
   3.2.2. The main functions on this tab are the two types of Ad Hoc capabilities; Ad Hoc
   Query and Ad Hoc Report.
   3.2.3. Ad Hoc Query provides user defined selection criteria with results output for
   immediate on-line review. The Help on the online screens identifies the Database tables
   where the data is stored. Use this option to view the database tables directly. All entries must
   be in upper case letters and properly formatted to return results.
   3.2.4. Ad Hoc Report is for the more experienced users. This option allows users to create
   their own reports and output formats. This is especially helpful when joining multiple tables
   is required to get the desired data. The report is processed in a background mode and the
   results are available for transferring to the PC. The file may be “dragged” to the PC by using
   the FILE menu on the Mainframe tab or by file transfer protocol (FTP) via “DOS”.
3.3. Functionality.
   3.3.1. Updates are sent from SBSS to AFEMS multiple times each day with current
   authorization/in-use (201), warehouse (101), vehicle (214) and serial number records
 16                                                             AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


   (249/250). The frequency is determined by the SBSS. AFEMS accumulates and processes the
   transactions in a batch mode several times each day, depending on how long each batch
   processing takes. Online transactions processed in AFEMS are sent out to the SBSS every
   hour.
   3.3.2. See Table 5.1 to determine transactions sent to C001.
3.4. Account Transactions.
   3.4.1. FCI, FET, FER, FEC, FED, 1ET and 1RB transactions processed in AFEMS are
   referred as Account Transactions, This capability was created in C001 in an effort to
   eliminate erroneous transactions and improve data quality by editing the transactions before
   accepting for processing.
   3.4.2. The online screens were designed to fill in as much data as possible when the screen is
   accessed, depending on the profile of the individual and how the screen is accessed.
   Mandatory fields are highlighted and any required codes are explained on the screen or in
   field help. System performs all edits and the transaction will not process until all edits are
   passed.
   3.4.3. Account Transaction processing requires a response from D002 before the record in
   AFEMS is permanently updated. When a transaction is input in AFEMS, it is validated and
   passes all edits or else an error message is displayed identifying the error for correction.
   Upon processingC001 will create a suspense record and send the transaction to D002 for
   processing. After processing in D0002, an update is sent back to C001. C001 processes the
   transaction, deletes the suspense and updates the Data Base tables.
   3.4.4. If the suspense is not cleared in C001 within 24 hours, check Function 444, in D002,
   for a reject. The suspense can be re-submitted in C001 from the Suspense screen after
   corrections are made. If C001 does not receive a confirmation transaction from D002; the
   transaction will be resent on the 4th and 7th day. If still no transaction is received from D002,
   after 10 days, the transaction is deleted from suspense and an interrogation (XJE) is sent to
   D002.
      3.4.4.1. 1ET, FME and FED transactions are not authorized for NWRM equipment.
      Contact the 635 SCOW for processing instructions. Instead of processing 1ETX, refer to
      AFMAN 23-122, 5.7.4.4.7.1.3 and 5.7.4.4.7.2.3 on page 280 for processing of TRIC IAD
      with proper supporting documentation. Due to a 1 to 4 hour transaction delay between
      AFEMS and ESS, the AFEMS Account Transactions flag may be turned OFF under 635
      SCOW authority for time-sensitive mission needs. Unit EAE or MAJCOM CEMO must
      provide specific justification for the task to be accomplished and a narrow, specified
      timeframe as defined by the situation, to turn the AFEMS flag OFF via the 635/735
      SCMG web pages.
          3.4.4.1.1. Requests will then be automatically routed to the 437/440 SCOS EMEs to
          be approved/denied within 24 hours. If a disagreement exists, the 437/440 SCOS will
          attempt to resolve the issue with the respective MAJCOM CEMO who may elevate to
          their MAJCOM/A4R (if necessary) for final approval/denial adjudication in
          coordination with the 635/735 SCOG/CC. The 437/440 SCOS are responsible for
          documenting the reasons why the AFEMS             Account Transactions flag has been
          turned OFF.
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     17


3.5. Allowance Standards.
   3.5.1. AS are created and maintained in C001 by Allowance Managers. AS are designed and
   structured to support a particular end item or mission. Allowances prescribe items and
   maximum quantities required to perform assigned peacetime and wartime missions,
   functions, and duties of Air Force organizations and individual specialists. Allowances are
   for the Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) master stock number. A master stock
   number should not be substituted for another master stock number. Allowances are used with
   force structure information which includes programmed phasing data to prepare time-phased
   requirements and to perform user defined simulations.
   3.5.2. Each AS consists of four main parts:
      3.5.2.1. Allowance Standard Text. The Allowance Standard Text:
          3.5.2.1.1. Describes the overall purpose and structure of the Allowance Standard.
          3.5.2.1.2. Identifies the target users.
          3.5.2.1.3. Describes how to interpret the Basis of Issue format.
          3.5.2.1.4. Provides a cross-reference list of end item to AS.
      3.5.2.2. Allowance Index. The Allowance Index provides descriptive information for
      each Allowance Id, to include:
          3.5.2.2.1. Allowance Id.
          3.5.2.2.2. Mission Description.
          3.5.2.2.3. End Item.
          3.5.2.2.4. Restrictive data for each Allowance ID (MAJCOM, Unit Kind Code, Unit
          Type Code, etc.).
      3.5.2.3. Basis of Issue (BOI). Provides BOI information for stock numbers within an
      Allowance ID. Total authorized quantity for is determined based upon the organization
      configuration information and the BOI.
      3.5.2.4. SERD information. SERD information is provided to Allowance Managers to
      create allowances for new/modified weapon systems. Provides Source Equipment
      Requirements Data for weapon systems and links the SERD information to specific
      Allowance Ids
3.6. Allowance Change Request (ACR).
   3.6.1. ACRs are used to request changes to Allowance Standards, approvals of
   miscellaneous authorizations (e.g., 041, 048, etc.) and an evaluation form for ACR
   evaluators. All user profiles have access to the screens. ACR should be used for equipment
   requests for all items that are accounted for in AFEMS. With the following exceptions;
      3.6.1.1. Any classified information.
      3.6.1.2. Explosive Ordnance Disposal Equipment (FSCs 1385 & 1386).
      3.6.1.3. Special Weapons.
      3.6.1.4. Multiple Items requests.

      3.6.1.5. C-CS authorization Changes.
      3.6.1.6. NOCM items.
3.7. Allowance Registration.
   3.7.1. Organizations are allowed to use specific BOIs within an Allowance Standard based
   upon the Organization Registration process. AFEMS compares organization and allowance
   data to determine specific organization IDs allowed to use the allowance id. The data that is
   compared between the Organization Id and the allowance ID is dependent on the specific end
   item type assigned to each Allowance Id.
   3.7.2. There are 2 ways an Organization Id can be registered.
      3.7.2.1. Automatic Registration is accomplished by AFEMS by comparing specific
      organizational data and Allowance Id data. Comparison requirements are divided into
      categories based upon the specific end item. Comparison requirements are divided into
      categories based upon the specific end item. The organization record must match the
      allowance restrictive data depending on end item type. If the allowance does not have
      restrictive data, it matches anything on the organization record.
      3.7.2.2. Manual registration is accomplished by the Allowance Managers by entering a
      ‘Y’ in the Org Specific field on the Allowance Standard Summary (TEIS) screen. When
      an allowance id is coded as Org Specific, it is excluded from the Automatic Registration.
   3.7.3. Determine the Specific End Item on the End Item Cross Reference screen (TECR).
   Enter the Specific End item on the End Item Identity (OEII) screen to determine the Type
   End Item.
      3.7.3.1. If the Type End Item on the End Item Identity (OEII) screen is not blank,
      AFEMS matches the Specific End Item, Maintenance Level, MAJCOM, Unit Kind Code,
      Log Plan Report Code, Maintenance Type, Mobility Type, Aerospace Config Code and
      Purpose ID on the organization ID and the Allowance Id.
      3.7.3.2. If the Type End Item on the End Item Identity (OEII) screen is blank, AFEMS
      matches the MAJCOM, Unit Kind Code, Log Plan Report Code, Maintenance Type and
      the Mobility Type on the organization ID and the Allowance Id.
      3.7.3.3. If the Type End Item on the End Item Identity (OEII) screen is blank, and there
      is no restrictive data on the Allowance Standard Summary (TEIS) screen, then all Org
      IDs are registered.
   3.7.4. After the organization is registered, the system computes total allowed quantities
   based upon stored organization configuration data. It is essential for current and accurate
   configuration data be maintained for each organization. If the Configuration code is EI, the
   organization quantities are maintained by the MAJCOM on the Organization ID cannot be
   updated by the custodian or Logistics Readiness Squadron/Materiel Management Activity or
   equivalent. If the Configuration Code is EI and the Type End Item is not blank and not equal
   to MDS, then the configuration quantities are derived from the data on Page 2 of the
   Organization Information (OMOI) screen. If the Configuration Code is EI and the Type End
   Item is MDS, the configuration quantities are derived from the data on the Support
   Organization Data (OSPT) screen.
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                         19


3.8. Deploy/Redeploy/Return assets.
   3.8.1. Allows users to deploy, redeploy and return assets from deployments. Capability
   exists for users to create a deployment package using several criteria and save it for future
   use. The package can be edited, copied, deleted, partially or fully deployed/returned.
   Quantities within the package can be changed to deploy/return only a partial of the full
   quantity. Once deployed, users may request reports to use on the deployments or identify
   overdue returns.
3.9. Serialized Reporting.
   3.9.1. D002 sends serialized transactions for Small Arms, COMSEC and vehicle transactions
   to C001 to maintain a central database for serialized assets. Serial numbers cannot be added
   to in-use or warehouse records in AFEMS. All serial numbers either in-use or warehouse
   must be updated in D002 and sent to C001 via interface.
3.10. Capital Reporting.
   3.10.1. Capital Assets are assets that exceed the acquisition cost of $100k, and estimated
   useful life of two years or more. C001 identifies potential capital assets based on the unit
   price exceeding the capital threshold and displays them on the In-Use Serialized Asset
   screen. Vehicles are updated automatically and do not require any manual updates. A notice
   is also placed in the message folder advising of the new record requiring update.
   3.10.2. Users may query the In-Use Serialized Asset screen and update the mandatory
   entries, including the Acquisition Cost. If the Acquisition Cost is less than the capital
   threshold, the asset is no longer considered a capital asset. If the cost is equal or greater than
   the threshold, the asset is depreciated and reported to DFAS. C001 computes depreciation
   monthly and reports to SAF/FM until the asset is completely depreciated. Vehicles are
   depreciated over a 5 year period and all other assets are depreciated over a 10 year period.
   3.10.3. Capital leases mainly apply to vehicles, but are not limited to vehicles. Capital leases
   transfer all the benefits and risks of ownership to the lessee. They are depreciated over the
   life of the lease or the depreciation term, whichever is shorter. To be classified as a capital
   lease (as opposed to an operating lease), the lease must meet one of the following criteria:
       3.10.3.1. The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the
       lease term,
       3.10.3.2. The lease contains an option to purchase the leased property at a bargain price,
       3.10.3.3. The lease term is equal to or greater than 75% of the estimated economic life of
       the leased property,
       3.10.3.4. The present value of rental and other minimum lease payments, equals or
       exceeds 90% of the fair value of the leased property
3.11. In-Use Serialized Assets.
   3.11.1. The In-Use Serialized Assets screen is used to update CFO and non-CFO asset
   information. Use the drop-downs to distinguish search criteria. Assets are automatically
   added to the screen as in-use details are reported to AFEMS. Changes to in-use assets that are
   initiated in C001 are automatically updated. Changes not initiated in C001 will require
   manual updates on the In-Use Serialized Assets screen.
 20                                                            AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


   3.11.2. The In-Use Serialized Assets screen has the capability to identify out-of-balance
   conditions for each detail. When a turn-in (TIN) is processed in D002, C001 is notified of a
   decrease in the detail balance. When the in-use serialized asset is greater than the actual in-
   use quantity, a recon indicator is added to the record. The recon indicator will remain on the
   record until the user validates or deletes the record on the RECON screen, by identifying the
   type action that removed the asset from the account, on the pop-up. The RECON screen is
   accessed by selecting the RECON tab on the In-Use Serialized Assets screen.
3.12. Readiness Status Assessment.
   3.12.1. The Readiness Assessment screen provides an overview of the total asset position in
   support of the specified selection criteria. Also, a list of equipment shortages and/or
   unserviceable items sorted by Stock Number Assessment may be viewed based on several
   search key combinations:
       3.12.1.1. SRAN and Unit Type Code.
       3.12.1.2. SRAN and End Item ID.
       3.12.1.3. ORG ID and End Item ID.
       3.12.1.4. ORG ID.
3.13. Deployment Assessment.
   3.13.1. Deployment Assessment Information allows the comparison of an organization's on-
   hand assets against assets at a deploying SRAN to determine equipment shortages. Mobility
   items (Use Code A), for a particular organization and WRM and Joint Use Assets in support
   of mobility equipment shortages are displayed for review, to identify assets at the deploying
   location that may be used to fill shortages. The shortage position is computed by subtracting
   the In-Use/In place Quantity from the Authorized Quantity.
3.14. Vehicles.
   3.14.1. C001 has full functionality for managing vehicles from loading the vehicle
   registration numbers to tracking in-use vehicles and everything in between. Most vehicle
   records are updated in C001 via automated interface.
3.15. Redistribution of Local Funded Assets.
   3.15.1. AFEMS receives records of excess local purchase (Budget Code 9/Z) assets and
   memo due-outs for local purchase assets. The excesses are matched against the memo due-
   out and redistribution orders are sent to redistribute the asset to fill the memo due-out. The
   Redistributed Base Funded Statistics screen allows the user to establish criteria for creating a
   redistribution Base Funded Statistics report for excesses assets redistributed by C001.

                                          Chapter 4

                              MAJCOM RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Organization Records.
   4.1.1. MAJCOMs and Field Operating Agencies/Direct Reporting Units are responsible for
   establishing and maintaining accurate organization records (also known as Reporting
   Organization File) for each of their subordinate units and for all non-Air Force units they
   sponsor. All organization record updates are made on the classified processor. The
   unclassified records are passed to the unclassified processor each evening during the Air Gap
   Process. Adds, changes and deletes of the organization data is sent via interface from the
   unclassified processor to SBSS (D002A) to update organizational records at the base level.
   The SBSS organization ID record must be loaded in SBSS before an organization account
   code can be loaded.
   4.1.2. The Organization Record is uniquely identifiable by a 12 position Organization
   Identification Code. Information found in these records includes the organization's location;
   Force Activity Designator; end items possessed (such as aircraft and missiles); current and
   future end item phasing schedules; Unit Type Codes; and other pertinent data.
   4.1.3. Organization information is derived from a number of sources. The USAF
   Programming Document (PD) is the official source for AF unit information to include
   numbers of weapon systems currently possessed and/or projected. Official sources for Non-
   PD units are special orders, contracts, support agreements, Personnel Accounting Symbol
   (PAS) Organization Register, or other correspondence. AFEMS receives all current PD
   releases through a system-to-system interface. AFEMS compares the PD data with AFEMS
   organization data and then generates a Comparison Report for each Major Command to
   identify discrepancies. AFEMS will generate a notification message on the classified
   processor, for each command.
   4.1.4. Upon reviewing the report, the commands may choose the PD overlay option to let
   AFEMS process the changes automatically, or they may manually update AFEMS. If the
   MAJCOM determines the PD overlay is appropriate, use the Program Document Update
   Request (OPDU) screen to turn on the PD overlay option. The PD overlay is processed two
   weeks from the time the comparison report is generated and only changes to the selected
   command(s), FOA(s), or DRU(s) will be processed. If the PD overlay is processed, all non-
   PD organizations without the non-PD indicator assigned will be deleted.
   4.1.5. AFEMS uses the organization data to determine authorized users of the AS and to
   compute total Basis of Issues (BOI) for organizations. AFEMS users may view organization
   information to help understand how it relates to specific allowance information, but only the
   parent MAJCOM can update the data.
   4.1.6. Organization data and Allowance data are used together to give the Major Commands
   the capability to forecast future requirements for weapon system activations or deactivations.
   4.1.7. All organization data is maintained on the Organization Identifier. The Organization
   Identifier is composed of 4 different elements;
 22                                                           AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


      4.1.7.1. Org Number (4 positions) -. The actual organization number, prefixed with
      zeros, is used for air force numbered organizations. I.e. org number for 10 ABW is 0010;
      four zeros are used for unnumbered air force organizations. I.e. org number for HQ AMC
      is 0000; and the geographic location indicator for non-air organizations.
      4.1.7.2. Unit Kind Code (3 positions) - Unit Kind Code consists of three Alphanumeric
      digits and identifies the type Organization such as "ALF" for airlift Organizations, "AIG"
      aircraft generation Organization, etc.
      4.1.7.3. Org Level Code (1 position) - Identifies the level (1 - 8) of the organization
      within the chain of command. Brief definition is 1 = HQ Air Force, 2 = MAJCOMs and
      Separate Operating Agencies, 3 = Numbered Air Forces, 4 = Air Divisions (no longer
      used), 5 = Wings, 6 = Groups, 7 = Squadrons and 8 = Misc Organizations.
      4.1.7.4. Detachment Number (4 positions) - Will be all zeros unless the special orders
      identify the organization as a detachment or operating location, i.e., Detachment (Det) -
      Det 7 = 0007, Det 17 = 0017, Operating Location (OL) - O A = 0A00, OLC = 0C00, OL
      AB = AB00. A detachment with an OL would be configured the same as the preceding,
      i.e., Det 7, OL A = 0A07.
4.2. Creating Organization Information Records.
   4.2.1. The Organization Information Record is loaded in AFEMS by the parent Reporting
   Organization File (ROF) Monitor using the Organization Information (OMOI) screen on the
   classified system. It consists of 2 pages.
      4.2.1.1. Page 1 is used to load/update the organization specific details such as, Org
      Name, SRAN, phasing Status, UTCs, etc.
      4.2.1.2. Page 2 is used to load and link specific End Items owned by the Organization.
      Only end items that have an assigned Item Type Code (not blank) on End Item Identity
      Data (OEII) screen should be loaded on OMOI page two.
   4.2.2. If the Item Type Code on End Item Identity Data (OEII) screen is ‘MDS’ the
   organization supporting the end item must be loaded on the Support Organization Data
   (OSPT) screen to link supporting (maintenance) organization to the organization that owns or
   possesses the aircraft or missile.
   4.2.3. Organizations will automatically be registered to applicable Allowance IDs in AS
   when owning and/or supporting organizational end item data match the Allow ID registration
   criteria.
   4.2.4. The Organization Change Request (ORCR) screen allows the MAJCOM to change to
   a single record or multiple records. For example, changing a Unit Kind Code within a
   command from CLM to MAI, or changing all 2750th organizations to 0088.
   4.2.5. The Organization Delete Request (ORDR) provides the capability to process a single
   delete or a mass delete of organizations meeting specified criteria.
   4.2.6. The Major Command Mass Change Request (OMCC) provides the capability to add,
   change, or delete Command Codes and/or Major Command Abbreviation. Once initiated, the
   actions on this screen will not process for 6 months to enable all the system interfaces to be
   notified.
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       23


   4.2.7. The Organization Event Review Request (OERR) provides the capability to query and
   display phased events for Organization and End Item information. This screen is useful for
   displaying past due events, such as organizations reported as activating, but the activation
   date is older than the current date. This screen only displays Phased Organization and End
   Item information where the Program Action Code (PAC) is other than B (In-Being).
   4.2.8. Deleting Organization Information Files.
      4.2.8.1. If an Organization Information Record needs to be deleted, all associated data on
      the OSPT record must be deleted first, then the information on page two of the OMOI
      screen before AFEMS will allow the deletion the organization information record. Also,
      if a forecast package exists, it must first be deleted on the Select Forecast Requirements
      (RSFR) screen.
4.3. Forecast Records.
   4.3.1. MAJCOMS can forecast for future requirements on the C001 classified processor.
   Forecasts identify specific organizational requirements (stock numbers and quantities)
   required to support future end item increases and decreases. Major commands tailor each
   forecast package to meet specific organization needs. Forecast packages can be converted to
   authorizations when the event has been de-classified and the organization and shop code has
   been aligned to each forecast requirement.
4.4. Forecasting for Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMEL) Support
Equipment (SE).
   4.4.1. If the organization requires PMEL support, the supporting base PMEL organization
   identity and GLI must be entered on page one of Organization Information (OMOI) screen.
4.5. Forecasting Procedures.
   4.5.1. Initial system generated forecasting is accomplished using the Support Organization
   Data (OSPT) screen. Forecasting cannot be accomplished until the applicable organizational
   information records have been established or updated on the Organization Information
   (OMOI) and the Support Organization Data (OSPT) screens.
   4.5.2. When the Support Organization Data (OSPT) screen is updated, a “Y” must be
   entered in the FCST IND (Y) field and the applicable phase date for each support
   organization. AFEMS will then build the forecasting records needed to accomplish the
   required forecasts, during the next batch processing cycle, usually overnight.
   4.5.3. Once the forecast records have been created, the MAJCOM maintains the forecast
   records on the Select Forecast Requirements (RSFR) and Adjust Forecast Requirements
   (RAFR) screens.
4.6. Activations and Mission Changes.
   4.6.1. The Select Forecast Requirements (RSFR) screen provides a list of forecast
   requirements based on one, or a combination of the search key fields. When only a portion
   of the required search key information is known, or only specific data is needed (i.e., if all
   the requirements for an end item are needed, only enter the end item identity (EII), if only the
   requirements for a specific organization is desired, enter the EII and Organization Identity
   [Org ID]). The Select Forecast Requirements (RSFR) screen may be used to select a desired
 24                                                             AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


   forecast package (specific allowance IDs) for viewing/tailoring on the Adjust Forecast
   Requirements (RAFR) screen.
   4.6.2. The action code field at the top of the Select Forecast Requirements (RSFR) screen
   controls the maintenance at the package level. Add/copy is accomplished at the package
   level. All search keys are required to add/copy, EII, organization identity, phasing status and
   installation code.
   4.6.3. After the forecast is selected, the system transfers to Adjust Forecast Requirements
   (RAFR).
   4.6.4. The top section action code of the Adjust Forecast Requirements (RAFR) screen
   controls action at the package level. Only adds and deletes are permitted at the package
   level. An add is accomplished by copying and then modifying an existing forecast package.
   This allows the user to retrieve an existing forecast that is structured similarly to the forecast
   the user wants to create, and then modify the data for the new forecast.
4.7. Forecast Package Change and Deletes.
   4.7.1. It may be necessary to change or delete a forecast package once it has been submitted
   due to the receipt of updated PDs or allowance changes.
   4.7.2. To add/ delete or change a record in a Forecast Package, first query the package on the
   Select Forecast Requirements (RSFR) screen, then select the desired forecast package, by
   entering ‘S’ in the Select Record column, press return. Selecting the forecast package will
   transfer to the Adjust Forecast Requirements (RAFR) screen, to add, change or delete the
   record.
      4.7.2.1. Add a record to a Forecast Package.
          4.7.2.1.1. Enter the stock number to be added (action code “A”) on the RAFR screen
          and enter.
      4.7.2.2. Tailor a Forecast Package.
          4.7.2.2.1. Make the necessary changes (action code “C” for changes and “D” for
          deletes) to the forecasted items and quantities and enter.
      4.7.2.3. Delete a Record from a Forecast Package.
          4.7.2.3.1. If the forecast subpackage requires deletions, enter a “D” in the top section
          action code field. If a stock number or multiple stock numbers require deletion, enter
          a “D” in the action code field at the bottom of the screen and select the items to be
          deleted from the forecast package.
4.8. Dated Forecast Authorization Equipment Data (DFAED).
   4.8.1. To create or update a DFAED, select the Adjust Forecast Requirements (RAFR)
   screen. Enter the ORG ID, Phasing Status, INSTL CODE, Allowance Identity and a “Y” in
   the Enter Y for DFAED field. The UTC and AEROSP VEH CONFIG should be entered if
   applicable (End Item Identity is not required). Each item required may then be added in the
   bottom portion of the screen.
   4.8.2. After the DFAED has been entered, allow the system time to process the updates,
   usually overnight. Verify the updates were accepted by checking the appropriate screens.
AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   25

   4.17.2. Select the RPFC (Prepare Forecast Conversion Program) screen. Enter the required
   search keys for the organization forecast being converted to current authorizations. Enter the
   organizations ORG CD and SHOP CD and enter the data.
   4.17.3. Verify the RQMT_FCST_DB has been properly updated.
4.18. Identify Forecast Problem Items.
   4.18.1. Force Structure Events (DFSE). Displays a list of organizations for the user to
   select from for the purpose of accessing a more detailed view of supporting Stock Number
   information for forecast problem items. This is the first in a three screen series used to
   identify forecast problem items and provide forecast data for an assessment of impacts. The
   secondary screens, Force Structure Events Impact (DFSI) and Potential Improved Equipage
   (DPIE) are used to support the assessment. This set of screens provides a view of problem
   items that do not support scheduled events due to the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD)
   exceeding the Need Date or insufficient due-ins to meet requirements. Also provided is a
   worldwide delivery schedule to determine availability to support scheduled events.
   4.18.2. Force Structure Events Impact (DFSI). Enter an S in the SEL CD field on the Force
   Structure Events (DFSE) screen to select a specific record. This screen is displayed and
   provides a list, sorted by Stock Number, of problem items that do not support a scheduled
   event because the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) exceeds the need date or insufficient due-
   ins are available to meet requirements.
   4.18.3. Potential Improved Equipage (DPIE). Enter an S in the SEL CD field on the Force
   Structure Events (DFSI) screen to select a specific record. This action allows you to view the
   worldwide delivery schedule for a selected Stock Number. If the selected Stock Number is a
   Sub-Group Master Stock Number, the program retrieves all Stock Numbers within the I&S
   Sub-Group from the Interchangeable & Substitutable Table and uses these Stock Numbers to
   retrieve worldwide asset information.
   4.18.4. Requirements Assessment (DRQA). The DRQA provides the online capability to
   identify forecast stock numbers and quantities not currently included in the RDB totals in
   order to recompute a new net requirement quantity. If a forecast was created after the last
   extract for RDB computation, this data was not included in the computation, thus providing a
   distorted picture of the true stock number position. This screen includes these new records in
   the computation to provide a more up to date picture of requirements and assets for a
   particular stock number. The system retrieves existing forecast requirements based on the
   Org Id, Phase Date and Program Action Code and enters them into a database for later batch
   processing. These records are applied to the latest RDB computation results and are used to
   compute a new net requirement and produce the Computed Requirements-By-Quarter
   Report, which reflects requirements phased over 28 quarters. The Computed Requirements-
   By-Quarter Report is output as a dataset.
4.19. Simulations.
   4.19.1. All simulations are executed and remain on the classified processor. Simulations
   perform a "what if" situation. All simulations are created through the retrieval and validation
30                                                            AFH23-123V3 8 AUGUST 2013


  of variable data required in the simulation of such events as: peculiar items not available to
  support programmed moves; identifying items required to support a specific end item
  application; identifying item and cost requirements computed to support a designated number
  of aircraft or type of end item application; defining the requirements to support optional joint
  use of assets; defining the impacts and requirements to convert existing contractor operated
  activities to Air Force operated wartime organizations; determining the impacts and planning
  requirements for such events as activations, operation plans, mission, unit moves, or
  equipage of units with new or modified end item applications.
  4.19.2. Variable data, such as activation, activation date, and identity of the activating
  organization are validated against the appropriate force structure for completeness and
  accuracy. Validated variable data is used with appropriate algorithms to perform simulations.
  Data such as cost, assets, activations, unit moves, mission, organization, location,
  requirements, equipment, etc., is retrieved for user simulation.
  4.19.3. Data entered for simulations do not update the actual data stored in the AFEMS data
  base. The values you enter are used to retrieve data necessary to compute a new simulated
  forecast package and output the Computed Requirements by Quarter Simulated Totals Report
  which produces 28 quarters of time phased requirements for each Stock Number.
  4.19.4. There are several screens available specifically created to perform simulations.
     4.19.4.1. Phase Date Simulation (DAPS). The DAPS allows users to assess the impact
     to forecast requirements when simulating a change to the End Item/Organization Event
     Phase Date as it applies to either an in-being Organization with programmed actions or an
     organization that is being activated. It provides the capability to determine the effect on
     asset availability for forecasted requirements if the Phase Date were to change. The
     screen requires the entry of three search keys: ORG ID, ALLOWANCE END ITEM
     IDENTITY, and PHASE DATE. The screen displays the organizations current Program
     Action Code and Phase Date under the CURRENT column. You may then enter the
     simulated Phase Date under the CHANGE column.
     4.19.4.2. Activation-Deactivation Simulation (DADS). The DADS allows users to
     establish parameters to simulate activation or a deactivation of one organization. The
     values entered are used to retrieve the data necessary to compute a new simulated
     forecast package and output it as the Computed Requirements-by-Quarter Report.
     Required search keys are the Org ID, Phase Date and Activation/Deactivation indicator.
     To simulate activation, the End Item Identity and End Item must also be entered, as a
     minimum.
     4.19.4.3. EII-EIQ Simulation (DEPS). The DEPS allows the simulation an End Item
     Identity and/or End Item Quantity change to a current in-being organization. Provides
     the capability to simulate the overall effect an end item change or an increase or decrease
     in the number of aircraft supported would have on the asset position of an organization.
     Enter the Org Id, End Item ID, and if applicable, the Config ID (Aerospace Config
     Code), which can be blank. The screen displays the data applicable to the Org id under
     the CURRENT column. Enter the desired changes to the current data in the CHANGE
     column. If a change is not desired, enter the value(s) from the CURRENT column into
     the CHANGE column.

     4.19.4.4. Organization Simulation (DMOS). The DMOS allows the user to simulate the
     move of an existing organization to another location. Enter Org ID, Phase Date, End
     Item ID, End Item Quantity and any other applicable fields on the screen.
     4.19.4.5. Base Closure Simulation (DBCS). The DBCS allows the simulation of a base
     closure to assess the impacts of the closures and the effect on budget requirements. A list
     of current in-being organizations with no programmed action or organizations with
     programmed actions that have an event Phasing Date beyond the simulated closure date
     (includes other command tenants). The Parent Major Command Abbreviation, the
     Program Action Code, and, if applicable, the Phase Dates for each organization supported
     by the specified SRAN. Determine, for each organization listed, whether the organization
     will be deactivated (simulated Program Action Code Y) or moved to a new location
     (simulated Program Action Code M). Action must be completed on all organizations
     before the simulation can be implemented.

                             EDITS AND ERROR REPORTING

5.1. Edits and Error Reporting.
   5.1.1. C001 identifies and creates suspense records for erroneous conditions. The suspense is
   identified as either a Reject or Variance. A Reject is created when a transaction is received
   and the data values are not formatted correctly or the mandatory values cannot be
   determined. The record is not processed and no updates occur. A Variance is created when
   the format is correct, but the values do not pass the edits. The record is processed and the
   C001 is updated. Edit processing is accomplished either on-line (correct as you go) or by
   batch process (from external interfacing systems).
   5.1.2. On-line data entries are rejected at the time of input when entered data fails edit and
   validation criteria. The error message is displayed on the screen. For more detailed
   explanation and corrective actions, refer to the screen help.
   5.1.3. All transactions received from D002 are edited to ensure accuracy. All D002 data
   transactions, which fail C001 edits, are placed in a reject suspense file. These reject/variance
   notices are viewed on the SBSS Online Reject screen. The screen help provides instructions
   for clearing and resubmitting the transaction. In some cases the erroneous condition must be
   cleared in D002 before the transaction is resubmitted in C001. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1,
   Ch 5, for a list of all C001 edit codes and corrective actions. See Table 5.1. for the Decision
   Logic Table for Equipment Transaction Reporting.
   5.1.4. The UTCVAR report was created to identify the most common variance conditions. It
   is processed weekly. The records appearing on the Reject Suspense screen are only created as
   the result of processing a transaction. The records appearing on the UTCVAR report are not
   transaction dependent. The variances are produced by extracting the records from internal
   and applying the edits. The erroneous condition must be corrected for the variance to be
   cleared.    Edit codes appearing on the report include;
      5.1.4.1. JB – Exceeds allowed quantities
      5.1.4.2. RB – Organization not registered for allowance
      5.1.4.3. IK – Stock number not in Allowance ID
      5.1.4.4. RC – Invalid Allowance ID
      5.1.4.5. HL – Authorization not on Vehicle Authorization Listing (VAL)
      5.1.4.6. Out of ISG – Substitute detail stock number not in I&SG of the Authorized stock
      number

Notes:

1. Edits/decision logic for reverse-post transactions are the same as for the original transaction.
2. If the transaction budget code is V, the vehicle registration number is placed in the output transaction in lieu of the
quantity.
3. This edit is made on the 3 LSC of the 901-SUP-REQUISITIONER element for the value TRM.
4. This is applicable to project code 440 (NATO) only.
5. MILSTRIP service code (position 1 of SRAN) is unequal to B, D, E, F, J, K, P, and T.
6. A2x/A4x/SHP - To determine the appropriate reason code, edit the 901-SUP-REQUISITIONER for a matching
MSC; if not matched, edit the MSC of the 901-MARK-FOR (5-10) to determine the appropriate reason code.
7. Provide a zero quantity if the status detail is deleted.
8. FME - FME action code T will create the XJU, and FME action code L will create the XGH.
9. XJE - If the TTPC equals 4H and the 901-ISSUE-PRIORITY equals JM, only an XGG will be produced. If the
TTPC equals 4H or 2X and the 901-FUND-CODE equals JL, an XGJ with an N FMC will be produced.
10. AFEMS requires the reporting of all TRM regardless of SCC or DAC.
11. For reason codes TAX or TXA, the authority for issue code (AFI) is unequal to A, B, or D.
12. For reason code AMY, the type balance code is D. For reason code AUY, the type balance code is B.
13. Do not include EMC 4 or 5 transactions.
14. Do not send XGJs for item code D
15. Concerns all activity code E transactions.
16. If record specified in XJE interrogation is not found in SBSS, original XJE is returned to AFEMS with NL in
positions 55-56 indicating negative reply.
17. Covers all organization codes (100-999).
18. Concerns only stock numbers with an L or P in the fifth position.
19. See Data Request Record (XJE) Output.
20. Reason code is SA0 when positions 1-2 of gaining SRAN equal FE, FW, or FD, or gaining SRAN equals
FB2029, FB2039, FB2065, FB2129, FB2377, or FB7030. For all other gaining SRANs, reason code will be SAS.
21. DIT creates XSA if memo flag = 1 (memo due-out) or XSD if memo flag = O (firm due-outs)
