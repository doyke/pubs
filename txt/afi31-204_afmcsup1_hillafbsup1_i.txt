       1.1.2.2. When traffic operations under military supervision necessitate special measures to meet
       mission unique requirements or to protect public safety.
    1.1.3. Safe and efficient movement of personnel and vehicles is the objective of every traffic control
    program. Program goals should focus on ways to reduce traffic-related deaths, injuries, and property
    damage.

1.2. Responsibilities.
    1.2.1. Air Force Chief of Security Police (HQ USAF/SP). Establishes policy to assist installation
    commanders in the administration of local traffic supervision and enforcement programs.
    1.2.2. Air Force Security Police Agency (HQ AFSPA). Provides guidance to MAJCOMs and field
    units on implementing traffic safety and supervision programs.
    1.2.3. Major Command Chief of Security Police (MAJCOM/SP). Each MAJCOM/SP manages com-
    mand unique traffic supervision and enforcement programs. They provide key staff support to instal-
    lation commanders and their assigned security police units.
    1.2.4. Installation Commander. Establishes and manages the local installation traffic supervision pro-
    gram. They have broad authority to regulate the movement of traffic and personnel on their installa-
    tions. Each must develop local procedures to ensure safe pedestrian and vehicle traffic. To meet goals
    and objectives, installation commanders integrate safety, engineering, legal, and law enforcement
    resources into their traffic review and planning processes.
    1.2.5. Chief of Security Police. The CSP is the installation commander's principal advisor on issues
    pertaining to the safe movement of personnel and traffic. The CSP exercises staff responsibility for
    directing, regulating, and controlling traffic, and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic con-

   dards in the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways. They also
   ensure planning, design, construction, and maintenance of streets and highways conform to National
   Highway Safety Program Standards, and where applicable, host nation requirements.
   1.2.8. Installation Traffic Engineer. Traffic engineers conduct formal traffic engineering studies.
   They apply traffic engineering measures and control devices to reduce the number and severity of traf-
   fic accidents. If there is no installation traffic engineer, the installation commander may request sup-
   port services by contacting the Commander, Military Traffic Management Command, 5611 Columbia
   Pike, Falls Church VA 22041-5050.
   1.2.9. Mental Health Office. The mental health substance abuse control program provides alcohol/
   drug education, treatment, and rehabilitation to personnel identified with alcohol and/or drug abuse
   problems.

1.3. Delegation Of Authority. Installation commanders can delegate their authority under this instruc-
tion to their vice commander, support group commander, or other appropriate official. Those selected for
delegation must not occupy a law enforcement, investigative, or other position which might lead to a con-
flict of interest or the appearance of such conflict during their administration of the motor vehicle traffic
supervision program. Installation commanders must coordinate their letters of delegation through their
installation staff judge advocate
1.3. (HILL) Delegation of Authority. The Ogden Air Logistics Center Commander (OO-ALC/CC) has
delegated his authority under AFI 31-204, to the 75th Air Base Wing Commander (75 ABW/CC).

                                                Chapter 2

                                       DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges.
    2.1.1. Driving a government owned vehicle (GOV) or POV on an Air Force installation is a privilege
    granted by the installation commander. If you accept that privilege, you must comply with the laws
    and instructions governing motor vehicle operation and registration on the installation. Consequently,
    everyone operating a motor vehicle on a military installation must produce, upon request from the
    security police, the following:
    2.1.1. (HILL) Unless contravened by military instructions, policies or exigencies, the Utah Motor
    Vehicle Code is applicable to traffic and vehicles on base. In accordance with the provisions of this
    supplement, paved base roadways are open to the use of the public, but are subject to military require-
    ments. Operation of privately owned vehicles (POV), including motorcycles, motor-driven cycles,
    all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles off paved base roadways is prohibited. Only government-owned
    vehicles (GOV) on official government business may operate off paved base roadways, and only
    when there are no safety or environmental restrictions imposed on the area to be used.
       2.1.1.1. Proof of vehicle ownership or registration if required by the issuing authority.
       2.1.1.2. A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or international driver’s license and/or AF
       Form 2293, US Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card, supported by a DD
       Form 2, US Armed Forces Identification Card. Locally determine acceptable identification
       media for civilian personnel and base contractors. Note: Each installation commander must deter-
       mine if international drivers licenses are recognized and accepted by the local (civilian) jurisdic-
       tion, and if so, will their use be authorized on the installation. As a general rule, most CONUS
       civilian jurisdictions will honor use of international drivers licenses for short periods of time by
       non-resident visitors and assigned military personnel. When practical, installation commanders
       should assimilate local policy to preclude conflicting policy.
       2.1.1.2. (AFMC) Foreign nationals must have a valid international driver’s license before driving
       privileges are granted on the installation. Consult the local Staff Judge Advocate’s (SJA) Office
       for authorizing foreign nationals driving privileges who do not possess an international driver’s
       license.
       2.1.1.2. (HILL) International driver’s licenses are valid up to 30 days upon arrival at the base,
       after which only valid state licenses will be permitted.
       2.1.1.3. If required by the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated, a valid record of motor
       vehicle safety inspection, emission control test, or any other test, evaluation, safety inspection, or
       other documents required by local, state, or host nation law or agreement. Note: In some
       instances, a state or other governing jurisdiction in which a vehicle is registered may require, as a
       condition for keeping registration/plates issued by that state or jurisdiction, a safety or other
       inspection even when the vehicle is operated in another state or jurisdiction. Though not enforce-
       able (in another state), failure to comply may invalidate the vehicle registration leaving the owner/
       operator in a precarious legal position. In such cases, it becomes the owner's responsibility to
       comply with their "home state" or other issuing jurisdiction requirements in addition to host state
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                          9


       requirements. Owners should secure host registration when unable to comply with licensing and/
       or registration requirements issued by their home state or other jurisdiction.
       2.1.1.4. Proof of current vehicle insurance when required by state, host nation, or the installation
       commander.

2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. The security police may stop vehicles on military installations based on the installation com-
   mander's authority. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
       2.2.1.1. In overseas areas, security police may stop, search, and detain vehicles on or off base as
       determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.1.2. AFI 31-209, The Air Force Resource Protection Program, local command instructions,
       and policies established by the installation commander will detail stop, inspection, search, and
       impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates and in Air Force restricted
       areas.
       2.2.1.3. On-base traffic stops and inspections (other than at entry gates and restricted areas) of
       POVs is authorized when there is a reasonable basis to believe it’s necessary to enforce a traffic
       regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
   2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their installation com-
   manders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search, and impoundment of vehicles.
   This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass appropriate legal review. Note: A theater
   commander or those commanding unified forces may direct policy covering all installations under
   their command. In this case, MAJCOMs must review those policies before issuing their guidance.

2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath, or Urine Tests. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for
alcohol or other drug content of their blood, breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation
driving privileges. This consent applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired
driving offense committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force instal-
lation.

2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. As a condition to accepting installation driving privi-
leges, drivers must give their consent for the removal and temporary impoundment of their POV if their
POV is: 1) Illegally parked for unreasonable periods; 2) Interferes with traffic operations; 3) Creates a
safety hazard; 4) Disabled by accident or incident; 5) Left unattended in, or adjacent to, a restricted, con-
trolled, or off-limits area; and 6) Abandoned. Drivers also agree to reimburse an authorized agency or
contractor for the cost of towing, storage, and disposal should a need arise to remove or impound their
motor vehicle because of a situation described above.
   2.4.1. Installation commanders define in local procedures or supplement to this instruction, the defi-
   nitions for "unreasonable periods," "abandoned," and other terms relevant to enforcement action
   under paragraph 2.4. Incorporate those instructions, procedures, and definitions into the local instal-
   lation traffic code and make them known to the general public.

2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges . Installation commanders may suspend or
revoke installation driving privileges and POV registration for lawful reasons both related and unrelated
10                                AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


to traffic violations or safe vehicle operations. Installation commanders must incorporate procedures gov-
erning suspension and revocation in local publications or supplement to this instruction. Make these
known to the general public.
     2.5.1. Suspensions.
        2.5.1.1. Installation commanders can suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
        lesser measures fail to improve a driver's performance. The commander may also suspend or
        revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation parking standards,
        or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in nature. Installation commanders
        determine suspension and revocation policy for non-moving violations, as well as what constitutes
        a non-moving violation on their installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to regis-
        ter; unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc.). Make
        these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps to make them
        known to the general public.
        2.5.1.1. (AFMC) Installation/Center Commanders may suspend or revoke privileges for habitual
        offenders of installation parking standards. A habitual parking offender is someone who has
        received three or more parking citations within a 30-day period or six or more parking citations in
        a six-month period.
        2.5.1.1. (HILL) Nonmoving violations that will result in suspension or revocation are identified
        in Attachment 2 of this publication.
        2.5.1.2. The installation commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw anyone's
        authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the installation.
        2.5.1.3. Installation commanders will immediately suspend installation GOV or POV driving
        privileges pending resolution of an intoxicated driving incident which involves active duty mili-
        tary personnel, their family members, retired members of the military service, and DoD civilian
        personnel. This applies regardless of the geographic location of an intoxicated driving incident.
        Installation commanders can only suspend privileges of non-DoD affiliated civilians for incidents
        occurring on the installation or in the areas subject to their military traffic jurisdiction. After a
        review of available evidence as specified in paragraph 2.6., suspend driver’s privileges pending
        resolution of the intoxicated driving incident under the circumstances outlined below:
        2.5.1.3. (AFMC) If a civilian policy agency reports information concerning intoxicated driving to
        the security forces and the civilian police report can not be readily obtained, complete the AF
        Form 3545, Incident/Complaint Report. This report is used for administrative due process for
        suspenses and revocations until an original copy of the report is received.
            2.5.1.3.1. Refusal to take or complete a lawfully requested chemical test to determine blood
            alcohol content BAC) or breath alcohol content (BrAC) for alcohol or other drugs.
            2.5.1.3.2. Operating a motor vehicle with BAC or BrAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
            2.5.1.3.3. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC below 0.10 percent blood alcohol
            by volume if the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is operated imposes a suspension for a BAC
            or BrAC level below 0.10.
            2.5.1.3.3. (HILL) “CIVILIAN.” Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 41-6-44 (2)(a)(I), states that “a
            driver is considered to be driving under the influence (DUI) when operating a motor vehicle
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                        11


         with a blood alcohol level (BAC) of .08 percent or greater. The UCA 32A-12-209(I), states
         that it is unlawful for any person under the age of 21 to purchase, attempt to purchase, solicit
         another person to purchase, possess, or consume any alcoholic beverage or product.” “MILI-
         TARY.” Manual for Courts-Martial Article 111, states “that a driver is considered to be DUI if
         he/she operates or is in actual physical control of any vehicle, aircraft, or vessel while drunk or
         when the alcohol concentration in the person’s blood or breath is 0.08 grams of alcohol per
         100 milliliters of blood or 0.08 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, as shown by chemical
         analysis.” Personnel under the legal age, who have a blood or breath content less than 0.08,
         may lose their driving privileges for 90 days pending due process.
         2.5.1.3.4. On an arrest report or other official document reasonably showing an intoxicated
         driving incident occurred.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
     2.5.2.1. The installation commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
     not less than one year in the following circumstances:
         2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit to or
         complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law of the jurisdic-
         tion, installation traffic code, or this instruction.
         2.5.2.1.1. (HILL) This period of revocation may be in addition to, and will run consecutively
         with, any revocation period imposed as a result of conviction of an alcohol-related offense.
         2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or a military or civilian administrative action
         resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for intoxicated driving. Official
         documentation is required as the basis for this type of revocation action.
         2.5.2.1.2. (HILL) A one-year revocation will be imposed on a driver convicted in an off-base
         civilian court of DUI or a lesser-included alcohol-related offense, such as alcohol-related reck-
         less driving, when the original offense charged was DUI. (See AFI 31-204, paragraph 2.5.1.3.)
         2.5.2.1.3. When a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs and the installation com-
         mander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is required to preserve public
         safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
         2.5.2.1.4. (Added-HILL) Any illegal drug detection may result in a one-year driving suspen-
         sion pending due process.
     2.5.2.2. The CSP develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension, and driving
     records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when receiving similar
     records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
     2.5.2.2. (HILL) When the Reports and Analysis (75 SFS/SFAR) Section is notified of personnel
     changing duty stations, it will forward an Individual History Record to the gaining commander if
     the individual’s driver’s license is revoked or suspended, or if the individual has accumulated traf-
     fic points.
     2.5.2.3. When temporary suspensions are followed by revocations, compute the revocation period
     from the original suspension date, exclusive of any period during which full driving privileges
     were restored pending resolution of charges.
12                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


        2.5.2.4. Installation commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively or con-
        currently.
        2.5.2.4. (HILL) Multiple suspensions will run consecutively unless otherwise determined by the
        revoking authority.

2.6. Reciprocal Procedures.
     2.6.1. Air Force installation commanders will honor revocations issued by other installation com-
     manders regardless of service component affiliation. Revocations remain in effect during reassign-
     ment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. Installation
     commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis. Anyone with suspended or
     revocated privileges may petition an installation commander for partial or limited driving privileges.
     2.6.1. (HILL) A driver whose privilege is suspended at another DoD installation is also suspended at
     Hill AFB for the same period.

2.7. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
     2.7.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that person in
     writing and tell them what action you are taking and the reason for it. Coordinate this notice with the
     base legal office.
     2.7.2. Except for incidents outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., do not suspend or revoke a person's
     driving privileges until they are notified (or reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative
     hearing. Installation commanders determine when a suspension or revocation takes effect once mak-
     ing or attempting this written notice. Only in unusual circumstances should you make verbal notifica-
     tions. Unless an application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or
     revocation takes place on the prescribed date and time. Installation commanders determine the time
     period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for a administrative hear-
     ing. For offenses outlined in para 2.5.1.3. and 2.5.2.1., an installation commander will authorize an
     immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence can include witness
     statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a refusal to complete chemical
     testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test results, or other evidence.
        2.7.2.1. Installation commanders or their designee must conduct evidence reviews as soon as pos-
        sible, but no later than three duty days following final assembly of evidence.
        2.7.2.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary suspension for
        intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-installation, non-DoD
        affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving
        either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the person is employed on the installation, send
        the notice to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
        2.7.2.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification for
        intoxicated driving:
        2.7.2.3. (AFMC) Installation/Center Commanders may designate an officer (in writing) to hold
        the administrative hearing. Normally, an officer on the SJA staff is appointed. However, in no
        instance will the SJA or a member of the security forces be appointed.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                        13


         2.7.2.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of paragraph 2.5.2. of this
         AFI.
         2.7.2.3.2. The right to request restoration of driving privileges pending investigation or reso-
         lution of the incident (direct request letters to the installation commander or designee).
         2.7.2.3.3. The right of military personnel to present evidence and witnesses and be repre-
         sented by a civilian counsel (at their own expense) or assigned military counsel. Commanders
         determine the availability of specific (by name) military counsel requests.
         2.7.2.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative present at the
         administrative hearing in accordance with applicable laws and instructions.
         2.7.2.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the administrative hearing
         before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes permanent.
         2.7.2.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgment of receipt and to return the signed letter to
         the address shown in the letter.
         2.7.2.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is determined
         by the installation commander. A preliminary suspension for intoxicated driving remains in
         effect until the installation commander makes a final decision. However, if no decision is
         made within 30 days of the preliminary suspension or revocation, restore full driving privi-
         leges until the accused is notified of the final hearing results.
  2.7.3. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1) The law
  enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or was in physical con-
  trol of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; 2) The person was lawfully
  cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3) The person was asked to submit to a test for
  alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or urine and was informed of the consequences for
  refusing to take or complete such a test; 4) The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath,
  or urine; failed to complete the test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of
  allowed blood alcohol content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation
  apprehension or in violation of state laws for an off-installation apprehension; and 5) The testing
  methods used were valid and reliable, and the results accurately recorded and evaluated.
     2.7.3.1. For revocation actions under paragraph 2.5.2.1. for intoxicated driving, the revocation is
     mandatory on conviction or other findings that confirm the charge.
         2.7.3.1.1. The date of conviction or other findings that confirm the charge is the effective date
         of the revocation.
         2.7.3.1.2. You may place the notice that revocation is automatic in the suspension letter, or
         send a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
         showing that you made reasonable attempts to notify the individual.
         2.7.3.1.3. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously granted.
         Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of all or partial
         driving privileges.

       with the findings made by OO-ALC/CC or designee.

2.8. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs.
   2.8.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle incident to
   Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
   2.8.2. (Added-AFMC) AFMC supervisors will ensure employees charged with intoxicated driving,
   on or off base, are referred to social actions within 10 days. The evaluation will determine if the per-
   son has an alcohol or substance abuse problem, which may require enrollment in the substance abuse
   awareness seminar.

2.9. Restoration of Driving Privileges on Acquittal. When an official report or finding determines
lack of guilt (not guilty) or when charges are dismissed or reduced to an offense not amounting to intoxi-
cated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher or in violation of
   the law of the jurisdiction that is bring assimilated on the military installation.
       2.9.2.1. (Added-AFMC) If operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of at least 0.05 percent by vol-
       ume but less than 0.10 percent by volume (impaired driving) in violation of the law of the jurisdic-
       tion in which the vehicle is being operated, the suspension my remain in effect for not less than six
       months but no more than one year.
   2.9.3. The person was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under another prelimi-
   nary suspension or revocation.
   2.9.4. The state or host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
   driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
   2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s training pro-
   gram.

2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
16                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


     2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publication, installation
     commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose authority to drive on
     military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service authority. Ensure the individ-
     ual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host nation, etc.) are still valid.
     2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement to
     any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation by a state, federal, or host
     nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and for on base privileges only), coordi-
     nate with the installation staff judge advocate. Note: This option applies only to installations exercis-
     ing exclusive military jurisdiction. Outline procedures for applying for partial or restricted privileges
     in the base supplement to this AFI or in another appropriate publication. Only consider requests in
     which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives. Do not consider the
     granting of limited privileges as an alternative to administrative discharge action when discharge is
     the more appropriate action. Installation commanders must weigh heavily the potential liability
     inherent when an individual with a suspended or revoked state, host nation, or other license is
     allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the installation. Administrative separation may be appropri-
     ate when the loss of driving privileges renders someone ineffective and incapable of performing their
     military duties, and a change in duty position is not reasonable.

2.11. Extensions of Suspensions and Revocations.
2.11. (AFMC) When revocation action for implied consent is combined with another revocation, it will
run consecutively.
     2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is discovered driv-
     ing in violation of their original suspension or revocation. The unit or installation commander may
     also take administrative or disciplinary action.
     2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of installation driving privileges until the offender com-
     pletes an approved remedial driver training course, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed
     necessary by the installation commander or local authorities.

2.12. Reciprocal State-Military Action.
     2.12.1. Statutory authority may exist within some host nations or states for reciprocal suspension and
     revocation of driving privileges. If so, the installation commander should honor the reciprocal agree-
     ments with the state or host nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the
     receiving party may suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred
     within its own jurisdiction.
        2.12.1.1. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal military
        reciprocity:
            2.12.1.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
            individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable military
            administrative actions (suspensions, revocation, or point assessment) for those off-base viola-
            tions reported by local, state, or host nation authorities.
            2.12.1.1.2. In the CONUS, notify the licensing authority of the state where a license is issued
            when revoking a person’s installation driving privileges (for a period of one year or more only)
            following final adjudication of an intoxicated driving offense or for refusal to submit to a
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                       17


          BAC/BrAC test. Include in the notification the basis for the revocation and the BAC/BrAC
          level.
   2.12.2. Provisions of the applicable status of forces agreement (SOFA) and the law of the host nation
   concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS installation commanders.
   When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the extent an agreement concerning reci-
   procity exists, the installation commander must have prior authorization to negotiate and conclude
   such an international agreement in accordance with applicable directives.
2.13. (Added-HILL) Reinstatement and Restriction of Driving Privileges.
   2.13.1. (Added-HILL) Reinstatement of base driving privileges applies to operation of GOVs only.
   Any request for reinstatement must be in writing, justified as mission essential, and submitted by the
   subject individual’s commander or equivalent.
   2.13.2. (Added-HILL) Restriction of base driving privileges applies to operation of POVs only. Any
   request for restricted privileges must be submitted in writing by the subject individual and be endorsed
   by their commander or equivalent.
   2.13.3. (Added-HILL) Requests for reinstatement of, or restriction on, base driving privileges may
   be submitted at the time of the administrative due process hearing or at any other time. Requests must
   be addressed to the 75th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (75 MSG/CD) through the
   Administration and Reports (75 SFS/SFA) Section.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                 MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION

3.1. Registration Policy.
     3.1.1. Register motor vehicles according to guidance in this instruction and policies established by
     the installation commander. Installation commanders may extend registration to anyone they deem
     appropriate. This may include reserve force personnel who maintain close affiliation with the instal-
     lation and other persons who frequently visit the base, such as local dignitaries, community leaders,
     retired civilian employees, civil air patrol members, etc.
     3.1.1. (HILL) The maximum number of motor vehicles per person that will be registered at any one
     time will be three, except for active duty, retired military personnel and DoD civilian personnel.
        3.1.1.1. Consistent with base entry policy in AFI 31-209, the installation commander is responsi-
        ble for ensuring vehicles entering their installation are controlled. Vehicles entering Air Force
        installations must be registered or meet other entry requirements outlined in paragraph 3.2. Eligi-
        ble vehicle registrants include assigned active duty military and civilian personnel working on
        base, retired military personnel, reserve and national guard personnel assigned to a unit or
        attached for training on an active installation or a reserve or national guard base or facility, and
        survivors of deceased active duty and retired military members who are authorized to use base
        facilities. The installation commander may authorize the registration of vehicles that are in the
        custody of or owned by dependents, step-parents, or guardians of minor children authorized to use
        base facilities. A dependent living away from home may require a letter stating acceptance of
        responsibility from the military sponsor to support an application for vehicle registration. Further-
        more, a person need not own the vehicle to register it; however, they must have a lease agreement,
        power of attorney, or notarized statement from the owner of the vehicle granting them permission
        to use the vehicle and specifying the inclusive use dates.
        3.1.1.1. (HILL) Contractors will be issued AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, when their con-
        tract is one year or less. When a contract is over one year they will be issued DD Form 2220, DoD
        Registered Vehicle, decal.
        3.1.1.2. Treat rental vehicles as government vehicles when being used for official business by
        military or DoD personnel. Check the driver's installation entry credentials and if all is in order,
        the vehicle may proceed in the same manner as a marked government vehicle.
     3.1.2. Vehicles intended for construction and material handling or used solely off the road are not
     usually registered as motor vehicles. Installation commanders determine the need and method for reg-
     istering off road vehicles (ORV) on the installation. However, ORV owners must register and license
     the vehicle prior to its operation on installation roadways.
     3.1.3. When unit vehicle registration (via orderly rooms) is authorized by the installation commander,
     each unit commander can grant limited temporary registration for up to 45 days pending permanent
     registration, or in other circumstances for longer terms.
     3.1.4. Air Force installations and activities honor the DD Form 2220, DOD Registered Vehicle
     Decal, issued by other military or DoD organizations.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                          19


   3.1.5. Use of AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The AF Form 75 is one method to control and iden-
   tify personnel and vehicles on a temporary basis. You can give it to installation visitors who do not
   have the authorized personal or vehicle credentials needed for unescorted or unchecked entry to the
   base. Installation commanders determine the use of AF Forms 75 on their installation and, if used, to
   what degree and to whom issued. If used, develop local policy and procedures governing the issue
   and control of visitor passes. Issue other access credentials when a pass is needed for longer than one
   year.
   3.1.5. (HILL) Pass and Registration Section (75 SFS/SFOXI) will issue AF Form 75 to vehicles that
   do not meet the requirement for permanent registration, not to exceed 30 days.
       3.1.5.1. How to process the AF Form 75:
           3.1.5.1.1. Ask the visitor to fill out the form and sign the consent to search and towing/
           impoundment warning.
           3.1.5.1.2. Use either the driver's license, state vehicle registration, or passport (overseas) or
           other recognized credential according to para 2.1.1.
           3.1.5.1.3. Display the form so one can view it from outside the vehicle.
           3.1.5.1.4. Installation commanders determine if and how to retrieve passes once the visit is
           finished.
   3.1.6. The installation commander determines local policy on authorizing and honoring other vehicle
   registration systems and decals of nonmilitary or non-DoD tenant activities tenanted on the installa-
   tion. Tenant-operated registration systems must meet the requirements of this instruction for:
       3.1.6.1. Complying with registration prerequisites and individual responsibilities in this instruc-
       tion and on the AF Form 533, Certificate of Compliance-Private Motor Vehicle Registration
       (or its equivalent).
       3.1.6.2. Displaying decals on the vehicle.
       3.1.6.3. Storing, issuing, and recovering decals.
   3.1.7. Installation commanders can implement decentralized POV registration among installation
   units. However, the security police must have 24-hour access to registrant information on all registra-
   tion systems used on the installation.

3.2. Registration and Driver Requirements. Registration systems for POVs on Air Force installations
will include the requirements specified below. Overseas commands and overseas installations should
modify these procedures to conform with local and international agreements. All motorcycle operators
must comply with the requirements of AFI 91-207 prior to registering a motorcycle. Individuals must
have the following credentials immediately available upon demand as required by state law or policies
established by the installation commander. 1) A valid state, overseas command, host nation, or interna-
tional driver’s license (as applicable) supported by DD Form 2, or other appropriate identification for
DoD civilians; 2) A certificate of state registration as required by the state or authority in which the vehi-
cle is registered; 3) Proof of meeting the minimum requirements for automobile insurance laws or regu-
lations of the state or host nation. Within the United States, the installation commander may set
reasonable liability insurance requirements for registration and operation of POVs within the confines of
the installation; and 4) Evidence of satisfactory completion of emission, safety, mechanical, or other test
20                                  AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


or evaluation required by local, state, or other jurisdiction in which the vehicle is licensed or located.
Installation commanders may require periodic safety inspections for all vehicles operated routinely on
their installation if a like inspection is not required by a nonmilitary jurisdiction. In such cases, the instal-
lation commander must ensure reasonable and accessible inspection facilities are available and that
inspections follow National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards. Note: The
owner or authorized operator is responsible for reasonable fees and expenses associated with vehicle
inspections. Failure to comply with safety inspection standards will result in termination or denial of use
of installation roadways.
3.2. (AFMC) Installation liability insurance requirements will mirror those of the host state or munici-
pality. If no minimum state requirement exist, commanders should establish liability insurance require-
ments for registration/operation of POVs within the confines of their installation. Consult the local SJA’s
office for assistance in setting minimum requirements.
3.2. (HILL) Registration and Driver Requirements. The POVs of assigned military personnel will be
registered within 10 duty days after arrival on base. The POVs of assigned civilian employees will be reg-
istered within 10 duty days after being hired. The POVs purchased after assignment to the base will be
registered within three duty days after registration requirements are met.
     3.2.1. Vehicle registration record keeping. Registering officials must check the eligibility to register
     and ownership (or legitimate custody) of a vehicle. Unit distribution points (i.e., unit orderly rooms)
     may perform registration functions under the supervision of the installation pass and registration sec-
     tion. In this case, these distribution points receive registration decals in bulk from the pass and regis-
     tration section. After issuing decals, provide the pass and registration section the completed AF Form
     533 or the necessary information for entering registration data into the automated system. Use one of
     the following methods to keep records:
         3.2.1.1. Manually kept records. Each registrant fills out an AF Form 533 upon initial Air Force
         vehicle registration and upon arrival at a new installation after permanent change of station. The
         registrant’s signature on the AF Form 533 certifies compliance with registration requirements. To
         minimize inconvenience to the registrant, you can preprint the name of the installation and mini-
         mum insurance limits in the appropriate blocks on the front. Determine filing methods locally.
         3.2.1.2. Automated records. Use the security police automated system (SPAS) computerized
         vehicle registration program. The registrant must read and understand the registration require-
         ments before issuing a decal.

3.3. Appointing Registration Officials . The chief of security police (CSP) develops local procedures
governing base registration officials. Generally, security police personnel working in the pass and regis-
tration section are assigned duties as registration officials. When authorized by the installation com-
mander, unit orderly room personnel may also act as registration officials for their unit personnel when
unit-level vehicle registration has been authorized. Local registration official procedures must cover the
following:
3.3. (HILL) Appointing Registration Officials. The 75 SFS/SFOXI (or authorized unit orderly rooms)
will control all base registration at Bldg 1296 (Pass and Registration) and Bldg 553 (South Gate Recep-
tion Center).
     3.3.1. Qualifications (i.e., grade, duty position, and skill level).
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                           21


   3.3.2. Duty training requirements and general position responsibilities which must include record
   keeping procedures, inventory, and security procedures for controlled DD forms.
   3.3.3. Appointment procedures for those authorized to perform as registration officials.

3.4. Specifications for DD Form 2220.
   3.4.1. Use the DD Form 2220 to register vehicles on Air Force installations. Remove the form from
   POVs when registration expires or registration privileges terminate.
   3.4.2. Use the installation tag (4” X 1/2”) to identify the Air Force installation where the vehicle is
   registered. Position this decal directly under the DD Form 2220. The tags are color coded according
   to the category of the registrant and are issued as follows:
       3.4.2.1. Officer--blue background with white letters.
       3.4.2.2. Noncommissioned officer--gold background with black letters.
       3.4.2.3. Airman--red background with white letters.
       3.4.2.4. Civilian--green background with white letters.
       3.4.2.5. Contractor--white background with black letters.
NOTE: The installation commander determines the color code used by dependents of deceased military
members.
       3.4.2.6. (Added-HILL) Family members of deceased military or retired civilian personnel will
       use the same color-coded DD Form 2220 as the deceased sponsor.
   3.4.3. Use AF Form 2219, Registered Vehicle Expiration (2” X 3/4”), to maintain the validity of a
   vehicle’s registration. This tab has a suffix (series) corresponding to a particular year of expiration
   (i.e., 2219A, 2219B, etc.). Revalidate registration by issuing a different “series” at a minimum of
   every three years. Position this decal to the right of the DD Form 2220.
   3.4.4. Prominently affix registration decals to the windshield (centered at the top or at lower driver's
   side corner), on the front bumper (driver's side), or to a owner supplied plate securely fastened to the
   driver's side bumper, bumper mounting bracket, or license plate mounting bracket. State and local
   policy can affect the exact placement. On two-wheeled vehicles, place registration decals on a con-
   spicuous front-facing surface or plate affixed to a front-facing surface.

     3.5.1. The owner fails to comply with the registration requirements of paragraph 3.2.
     3.5.2. The owner sells or disposes of the registered POV, is released from active duty, is separated
     from the service, or terminates civilian employment with a military service or DoD agency.
     3.5.3. The owner is other than an active duty military or civilian employee and discontinues regular
     operation of the POV on the installation.
     3.5.4. The state, overseas command, host nation, or installation suspends or revokes the owner's driv-
     ing privilege. Affected persons can apply to reregister their POV after their suspension or revocation
     period expires. Other family members having installation driving privileges may transfer the base
     vehicle registration into their name. If so, change the AF Form 533 or SPAS data base to reflect the
     new registrant. Note: The installation commander determines the period of time a person has before
     they must surrender their DD Form 2220 or transfer the decal and base registration to another autho-
     rized driver.
     3.5.5. When a registrant is transferred. The installation commander may permit registration by the
     spouse or other dependents continuing to live near the installation. When this occurs, update the AF
     Form 533 or SPAS data base.
     3.5.6. When ownership of a vehicle is transferred. The new owner of a previously registered vehicle
     can transfer the registration provided the new owner is eligible for base vehicle registration. The new
     owner must follow the procedures in paragraph 3.2.
     3.5.6. (HILL) When ownership of a POV is transferred, the previous owner will remove the DD
     Form 2220, return it to Operations (75 SFS/SFO) and de-register the vehicle. The new owner will fol-
     low the registration procedures in paragraph 3.2.
     3.5.7. During a PCS transfer. If authorized by the installation commander, a registrant may keep the
     registration decal on their vehicle for re-registration at the gaining installation. In this case, the losing
     installation transfers the registration number to the gaining pass and registration section where only a
     new installation tab is issued upon the member's arrival at the new duty station. Note: This procedure
     is not allowed for CONUS to OCONUS POV shipments or consecutive OCONUS to OCONUS trans-
     fers unless the vehicle will be accompanied or driven by a registered owner. Unless the vehicle is
     accompanied or driven, surrender the DD Form 2220 as part of normal out processing.

3.6. Specified Consent to Impoundment. Personnel must consent to the installation vehicle impound-
ment policy if they wish to drive on the installation. POV registration forms or policy will contain or have
appended to them a certificate with the following statement:
         “I am aware that AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, and the installation
traffic code provide for the removal and temporary impoundment of privately owned vehicles parked ille-
gally for unreasonable periods, interfering with military operations, creating a safety hazard, disabled by
incident, left unattended in a restricted or controlled area, or abandoned. I agree to reimburse any agency
or contractor for the cost of towing, storing, and disposing of my motor vehicle if it is lawfully removed
and impounded."

                                TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision. A strong
   traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision, and control of
   motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws and regulations together
   with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle accidents are also important. Finally,
   every successful program must include meaningful interaction, education, and communication with
   the general public.
   4.1.2. Installation commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest and most
   efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic planning is circula-
   tion control. The base traffic engineer, CSP, safety officer, and other concerned staff agencies develop
   the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway engineering representatives from adjacent civilian
   communities to ensure the installation plan is compatible with plans developed by the state and sur-
   rounding local communities. As a minimum, your base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include measures
      for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested locations by law enforcement personnel or designated traffic
      directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every installation commander should appoint a primary and alternate base traffic engi-
      neer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation plan. This is normally
      a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the position should have an infrastruc-
      ture planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow patterns,
   and points of congestion. The CSP and traffic engineer usually conduct coordinated traffic control
   studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major and minor routes, locations for traffic
   control devices, and special conditions requiring engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMC-
   TEA) will help installation commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering problems. MTM-
   CTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
      4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.

     4.1.5. Installation commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance in accordance with AFR
     75-88, Highways for National Defense.

  4.2.1. Installation commanders must establish a traffic code for operation of motor vehicles on the
  installation. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority is
  empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic codes must
  contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the code of the state or
  host nation in which the installation is located. The CSP is responsible for developing the traffic code
  and for ensuring it meets all local and legal requirements, this AFI, and the standards published in the
  following:
     4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR 1230.
     4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance published
     by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is contained in 23,
     CFR 1204.
     4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
  4.2.2. The installation traffic code must contain policy and procedures for the towing, searching,
  impounding, and inventorying of vehicles. Publish these provisions and ensure they contain the fol-
  lowing:
     4.2.2.1. Violations and conditions to tow or impound a vehicle.
     4.2.2.2. Procedures to notify the vehicle owner.
     4.2.2.3. Procedures for towing, storing, and protecting impounded vehicles.
     4.2.2.4. Procedures for disposing of vehicles after lawful impoundment.
  4.2.3. Where applicable, installation traffic codes must supplement the various basic provisions con-
  tained in the subparagraphs below:
     4.2.3.1. Motorcycles and mopeds. Operators must comply with special requirements when driv-
     ing motorcycles, mopeds, or other open two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles powered by a motor-
     cycle-type engine. See paragraph 4.2.6. for information concerning off-road vehicle use.
     Installations should adopt local, state, or host nation guidance concerning the legal definition,
     operation, use, and control of mopeds, motorized bicycles, and other such devices on installation
     roadways. Such guidelines will be modified or restricted as necessary to ensure personal safety or
32                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


        the safe and orderly flow of installation traffic. Refer to AFI 91-207 for helmet, eye, and clothing
        safety requirements.
        4.2.3.2. Restraint systems.
            4.2.3.2.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
            wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear restraint
            systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
            4.2.3.2.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
            wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
            4.2.3.2.3. US Department of Transportation requires approved infant/child restraint devices in
            POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 50 pounds in weight.
            4.2.3.2.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved restraint
            system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
            4.2.3.2.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the manufacturer's
            primary restraint system (seat belts).
        4.2.3.3. Headphones and earphones. The wearing of headphones and earphones is prohibited
        while driving a motor vehicle on base. This does not negate wearing of hearing protection when
        conditions and good judgment dictate its use such as when driving in noise hazard areas. This
        restriction does not apply to intercom systems worn by motorcycle operators and their passengers.
     4.2.4. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of installation driving
     privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations of the installation traffic code.
     4.2.5. At bases with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction, make violations of state traffic codes
     applicable to base driving records when those violations are included in that state’s criminal offense
     code. This provision is covered under the authority of Title 18 United States Code 13 (USC).
        4.2.5.1. DoDD 5525.4, Enforcement of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations, adopts the vehic-
        ular and pedestrian traffic laws of states where traffic law violations are not considered criminal
        offenses and cannot be assimilated under 18 USC. It makes these laws applicable to military
        installations having concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction. It also delegates authority to
        installation commanders to establish additional vehicular and pedestrian traffic rules and regula-
        tions for their installations. Those found guilty of violating traffic laws made applicable on instal-
        lations under provisions of DoDD 5525.4 are subject to a fine of not more than $50 or
        imprisonment for not more than 30 days or both for each violation. In those states where you can-
        not assimilate traffic laws, post an extracted copy of this paragraph and a copy of DoDD 5525.4 in
        a prominent place accessible to persons assigned, living, or working on the installation.
            4.2.5.1.1. Take only administrative actions in states where you cannot assimilate violations of
            traffic laws under either Title 18 USC 13 or DoDD 5525.4. Generally, this applies to installa-
            tions under part or full proprietary jurisdiction.
     4.2.6. Off-road vehicles usage: The installation commander or his or her designee determines if,
     when, and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of off-road
     vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning age, safety train-
     ing, and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such as reflective vests,
     gloves, headlight on, and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a recreational capacity.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                        33


   However, ensure full compliance with local, state, or host nation requirements. When necessary,
   develop additional procedures and guidance locally and publish in the installation traffic safety plan or
   supplement to this instruction. Ensure environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating
   any off-road vehicle use area.

4.3. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.3.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within traffic laws
   and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective enforcement should
   emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers. You can reach these goals by
   developing effective programs in the following areas.
      4.3.1.1. Publishing a realistic traffic code well known by all personnel.
      4.3.1.2. Adopting standard signs, markings, and signals in accordance with National Highway
      Safety Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for
      Streets and Highways.
      4.3.1.3. Ensuring enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
      act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in opera-
      tion.
      4.3.1.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with suspended
      or revoked privileges.
      4.3.1.5. Use sound discretion and judgment in deciding when to apprehend, issue a citation, or
      warn the offender.
   4.3.2. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
      4.3.2.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the influence of
      alcohol or drugs.
      4.3.2.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection tech-
      niques, and equipment standards unique to your location and jurisdiction.
      4.3.2.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11.).
      4.3.2.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs prevents
      their safe operation of a motor vehicle.

4.4. Speed-measuring Devices. Use speed-measuring devices in traffic control studies and enforce-
ment programs. Post signs to indicate the use of speed-measuring devices.
   4.4.1. Equipment purchases. Installations located in states having a formal civilian police training
   and certification program for speed measurement should consider purchasing the same brand and
   model of equipment used by their civilian counterparts. Where possible, attend the same or similar
   certification courses used by local authorities.
   4.4.2. Training and certification standards.
      4.4.2.1. The CSP should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices meet training and
      certification requirements prescribed by the state or jurisdiction where the installation is located.
      Obtain specific information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting
34                                AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


        the state agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Notwithstanding the above informa-
        tion, the CSP may establish other local training and certification programs for operators of
        speed-measuring devices. If exercising this option, you must ensure your qualification and train-
        ing standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civil author-
        ities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings, and civilian courts used
        to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military staff judge advocate and attor-
        ney general (or equivalent) is necessary.
        4.4.2.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer's training
        program if security police are unable to attend local or state-sponsored radar certification courses.
        4.4.2.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the effective-
        ness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-measurement radar. On
        successful completion, the course graduate must know how to:
            4.4.2.3.1. Describe the association between excessive speed and accidents, deaths, and inju-
            ries, and describe the traffic safety benefits of effective speed control.
            4.4.2.3.2. Describe the basic principles of radar speed measurement.
            4.4.2.3.3. Identify and describe Air Force speed measurement and speed enforcement policy
            and procedure.
            4.4.2.3.4. Identify the specific radar instrument used and describe the instrument’s major
            components and functions.
            4.4.2.3.5. Demonstrate basic skills in calibrating and operating the specific radar instru-
            ment(s).
            4.4.2.3.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and courtroom testi-
            mony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
     4.4.3. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required by the
     state or governing jurisdiction. The CSP must document and maintain certification and training stan-
     dards in the unit training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
     4.4.4. Use the following sources in local training and certification programs:
        4.4.4.1. State or local training guides, plans, and procedures.
        4.4.4.2. Publish techniques for radar speed detection and legal aspects of speed-measuring
        devices by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association
        of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training.

4.5. Traffic Accident Investigation.
     4.5.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
        4.5.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
        4.5.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the installation com-
        mander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and property damage; however,
        the installation commander may establish different damage amounts for each category.

   4.5.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving military personnel according to
   local policy developed by the CSP and local police leaders.
NOTE: Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an accident report
form, field sketch, scale diagram, and accident narrative.

4.6. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.6.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident to the
   security police. Report off-base accidents to the security police if they involve injuries to military per-
   sonnel or damage to military property. The installation commander determines what agencies to notify
   and for what type of accidents to notify them. The CSP must develop a local notification matrix or
   other procedures that will ensure notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.6.2. The security police will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information.
   Record the information in the security police desk blotter. When possible, obtain copies of major
   accident reports prepared by investigating civilian police agencies.
   4.6.3. Security police respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions or poli-
   cies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
       4.6.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.6.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.6.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.6.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.6.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.6.3.6. The CSP determines (with installation commander approval) when and/or if minor vehi-
       cle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she may delegate this authority to
       on-duty security police supervisory personnel. Develop policy in this area locally.
   4.6.4. Report minor accidents not involving a security police response to the security police within 72
   hours. Record accident information in the security police blotter. This information should include the
   accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or address when civilian
   not affiliated with military), vehicle description, and license number(s). You should also include a
   brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or causing the accident. A minor accident is
   any accident in which there are no fatalities/injuries or vehicle/property damage above the amount
   established by the installation commander. Consequently, a major accident is any accident involving
   a fatality, injury, or property damage above the amount established by the installation commander.
   The installation commander may set differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and
   property damage. The investigation of major accidents involve specialized accident investigative
   techniques to draw conclusions and opinions about how and why the accident occurred.
       4.6.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor vehicle
       accident:
          4.6.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention
          4.6.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is sought
36                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


            4.6.4.1.3. Any visible injury. This includes bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or
            any other visible damage to the body.

4.7. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data.
     4.7.1. Analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine accident causes. When
     frequent accidents occur in one area, analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors
     in an attempt to isolate causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and
     trend analysis available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
     exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the CSP determines the agencies
     cleared to receive accident and incident data.
     4.7.2. Law enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation reports will
     indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where applicable, if air bags
     deployed.

4.8. Parking.
     4.8.1. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the installation. Strong
     enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while reducing traffic accidents
     and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and awareness initiatives in areas
     where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness fail, installation commanders may
     authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing and "booting" of vehicles. Do not use
     towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revo-
     cations, etc., prove effective. When using towing and booting, follow the guidelines below:
        4.8.1.1. Publish operating instructions to control discretion of enforcers and limit towing or boot-
        ing to specific offenses.
        4.8.1.2. Focus on specific reasons for towing or booting. Booting is effective for immobilizing
        unsafe vehicles, or vehicles not inspected or registered. Use booting in high offense areas or to
        compel the presence of repeat offenders. Towing is more effective for moving vehicles that pose
        safety hazards. Some examples include double parking, and blocking fire hydrants and fire lanes.
        4.8.1.3. Notify drivers that certain violations or multiple violations may result in towing or boot-
        ing. Also, provide drivers a prompt opportunity to obtain release of their property.
        4.8.1.4. Warn drivers when a boot is attached to their vehicle and instruct them on how to have the
        boot removed without damaging the vehicle.
     4.8.2. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, installation commanders determine
     reserved parking policy for their installations. Number of available spaces, facility design and layout,
     traffic flow, and number of vehicles using facilities will help determine the number and location of
     reserved parking spaces. Make policy and procedures governing reserved parking a part of the instal-
     lation supplement to this instruction, separate traffic control instruction, or base parking plan. The
     publication must address approval, issue, control, and review of reserved parking and should give spe-
     cial consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor, and car pool parking. Handicap parking is regulated
     under the uniform federal accessibility standards and applies to all Air Force installations.
     4.8.2. (HILL) See Attachment 3 (Added) of this supplement for Hill AFB parking lots and classifi-
     cation.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                      37


   4.8.3. You can use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc., to control parking space assignments
   and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. If this identification media is placed on a vehicle
   bumper, separate it from the vehicle registration identification. MAJCOMs (or installation command-
   ers if not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop policy concerning the issue and control of the
   identification media discussed above.
   4.8.3. (HILL) The decals and permits used at Hill AFB are listed in Figure 4.1. of this supplement.
   The parking wardens will issue parking lot decals, permits and placards to personnel authorized to
   park in their lots. Decals will be placed on the left rear bumper. Placards or hanging permits will be
   placed so they are visible through the windshield. NOTE: When available, placards may be used in
   lieu of decals, but they must be identifiable.

NOTES:
     1. The Official Business Permit will be issued on a controlled basis and in limited numbers to
        directorates, major tenant units, squadrons and union stewards. It will be used when no other
        means of transportation (i.e., personal GOV, motor pool taxi or base shuttle bus) is available
        and time-sensitive official business must be conducted via POV. An individual authorized in
        writing by the director or commander will issue the permit, and it will normally be valid only
        for the time required to conduct the official business and return to the duty section. In no case
        will the period of issue exceed one duty day, except for individuals who must use POVs on a
        daily basis, due to the nature of their job requirements (i.e., construction monitors). The per-
        mit will not be used after duty hours. This permit allows POVs to park in numbered parking
        lots and GOV, car-pool, visitor and official business spaces when performing official business
        away from the normal work center parking area. In no case, however, will this permit autho-
        rize access to handicap, X/XX, or parking by permit spaces, the flight line, or designated park-
        ing lots or spaces at the user’s work center during regular duty hours. Official Business

            Parking Permits and Van or Car-pool Parking Permits, Class B and C, will be issued by park-
            ing wardens after authorization by confinement (75 SFS/SFOJ). Special parking privileges
            such as NCO/Airman of the Quarter, etc., are discouraged in areas that have limited parking.
        2. The X parking decal will be issued to active duty colonels and civilians, GS-15 and GM-15,
           (placement of the decal will be on the left rear bumper of POVs).
        3. The XX parking decal will be issued to active duty and retired general officers and to Senior
           Executive Service (SES) civilians (placement of the decal will be on the left rear bumper of
           POVs).
        4. SES, general officers, colonels and chief master sergeants will also be issued appropriate iden-
           tifying rank stickers to augment their DD Form 2200.
     4.8.4. You can use parking wardens (unit personnel) to monitor and cite parking violators, especially
     within off-street parking facilities.
     4.8.4. (HILL) Management and Parking Warden policy is contained in Table 4.2. (Added) of this
     supplement.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                       39


Table 4.3. (Added-HILL) Management and Parking Wardens.
     Management       1. Commanders are responsible for assignment of parking spaces within
                      their respective parking lots. When more than one organization is involved,
                      commanders are encouraged to divide spaces based on percentages for
                      number of personnel. Assigned spaces are identified as those spaces
                      reserved for specific vehicles such as handicapped, GOV, visitor, contract
                      designated union stewards and key personnel. However, assigned spaces
                      will not exceed 10 percent of the total spaces available at each building.
                      Total available is the number of spaces after subtracting all exclusions from
                      the total number of spaces. Exclusions include handicapped, GOV and
                      visitor spaces. The commander may use up to 10 percent of the remaining
                      total available spaces for reserve or dedicated spaces. Car pool parking is a
                      special reserved parking and not considered in the total available or
                      exclusion. All parking spaces will be marked “reserved” and located
                      according to the following priorities, based on the shortest, most accessible
                      walking distance to work areas, handicap vehicles, GOVs used during duty
                      hours, visitor vehicles, key personnel vehicles, car pool vehicles and all
                      other vehicles. NOTE: Handicapped stalls will not be reserved for specific
                      individuals. The stalls are assigned to specific facilities and will be used on
                      a "first come" basis. Individuals will contact the responsible facility
                      commander if there are any concerns over the number of stalls available.
                      2. Civil Engineering is responsible for the design, establishment and
                      construction of all roadways and parking areas on base, the installation or
                      removal of parking lot and traffic control signs and signals, and the design
                      and placement of roadblocks.
                      3. All requests for construction, installation or removal of traffic signs and
                      markings will be submitted through 75 SFS/SFO and the Structural Repair
                      Section (75 CES/CEZR), in turn.
                      4. Parking lots will be designated as open for all personnel, car-pools, or
                      with parking decal only. See Attachment 3 (Added) of this supplement for
                      the location and type of parking decals required.
                      5. Reserved and special parking areas are designated in accordance with
                      this supplement.
                      6. Subdividing or changing parking slots or lot boundary lines requires
                      approval of the using organization and 75 SFS/SFO. The American
                      Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592, will be notified for
                      negotiating as needed.
                      7. Vehicles are prohibited from parking so that the front or rear bumper
                      extends over the sidewalk, thus enabling proper snow removal.
                      8. 75 SFS/SFOJ is responsible for managing the base parking lot warden
                      program. These responsibilities include maintaining a complete list of
                      parking wardens, training primary parking wardens, and conducting annual
                      program reviews of unit.
40                           AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


     Parking Wardens   1. Each organization assigned responsibility for parking lots or spaces will
                       appoint at least one parking warden. Additional parking wardens may be
                       appointed as deemed necessary by the two-letter or three-letter chief. If an
                       organization is responsible for more than one parking lot, parking wardens
                       may be appointed for each lot. Where more than one organization uses a
                       parking lot, each organization will appoint a parking warden for its
                       respective portion. However, each parking lot will have a primary parking
                       warden who will be responsible for issuing and accounting for all parking
                       decals, placards and official business parking permits.
                       2. All parking warden appointments will be in writing, and a copy of the
                       letter will be sent to 75 SFS/SFOJ. The letter will include the parking
                       warden’s name, office symbol, duty phone, date trained, and the parking lot
                       appointed. The letter will be updated annually or upon change of parking
                       wardens, whichever occurs first.
                       3. Primary parking wardens will receive training from 75 SFS/SFOJ. They
                       will:
                       a. Control and verify the issuance of all DD Forms 1408, Armed Forces
                       Traffic Ticket (AFI 31-204, paragraph 4.9.3.), and the parking forms,
                       permits and decals prescribed by this supplement.
                       b. Ensure parking requirements for their parking lots are strictly enforced.
                       c. Issue DD Forms 1408 for parking violations in their assigned parking
                       lots, submit the white and yellow copies 75 SFS/SFOJ within three duty
                       days after issuance, and keep track of the number and location of DD Form
                       1408 books issued. Non-primary parking wardens may be delegated
                       authority to issue DD Forms 1408 in their assigned parking lots, and when
                       relieved of these duties, they will relinquish all unused books to the primary
                       parking warden.
                       d. Issue parking decals and placards only to vehicles registered on base and
                       having current DD Forms 2220. Each requester will only be issued one
                       decal or placard per vehicle registered on base, but each decal or placard
                       will only be for one parking space.
                       e. Ensure decals and placards are removed and returned upon an
                       individual’s PCS, retirement, etc.
                       f. Submit an annual report to 75 SFS/SFOJ of all assigned parking slots,
                       including a list of all reserved parking slots, parking passes or decals issued,
                       and official parking permits.
                       g. Train alternate parking wardens and provide them continuing guidance.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                  41


Parking Rules     1. All personnel driving POVs to their workplace will park in their
                  organization’s parking lot.
                  2. Only state issued handicapped placard, DD Form 787, Handicap Person
                  Vehicle Decal or locally generated temporary medical placard authorizes
                  handicapped parking on base. The only exception to this is parking in
                  reserved lots. If not assigned the reserved lot parking is not authorized,
                  unless temporarily visiting. To be issued a temporary or permanent base
                  handicapped parking permit, an individual must bring a properly
                  accomplished OO-ALC Form 339, Handicap Parking Request (blocks
                  1-21 by requester and blocks 23-28 by applicable civilian or base hospital),
                  to 75 SFS/SFOJ. This form needs to be signed by a medical physician as
                  proof of the need for the permit. Temporary permits need the duration of
                  the needed permit. Since the permits are accountable, the information
                  (name, work center, organization, duty phone and effective dates) is kept in
                  a log with 75 SFS/SFOJ. When the temporary permit expires it will be
                  returned to 75 SFS/SFOJ for destruction. A permanent handicap sticker is
                  to be put near and used in conjunction with the DD Form 2220.
                  3. Vehicles will be parked only in areas specifically designated, posted or
                  striped as parking areas, zones, lots or spaces.
                  EXCEPTION: Parallel parking is authorized on streets in base housing.
                  4. Parking lot decals will be placed on the driver’s side rear bumper of
                  vehicles. Placards or hanging permits will be placed so they are visible
                  through the vehicle windshield.
                  5. Maintenance and service vehicles, or POVs on official business, may
                  stop at building entrances to load or unload cargo or equipment, providing
                  other vehicular traffic is not obstructed and traffic hazards are not created.
                  6. All boats and trailers not parked in carports or garages in base housing
                  will be stored in the fenced compound near Bldg 1138 or off base. The
                  motor pool dispatcher controls access to the compound.
                  7. Official business parking is authorized in accordance with paragraph
                  4.8.3. and Figure 4.1 of this supplement.
                  8. Except as otherwise provided in this supplement, vehicles stopping or
                  parking on two-way roadways will do so with both passenger-side wheels
                  within 12 inches of the right curb or paved edge of the roadway.
                  9. Non-emergency vehicles will not back into diagonal parking spaces.
                  10. Vehicles in parking spaces shall not obstruct walkways.
                  11. Carpool spaces will be used for employee carpools Monday-Friday,
                  0530-1600. At all other times, these spaces will be available for open
                  parking.
                  12. All base parking lots requiring numbered parking or carpool decals will
                  be available for open parking outside of Monday-Friday, 0530-1600.
42                               AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


                        13. Parking Lot 17, on the northeast side of Bldg 100, will only be for
                        handicap parking.
                        14. Only motorcycles will park in designated motorcycle parking spaces,
                        with no exceptions for inclement weather.
                        15. Parking is prohibited in the following areas:
                             a. In or along any areas not designated, posted or striped for parking,
                        including along yellow or red painted curbs.
                             b. In reserved spaces.
                             c. In bus stop zones, except for carpool drop-offs and pickups.
                             d. Within 30 feet of stop signs or traffic signals.
                            e. Within 10 feet of permanent buildings or within 20 feet of temporary
                        buildings, unless the area is specifically designated for parking or loading/
                        unloading is taking place.
                             f. Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, in any direction.
                             g. Outside the white lines of parking spaces. Vehicles will not take up
                        two parking spaces.
                             h. Anywhere on base roadways when the purpose is major or minor
                        repairs. Major repairs will also not be made in base parking lots. Major
                        repairs include: repairing the engine, drive train, or rear end; replacing body
                        parts; placing the vehicle on jack stands or drive-on ramps (excluding tire
                        changing), or any repair disabling the vehicle for six hours or longer.
75 th Services Division 1. Personnel authorized to permanently register POVs may display them for
(75 SVS) For Sale Lot sale in the parking lot adjacent to Bldg 524, Outdoor Recreation (75 MSG/
                        SVM). Before such use, personnel will register their POVs and obtain a
                        permit from the base Auto Hobby Shop (75 SVS/SVRS), 777-3476. All
                        POVs parked in the For Sale Lot will have a current state registration and
                        vehicle liability insurance.
                        2. POVs may also be displayed for sale at base housing residences if parked
                        in their driveways or garages.
  Recreational Vehicle 1. RVs (motor homes, fifth wheels, travel trailers, pickup truck campers,
    (RV) Parking/Use    and pop-up/tent campers) post unique problems for the installation. Their
                        size, either alone or in conjunction with their tow vehicle, imposes
                        challenges and obstacles to traffic, often requiring more than the single
                        parking space allotted for POVs.
                        2. The following rules govern the parking and use of RVs on base.
                            a. RVs may be stored or parked only in the following locations: 1 Apr–
                        31 Oct, in the designated RV storage lot, or completely within the driveway
                        or carport of a base housing unit; 1 Nov-31 Mar, in the RV storage lot, or off
                        base. Except for trucks with campers mounted in their beds, RVs will not
                        be parked on the street in base housing. RVs will not be stored in parking
                        lots.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                            43


                              b. RVs will not be occupied overnight unless registered and parked in the
                           Family Camping Area (FAMCAMP). On occasion, 75 MSG/SVRE may
                           sponsor an activity and designate a parking lot for the use of RVs
                           participating in that activity, and RVs parked in the designated area may
                           only dry camp; there will be no connection to utilities (electricity, water and
                           sewer). Generator use will be determined for each event (normally
                           0600-2200 hours). Quiet hours will be from 2200-0600.
                              c. Transient RVs may park at the base exchange and commissary for a
                           reasonable length of time while their occupants are shopping in these
                           facilities, but in no case will they remain overnight. Drivers will do
                           everything possible to avoid causing obstruction to other traffic.
                              d. Small RVs (typically pickup truck campers and small Class B motor
                           homes) may be used by personnel to commute to and from work, only as
                           long as the vehicles, when parked, occupy no more than a single parking
                           space.
                              e. 75 SFS/SFO personnel or parking wardens may ticket violators.
                           Unattended RVs in violation may be ticketed and towed at the owner’s
                           expense. Repeated violations may result in removal of base registration
                           decals and denial of entry to base. Under some circumstances, owners/
                           drivers may be barred from base.

4.9. Traffic Violation Reports.
   4.9.1. Commanders should deal with most traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations
   within Air Force channels.
   4.9.2. You can refer traffic violations occurring on Air Force installations (within the United States or
   its territories) to the proper US Magistrate. Do not refer violations in the following circumstances:
       4.9.2.1. The operator is driving a government vehicle at the time of the violation.
       4.9.2.2. A US Federal Magistrate is either not available or lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter
       because the violation occurred in an area where the federal government has only proprietary legis-
       lative jurisdiction.
       4.9.2.3. Mission requirements make referral of offenders impractical.
       4.9.2.4. A US Magistrate is available, but the accused refuses to consent to the jurisdiction of the
       court and the US attorney refuses to process the case before a US district court.
   4.9.3. Issue traffic violators on military installations a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket,
   or a DD Form 1805, United States District Court Violation Notice. The CSP determines who is autho-
   rized to issue those forms and what training they must complete before issuing either form. The DD
   Form 1408 is issued to the following personnel: active duty personnel, Cadets/Midshipmen of the Mil-
   itary Academies to include the Coast Guard Academy, reservists on orders or performing inactive
   duty training including commuting to and from training, and guardsman in federal service under Title
   10 of the United States Code. Title 10 status is reflected on the guardsman’ s orders. Issue civilians the
   DD Form 1805, or the DD Form 1408 when a US Magistrate system is not available.”
44                                AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


     4.9.3. (HILL) Individuals contesting a traffic citation issued on a DD Form 1408 may contact 75
     MSG/CD to schedule an appointment. Individuals contesting a traffic citation issued on a DD Form
     1805 may contact OO-ALC/JAJ.
     4.9.4. Installation commanders establish procedures for disposing of traffic violation cases through
     administrative or judicial action consistent with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and
     federal law. Additionally, forward a copy of all violation reports on military personnel and DoD civil-
     ian employees apprehended for intoxicated driving to the Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol
     Control.
     4.9.5. Unless restricted under the provisions of para 4.9.2., use the DD Form 1805 to refer civilian
     violators of state and federal traffic laws to the appropriate US magistrate. Notify the commander,
     first sergeant, or supervisor when any military personnel or DoD civilian employees is cited with the
     DD Form 1805. If requested, locally reproduce a copy of the DD Form 1805 and make it available to
     the commander, first sergeant, or supervisor.
        4.9.5.1. Preparation of the DD Form 1805. This prenumbered form is issued through standard
        publication channels and is only accountable once it is issued to an offender. Before issuing this
        form, stamp (type) in black ink the specific address of the clerk of the US District Court (Central
        Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address the communication, on the reverse of the
        violator’s copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. Determine the entry for the amount of
        the fine, mandatory court appearance of the offender, and the date of appearance according to
        guidance furnished by the governing district court.
        4.9.5.1. (HILL) The preset collateral amount will be entered in Box B or Box A will be checked
        to indicate a mandatory appearance before a US magistrate. If a mandatory appearance is required,
        the box showing time and place of the court appearance will be filled in as prearranged with the
        US magistrate. Personnel who issue mandatory appearance violation notices will appear before
        the US magistrate, if required. See paragraphs 6.3.4. (Added) and 6.3.5. (Added) for instructions
        on processing violations involving automobile insurance coverage.
        4.9.5.2. Identify the assimilation of state traffic laws by a specific state code reference in the
        CODE SECTION block of the DD Form 1805 or in a complaint filed with the US magistrate.
        4.9.5.3. Use the statement of probable cause on the DD Form 1805 according to local staff judge
        advocate and US magistrate court policy. The statement of probable cause is required by the fed-
        eral misdemeanor rules to support the issuance of a summons or arrest warrant.
        4.9.5.4. For cases referred to US magistrate, normal distribution of DD Form 1805 is as follows:
            4.9.5.4.1. The CSP forwards copy 1 (white) and copy 2 (yellow) to the US District Court
            (Central Violation Bureau).
            4.9.5.4.2. Security police file copy 3 (pink).
            4.9.5.4.3. Provide copy 4 (envelope) to the violator.
NOTE: Ensure unit personnel are notified IAW para 4.9.5. above.
            4.9.5.4.3. (HILL) If offenders wish to appear before a US magistrate, they do not send in the
            collateral amount by mail. The US Magistrate Court will inform them of their court appear-
            ance date. The US magistrate may require the posting of a bond before the hearing is sched-
            uled.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                         45


      4.9.5.5. When DD Form 1408 is used, distribute the form as follows:
          4.9.5.5.1. Provide the pink copy to the violator with normal reporting instructions and rebuttal
          instructions as determined by the installation commander.
          4.9.5.5.2. Forward the white copy to the service member’s commander, to the commander of
          the family member’s sponsor, or to the civilian’s supervisor or employer for administrative
          action within the unit/organization.
          4.9.5.5.3. Forward the yellow copy to the security police administration branch for processing
          and tracking until the white "action copy" is returned by the unit commander, section com-
          mander, or first sergeant. When the white copy is received, review it for action taken, annotate
          the information in SPAS or the AF Form 1313, Driver Record, with the moving or non-mov-
          ing violation and any points assessed. File the white and yellow copies with the driver record.
      4.9.5.6. (Added-HILL) In cases where a mandatory appearance is not required, if offenders wish
      to appear before a US magistrate, they do not send in the collateral amount by mail, requesting
      instead an appearance date by checking the appropriate line on the DD Form 1805 and mailing the
      DD Form 1805 to the Central Violations Bureau. The US Magistrate Court will inform them of
      their court appearance date. The US magistrate may require the posting of a bond before the hear-
      ing is scheduled.
   4.9.6. (Added-HILL) Violations that warrant suspension or revocation of base driving privileges, in
   addition to those listed in AFI 31-204, are shown in Attachment 4 (Added) of this supplement.
   NOTE: Any individual who is on a suspension or revocation and is charged with another violation
   that warrants suspension or revocation is subject to the additional suspension or revocation being
   imposed. If imposed, the additional suspension or revocation will run consecutively to the term of the
   original suspension or revocation. Any individual charged with driving on base while base driving
   privileges are suspended or revoked is subject to revocation of an additional two years. The two addi-
   tional years will run consecutively to the term of the original suspension or revocation.

4.10. Standards and Procedures for Processing Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.10.1. As a minimum, the CSP must train installation law enforcement personnel to do the follow-
   ing:
      4.10.1.1. Recognize signs of alcohol and other drug impairment in persons operating motor vehi-
      cles.
      4.10.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1920, Alcohol Influence Report, or other form which adequately
      documents sobriety and sobriety testing of an individual.
      4.10.1.2. (HILL) Also, prepare the Utah DUI Summons and Citation form when processing
      intoxicated drivers, but do not list a court or court appearance date as this is done separately on the
      DD Form 1805 or by a separate charging document.
      4.10.1.3. Perform standard field sobriety tests. The standardized Air Force field sobriety test con-
      sists of the one leg stand, the walk and turn, and the horizontal gaze nystagmus. Also consider any
      local, state, or host nation sobriety test requirements in addition to the above standard Air Force
      tests.
46                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


        4.10.1.4. Determine to a reasonable and practical degree when a person appears intoxicated, but
        is actually physically or mentally ill and requires prompt medical attention.
        4.10.1.5. Understand the operation of breath-testing devices.
     4.10.2. Each installation using breath-testing devices will ensure operators of these devices:
        4.10.2.1. Are chosen for integrity, maturity, and sound judgment.
        4.10.2.2. Meet installation, and where possible, state certification standards.
     4.10.3. Use only breath-testing devices listed on the approved NHTSA conforming products list pub-
     lished in the Federal Register. Ensure only trained personnel administer tests as specified in para-
     graph 4.13. and adhere to the procedures described in paragraphs 4.14. and 4.15. relating to voluntary
     and involuntary testing.
     4.10.4. Installations located in states or overseas areas with no formal training program will develop
     their own training program following material and guidance from selected civilian institutions or
     manufacturers of the equipment. Coordinate local training programs with the installation staff judge
     advocate and state's attorney general (or local equivalent) to ensure your program meets local require-
     ments for legal admissibility. Conduct refresher training at the intervals determined by the CSP and
     staff judge advocate.

4.11. Blood Alcohol Concentration Standards.
     4.11.1. Uniformly apply administrative revocation of driving privileges and other enforcement mea-
     sures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a person is tested per para-
     graph 2.3., evaluate the results of the test as follows:
        4.11.1.1. If the percentage of alcohol in the person’s blood is less than 0.05 percent, presume the
        person is not under the influence of alcohol.
        4.11.1.2. If the percentage is 0.05 but less than 0.10, presume the person is impaired. Consider
        this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the
        influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges according to para 2.5. Note: The 0.10 threshold
        delineating impaired from intoxicated can be lesser level when assimilating a more stringent local,
        state, or host nation standard.
        4.11.1.3. If the percentage is 0.10 (or lesser amount when assimilating local, state, or host nation
        standards) or more or if tests reflect the presence of illegal drugs, the person is considered to have
        been driving under the influence of intoxicants. Suspend driving privileges according to para
        2.5.1.3.
     4.11.2. Percentages in paragraph 4.11.1. are percent of weight by volume of alcohol in the blood
     based on grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Installation commanders will modify military
     standards to agree with a more stringent state, local authority, or host nation standard. Refer to Assess-
     ment #3, Table 5.1.

4.12. Chemical Testing Policies and Procedures.
     4.12.1. Results of chemical testing are valid under this instruction only under the following circum-
     stances:
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                         47


      4.12.1.1. Testing of blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances using generally accepted sci-
      entific and medical methods and standards.
      4.12.1.2. Qualified personnel administer breath tests.
      4.12.1.3. Use of a nonportable breath-testing device approved by the state or host nation.
   4.12.2. If the state or host nation has not established procedures for use of breath-testing devices, then
   apply the following procedures if you use portable breath-testing devices: 1) During the initial traffic
   stop as a field sobriety testing technique in lieu of or in conjunction with other field sobriety testing
   techniques as long as the state or host nation does not prohibit such use, and 2) According to the man-
   ufacturer's operating instructions.
      4.12.2.1. Use nonportable evidentiary breath-testing devices as follows:
          4.12.2.1.1. Observe the suspected person for at least 20 minutes before collecting the breath
          specimen. During this time, the person must not drink, eat, smoke, chew tobacco, or ingest
          any substance.
          4.12.2.1.2. Verify calibration and proper operation of the instrument according to manufac-
          turer's specifications and any specific local, state, or host nation requirements.
          4.12.2.1.3. Comply with operational procedures in the manufacturer’s current instruction
          manual. Perform the preventive maintenance as required by the owner's manual.
   4.12.3. Chemical tests of personnel involved in fatal accidents.
      4.12.3.1. Installation medical authorities will immediately notify and brief the CSP upon death of
      any person involved in a motor vehicle accident. Subject to military jurisdiction, medical author-
      ities will examine anyone killed in an on-base motor vehicle accident or mishap. Conduct tests for
      the presence and concentration of alcohol or other drugs in the blood, bodily fluids, or tissues as
      soon as possible and where practical within eight hours of death. Include the test results in the
      medical reports.
      4.12.3.2. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath sample
      from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.

4.13. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.13.1. Most of the time you will detect drunk drivers by observing unusual or abnormal driving
   behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If you reason-
   ably conclude that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform field sobriety tests.
   The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording results of such tests. Use the
   standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.10. Specific procedures for administering them can be
   found in AFH 31-227, Air Force Motor Vehicle and Traffic Control. Also see AFH 31-227 for proce-
   dures and guidance concerning the use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints, and other drunk driving
   reduction measures.

4.14. Voluntary Breath and Bodily Fluid Testing Based on Implied Consent.
   4.14.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3.
   4.14.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
48                                  AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


        4.14.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a motor
        vehicle on the installation.
        4.14.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the influence of
        alcohol or drugs.
        4.14.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that failure to
        voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may result in revoca-
        tion of on-base driving privileges.
     4.14.3. The installation commander prescribes the type of chemical tests used. Advise the driver that
     the installation commander may revoke driving privileges if they fail to voluntarily submit to or com-
     plete a requested chemical test and that they do not have the right to have an attorney present before
     deciding if they will or will not take the test. Testing will follow policies and procedures in paragraph
     4.12. Also advise the driver that you can use the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied
     consent provisions of this instruction as evidence in courts-martial, nonjudicial proceedings under
     Article 15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
     4.14.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders, or any
     medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may refuse a blood
     extraction without penalty, but you can offer a breath or urine test, or both. You must outline these
     procedures and the type of medical conditions that qualify for nonpunitive refusal in readily available
     medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other reasonable areas where blood samples might
     be drawn from those suspected of drunk driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a med-
     ical doctor.
     4.14.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do not admin-
     ister a test except as specified in paragraph 4.15.

4.15. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
     4.15.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of individuals stopped, apprehended, or
     cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor vehicle and for whom proba-
     ble cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated. Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence,
     and regulatory rules concerning requesting and granting authorizations for searches govern the extrac-
     tion of body fluids in furtherance of other kinds of investigations. Air Force policy on nonconsensual
     extraction of blood samples is further addressed in AFI 44-102, Patient Care and Management of
     Clinical Services.
     4.15.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure authori-
     zations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and who subse-
     quently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test,. may nonetheless be forced to submit to an
     involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. As a general rule, forced extractions are considered only when
     an individual is involved in an accident in which there is a death, serious personal injury, or significant
     property damage. Probable cause must exist to believe the individual was driving or was in control of
     a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Conduct the extraction in accordance with the
     following procedures: 1) A search authorization by an appropriate commander or military magistrate
     obtained pursuant to Rule 315, Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual
     extraction; 2) A search authorization is not required under such circumstances when there is a clear
     indication that one will find evidence of intoxication and there is reason to believe that the delay nec-
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                         49


   essary to obtain a search authorization would result in the loss or destruction of the evidence sought;
   and 3) Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing staff judge advocate
   and attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability of the
   appropriate commander or military magistrate.
       4.15.2.1. If authorization from the military magistrate or commander proves unsuccessful (due to
       nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
       Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at the
       time an authorization is sought.
           4.15.2.1.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical facil-
           ity should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate.
           4.15.2.1.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d) need
           not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can perform the
           extraction.
           4.15.2.1.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the individ-
           ual in determining probable cause.
   4.15.3. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary purposes by
   qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions defining medical care,
   such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFR 160-12. Only qualified medi-
   cal personnel administer extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure.
   Assistance to overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
   enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s commanding officer
   or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect nonconsensual extractions.
       4.15.3.1. Nonconsensual extraction will not interfere with or delay proper medical attention.
       Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other medi-
       cal treatment is required.

4.16. Testing at the Request of the Apprehended Person.
   4.16.1. A person subject to tests under paragraph 2.3. can request additional testing. These tests are
   paid for by the requesting individual, and an approved facility such as an off-base hospital or research
   laboratory performs the tests. If they desire admissibility of other tests in a military or civilian court
   of law, they must ensure the state (or host nation when in an overseas area) approves the test and test
   method. Complete all tests as soon as possible, noting any delay on the resulting documents.
   4.16.2. If someone requests additional testing, the apprehending official may help make those
   arrangements. However, tests conducted under authority of the UCMJ remain valid when circum-
   stances prevent timely release of the individual, or for whatever reason additional testing is not com-
   pleted.

4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. Civil authorities enforce traffic laws in areas not under mili-
tary control. Likewise, the security police often investigate on-base accidents and incidents of interest to
local authorities. Consequently, the CSP must develop a program for the sharing and exchanging of infor-
mation with civil authorities. In overseas areas, these procedures are generally well documented in formal
agreements with the host nation. Local procedures must cover the receiving, processing, and securing of
traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative agencies.

4.18. Compliance With Local and State Laws.
     4.18.1. Installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws when
     operating government vehicles on or off base.
     4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before moving gov-
     ernment vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits such as weight,
     length, width, or other standards.
     4.18.3. Installation commanders should maintain a close liaison with civil enforcement agencies and
     encourage the following:
        4.18.3.1. When possible, the prompt release of government vehicles and operators involved in
        accidents or incidents.
        4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of government
        motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious violations of civil traffic
        laws.
        4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any state, local, or host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
        driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

4.19. Civil-Military Cooperative Programs.
     4.19.1. The State-Armed Forces Traffic Workshop Program is an organized effort to coordinate mili-
     tary and civil traffic safety activities throughout a state or area. Installation commanders should coop-
     erate and provide proper support and participation.
     4.19.2. The installation commander should establish a community-installation traffic workshop pro-
     gram to coordinate the installation traffic efforts with those of local communities. Sound and practical
     traffic planning depends on a balanced program of traffic enforcement, engineering, and education.
     Civilian and military legal and law enforcement officers, traffic engineers, safety officials, and public
     affairs officers should take part.
4.20. (Added-HILL) Flight Line Driving. Operating vehicles on the Hill AFB flight line is covered in
Hill AFB Instruction 13-202, Flight Line Vehicle Control. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) is
the Chief, Airfield Management or Airfield Operations (75 OSS/OSA).

                   DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SPAS or the AF Form 1313 to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and
parking violations, suspension or revocation actions, and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members, and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a military
installation. In filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “S” subject or “V” vic-
   tim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability deter-
   mined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and
   “FO” fixed object.

Table 5.1. Suspension/Revocation of Driving Privileges (See Notes 1 and 2).
Assessment: 1. Two-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
Violation: Driving while driver’s license or installation driving privileges are under suspension or
revocation.
Assessment: 2. One-year revocation is mandatory on determination of facts by installation commander.
Violation: Refusal to submit to or failure to complete chemical tests (implied consent).
Assessment: 3. One-year revocation is mandatory on conviction.
Violation:
1. Manslaughter (or negligent homicide by vehicle) resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.
2. Driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor
0.10% or greater. Note: Where state or local authority use a more stringent standard (i.e., 0.08 instead of
0.10), Air Force units will assimilate the more stringent standard.
3. Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of any narcotic or while under the influence of any
other drug (including alcohol) to the degree rendered incapable of safe vehicle operation.
4. Use of a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony.
5. Fleeing the scene of an accident involving death or personal injury (hit and run).
6. Perjury or making a false statement or affidavit under oath to responsible officials relating to the
ownership or operation of motor vehicles.
7. Unauthorized use of a motor vehicle belonging to another, when the act does not amount to a felony.
Assessment: 4. Suspension for a period of six months or less or revocation for a period not to exceed
one year is discretionary.
Violation:
1. Mental or physical impairment (not including alcohol or other drug use) to the degree rendered
incompetent to drive.
2. Commission of an offense in another state which, if committed on the installation, would establish
grounds for suspension or revocation.
3. Permitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of an official driver’s license.
4. Conviction of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.
5. Conviction of racing on the highway.
6. Excessive parking and other non-moving violations as covered under paragraph 2.5.1.1.

NOTES:
     1. When imposing a suspension or revocation because of an off-installation offense, the effective
        date is the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of state or
        host nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
       2. No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied con-
          sent violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial,
          nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise
          addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another revo-
          cation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations may run consecutively (total of 24
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                         53


            months) or concurrently (total of 12 months). Apply the installation commander’s policy sys-
            tematically and not on a case-by-case basis.

Table 5.1. (AFMC) Assessment 4.
Impose a 30 day suspension (first time suspension) for a habitual parking violations. Impose no more
than a six-month suspension (first time suspension) when six or more parking violations have
accumulated within a six-month period. For second (and subsequent) suspensions for parking violations,
a longer suspension may be imposed. However, a one year suspension/revocation is the maximum for
parking violations. Do not impose points for parking violations.

5.2. The Traffic Point System. The traffic point system provides a uniform administrative device to
impartially judge service personnel's driving performance. This system is not a disciplinary measure or a
substitute for punitive action. Further, this system is not intended to interfere in any way with the reason-
able exercise of an installation commander’s prerogative to issue, suspend, revoke, deny, or reinstate
installation driving privileges.

5.3. Point System Application. The use of the point system and procedures prescribed herein are man-
datory. The point system applies to civilian personnel operating government vehicles on and off the
installation and to their POVs driven on-base. It applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs
on or off the installation and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this
instruction operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
according to the Table 5.2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or civilian court,
or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or collateral. Do not use the
point system for non-moving violations.

Table 5.2. Point Assessment for Moving Violations (See Note 1).
Violation                                                                                 Points

instruments or to transmit simulated erroneous speed (prohibited on DoD installations).
Driver involved in accident is deemed responsible (only added to points assessed for            1
specific violations).

NOTES:
  1. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, assess the points for the offense
     having the greater value.
     2. Use this measure for other than minor vehicle safety defects or when a driver or registrant fails to
        correct a minor defect (for example, a burned out headlight not replaced within the grace period
        on a warning ticket).
     3. Applies to not using or improper use of a child restraint device, i.e., car seat, infant carrier, booster
        seat, belt/strap modification (when required by manufacturer) etc. Assess four points when no
        restraint system of any kind is used.

5.4. Point System Procedures.
     5.4.1. Reports of moving traffic violations recorded on DD Form 1408 or DD Form 1805 will serve
     as a basis for determining point assessment.
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                      55


  5.4.2. On receipt of DD Form 1408 or other military law enforcement report of a moving violation
  (e.g., AFI 3545) the unit commander or designated supervisor will conduct an inquiry. The com-
  mander will take or recommend proper disciplinary or administrative action.
  5.4.3. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW para 4.9.
  5.4.4. Installation commanders may require the following driver improvement measures as appropri-
  ate:
     5.4.4.1. Advisory letter through the unit commander or supervisor to any person who has
     acquired six traffic points within a six-month period.
     5.4.4.1. (HILL) 75 SFS/SFAR will forward an advisory letter, on behalf of the Chief, Security
     Forces (CSF), through the unit commander or supervisor, to any person accumulating six traffic
     points within a six-month period.
     5.4.4.2. Counseling or driver improvement interview by the unit commander of any person who
     acquires more than six points but less than 12 traffic points within a six-month period.
     5.4.4.3. Referral for medical evaluation when a driver, based on reasonable belief, appears to
     have mental or physical limits that had, or may have, an adverse effect on driving ability.
     5.4.4.4. Attendance at driver improvement program (DIP) to improve driving skill, awareness, or
     attitude.
     5.4.4.5. Referral to an alcohol or drug treatment or rehabilitation facility for evaluation, counsel-
     ing, or treatment. This action is required for active duty military personnel in all cases in which
     alcohol or other drugs are a contributing factor to a traffic citation, incident, or accident.
  5.4.5. The installation commander may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
  instruction regardless of whether these improvement measures are accomplished.
  5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one violation
  or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic points within 24
  consecutive months). Installation commanders determine suspension and revocation periods for
  offenses not covered in Table 5.1.; however, any revocation must be for a period of 6 months or more.
  The installation commander may impose a longer suspension or revocation period (to include offenses
  in Table 5.1.) based on the person’s overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and
  severity of moving violations, and the response to previous driver improvement measures. In all
  cases, military members must successfully complete a prescribed course in remedial driver training
  before reinstatement of driving privileges.
  5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for 24 con-
  secutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during records update while
  recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations. Completion of a revocation
  based on points requires removal from the driver record of all points assessed before the revocation.
  5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving violations,
  chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain posted on individual
  driving records for the period of time indicated below.
     5.4.8.1. Chargeable nonfatal traffic accidents or moving violations--three years.
     5.4.8.2. Nonmandatory suspensions or revocations--five years.

        5.4.8.3. Mandatory revocations--seven years.

5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Establish procedures to promptly notify the CSP when a person
assigned to or employed on the installation is transferred to another installation, released from military
service, or ends employment or affiliation with the installation.
5.5. (HILL) Disposition of Driving Records. When 75 SFS/SFAR is notified of personnel changing
duty stations, they will forward an Individual History Record to the gaining commander if the individual’s
driving privileges have been revoked or suspended, or if the individual has accumulated traffic points.
     5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other entries on
     their driving records, the CSP must forward the records to the CSP of the gaining installation. The
     gaining CSP should coordinate with applicable commanders and continue any Air Force suspension
     or revocation based on intoxicated driving or accumulation of traffic points. Traffic points for persons
     transferred will continue to accumulate as specified in para 5.4.7.
     5.5.2. Follow AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities, and AFMAN
     37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released
     from active duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of
     officer component, or military and civilian retirement when continued vehicle registration is autho-
     rized. Retain or destroy according to AFMAN 37-139 records on civilian personnel who are terminat-
     ing on-base employment or on-base registration.
     5.5.3. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or other
     entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for service members.
     Retain driving records of retirees electing to retain installation driving privileges. Do not delete points
     accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or
     chargeable accidents from the driver records except per para 5.4.7. and 5.4.8.

                                                Chapter 6

                         IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. General. This chapter provides the standards and procedures for law enforcement personnel when
towing, inventorying, searching, impounding, and disposing of POVs. This policy is based on:
   6.1.1. The interests of the Air Force in crime prevention, traffic safety, and the orderly flow of vehicle
   traffic movement.
   6.1.2. The vehicle owner's constitutional rights to due process, freedom from unreasonable search
   and seizure, and freedom from deprivation of private property.

6.2. Standards for Impoundment.
   6.2.1. You should not impound a vehicle unless it interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or
   convenience, is involved in criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or
   abandoned.
   6.2.2. The impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other reasonable alternatives exist. When
   possible, attempt to locate the owner of the POV and have the vehicle removed. If reasonably feasi-
   ble, allow another responsible person to drive or tow the POV, if they first have permission from the
   owner, operator, or person empowered to control the vehicle. However in such cases, the security
   police (or towing contractor) is not responsible for safeguarding the vehicle.
   6.2.3. Impounding of POVs is justified when any of the following conditions exist:
       6.2.3.1. The vehicle is illegally parked:
          6.2.3.1.1. On a street or bridge, in a tunnel, or is double parked and interferes with the orderly
          flow of traffic.
          6.2.3.1.2. On a sidewalk, within an intersection, on a crosswalk, on a railroad track, in a fire
          lane, or is blocking a driveway so that the vehicle interferes with operations or creates a safety
          hazard to other roadway users or the general public.
          6.2.3.1.3. When blocking an emergency exit door of any public place.
          6.2.3.1.4. In a “tow-away” zone that is so marked with signs.
       6.2.3.2. The vehicle interferes with or is involved in one of the following:
          6.2.3.2.1. Street cleaning or snow removal operations after attempts to contact the owner fail.
          6.2.3.2.2. Emergency operations during a natural disaster, fire, or other emergency.
          6.2.3.2.3. The vehicle was used in a crime or contains evidence of criminal activity.
          6.2.3.2.4. The owner or person in charge of the vehicle is apprehended and therefore unable
          (or unwilling) to arrange removal of the vehicle.
          6.2.3.2.5. The POV is mechanically defective and is a menace to others using the public road-
          ways.
          6.2.3.2.6. The POV is disabled by a traffic accident and the operator is unavailable or physi-
          cally incapable of having the vehicle towed to a place of safety for storage or safekeeping.
58                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


            6.2.3.2.7. Law enforcement personnel reasonably believe the vehicle is abandoned.

6.3. Towing and Storage.
     6.3.1. The Air Force or a contracted wrecker service may tow and store impounded POVs depending
     on availability of towing services and the local commander’s preference.
     6.3.2. The installation commander designates a securable enclosed area on the installation for use as
     an impound lot. You may use an impoundment area belonging to a contracted wrecker service pro-
     vided the area is reasonably secure. The CSP approves contractor impoundment areas and maintains
     keys for all on-base impoundment areas.
     6.3.2. (HILL) 75 SFS will maintain an impound lot on Hill AFB. The Investigation Section (75 SFS/
     SFOI) is the OPR for the lot.
     6.3.3. Impound or tow POVs for appropriate violations of the installation traffic code or involvement
     in criminal activities under the direct supervision of law enforcement personnel.
     6.3.3. (HILL) When the operator of a POV is apprehended or detained for DUI, 75 SFS/SFO person-
     nel will secure the vehicle by one of the following methods:
        6.3.3.1. (Added-HILL) If another person in the vehicle is unimpaired, possesses a valid driver’s
        license, and has the consent of the driver or owner, and if the vehicle is insured to be driven by
        other people than the owner, that person may take possession of the vehicle.
        6.3.3.2. (Added-HILL) If the vehicle is blocking or impeding traffic, coordinate through 75 SFS/
        SFO so the vehicle can be towed off base by a civilian wrecker service.
     6.3.4. (Added-HILL) When a driver cannot produce proof of insurance and states their vehicle is not
     insured, the vehicle will be towed off base by a civilian wrecker service. No one, including 75 SFS/
     SFO personnel, will drive the vehicle any further. An uninsured POV will not be operated on base
     under any circumstances.
     6.3.5. (Added-HILL) When a driver cannot provide valid proof of insurance but states the vehicle is
     insured, issue a DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket (military), or DD Form 1805, United
     States District Court Violation, (family members, civilians) citing the driver. The driver will then
     have 72 hours to bring evidence of insurance, valid at the time the ticket was issued, to the 75th Secu-
     rity Forces Control Center (SFCC). If evidence of valid insurance is provided within 72 hours, the DD
     Form 1408 will be annotated to reflect the issuance of a warning, or in the case of a DD Form 1805,
     the DD Form 1805 will be voided and a DD Form 1408, annotated as a warning, will be issued to the
     driver. If proof is not verified within 72 hours, the ticket will be processed for action by the military
     member’s commander or by the US Magistrate Court.

6.4. Procedures for Impoundment.
     6.4.1. Unattended POVs.
     6.4.1. (HILL) Abandoning or parking a vehicle on base in any way that presents a hazard is prohib-
     ited. Such vehicles are subject to impoundment at the owner’s expense, without warning. A vehicle is
     presumed abandoned if it is left unattended for a period of more than three duty days. Vehicles parked
     more than three duty days without a DD Form 2220 or current state license plates are deemed aban-
     doned and will be towed. Additionally, vehicles parked more than 10 days missing the engine or other
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                       59


  major parts (i.e., fender, windshield, wheel, etc.) are deemed abandoned. In restricted areas, POVs
  will not be left unattended at any time.
     6.4.1.1. Conspicuously place DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice (See DODD 5525.4),
     on POVs considered abandoned or improperly unattended. Document this action with an entry in
     the security police blotter.
     6.4.1.2. Allow the owner three days from the date the POV is tagged to remove the vehicle. Have
     the vehicle towed if it's not moved within the allotted time. If a contracted wrecker service is used,
     complete a DD Form 2505 according to local procedures.
     6.4.1.3. After the vehicle is removed, security police or the contractor completes the DD Form
     2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report (See DODD 5525.4), as a record of action taken.
         6.4.1.3.1. Law enforcement personnel or the towing contractor conduct an inventory listing
         personal property. Do not open closed containers such as a suitcase unless necessary to iden-
         tify the owner or if the contents might present a danger to the public. In most cases, listing the
         container and sealing it with security tape will suffice.
         6.4.1.3.2. Place personal property in a secure area for safekeeping.
         6.4.1.3.3. (Added-HILL) Make a reasonable attempt to locate the vehicle owner. If the owner
         cannot be contacted a DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, will be issued allowing
         three days before impoundment procedures are continued. NOTE: If the owner is on tempo-
         rary duty or leave, the vehicle will not be considered abandoned or towed unless it is a safety
         hazard or does not possess a current DD Form 2220.
         6.4.1.3.4. (Added-HILL) A written report of impoundment will be sent to the Vehicle
         Impoundment Lot Officer, 75 SFS/SFOI.
     6.4.1.4. Forward DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment (See DODD 5525.4), by cer-
     tified mail to the address of the last known owner of the vehicle to advise the owner of the
     impoundment action and request information concerning the owner’s intentions concerning the
     vehicle.
  6.4.2. Stolen POVs or vehicles involved in criminal activity.
     6.4.2.1. Keep vehicles in Air Force custody when holding them for evidentiary purposes. Release
     recovered stolen POVs to the registered owner, unless held for evidentiary purposes, or to the law
     enforcement agency reporting the vehicle stolen, as appropriate.
     6.4.2.2. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government agencies will request the Air
     Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to military issues. Staff such requests
     through the Staff Judge Advocate and CSP. When appropriate, comply and support such requests
     and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if civil authorities do not
     take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by the installation com-
     mander.
  6.4.3. (Added-HILL) Release of Impounded Vehicles.
     6.4.3.1. (Added-HILL) A vehicle impounded due to being abandoned will be released after the
     registered owner or agent:
60                                 AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002


            6.4.3.1.1. (Added-HILL) Makes a request in person at Bldg 1235, 75 SFS/SFOI, for release
            of the vehicle. Request can be made between the hours of 0730 and 1600, Monday through
            Friday, excluding holidays.
            6.4.3.1.2. (Added-HILL) Presents ID sufficient to prove ownership of the impounded vehi-
            cle.
            6.4.3.1.3. (Added-HILL) Pays an impound fee of $60 to the Defense Finance and Account-
            ing Service/San Bernardino, at the Financial Management and Comptroller Directorate
            (OO-ALC/FM) in Bldg 1238, and then presents receipt of payment to 75 SFS/SFOI.
        6.4.3.2. (Added-HILL) Any impounded vehicle not claimed by the registered owner or agent
        within 120 days from the date of impoundment will be disposed of in accordance with DoDM
        4160.21, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Manual, UCA 41-6-116.10, or at the direction of
        OO-ALC/CC.

6.5. Search Incident to Impoundment Based On Criminal Activity. Search of a POV in conjunction
with impoundment based on criminal activity will likely occur in one of the following general situations:
     6.5.1. The owner or operator is not present. This situation could arise during traffic and crime-related
     impoundments and abandoned vehicle seizures. Do not search the vehicle unless evidence or contra-
     band is in plain view or is readily discernible on the outside as evidence of criminal activity. When in
     doubt, obtain proper search authority before searching.
     6.5.2. The owner or operator is present. This situation can occur during a traffic or criminal incident
     or if the operator is apprehended for a crime or serious traffic violation and sufficient probable cause
     exists to seize the vehicle. In some cases, the operator is present but is unwilling, incapacitated, or
     otherwise unable to make adequate arrangements to safeguard the vehicle. As a general rule, you may
     search vehicles without search authority when there is a reasonable danger to police or public, there is
     a risk of loss or destruction of evidence, or the search is reasonable under rules governing search inci-
     dent to apprehension.

6.6. Disposition Of Vehicles After Impoundment.
     6.6.1. When a vehicle is impounded, hold it for as long as necessary for evidentiary, law enforcement,
     or other legal purposes. Unless directed otherwise by competent authority, release vehicles and prop-
     erty when no longer needed for one of the reasons stated above. Review Title 10, USC 2575, Dispo-
     sition of Unclaimed Property, and DoD Directive 4160.21-M, Defense Reutilization Marketing
     Manual, (when DRMO is used) before taking action to dispose of vehicles not claimed by the owner
     or an authorized agent.
     6.6.2. A vehicle is considered abandoned 60 days after making reasonable good faith efforts to con-
     tact the owner or when the owner is contacted and fails to take appropriate steps to assume responsi-
     bility for the vehicle. When owners decline to recover their vehicles, attempt to secure release of the
     vehicle by having the registered owners complete and sign the DD Form 2507. The 60-day waiting
     period does not apply when the owner releases the vehicle to the Air Force on DD Form 2507, signed
     letter, power of attorney, or other legally recognized document.
        6.6.2.1. Once the vehicle becomes the lawful possession of the Air Force, process the vehicle as
        abandoned property in accordance with local procedures. Unless otherwise directed, installation
        commanders have considerable latitude in determining the best use for, or disposal of, abandoned
AFI31-204_AFMCSUP1_HILLAFBSUP1_I 31 DECEMBER 2002                                                       61


       property. Scrap, auction, or use to support Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) activities are
       potential options. Consider local, state, or if applicable, host nation requirements. If you process
       vehicles through the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO), follow applicable DRMO
       and DoD directives.
