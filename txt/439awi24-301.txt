government vehicles with equal force to officers, airmen and civilian drivers. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision includes official use policy, idling policy, approval authority for vehicle air
transport, fleet card usage, vehicle rental/lease requests.
1. Official use of Government Vehicles.
   1.1. Title 40 U.S.C., Section 491 requires the Air Force to develop an effective means of
   limiting the use of government vehicles for official government business. The Air Force has
 2                                                          439AWI24-301 7 OCTOBER 2014


     established this policy requirement in Air Force Instruction 24-301, Vehicle Operations. This
     provision applies to all military and civilian personnel who operate government vehicles,
     including those rented or leased with government funds, and provides for potential
     disciplinary actions against those who violate this standard.
     1.2. The concept “official use” of Air Force vehicles is sufficiently broad to prohibit
     instruction relating to each and every instance in which vehicles may be used. AFI 24-301,
     however, establishes one simple rule: Restrict the use of all DoD motor vehicles, including
     those rented or leased, to official purposes only, that is, uses that would further enhance
     the mission of the Air Force. Providing a government vehicle solely or even principally to
     enhance the comfort or convenience of the member(s) is not permitted.”
     1.3. The 439th LRS Vehicle Management Flight is committed to assisting all Westover ARB
     vehicle users and organizational VCO/VCNCO’s to realize the greatest flexibility and
     efficiency possible from their assigned vehicles while operating within the statutory
     provisions set forth regarding authorized “official use” operation of those assets.
     1.4. You are encouraged to contact the Vehicle Operations Dispatch Office at 557-3855, or
     the Base Transportation Manager at 557-3805 should you have further questions or concerns
     regarding “Official Use” criteria and determinations.
2. Dispatching. Vehicles are not dispatched for trips beyond the established permitted
operating distance of 75 miles without the approval of the Transportation Accountable Officer
(TAO).
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. The using organization and operator ensure that each vehicle is clean before it is
     returned to the dispatch line.
     3.2. Persons to whom vehicles are dispatched are responsible for the safeguarding and
     proper utilization of the vehicle until it is officially released.
4. Motor Vehicle Idle Policy.
     4.1. The Air Force has established this policy requirement in Air Force Instruction 24-302,
     Vehicle Management. This provision applies to all military and civilian personnel who
     operate government vehicles, including those rented or leased with government funds, and
     provides for potential disciplinary actions against those who violate this standard. Vehicles
     on Westover ARB shall comply with Massachusetts state regulations as outlined in 310 CMR
     7.11. Motor Vehicles will not idle more than 5 minutes within a 60 minute period unless
     exempt as described below:
        4.1.1. The motor vehicle idles to operate defrosters, heaters, air conditioners, or other
        equipment solely to prevent a safety or health emergency.
        4.1.2. A police, fire ambulance, public safety, other emergency or law enforcement
        motor vehicles, or any motor vehicle used in an emergency capacity, idles while an
        emergency or training mode and not for the convenience of the vehicle operator.
        4.1.3. When idling of motor vehicle is required to operate auxiliary equipment to
        accomplish the intended use of the vehicle (loading/unloading, construction operations)
        provided this exemption does not apply solely for comfort of operator.
439AWI24-301 7 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    3


      4.1.4. A bus idles a max of 15 minute in any 60 minute period to maintain passenger
      comfort while non-driver passengers are on board.
      4.1.5. The motor vehicle is used for airport ground support, including, but not limited to,
      motor vehicles operated to service or supply aircraft.
      4.1.6. The primary propulsion engine idles for maintenance, servicing, repairing, or
      diagnostic purposes if idling is necessary for such purpose.
5. Documentation.
