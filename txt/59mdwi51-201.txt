This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 51-2, Administration of Military Justice.
This instruction prescribes the professional policies, procedures, and practices for all 59th
Medical Wing (MDW) personnel involved in performing blood alcohol tests (BATs), urinalysis,
or collecting other biological specimens that may be used for judicial or non-judicial
proceedings. This instruction discusses samples taken incident to medical care as well as those
taken for non-medical purposes. Non-medical purposes include those taken for judicial or
administrative actions involving military and non-military personnel. Failure to comply with the
provisions of this instruction may render a biological specimen inadmissible as evidence in
judicial or administrative proceedings; however, this instruction is for internal guidance only and
does not create any substantive rights. This instruction applies to all personnel assigned,
attached, or under contract to the 59 MDW. This instruction does not apply to the Air National
Guard or Air Force Reserve. This publication requires the collection and/or maintenance of
information protected by the Privacy Act of l974. The Privacy Act Statement required by Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program, is in the Receipt for Military
Identification Card Form. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and
Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 6025.18, Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health
Information in DoD Health Care Programs, applies. Refer recommended changes and questions

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changed nonconsensual procedures and updated facility name. A margin bar (|) indicates newly
revised material.
1. Overview. The results of testing of biological specimens, as well as the specimens
themselves, may be evidence in military and civilian judicial or administrative proceedings. 59
MDW personnel must cooperate in collecting, preserving, and presenting such evidence. The
term "biological specimen" as used in this instruction means specimens collected from human
donors.
2. Collecting Specimens Incident to Medical Care That May Also Be Used in Judicial or
Non-judicial Proceedings.
     2.1. Nothing in this instruction precludes the timely collecting and analyzing specimens
     taken incident to medical care of a patient. Whether such specimens may later be used as
     evidence is not a question for health care providers. Properly treating patients is the health
     care provider’s primary concern. If collecting and analyzing a specimen for the purpose of
     medical care, no prior coordination with the 802nd Mission Support Group Legal Office (802
     MSG/JA) or a military member's commander is required.
     2.2. During treatment or evaluation of a patient for medical purposes, a physician or other
     health care provider may suspect the illegal use of alcohol or drugs by a patient. If this
     occurs, the physician or other health care provider must:
        2.2.1. Military Patients. Contact the patient's commander immediately. The military
        patient's commander will seek guidance from 802 MSG/JA to determine if a biological
        sample is needed. If the commander notifies the physician that collection of a biological
        specimen is necessary, 59 MDW personnel will comply with the procedures set out in
        paragraphs four (4) and five (5) below, including chain-of-custody procedures.
        2.2.2. Non-Military Patients. Contact 802d Security Forces Squadron Base Defense
        Operations Center (802 SFS/BDOC) immediately at extension 671-2018.
     2.3. Recording Observations. In all cases involving suspected drug or alcohol abuse, record
     and document the facts as outlined in paragraph five (5) of this instruction.
3. Collecting Specimens Solely for Administrative or Judicial Proceedings.
     3.1. This section summarizes the principles that govern the handling of biological specimens
     for later use in legal proceedings. Refer to AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management, Chapter
     17 for a more complete description.
     3.2. Blood Alcohol Tests (BATs). A Military Magistrate has the authority to order a
     probable cause search and seizure of the blood and urine of any person located on the
     installation. A commander has the authority to direct a search of the blood and urine of any
59THMDWI51-201 15 June 2011                                                                    3


  member of his or her command. Refer any questions to 802 MSG/JA during duty hours or to
  the on-call 802 MSG judge advocate through the 802 SFS/BDOC.
  3.3. Drug Abuse Testing Program. Biological specimens (individual or unit sweep) may be
  taken in connection with the drug testing program (See AFI 44-120, Military Drug Demand
  Reduction Program). Urinalysis testing for illegal drug use is coordinated and conducted by
  the Drug Demand Reduction Program.
  3.4. Nonconsensual Taking of Biological Specimens:
     3.4.1. Nonconsensual Taking of a BAT. If an individual disobeys a commander's or
     Military Magistrate’s order to allow medical personnel to draw blood for a BAT, the
     blood may be obtained via involuntary extraction (see AFI 44-102, Medical Care
     Management, paragraph 16.3.2.3.3). In these cases, 802 MSG/JA must be contacted
     immediately. A person with appropriate medical qualifications, such as a physician,
     nurse, or medical technician, must perform any involuntary extraction of blood in a
     reasonable manner.
     3.4.2. Nonconsensual Taking of Other Biological Specimens. Biological specimens that
     do not involve an intrusion into the body, such as hair samples, scrapings from under
     fingernails, scraping of dried fluid such as blood or semen from the skin surface, etc.,
     may be taken without the member's consent when a Military Magistrate gives search
     authorization (verbal or in writing) or when directed by the member’s commander. Any
     questions concerning such searches should be referred to 802 MSG/JA. (See AFI 44-102,
     paragraphs 16.3.2.3.4 and 5.)
  3.5. Declining to Take Specimen When the Health of Subject or Medical Personnel is
  Endangered. 59 MDW personnel may decline to take a biological specimen if the taking
  would endanger the health of the subject or present a significant risk to the patient or health
  care provider. If this is believed to be the case, the matter should be referred to the senior
  medical officer present for determination. The senior medical officer present must seek legal
  guidance from 802 MSG/JA before declining to comply with a search order, warrant, or
  authorization. Subject to this limitation, medical personnel must comply with a Military
  Magistrate’s search authorization or a commander’s directive to take biological specimens.
  3.6. Biological Specimens Requested by Civilian Law Enforcement Authorities. Military
  personnel are prohibited by statute from assisting local authorities in civil law enforcement.
  Title 18 United States Code, Section 1385, Orders to Preserve Confidentiality. Biological
  specimens must not be taken or examined solely at the request of and for the use of civilian
  law enforcement authorities. Unless the providing physician determines taking a biological
  specimen would endanger the subject's health as described in paragraph 3.5 above, 59 MDW
  personnel will permit, but will not assist, non-Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center
  (WHASC) personnel to take a biological specimen when acting at the request of a civilian
  peace officer (law enforcement) or at the direction of a civilian judge in accordance with
  Texas law. Consult 802 MSG/JA before the non-WHASC personnel obtain the specimen.
  Under Texas law, the taking of a blood specimen at the request of a peace officer may only
  be accomplished by a physician, qualified technician, chemist, registered professional nurse,
  or licensed vocational nurse.
 4                                                               59THMDWI51-201 15 June 2011


     3.7. No Drug or Alcohol Tests Done Solely at the Patient's Request. No drug or alcohol
     specimen collections will be performed solely at the request of a patient, or in the case of a
     minor, the patient’s parent or guardian.
4. Chain-of-Custody. All biological specimens that are to be used for nonmedical purposes
require a chain-of custody form in order to identify all persons who have had access and control
of the specimen. Each person receiving the specimen will print and sign their name and will
ensure that the next person receiving the specimen also signs. The DD Form 2624, Specimen
Custody Document – Drug Testing, will be used for all BATs requested for judicial or
administrative action (legal BAT requests), and for Drug Abuse Testing Program samples. Refer
to AFI 44-120, Section C, for specific procedures for completing chain-of-custody documents.
5. Recording Observations.
     5.1. Medical personnel called upon to examine or treat persons, regardless of whether it is in
     connection with gathering evidence for legal purposes or for medical purposes, should record
     their observations as to the following conditions within the medical record:
        5.1.1. Odor of breath.
        5.1.2. Steadiness of gait and muscular coordination.
        5.1.3. Coherence of speech.
        5.1.4. Clarity of speech.
        5.1.5. Appearance of pupils and eyes.
        5.1.6. Appearance of the face.
        5.1.7. Orientation.
        5.1.8. Evidence and description of trauma, if present.
        5.1.9. Any other significant physical or mental presentation.
6. Releasing Results of Biological Tests. All requests for laboratory results or patient medical
records will be processed through the Release of Healthcare Information Office (59
MDSS/SGSBTH). Sample request letters are Attachments 2 and 3.
