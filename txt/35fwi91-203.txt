1. BASH PROGRAM INFORMATION PURPOSE & OPR CONTACT:                                This plan
establishes procedures to minimize bird/wildlife strike hazards (BASH) to Misawa AB aircraft.
The BASH program relies on a variety of techniques and numerous base organizations to
control/reduce these hazards. The 35 FW Flight Safety office (35 FW/SEF) is the office of
primary response for all BASH issues and can be reached at DSN 315-226-2710, comm. 0716-
77-2710, fax 315-226-2701 or 35FW.SEF@misawa.af.mil.
     1.1. WAIVER AUTHORITY: This instruction is derived from multiple sources. A
     thorough review of these references must be accomplished before seeking a waiver. As long
     as other directives do not exist, 35 FW/SE is the waiver authority for this instruction.
1.2. 2 SITUATION: A bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard continuously exists at Misawa AB
and in its vicinity. The hazard severity varies greatly due to seasonal changes and characteristics
of resident and migratory bird species and other wildlife. Misawa AB is located directly in the
path of most migratory bird routes running north and south along the Japanese islands. Misawa
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                       3


AB also has two large bodies of brackish/fresh water to its west and northwest which attract
migratory waterfowl. The Pacific coastline is only two miles to the east of Misawa AB,
furthering the influx of coastal birds. Additionally, small animals such as foxes are prevalent on
and around the airfield. The damage potential to an aircraft from these hazards range from minor
to the possible loss of an aircraft/aircrew.
       1.2.1. BASH PHASE PERIODS: The majority of the year at Misawa is designated as a
       BASH Phase I period. Bird activity peaks during the Spring (Apr-May) and Fall (Oct-
       Nov) and are designated as BASH Phase II periods. During BASH Phase II all Misawa
       AB personnel associated with flight operations should be extra vigilant for bird/wildlife
       activity and immediately report these observations to Airfield Management operations
       (AM ops). Additionally, the 35 FW Supervisor of Flight (SOF) and AM Ops are strongly
       encouraged to increase the Bird Watch Condition (BWC) during expected/observed
       hazardous conditions. Low levels and night flying are recommended to be avoided or
       kept to a minimum during BASH Phase II.
       1.2.2. PRIMARY MIGRATORY ROUTES: Three primary migratory routes are located
       near Misawa: the Sakhalin route from Siberia, the Kurils route through the Japanese
       mainland, and the Sea of Japan route west of Misawa. (Illustration: see Attachment 3g,
       Bird Migration Routes in Japan)
       1.2.3. LOCAL LAKES: Lake Ogawara and Lake Anenuma are located within 1NM of
       the base to the west and northwest. They attract approximately 100,000 migratory birds
       each spring and fall.
       1.2.4. DRAUGHON RANGE: The base’s primary bombing range is located 10NM to
       the north of Misawa AB. During migratory periods Whopper Swans often rest and linger
       on Draughon Range for several days prior to departing for Swan Lake Sanctuaries 15
       miles to the southeast of the base.
       1.2.5. BIRD SANCTUARIES: Misawa AB is flanked on the north and on the south by
       the Shimokita Peninsula Sanctuary (15NM to the north) and the Shimoda/Swan Lakes
       Sanctuaries (5.2NM to the southeast). (Illustration: see Attachment 3a, Bird Sanctuaries
       in Japan)
1.3. MOST COMMON WILDLIFE HAZARDS: (See Attachment 3 for a complete wildlife
list)
       1.3.1. RAPTORS/HAWKS: During the summer months raptors and hawks are very
       active on and over the airfield. Typically they like to soar/hunt over the airfield at several
       hundred feet altitude. Occasionally they will hover 10-23 feet above the runway. They
       are not significantly numerous, but due to their size they pose a significant threat to
       aircraft as they arrive and depart the airfield.
       1.3.2. CROWS: Large flocks of crows appear on the airfield all year round. The flocks
       are most numerous during the July to October time frame. The crows move across the
       airfield from roosting sites to a local off base garbage dump on a daily cyclic pattern.
       Both their size and number pose a significant threat to aircrews flying into or out of
       Misawa AB.

       1.3.3. HERONS: Night Herons and Grey Herons are a constant concern around the
       Misawa airfield. Specifically, a colony of 450+ Night Herons reside year round just
       north of tower #231, adjacent to Takinosawa Retention Pond. These Herons are
       nocturnal and transit the airfield at night, making visual avoidance of these large birds
       virtually impossible. Grey Herons are also year round residents and are the largest
       member of the Heron family in Japan. They are solitary, only active during daylight
       hours, and occasionally fly over the airfield as they forage for food. Although the
       number of Herons around the airfield is relatively small, if struck by an aircraft, the sheer
       size of these birds could easily cause severe damage.
       1.3.4. SWANS and DUCKS: Although mainly a concern during the migratory seasons,
       Spotted-billed Ducks and Swans do reside around Misawa AB year round. Ducks and
       swans are most active in the mornings and in the evenings. Small flocks of ducks are
       occasionally sighted flying over the airfield during non-migratory periods. During
       migration the flocks become much more prevalent. Additionally, during the migration
       season, swans frequently transit Draughon Range presenting a severe bird strike hazard to
       aircraft using the range at low altitude.
    1.4. KNOWN ROOSTING/PERCHING AREAS:
       1.4.1. HARDENED AIRCRAFT SHELTER AREAS: The Hardened Aircraft Shelter
       (HAS) areas for both the JASDF (Japanese Area Self Defense Force) and the USAF
       located on the north side of the runway contains a plethora of grounding wires, antennas,
       and builds. These areas are a constant roosting/perching site for crows and hawks.
       1.4.2. AIRFIELD RETENTION PONDS: Retention ponds are located southwest of the
       approach end of Runway 10 and north of the JASDF HAS area along Falcon Drive on the
       northeast side of the base. These ponds are constant roosting sites for ducks and other
       water fowl.
       1.4.3. TIMBERED ACERAGE: The timbered acreage directly east of the runway and
       surrounding the approach clear zone for Runway 28 just outside the perimeter fence
       cannot be trimmed back due to international relations. These tall and dense trees are
       commonly used as perching/roosting sites for hawks that hunt over the airfield during the
       day.
    1.5. PRIMARY MEANS OF CONTROL: The primary means of bird/wildlife control is
    habitat control. Habitat control consists of effective grass management, tree stump removal,
    landscaping, garbage control and drainage control. When habitat control measures fail to
    control bird hazards, secondary procedures such as harassment, dispersal and depredation
    will be employed. Airfield Management and the BASH Abatement Team will use horns,
    BASH cannons, screamers/bangers or other bird abatement procedures as needed to reduce
    threats. Lethal measures should also be used to reinforce passive deterrents. All control
    measures require action from base-wide organizations as described in Chapter 3 of this plan
    (See AFPAM 91-212 for additional control measures).
2. BIRD HAZARD WORKING GROUP
    2.1. PURPOSE: The Bird Hazard Work Group (BHWG) coordinates activities between base
    and tenant units to implement the 35 FW BASH Program. Key functions of the BHWG are
    bird/wildlife strike data collection and sharing, identification of hazards, and the coordination
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                      5


    of unit actions. The BHWG also serves as a point of contact and coordination with JASDF
    units, host nation agencies, and other off-base entities.

        3.7.1.3. ATIS: If the BWC is moderate or severe ensure changes to and the current
        BWC is updated on ATIS.
     3.7.2. RUNWAY ACCESS: Coordinate with Ground Control to provide BASH
     Abatement Team priority access to the runway and ramp areas during BWC Severe.
     Ensure controllers know their responsibilities and time standards for clearing the use of
     the BASH Cannons and other bird scare/abatement procedures (see Chapter 5 para: 5.2.
     and 5.3).
     3.7.3. MOUI 3005: Coordinate this instruction with JASDF Standards and the JASDF
     ATC squadron via the Memorandum of Understanding International 3005 (MOUI
     FB5235-92-3005) to the maximum extent possible.
     3.7.4. ISSUES: Report problems and issues to the BHWG and 35 FW/SEF.
  3.8. MAINTENANCE GROUP (35 MXG):
     3.8.1. REPORTING: Ensure personnel report hazardous bird activity to the Airfield
     Management, 35 FW SOF, or 35 FW/SEF. Squadron maintenance personnel can provide
     valuable bird activity information.
     3.8.2. DISCOVERED BIRD STRIKES:                   Ensure personnel immediately report
     discovered bird strikes found on aircraft to the 13 FS and 14 FS Operations Desk, 35
     FW/SEF, and Quality Assurance. Do not clean surfaces before adequate samples of the
     remains and photographs of impact areas are taken. Even the smallest fragment of
     feathers and/or blood smears can be used to assist the USAF bird identification and
     tracking efforts. Once the aircraft is released for clean up; proceed cleaning IAW T.O. 1-
     1-691 and para 4.7.1.5 of this instruction as required.
     3.8.3. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM AUGMENTATION: Provide personnel (E5 or
     above) as needed to augment the BASH Abatement Team. These personnel will
     complete all required training as directed in Chapter 4 of this instruction.
  3.9. CIVIL ENGINEER SQUADRON (35 CES):
     3.9.1. SERVICES & RESOURCES: Provide resources and advice to the BHWG for
     environmental modification.       Request funds for annual surveys and prepare
     environmental impact assessments as necessary. Develop procedures and provide
     services to make the airfield unattractive to birds and wildlife. Correct environmental
     conditions that increase BASH potential.
     3.9.2. INRMP:    Incorporate the following practices into the Integrated Natural
     Resources Management Plan (INRMP).
        3.9.2.1. AIRFIELD MOWING: Maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and 14
        inches. Cut grass before it goes to seed to discourage seed eating birds from feeding
        at the airfield. Do not permit grass to exceed 14 inches, as high grass will attract
        some bird species and rodents, which are a food source for other types of birds.
        Begin mowing parallel and adjacent to the runway. Work away from the runway,
        driving the insects and rodents away from the active runway. USAF is responsible
        for grass cutting west of Taxiway Bravo 3, JASDF cuts east of Taxiway Bravo 3 IAW
        MOUI FB5235-92-3005.
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                11


        3.9.2.2. AIRFIELD SEEDING: Coordinate with airfield management to sod or
        hydro-seed bare areas as determined by the BHWG. Birds frequently use bare areas
        as resting sites.
     3.9.3. LEVELING OF AIRFIELD: Coordinate airfield ponding reduction through the
     Host Nation and Parallel Runway Project and QKKA 04-1511 In-House Drainage
     Project.
     3.9.4. EDGE EFFECT POLICY: Ensure the airfield meets edge effect policies (grass to
     trees), eliminating roosting sites through vegetation management, stump removal, and
     tree pruning.
     3.9.5. BIRD PROOFING: Bird proof buildings, hangars, and permanent fixtures (like
     TACAN and ILS antennas) on or around the airfield, as determined by the BHWG. Use
     netting, trapping, bird spikes, fishing line, or any other appropriate means. Ensure
     techniques do not interfere with fire suppression equipment, operational requirements, or
     cause a larger problem other than the identified bird/wildlife hazard.
     3.9.6. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM AUGMENTATION: Provide personnel (E5 or
     above) as needed to augment the BASH Abatement Team. These personnel will
     complete all required training as directed in Chapter 4 of this instruction.
     3.9.7. SURVEYS: Coordinate for airfield surveys of bird/wildlife problem areas through
     the BHWG.
     3.9.8. AIRFIELD MOWING MAP: Maintain and update the airfield mowing map in the
     MOUI FB5235-92-3005. This map is the official BASH plan mowing map and is found
     in Attachment 10 of this instruction.
     3.9.9. TREE CUTTING: Coordinate a Tree Cutting Plan with GOJ to reduce/eliminate
     bird/wildlife hazards in the airfield clear zones.
  3.10. SECURITY FORCES SQUADRON (35 SFS): Provide M870 shotgun training, gun
  maintenance, and advice to BASH Abatement Team through 35 FW/SEF.
  3.11. NAVAL AIR FACILITY, MISAWA (NAFM):
     3.11.1. BASH SUPPORT: Provide a representative to the BHWG. Support the Misawa
     AB BASH program and comply with all local BASH procedures except where command
     or service guidance requires a different reporting process or more restrictive procedures.
     3.11.2. BASH REPORTS: Reports provide 35 FW/SEF (DSN FAX 226-2701, Voice
     226-2710) information on bird strikes that occur on any assigned, transient, or deployed
     aircraft. A telephonic brief to 35 FW/SEF will be sufficient for data collection. The AF
     Form 853 (Attachment 6a, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report) may be used for these
     reports but will not be forwarded off-base for non-USAF aircraft. Report potential
     hazards within the tenant unit’s area to Airfield Management, (Voice 226-3110) or 35
     FW/SEF.
     3.11.3. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM AUGMENTATION: Provide personnel (E5 or
     above) as needed to augment the BASH Abatement Team. These personnel will
     complete all required training as directed in Chapter 4 of this instruction.

4. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM PROCEDURES
  4.1. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM ORGANIZATION: The OPR for the BASH Abatement
  Team is 35 FW/SEF. The wing FSNCO is the primary team lead unless the 35 FW/SEF
  designates and trains another qualified individual. The wing FSO is the acting team lead in
  the absence of the FSNCO or qualified designee. There is no limit as to the number of
  members that can be on BASH Abatement Team. The BASH Abatement Team lead will
  adjust the number of members as required to optimize the BASH Abatement Team
  effectiveness.
  4.2. MEMBER ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: Members must be an E-5 or above and
  be familiar with shotgun shooting and safety. The BASH Abatement Team lead may make
  exceptions to these requirements on a case-by-case basis.
  4.3. APPOINTMENT:           Commanders from base organizations will identify BASH
  Abatement Team members by appointment letter (see Attachment 7). Appointees will
  forward their letter to 35 FW/SEF for approval, and addition to the BASH recall roster.
  4.4. TRAINING REQUIREMENTS: Individual team members must complete and be
  current in the following training prior to being allowed access to the shotguns and
  ammunition for bird/wildlife scare and abatement. All training requirements must be re-
  accomplished annually, or as otherwise directed.
     4.4.1. BASH PROGRAM TRAINING: Conducted by the 35 FW/SEF. Training
     includes BASH program familiarization and threatened/endangered avian recognition.
     4.4.2. M870 SHOTGUN TRAINING: Provided by 35 SFS (Contact CATM at 226-9696
     4.4.3. FLIGHTLINE DRIVERS LICENSE: Conducted by Unit Airfield Driving
     Program Manager. (Note: If a team member does not have his/her flight line driver’s
     license, they must be accompanied by a person who has a flight line driver’s license. The
     person with the license will maintain control of the vehicle and radios at all times.)
  4.5. RECALL ROSTER: 35 FW/SEF will maintain a BASH Abatement Team roster that
  includes name, rank, training complete/due dates, DEROS, duty phone, and organization for
  each member. 35 FW/SEF will ensure a current copy of the recall roster is forwarded to
  Airfield Management. The roster is the official document that clears a team member to
  access the guns, ammo, and the performance of depredation duties. All information on the
  roster must be current and correct (i.e. updated annual currency requirements).
  4.6. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM RECALL: Airfield Management or 35 FW/SEF may
  recall members of the BASH Abatement Team to fulfill scare/depredation duties as needed to
  continually condition wildlife to recognize the airfield as an unattractive habitat and to
  eliminate specific bird/wildlife hazards.
     4.6.1. PRE-RECALL: During the 35 FW flying period, the 35 FW SOF will initiate
     BASH responses IAW (para: 3.4-3.5) by notifying Airfield Management and tower
     personnel. Airfield Management will notify JASDF Base Operations, 35 FW/SEF, and
     Security Forces of intended actions. Airfield Management will then provide the initial
     response to the bird/wildlife hazard and activity, and will utilize all available scare tactics
     - non-lethal and lethal (i.e. human presence, noise makers, BASH Cannons, shotguns).
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 13


     4.6.2. RECALL: When initial bird/wildlife dispersion response efforts are ineffective or
     inadequate, Airfield Management will recommend an increase in the BWC and will
     coordinate with 35 FW/SEF to notify/recall BASH Abatement Team members until
     enough personnel are identified to handle the bird/wildlife situation. If 35 FW/SEF is
     unavailable, Airfield Management will recall BASH Abatement Team members on the
     recall roster as required. BASH Abatement Team members should report to Airfield
     Management in Uniform of the Day (UOD) as quickly and safely as possible (less than
     45 minutes from activation if possible).
     4.6.3. PROACTIVE RECALL: The BASH Abatement Team can be recalled to
     preemptively scare and depredate birds/wildlife to continually condition wildlife to
     recognize the airfield as an unattractive habitat. This technique is most effective during
     morning or evening hours during migration (Phase II) periods of the year. The 35 FW
     SOF, Airfield Management, or 35 FW/SEF can request this recall and the decision will be
     made regardless of the flying operations to continually condition wildlife to recognize the
     airfield as an unattractive habitat and to eliminate specific bird/wildlife hazards.
  4.7. BASH ABATEMENT TEAM FIELD PROCEDURES:
     4.7.1. SHOTGUN PROCEDURES:
         4.7.1.1. APPROVAL TO SHOOT: Misawa ATC (Ground Control) must give
         approval prior to firing shotguns on the airfield within the Controlled Movement Area
         (CMA). Do not use the phrase “bird depredation” when requesting approval to shoot;
         proper phraseology is, “Request Bird Scare for the next X minutes.” Use the term
         “Grassy Area” for infield areas.
         4.7.1.2. OPERATE IN PAIRS: BASH team members will operate in pairs, one
         shooter and one safety observer/radio monitor to the maximum extent possible. Both
         members will wear orange safety vests and hearing protection.
         4.7.1.3. BASE PERIMETER: If near base perimeter fencing, only fire in a direction
         resulting in ammunition impacting within the base perimeter.
         4.7.1.4. PREFERRED METHOD OF FIRE: The preferred method for shooting birds
         is to fire when birds are on the ground. However if an “air” shot is required, the line
         of fire must be parallel to the runway and taxiways.
         4.7.1.5. BIRD REMAINS: Bird carcasses will be collected, counted, and identified.
         Remains will be disposed of IAW the base disposal agreement with pest control.
         Personnel are required to wear rubber gloves, N95 masks when handling bird
         remains. Double bag (plastic bag) the remains and drop off at the entomology. Put
         used gloves and mask in bag with remains after remains are sealed inside first plastic
         bag. Immediately wash your hands thoroughly before touching face.
         4.7.1.6. SPENT SHELLS: Retain spent shells and place them back in the
         ammunition can at Airfield Management for munitions accountability.
         4.7.1.7. AMMUNITION & GUN LOG: Fill out the ammunition log, gun log and
         BASH activity log located near the ammo and guns at Airfield Management.
  4.8. IRRE/CERE/ORI OPERATION: The BASH Abatement Team will not respond to
  exercise inputs or wear chemical protective masks or bulky chemical clothing while actively
14                                                       35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011


  dispersing bird/wildlife hazards. Once the bird hazard is eliminated the team members will
  recover to exercise play.
  4.9. BIRD ABATEMENT TEAM LEGAL REVIEW: The Bird Abatement Team Legal
  Review under SOFA will be updated through 35 FW/JA once every 5 years. Last update
  accomplished: 05 Jan 2007. Next update due: 05 Jan 2012. (See Attachment 9)
5. BASH CANNON SYSTEM PROCEDURES
  5.1. DESCRIPTION: The BASH cannons are a commercial bird deterrent product owned
  by 35 OG and operated by the SOF, 35FW/SEF, and Airfield Management via either 2 hand
  held controllers or the computer station at Base Ops. Misawa AB has a three year contract
  (ending in April 2011) with Reed-Joseph (the manufacturing company of the system). Reed-
  Joseph has a contract with Christopher Barnett (ph# 226-4406) for maintaining the system.
  Mr. Barnett is responsible for servicing, inspecting and lubricating the cannons every three
  months (paid for through Reed-Joseph contract). The system at Misawa consists of 20 units,
  each containing a propane-powered cannon and loud speaker (bird distress calls). The
  cannons are operated remotely and are hard wired on the 140.675 MHz frequency. This
  frequency has been approved and is in the 5 AF Spectrum Management Database. The
  frequency overlaps with the Misawa AB Services frequency; but, Services only uses this
  frequency during exercises for PAR sweeps and Mortuary affairs. Historically this overlap
  has caused no interference issues.
  5.2. ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
     5.2.1. CLEARANCE TO ACTIVATE: Authorized users will request bird cannon
     activation from Misawa Ground Control before use. During periods of limited or no
     flying, users may request clearance for a specific time or for a specific length of time.
     During busy flying periods, expect some delays before clearance from Ground Control.
     Request help from the 35 FW SOF to coordinate timing and reduce this delay.
     5.2.2. ACTIVATION: Activate within 1 minute of the clearance or do not activate
     without receiving a new clearance.
  5.3. GROUND CONTROL AUTHORIZATION: Ground Control will authorize system
  activation under the following conditions:
     5.3.1. NO DEPARTURE AIRCRAFT: No departing aircraft are likely to be cleared for
     takeoff in the next 2 minutes.
     5.3.2. NO APPROACH AIRCRAFT: No approaching aircraft are within 2 minutes of
     landing or low approach.
  5.4. POST ACTIVATION: Airfield Management will ensure that the BASH cannon
  activation is logged in AF IMT 3616 as required.
  5.5. EFFECTIVENESS GUIDELINES: BASH cannons are very effective and can be used
  to scare birds and wildlife away from the airfield. They can greatly reduce the threat of bird
  strikes and wildlife hazards to aircraft if used correctly.
     5.5.1. BASH CANNON HAZARDS TO AIRCRAFT: Since BASH cannons scare birds
     into the air, there is a small chance that activation of the system may momentarily
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                 15


     increase the bird hazard. This risk is small and easily manageable. The procedures
     outlined in paragraph 5.3.1 & 5.3.2 of this instruction mitigates this risk.
     5.5.2. PROACTIVE USE: Use the BASH cannons at random times, especially near
     sunrise and sunset, even if flying activity is not immediately planned. Fire several or all
     cannons at once and observe bird response. If birds immediately land back in the same
     area, repeat the firing sequence and initiate other scare tactics.
     5.5.3. LOCATION: Location of each cannon will be documented by Airfield
     Management. Movement of cannons will be coordinated through 35 FW/SEF as needed
     for effective deterrence of birds in the various airfield areas.
  5.6. GROUND SAFETY PROCEDURES:
     5.6.1. EAR PROTECTION: Both the cannon and speakers create sounds over 130 dB.
     Personnel should wear ear protection at all times when working within 100 yards of a
     BASH cannon unless the cannon have been deactivated according to the user manual.
     5.6.2. DANGER ZONE: No smoking or open flame is allowed within 50 feet of a
     BASH cannon unit. No personnel are allowed within 50 feet of a BASH cannon unit
     unless performing maintenance.
     5.6.3. MAINTENANCE: No maintenance will be conducted on cannons that are
     operational or powered in any way. The BASH cannon unit will be deactivated
     according to the user manual before any repair or propane servicing work is
     accomplished. (Contact 35 FW/SEF, for a copy of the user’s manual)
     5.6.4. PROXIMITY TO COMBUSTIBLES: Do not place or use cannons in or around
     combustible materials (e.g. tall dry grass).
     5.6.5. BARREL: Never place material in the cannon barrel or megaphone.
     5.6.6. INDOORS: Never activate cannons inside a building.
     5.6.7. SET-UP & STORAGE:           Cannons will always be maintained in the vertical
     position, even during storage.
     5.6.8. DAMAGED: Damaged or overturned cannons will be de-activated and inspected.
     Any damaged components will be replaced or repaired before the unit is returned to use.
     Damage to the propane components poses a fire hazard. Replace propane components
     that show damage or excessive wear.
6. BIRD WATCH CONDITIONS (BWC)
  6.1. DEFINITIONS: The BWC authority will use the Bird Watch Conditions defined in the
  Flight Information Handbook Section B Paragraph 4 for all wildlife activity affecting flying
  operations at Misawa AB. Department of Defense Bird Watch Conditions are limited to the
  airfield only. Since NEXRAD and other bird reporting and prediction methods are not
  available at Misawa, the 35 FW cannot declare BWC for the local VFR flying area (within
  230 NM of Misawa). (See Attachment 5 for a summary of these definitions.)
  6.2. BWC SEVERE: Bird/wildlife activity on or immediately above the active runway or
  other specific locations representing high potential for strikes. Supervisors and aircrews
16                                                       35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011


  must thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting operations in areas under BWC
  Severe.
     6.2.1. SEVERE GUIDELINES: Bird activity is such that further safe operation of
     aircraft is unlikely. Examples: One or more birds or animals posing an immediate threat
     to safe operation; more than 15 large birds and/or more than 30 small birds on or above
     the runway or target area at Draughon Range. Large flock activity detected by radar,
     pilots, or ground personnel on more than one key area of the VFR pattern,
     approach/departure corridors, or Draughon Range pop pattern. Consider BWC Severe
     immediately after a major bird strike (aircraft emergency due to significant bird strike
     damage) until the situation can be assessed.
  6.3. BWC MODERATE: Bird activity in locations representing increased potential for
  strikes. Increased vigilance by all agencies, supervisors, and pilots is required.
     6.3.1. MODERATE GUIDELINES: Bird activity is such that there is an increased
     potential for strikes, but further safe operation of aircraft is manageable through increased
     vigilance by all agencies and supervisors (i.e. pilot, 35 FW SOF, and ATC report of
     location and number of birds/wildlife). Some examples of increased potential: Five or
     more large birds circling near the runway or near the target area at Draughon Range,
     flock activity within 10 NM of the aerodrome, or more than one pilot/tower report of
     birds in the approach/departure corridors or in the Draughon Range pop pattern.
     Additionally consider BWC Moderate in the hours of dawn and dusk (especially after a
     rain storm) during BASH Phase II (April-May and October-November) Based on
     historical data, BASH Phase II may dictate BWC Moderate without any immediately
     visible bird activity.
  6.4. BWC LOW: Bird activity on and around the airfield is such that there is low potential
  for strikes.
     6.4.1. LOW GUIDELINES: Normal bird or wildlife activity with only occasional and
     isolated reports.
7. FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS
  7.1. APPLICABILITY: The following restrictions apply to 35 FW aircraft. Transient U.S.
  aircraft and U.S. tenant unit aircraft will comply with these procedures to the maximum
  extent possible where these procedures do not conflict with that aircraft’s technical orders or
  command guidance. JASDF and Naval Air Facility Misawa units are encouraged to comply
  with these restrictions to maximum extent possible. (See Attachment 5 for a summary of
  these restrictions.)
  7.2. BWC LOW RESTRICTIONS: No restrictions.
  7.3. BWC MODERATE RESTRICTIONS:
     7.3.1. TAKEOFF: No formation takeoffs. All takeoffs will be in afterburner if so
     equipped. Aircraft will expedite climb above 500’ AGL. Takeoff only when departure
     route avoids identified activity.
     7.3.2. PATTERN OPERATIONS: Formations will space themselves no closer than
     route position. Aircraft limited to full stop landing or restricted low approaches at or
     above 500’ AGL.
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   17


     7.3.3. LANDING: No formation landings. Aircraft limited to full stop landing or
     restricted low approaches at or above 500' AGL. Land only when arrival route avoids the
     identified bird activity.
     7.3.4. DRAUGHON RANGE: Limit flight and attacks to those that recover above 500’
     AGL. This will typically only prohibit low angle strafe.
  7.4. BWC SEVERE RESTRICTIONS:
     7.4.1. TAKEOFF: Prohibited without 35 OG/CC or higher approval.
     7.4.2. PATTERN OPERATIONS: Aircraft will divert or hold (fuel permitting) until bird
     activity subsides.
     7.4.3. LANDING: Prohibited without 35 OG/CC or higher approval (unless required for
     emergency). Non-35 FW aircraft should consider holding until bird activity subsides or
     land at a divert base.
     7.4.4. DRAUGHON RANGE: Low events prohibited. Aircraft will not fly in the pop
     pattern and all attacks will recover above 2300’ AGL.
  7.5. LOCAL FLYING AREA RESTRICTIONS: Misawa is not served by any computer
  bird avoidance models or NEXRAD bird observations. It is currently impossible to make
  useful BWC declarations for the local flying area (within 230 NM of Misawa.) The
  following guidelines and restrictions are derived from AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft
  Strike Hazard Management Techniques.
     7.5.1. LOW LEVELS: 35 FW pilots will avoid flying low levels one hour before or after
     sunrise and sunset during the months of April, May, October, and November (BASH
     Phase II) to the maximum extent possible. This restriction is based on known increases
     in bird activity around coastal areas and bird sanctuaries during migration seasons.
     7.5.2. CONSIDERATIONS: 35 FW pilots will consider all of northern Japan a coastal
     area. Flying within one hour before or after dawn and dusk should be avoided unless
     absolutely necessary. The highest levels of bird activity normally occur during these
     hours as birds leave and return to their roosts. Avoiding flight operations during these
     periods can significantly reduce the chance of a bird strike.
     7.5.3. RAPTOR CONCENTRATION AREAS: 35 FW pilots will avoid areas of known
     raptor (birds of prey) concentrations based on PIREPs of raptor activity. Pilots will be
     briefed on these PIREPs and avoid the indicated areas for the remainder of that day.
     Raptor activity is most concentrated in the summer, during 1000-1700 hours, due to
     increased thermals. Generally, a maximum altitude of 3,000-4,000’ AGL is reached by
     all raptor species, though soaring can occur at considerably higher altitudes. Likely
     raptor activities include areas such as ridge lines, rolling hills, large plowed fields where
     thermals are likely to form, and areas near water.
     7.5.4. OBSERVED BIRD ACTIVITY: 35 FW pilots should avoid or remain above
     1000’ AGL around observed areas of bird activity and report this activity to 35 FW SOF.
     7.5.5. NIGHT FLYING: 35 FW pilots will minimize night flying missions, unless
     necessary, during the waterfowl migration months of April, May, October, and
18                                                      35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011


     November (BASH Phase II). Migrating birds are most active from sunset through
     midnight, with numbers decreasing in the early morning hours.
8. HOST NATION COORDINATION

LOCAL BIRD SPECIES LIST: Bird species identified during first stage of Naval Air Facility
funded wildlife study at Misawa, November 97. Crows, hawks, and migratory water fowl
comprise the most significant threat the airfield operations.
Common Name (Proper Name)                           Location

Common Kingfisher (Alcedo althis)
Cormorant (Phalacrocorax sp.)
Smew (Mergus albellus)

OTHER WILDLIFE (RABBITS/FOXES): Rabbits are not a significant hazard to aircraft, but they
often attract raptors. Proper grass management is used to reduce the numbers of these animals on the
airfield. Foxes are also present at Misawa. Foxes are normally about the size of a small dog and prey on
mice and rabbits. This has the overall effect of reducing food sources for raptors such as the local Black
Kite. While foxes can present a hazard to aircraft, they are considered beneficial in small numbers.
When deemed necessary, these animals can be trapped and relocated to a safe environment off the
airfield.

                                           LOCAL FLYING AREA RESTRICTIONS

A. Pilots should not fly low-levels within one hour after sunrise or one hour before sunset during the months of April,
May, October, and November (BASH Phase II)

B. Pilots will avoid areas with known raptor concentrations based on PIREPs of raptor activity. (Raptor activity
[typical max altitude 3000’ to 4000’ AGL] greatest: summer, 1000-1700 hrs, Located near thermal areas; ridges,
coast, rolling hills, ex.)

C. 35 FW pilots will remain above 1000’ AGL in areas where they observe increased bird activity. Report this activity
to 35 FW SOF or Airfield Management as soon as practical.

D. 35 FW pilots should avoid flying night missions during the waterfowl migration months of April, May, October, and
November (BASH Phase II).

BASH PREVENTION CHECKLIST (3 of 4):

                                            BASH CANNON PROCEDURES

BASH cannons will be operated by Airfield Management, 35 FW SOF or 35 FW/SEF in accordance with the following
directions.

1. Request “Cannon Activation” from Misawa Ground Control before use.
2. Activate within one minute or do not activate without a new clearance.
3. Ground will clear cannon activation when the following is true:
          - No A/C cleared for takeoff or expected in the next 2 minutes.
          - No landing A/C within the next 2 minutes.
4. Request 35 FW SOF help to coordinate timing during busy air traffic periods.
5. Airfield Management will ensure cannon activation is documented on the Bird / Wildlife Deterrent Summary log.

BASH CANNON RECOMMENDATIONS:

Use the BASH Cannons at random times especially near sunrise and sunset, even if flying activity is not immediately
planned. Fire several or all cannons at once and observe bird response. If birds immediately land back in the same
area, repeat the firing sequence and initiate other scare/depredation tactics.

BIRD DISPERSAL PROCEDURES

Non-Lethal:     Use during normal and increased bird or wildlife activity. This
                is the first course of action to remove wildlife.

                TOOLS:       OPS vehicle horn, lights, siren and distress tape.
                             Pyrotechnics; screamers, banger and cracker
                             shells.
                             BASH Cannon activation
                             Radar indications of large flock activity
Lethal:         Use during severe bird/wildlife activity or as required if initial
                methods are inadequate or non-effective.

                TOOLS:       Shotguns
                             BAT team will respond within 45 minutes.

                       BASH TEAM LEGAL REVIEW UNDER SOFA:

                                                                                           23 Dec 06
MEMORANDUM FOR 35 FW/JA
FROM: 35 FW/SEF
SUBJECT: Bird Abatement Team Legal Review under SOFA
1. There exists a bird aircraft strike hazard here at Misawa AB. Such strikes can cause lose of
USAF funds, assets, and human life. The Bird Abatement Team (BAT) program entails use of
non-lethal and lethal methods to minimize bird activity on the airfield while aircraft are present
in order to reduce/eliminate this hazard. The BAT will use lethal methods (specifically use of
shotguns) to kill one or more birds on the airfield in conjunction with non-lethal methods (such
as BASH cannons and pyrotechnic noisemakers) This strategy prevents birds from becoming
accustomed to the non-lethal methods, strongly enhances their effectiveness, and thereby
significantly reduces the bird strike hazard on the airfield. Over time, this strategy will save lives
and millions of dollars in Air Force property.
2. The 35 Fighter Wing Flight Safety Office respectfully requests a review of the BAT strategy
under SOFA.

Subject: SOFA review of BAT
As for shooting birds, the controlling guidance is the Japanese Environmental Governing
Standards (JEGS) chapter on natural resources management. We should have a
Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan or INRMP. On a SOFA area or facility
(installation) such as Misawa AB, we do not need permission from the Japanese
government to act.

Threatened and endangered birds should not be harmed, if possible. The SOFA gives us
exemption from these Japanese laws, however, the issue is not squarely addressed in the
JEGS; the JEGS merely mentions migratory birds as something for the INRMP. JEGS,
35FWI91-203 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                         49



para 13-3.3. The JEGS lists a number of birds as threatened or endangered. JEGS, table
13-3. I have a copy of the table if you don't have access to it and would like a copy.
If you have any additional questions, please let me know.
