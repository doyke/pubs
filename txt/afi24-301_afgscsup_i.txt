This instruction establishes procedures and standards for managing Vehicle Operations on Air
Force installations. It implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 24-3, Operation and Use
of Transportation Vehicles. It applies to all organizations and personnel that operate and control
Air Force government vehicles (owned, rented or leased). This Directive also sets forth policies
regarding authorized licensing and official use of Air Force government vehicles (owned, rented
or leased) by DoD civilian employees and military personnel, Reserve and National Guard
regardless of service affiliation. Failure to observe prohibitions and mandatory provisions of this
directive in paragraphs 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and Sections 3D through 3M by military personnel is a
violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Violations may result in
administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil
sanctions for violations of related laws. AFI 34-204, Property Management, Para 6.21.1 requires
organizations using non-appropriated funded vehicles to use this directive as a training guide.

                                            Chapter 3

                               OFFICIAL USE OF VEHICLES

Section 3A— General Information

3.1. Official Use of GMVs: The same statute that restricts the use of Military Air (MilAir)
resources for official use (Title 31 U.S.C. Section 1344, Passenger Carrier Use) also restricts the
use of GMVs. Just as MilAir assets are carefully controlled because of their high value,
government vehicles are closely controlled because of their easy accessibility, high visibility, and
potential for misuse. DOD 4500.36-R, Management, Acquisition, and Use of Motor Vehicles
implements federal law (40 U.S.C. § 601-611, Motor Vehicle Pools and Transportation System
s) and prescribes the limited use of GMVs to official governmental purposes. Unauthorized use
of GMVs often results in unnecessary expenditure of funds and public criticism. Transportation
by a DOD motor vehicle shall not be provided when the justification is based solely on reasons
of rank, position, prestige, or personal convenience. Although the major goal of Vehicle
Operations is to provide quality support, commanders, vehicle operators, and the base populace
must know vehicle use restrictions and what constitutes official use. Restrict use of all DOD
motor vehicles, including those rented or leased, for official purposes only; in support of
authorized DoD functions, activities or operations. Providing a government vehicle solely or
principally to enhance the comfort or convenience of member(s) is not permitted.
Determinations regarding any question of authorized support for such activities will be resolved
in favor of strict compliance with rules outlined in this instruction to preclude any negative
public perception. Refer requests which appear to conflict with governing directives to the
Vehicle Operations Supervisor for evaluation; this element is staffed with trained experts capable
of making an official use determination.
   3.1.1. Terminal Transportation: Responsible leadership requires ensuring personnel are
   available and trained to perform duties in direct support of the mission and trained to perform
   their wartime roles. Use of resources to support administrative activities, for which sufficient
   public transportation or commercial services exist to fulfill the need, detracts from direct
   mission support and should be avoided. To that end and as defined elsewhere in this
   publication, other, more cost effective and responsive means of transportation will be utilized
   to support administrative activities. See the table in Attachment 9, GMV Official Use
   Rules of Transportation Terminals, to make these determinations.
       3.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Terminal Transportation rules apply to all registered, rented
       and leased GMVs assigned to AFGSC installations. VCOs utilizing organic assets when
       moving passengers to commercial terminals must coordinate with their local LRS VOCC
       for approval 24 hours prior to departure when possible.
   3.1.2. Tobacco products will not be used in GMVs.
   3.1.3. Alcoholic beverages will not be consumed in GMVs. Operators will not consume
   alcohol 8-hours prior to duty or prior to operating any GMVs. Operators are ultimately
   responsible for exercising good judgment by imposing additional time constraints as needed.
       3.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Open alcohol containers will not be allowed inside a GMV.
       Vehicle operators will notify the on-duty dispatcher when any individual is creating a
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                        27


       safety concern in connection with the operation of the vehicle. The Vehicle Operations
       Control Center will contact security forces or local law enforcement personnel to request
       assistance in removing the disturbance.
   3.1.4. Use of hand-held wireless phones or text messaging equipment is prohibited while
   operating a GMV.

Section 3B— General Responsibilities and Administration

3.2. Penalties for Misuse of DOD Motor Vehicles: Misuse or acts/omissions resulting in
misuse of GMVs (owned, rented, or leased) may result in disciplinary action. All military and
civilian employees need to take appropriate measures to prevent misuse, abuse, or willful
acts/omissions that could cause damage to GMVs. Directing personnel to violate official use
restrictions is an unlawful order and should be reported to command or other appropriate
agencies. Negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of a GMV may result
in the following disciplinary actions:
   3.2.1. Military Personnel: Adverse administrative action or punishment under Article 92,
   Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), without regard to otherwise applicable criminal
   or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
   3.2.2. Civilian Personnel: Suspension from duty by the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF),
   without pay, for not less than 1 month, suspension or removal.
3.3. Vehicle Misuse Investigation: Report all suspected misuses to LRS Vehicle
Operations. Vehicle Operations conducts a technical assessment of the incident to determine if
regulatory official use guidance has been violated.
   3.3.1. Forward all substantiated allegations along with the technical assessment to the LRS
   commander within 7 days of receiving the complaint. Then LRS commander will forward the
   substantiated misuse case to the operator's unit commander within 7 days of receipt. Unit
   commander's have 15-calendar days to respond to the LRS commander's finding or
   acknowledging actions taken to prevent further infractions.
       3.3.1.1. Technical assessments will include, at a minimum; the vehicle’s make, model,
       and vehicle registration number, and the date, time, and location of incident. Finally,
       clearly state the offense and official use references substantiating the misuse.
   3.3.2. Vehicle Operations will maintain a log of reported and substantiated misuse cases.
   The log of substantiated cases with technical assessments and unit responses will be kept on
   file for 6-years (RDS: T24-03R1300).
   3.3.3. Annually, the LRS commander will provide their respective group commander with
   detailed results of pending and completed vehicle misuse investigations with
   recommendations to improve official use of GMVs.
       3.3.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Forward group commander coordinated annual misuse
       summary to HQ AFGSC/A4RE not later than (NLT) 15 Mar each year.
   3.3.4. Vehicle Operations will provide unit misuse data to VM&A in support of their annual
   unit Vehicle Control Function (VCF) assistance visits.
 28                                          AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


   3.3.5. Vehicle Operations will brief overall base status of this program at VCO/VCNCO
   meetings.

Section 3C— Determining the Level and Validity of Support

3.4. Priority of Transportation Services: When vehicle transportation is essential to the
performance of official business, the following methods shall be considered in the order shown
to the extent they are available and capable of meeting mission requirements:
       3.4.1. DOD scheduled bus service.
       3.4.2. Scheduled public transportation.
       3.4.3. DOD-owned, rented or leased motor vehicle.
       3.4.4. Voluntary use of POV on a reimbursable basis.
       3.4.5. Commercial taxicab on a reimbursable basis.
3.5. Making Official Use Determinations: When questions arise about official use of motor
vehicles, they shall be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and the
policies of this instruction. Attachment 8, General Official Use Rules, and Attachment 9,
GMV Official Rules for Transportation Terminals are provided to assist in making official
use determinations. When guidance does not specifically fit a request for transportation support,
commanders must document answers to the following questions prior to approving the use of a
government motor vehicle:
   3.5.1. Is the purpose of the trip official (in support of an authorized DOD function, activity,
   or operation)?
   3.5.2. Does the request have the potential to create a perception that will reflect unfavorably
   on the Air Force or cause public criticism (can it be justified to a taxpayer)?
   3.5.3. Will the request impact mission requirements?
   3.5.4. Is commercial or DOD scheduled transportation available? It is important to note the
   Air Force does not provide transportation support that competes with commercial services.
   3.5.5. If provided, is GMV transportation the most cost effective method of satisfying the
   requirement?

Section 3D—Authorized Uses of GMVs for Temporary Duty Support

3.6. Temporary Duty: Transportation may be provided between lodgings and duty stations
for personnel on temporary duty when public or commercial resources are inadequate or
nonexistent. The temporary duty status of an individual does not necessarily justify the use of a
DOD motor vehicle. Use of the vehicle will always be predicated on need, distance involved,
and other conditions that justify their use. Note: When an adequate DOD or commercial bus
system is available, the use of any individual motor vehicle or commercial rental car is
prohibited. When authorized, (refer to Attachment 8 for some specific examples) a GMV may
be operated:
   3.6.1. Sustenance: Between places of business or lodging and eating establishments,
   drugstores, barber shops, places of worship, laundry cleaning establishments, and similar
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             29


   places required for sustenance of the member whether on or off-base. If used off-base for
   sustenance, restrict GMV use to reputable establishments in reasonable proximity to the
   installation. Reasonable proximity is established by the DSS. A one-way distance of 5-miles
   should be used as a guide. Reputable is defined as an establishment that will not create a
   perception that will reflect unfavorably on the Air Force or cause public criticism. GMVs
   will not be taken to adult-oriented/themed establishments.
   3.6.2. Entertainment and Morale: Between places of business or lodging and installation
   bowling centers, officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums or any on-base NAF activity (e.g.,
   golf courses, rod & gun clubs) facilities required for the comfort or health of the member.
   Use of motor vehicles for transportation to or from off-base entertainment or recreational
   facilities is prohibited.
   3.6.3. DELETE
   3.6.4. DELETE

Section 3E— Standard Authorized Uses of GMVs for Permanent Party Mission Support

3.7. Permanent Party: Official use for active duty personnel includes transportation to or from
Air Force scheduled appointments on or off-base, e.g., MPS records check, dental appointments,
commander’s calls (support must be conducted on base and cannot be used to circumvent official
use rules for purposes of morale), urinalysis testing, hospital outpatient appointments. GMV
travel is not authorized for elective surgery, procedures, or treatments where the member would
otherwise not be entitled to government travel. Use transportation priorities specified in
Paragraph 3.4.
   3.7.1. Permanent Personnel conducting official off-base duties are authorized to stop at off-
   base eating establishments in the immediate vicinity or direct route of the off-base work site.
   Stopping at private quarters for any reason or stopping for shopping purposes is prohibited.
   The intent is to allow for those personnel working away from their duty location, for an
   extended period, the opportunity to obtain meals without incurring an additional time/fuel
   cost of returning to the installation. This is not to be taken as authority to stop as a matter of
   convenience when in transit between sites, whether on or off-base.
   3.7.2. Personnel conducting official off-base duties are authorized to respond to personal
   emergencies that may arise while they are conducting off-base duties in a GMV. Personal
   emergencies are defined as notification of a life threatening or serious injury to themselves or
   a dependent or substantial damage to personal property, such as a home fire. Example: Off-
   base personnel with a GMV receives notification, at that time, of a personal emergency.
   Personnel may respond as it is more time and cost effective for the Air Force to have the
   individual proceed to the emergency event directly (home, school, hospital, accident scene)
   rather than return to the installation/duty location to retrieve their personal vehicle. The unit
   commander will notify the LRS commander any time these actions have been exercised and
   take actions to have the GMV returned at the earliest opportunity.
3.8. Event Participation: Units may provide transportation to military and civilian personnel
officially taking part in public ceremonies, parades, retirements, changes of command, and
military field demonstrations, (specific examples of “officially taking part” in a ceremony
include, but are not limited to; Unit Commander, Presiding Officer, Unit First Sergeant,
 30                                           AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


Command Chief, Chaplain, Master of Ceremonies, Guest Speaker, Proffer, etc.). This is not to
be interpreted as authority to transport a member’s relatives or personal friends invited to attend
activities such as retirements, promotions, awards ceremonies, dedications, funerals, or any other
similar type functions.       Event participation guidance applies on and off installation.
Determinations regarding any question of authorized support for such activities will be resolved
in favor of strict compliance with rules outlined in this instruction to preclude any negative
public perception. Space-available provisions apply (see glossary for Space-A definition).
   3.8.1. GMV travel is authorized to transport immediate family members of the sponsor in
   situations involving a sponsor’s combat-related death. LRS commanders will make
   determination in situations where combat-related cannot be determined.
   3.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) After-hours functions. All transportation to official after-hours
   functions will begin and end at the individual's normal place of duty, not at a residence.

Section 3F— Special Authorized Uses of GMVs for Permanent Party Mission Support

3.9. Mission-Specific Authorizations: Certain mission-specific allowances may be approved
by the installation commander annually either by memorandum or in the installation’s official
use policy (see paragraph 1.6.2.). Units will submit requests to the DDF annually. The
consolidated package with the LRS commander’s recommendations will be submitted to the
installation commander for final approval. Approval determinations will be provided to each
requesting unit commander and VCO. Mission-specific authorizations will be limited to:
   3.9.1. Alert Aircrews, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Personnel, and Emergency
   Response Forces: The installation commander may approve use of GMVs by alert aircrews,
   ICBM personnel, and emergency response forces (groups organized for emergency response
   purposes, e.g., Law Enforcement and Fire Department) for travel to on-base eating
   establishments and base gymnasium when on-duty. This approval may include the use of
   Military Dining Facilities and NAF/AAFES/DECA operated eating establishments to include
   commissary and shoppette. The intent is to afford personnel to remain on duty and maintain
   the ability for immediate response while securing meals for health and sustenance. Do not
   grant any of the above authorities for the personal convenience of members. Personnel are
   prohibited from using GMVs for travel to and from their private quarters under this
   provision.
   3.9.2. The installation commander may approve use of GMVs for the purposes of securing
   carry-out meals in bulk from on-base military dining facilities or flight kitchens. Examples
   include; Aircrew, Passenger Terminal, and Mobility/Contingency support. Do not grant any
   of the above authorities for the personal convenience of members.
       3.9.2.1. DELETE
       3.9.3. IAW DOD 4500.36-R, C2.2.3.3.5., emergency response vehicles will not be
       parked near dormitories or housing areas permitting circumvention of the pubic law that
       prohibits government-furnished, domicile-to-duty transportation.
       3.9.4. Other forms of emergency response GMV programs not listed in Chapter 3 are
       prohibited. As an immediate response alternative, units should consider using available
       base taxi service.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             31


       3.9.5. Unless specifically authorized in another section of this instruction, Air Force
       owned or leased vehicles will not be used to transport personnel or equipment to or from
       base housing areas or other private quarters located either on or off the installation.
   3.9.6. Mission specific authorizations may not be extended to other activities (para 3.38.).
3.10. Operations Group Commanders (OG/CCs): The installation commander may authorize
OG/CCs to drive their GMV to on-base quarters or base gymnasium incidental to the
performance of their duties in connection with on-going flight operations. This should not be
interpreted as having Command and Control Vehicle (CACV) authority. The intent of the policy
is to allow OG/CCs to drive their GMV to on-base dining facilities, home to eat, or base
gymnasium during on-going flying operations without having to transfer to a POV. Vehicles
will not be driven to quarters and parked overnight.

Section 3G—Overall Policy of Command and Control Vehicle (CACV) Authority

3.11. CACV Authority: Air Force commanders with overall responsibility for operations or
installation security, and who have a 24-hour emergency response and continuous
communications requirement, are authorized CACVs. Authority for these vehicles is strictly
limited to key command positions, especially in light of statutory restrictions on the use of
GMVs for “domicile-to-duty” transportation (Title 31 U.S.C. § 1344).
3.12. Basic Qualification for CACV: CACV authority is premised on a commander’s mission
requirement for around-the-clock mobility and a vehicle-based communications capability. The
commander must be assigned and occupy dedicated installation housing. Overall command and
control responsibility cannot be delegated. For this reason, there will normally be only one
CACV authorization per base unless otherwise approved by appropriate authority.
3.13. Approval Authority for CACV: COCOM, MAJCOM, and Component MAJCOM
commanders who meet the basic qualification for CACV are authorized command and control
vehicles. CACV approval authority for War Fighting Headquarter, Numbered Air Force,
Expeditionary Mobility Task Force, Center, Sector, Wing, Missile Group, detached flying unit
commanders with overall responsibility for operations (host or tenant) or installation security is
the respective parent MAJCOM commander (may be delegated in writing to MAJCOM/CV).
   3.13.1. Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installation and Mission Support is CACV
   approval authority for DRU and FOA commanders who meet the qualification criteria.
   Requests to establish CACV authority will be routed through HQ USAF/A4LE.
   3.13.2. MAJCOM/A4L staffs will revalidate CACV authorizations biennially, IAW
   procedures outlined above, NLT 30 October, retain a listing of all CACV authorizations for
   their respective command, and forward a list of approved/validated CACV authorizations to
   HQ USAF/A4LE for consolidation.
   3.13.3. Tenant units requesting CACV approval must coordinate with the host installation
   prior to requesting approval through their parent MAJCOM commander.
3.14. Request and Justification for CACV: Must include affirmative responses to the
questions cited below before CACV authority is granted:
   3.14.1. Does the commander have sole operational responsibility for a flying, combat,
   combat support, installation security, wartime, or contingency mission?
 32                                            AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


   3.14.2. Does the commander live on the installation?
   3.14.3. Is it unreasonable to expect the commander to discharge his or her duties without
   dedicated, full-time mobility (i.e., the vehicle remains available to the commander on a 24-
   hour, full-time basis) and an immediate means to communicate with a duty office or
   command post, aircraft, or operational combat sites?
   3.14.4. With the possible exception of the installation commander, is the requesting
   commander the only person in the vertical chain of command designated to require a
   command and control vehicle?
   3.14.5. Will a replacement commander be officially appointed with command and control
   authority to replace the commander when he/she is absent due to TDY or leave?
   3.14.6. In cases where a duty office or command post has been established to handle
   emergency response actions, is there any reason why that duty office or command post
   cannot manage an emergency until the commander arrives by privately owned conveyance?
   3.14.7. Can it be substantiated that the commander cannot adequately discharge duties
   outside of normal duty hours with a privately owned vehicle and a non-tactical portable
   communication device instead of a radio-equipped, emergency-configured vehicle?
3.15. CACV Use: On-base incidental use of command and control vehicles is authorized. On-
base incidental use includes travel to quarters, military transportation terminals, physical
conditioning facilities, eating establishments, the post office, cleaners, banks, etc. This authority
accommodates the commander’s around-the-clock responsibility to assure an immediate
response and communications capability with the acknowledged need to accomplish certain tasks
related to personal health and sustenance. Permanent party official use rules (para 3.7.) apply for
off base travel and stops.
   3.15.1. Incidental use should be exercised reasonably and at no significant cost to the
   government. All other official use constraints as described in this chapter, including the
   provisions on spouse and family member travel, apply to command and control vehicles.
   3.15.2. In case of leave or extended absence from the installation, the commander passes
   CACV authority to the individual assuming the responsibility. CACV vehicles are
   considered equipment assigned to specific commanders which allow maximum response
   flexibility in executing their assigned duties. In accordance with this determination,
   commanders will use assigned CACV vehicles for transport to/from off-base commercial
   transportation terminals only when use is critical to ongoing missions (e.g. use of specialized
   communications equipment installed in the CACV required while commander is en-route
   to/from off-base commercial transportation terminal). In all other instances, commanders
   with CACV authority are provided the same level of service as other members outlined in
   Attachment 9.

Section 3H—Air Force Band Transportation Support

3.16. Air Force Band Transportation Support: Vehicle Allowance Standards authorize
intercity buses to installations supporting Air Force bands. Buses will be authorized and
assigned to Vehicle Operations with the band as the primary user.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          33


       3.16.1. When Air Force owned intercity buses are not available to meet band
       requirements, the base LRS must arrange adequate alternative transportation, to include
       commercial charter buses. The Air Force band funds for commercial charter buses.
       3.16.2. The band pays all temporary duty expenses for Vehicle Operations personnel
       providing operator support.
       3.16.3. Buses may be used for other transportation needs when no band requirements
       exist.

Section 3I— Dependent and Pet Transportation Support

3.17. General Dependent Transportation Support: Transportation of family members is the
responsibility of the sponsor. Dependents may use publicized, regularly scheduled shuttle buses
or mass transportation services on a space-available basis.
       3.17.1. Spouses are not considered representatives of the United States, DOD or Air
       Force, except when traveling on an approved Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA).
       Military member or civilian employee spouses may be transported in GMVs only when:
           3.17.1.1. Accompanying the military member or civilian employee in the GMV for
           which the use of the vehicle has already been authorized to accomplish the official
           business and space is available. Transportation will be provided at no additional cost
           to the government. The vehicle must be no larger than that required for the
           performance of the official business. Spouses may proceed independently to or from
           an official function in a GMV when the spouse's presence at the function is in the best
           interest of the Government; however, this authority applies only to the spouse of an
           employee who is authorized to receive domicile-to-duty transportation.
3.18. Special Dependent Transportation Support: Spouses on official government orders
(also known as Invitational Travel Authorizations, ITA) are authorized and afforded air
transportation support only (Joint Federal Travel Regulation, Appendix E) and ground
transportation in direct support of the invitation, i.e. travel to/from transportation terminal,
billets, and event site.
   3.18.1. All other spouse support falls under space-available travel for dependents. No other
   transportation allowances (e.g. shopping trips, museum or landmark tours) are authorized.
3.19. Pet Transportation Support: Each organization must develop its own local policy
directives for the transport of family pets. Commanders should only allow this pursuant to
official business; i.e., PCS. GMVs should be used on a space-available basis with no detriment
to the mission. The family pet must always be under the control of the owner, either leashed or
caged, in order to ensure the safety of the driver and passengers. Owners will be held
responsible for the behavior of their pets and any costs associated to damage caused by the pet.

Section 3J—DOD Agency Transportation Support (non-inclusive)

3.20. Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Support: CAP is authorized Air Force transportation support
when performing Air Force assigned missions as a volunteer civilian auxiliary of the Air Force
IAW AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol. Air Force installation
commanders may provide government transportation and equipment to CAP units on a
 34                                          AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


temporary basis. When providing transportation or equipment to CAP units, the installation
commander must also provide a sufficient number of qualified personnel to operate the vehicles
or equipment. If requested by CAP, the Air Force may provide licensed/qualified operators for
CAP ground transportation support. CAP members are not authorized to drive GMVs.
       3.20.1. The SECAF can employ the services of CAP in-lieu-of or to supplement Air
       Force resources to fulfill non-combat programs and missions of the Air Force. IAW Title
       10 U.S.C. Section 9442, Status as Volunteer Civilian Auxiliary of the Air Force, when
       performing Air force-assigned programs and missions, CAP functions as an auxiliary of
       the Air Force. Authorize transportation support to CAP organizations when not
       detrimental to the mission. This is a non-fee charging or non-reimbursable service.
       3.20.2. IAW HQ USAF/HC, Air Force Chaplain Services, permits Wing Commanders to
       use the services of the CAP Chaplains (also referred to as Air Force Auxiliary Chaplains)
       to meet current mission requirements. This is addressed in AFI 52-101, Planning and
       Organizing. CAP/Auxiliary Chaplains are serving Air Force ecclesiastical missions and
       are afforded the same service as active duty Chaplains.
3.21. Child Development Center Support: Authorize child development centers limited
transportation support based on the availability of vehicle operators and vehicles when it is not
detrimental to the mission. Limit support to child-development-center-sponsored activities. Do
not provide transportation between on or off-base housing areas and the child development
center. Do not authorize Air Force vehicles on a permanent basis to child development centers.
3.22. Chaplain and Chapel Support: Provide transportation support to the installation
chaplain and chapel personnel performing official duties in the same manner as other mission
support activities. Support includes direct administrative support and staff assistance visits to
off-base locations. The installation staff chaplain submits the transportation request for chapel
program activities such as picnics, special groups, social activities, renewal activities, chapel
youth trips, or summer camps. Submit all requests to the Vehicle Operations well in advance of
the date required. Support is predicated on the availability of vehicles and vehicle operators and
must not pose a detriment to higher priority missions.
   3.22.1. Provide transportation support from installation housing areas to installation chapels
   for weekly worship and religious education programs when resources are available. Vehicle
   operators will be provided on a volunteer basis only.
   3.22.2. In all cases, the chapel must program and identify chapel transportation requirements
   to the LRS for inclusion in the installations annual budget submission. The chapel is
   responsible for all TDY expenses for Vehicle Operations personnel providing support.
3.23. Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Support: Express any arrangements concerning FPC
inmates operating Air Force vehicles in a written support agreement between the federal agency
and the Air Force.
   3.23.1. Use Air Force vehicles to perform work stipulated by a support agreement. Do not
   use Air Force vehicles to conduct other prison business or for inmates to conduct personal
   business.
   3.23.2. Do not assign Air Force vehicles to a prison facility. Air Force units using FPC
   inmates for labor may transport them to and from work sites.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            35


3.24. Housing Office Support: Air Force vehicles assigned to housing offices may be used to
transport newly arrived members in overseas areas to available or potential rental properties in
local communities. The following guidelines apply:
   3.24.1. Only housing office employees can transport members in GMVs to search for off-
   base housing.
   3.24.2. The base housing manager should consider the adequacy of local sponsorship
   programs and the availability of private or commercial transportation before authorizing the
   use of assigned GMVs to support members obtaining off-base quarters.
   3.24.3. Do not provide base-level transportation and operator support, to include UDI
   vehicles, to individual members for the purpose of house hunting. UDI support may be
   provided to the housing office to facilitate mass transportation movements. Support will be
   based on the availability of GMVs in relation to mission support requirements.
3.25. Air Force Recruiter Support: Air Force Recruiters may use GMVs to provide
transportation to prospective military recruits for interviews, in-processing, and orientation only.
The SECAF must approve all domicile-to-duty transportation requirements for recruiters.
3.26. Inpatient Status Support: Medical staff personnel and unit leadership, i.e., commander,
first sergeant, supervisor, or unit commander appointed Family Liaison Officer (FLO) may use
GMVs to travel to/from off-base hospitals to support/help military members who are in in-
patient status at off-base locations. Family members may accompany on a space-available basis.
3.27. Mental Health Support: The use of GMVs is authorized to support mental health
facilities when mental health patients are in outpatient status. Mental Health must prearrange
transportation support and such support must be part of patient therapy ordered by a medical
physician. Medical personnel must accompany the patient(s).
3.28. Air Force Museum Support: Transportation service (UDI, Radio Taxi, Non-Radio Taxi,
and Mass Transportation) in support of APF Air Force museums may be provided when such
transportation can be made available without detriment to the DOD mission. Figure 3.1 contains
a list of Air Force museums that receive APF.
   3.28.1. Limit vehicle support to cargo type vehicles for use in maintaining facilities and
   displays. Process requests for Air Force vehicle support as any other vehicle support request.
   They must comply with all established guidelines.
   3.28.2. Provide support using the means most economical to the Air Force. Museums that
   do not receive Air Force APF are private organizations and not authorized permanent Air
   Force vehicle support. Note: The above policy does not apply to the National Museum of
   the USAF at Wright-Patterson AFB OH.

3.29. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG)
Support: When DOD scheduled bus service or scheduled public transportation is not available
or impractical, AFRC and ANG members in official status (active duty, active duty for training,
annual tour, inactive duty for training pay (UTA)) are authorized government transportation for
line of duty travel i.e., to and from duty locations, dining facilities and temporary lodging, IAW
with guidelines provided in this publication. AFRC members are not to interpret this paragraph
as authority to rent vehicle(s) without prior coordination/approval from their chain of command.
3.30. Air Force Fitness Program (AFFP) Support: AFFP testing is an official scheduled
appointment and GMV support/use is authorized for transport to an approved assessment
facility/location.
   3.30.1. Transportation for unit or installation sponsored/mandatory physical fitness activities
   is not authorized and remains an individual responsibility.
   3.30.2. Vehicle Operations may establish incidental shuttle bus stops at base gymnasiums to
   meet the intent of the AFFP. A shuttle will not be established solely to support the AFFP.
   3.30.3. Unit assigned vehicles will not be driven to the gymnasium for the intent of this
   program other than for officially scheduled testing.

3.32. Non-DOD Counterparts and Foreign Attaché Support:             GMV support for USAF-
sponsored, non-DOD counterparts and foreign attaché is authorized. Vehicle types will meet the
guidance prescribed in DOD 4500.36-R, Para C3.1.1.3. and C3.1.1.4., commensurate with
principals US military equivalent rank.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           37


3.33. Invited Civilian Organizations: When officially invited and approved by the installation
commander or other competent authority (delegated in-writing by the installation commander)
GMV support may be provided to transport civilian organizations (non-reimbursable) to military
installations (limited to local area travel) to take part in base activities in the interest of
community relations. This is not to be interpreted as authority to transport a member’s relatives
or personal friends invited to attend activities such as retirements, promotions, awards
ceremonies, dedications, funerals, or any other similar function. Space-available provisions
apply.
   3.33.1. Authorize reimbursable transportation support for community service programs as
   prescribed by AFI 35-105, Community Relations, when certified by the installation Public
   Affairs Officer.
3.34. Support for Civilian Organizations: When approved by the installation commander or
other competent authority (delegated in-writing by the installation commander; typically the
Public Affairs Officer), personnel invited to speak at social events by civilian organizations are

support is to/from a duty location unless the member is authorized domicile-to-duty or CACV
authority.

Section 3L— General Unauthorized uses of Air Force Vehicles (non-inclusive)

3.35. Reason of Grade, Prestige or Personal Convenience:              Do not provide exclusive
assignment of UDI vehicles (owned, rented, or leased) to an official or employee based solely on
grade, prestige or personal convenience. Assignment and use of UDI vehicles to units will not
exceed 60-days (total duration). Back-to-back UDI requests are not authorized.
3.36. Reason for Personal Business or Personal Nature: Unless authorized under Paragraph
3.6 through 3.34, transportation to, from, or between locations will not be provided for
conducting personal business or engaging in other activities of a personal nature by military or
civilian personnel, members of their families, or others.
   3.36.1. (Added-AFGSC) GMV support will not be provided to activities or agencies such
   as Airmen Against Drunk Drivers and other―Drunk Bus/Van proposals. These types of

   to receive all appropriate personal property shipping entitlements. Refer requests for
   household goods moves to Personal Property Element.
   3.40.2. DELETE
3.41. GMV Parking Locations: Unless incident to the performance of official duty, do not use
or park GMVs at commissaries, base exchanges (including all concessions), bowling centers,
officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums or any NAF activity (e.g., golf courses, rod & gun clubs)
unless approved in other sections of this chapter.
3.42. Permissive TDY Status: Members traveling in Permissive TDY status are not authorized
dedicated appropriated funded motor vehicle transportation support. Members in this duty status
may use publicized, regularly scheduled transportation services (e.g., shuttle buses, airport
transportation service) on a space-available basis. Do not provide a larger vehicle to
accommodate space-available passengers.
3.43. Contractor Support: Contractors are prohibited from using DOD furnished GMVs for
home-to-work transportation (41 CFR, Subpart 101-38.301-1, Public Contracts and Property
Management, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 45.3).

Section 3M—Domicile-to-Duty Transportation Support:

3.44. Approval Authority for Transportation between Domicile and Place of
Employment . The SECAF must approve all domicile-to-duty authorizations. 31 U.S.C. §
1344, is the sole authority for use of government transportation between a residence and place of
employment and Section 1344(b) designates specific positions authorized home-to-work
transportation. For the Air Force, the SECAF and the Chief of Staff are the only two positions
authorized home-to-work transportation.
   3.44.1. The SECAF may authorize others home-to-work transportation only when one of
   three conditions exists:
       3.44.1.1. Highly unusual circumstances presenting a clear and present danger (e.g., the
       threat of terrorist attack).
       3.44.1.2. An emergency such as a public transportation strike.
       3.44.1.3. Other compelling operational considerations (defined as those circumstances
       with an element of importance which are essential to the successful accomplishment of
       the Air Force mission or are necessary for the Air Force’s efficient operation).
       3.44.1.4. DOD contractor personnel conducting official defense business are not
       authorized domicile-to-duty transportation.
3.45. Normal Approval Procedures for Domicile-to-Duty: Federal law requires the SECAF
(non-delegable) to approve written determinations for domicile-to-duty requirements cited
above. The determination must include:
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             39


   3.45.1. The name (or other identification, if confidential) and the title of the individual.
   3.45.2. The reason for the determination.
   3.45.3. The anticipated duration of the authorization. The initial approval will not exceed
   15-calendar days. If the circumstances continue, the SECAF may approve a subsequent
   determination of not more than 90-additional calendar days. The process may continue as
   long as required by the circumstances.
       3.45.3.1. Submit original or subsequent determination requests to HQ USAF/A4L
       through the respective MAJCOM/A4L. The SECAF advises the Senate Committee on
       Governmental Affairs and the House of Representatives Committee on Government
       Reform of each determination.
3.46. Special Approval Procedures for Domicile-to-Duty: Combatant Commanders in areas
outside the United States may, under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 2637, authorize the use of
government transportation for those not otherwise entitled when the commander determines that
public or private transportation in the area is unsafe or not available. If authorized, Air Force
personnel will notify HQ USAF/A4L through their chain of command to begin approval process.
   3.46.1. Unless waived by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), obtain
   reimbursement.
3.47. Field Work: The SECAF determines who is eligible to use home-to-work transportation
for field work. IAW 41 CFR, Subpart 101-6.401(g), Public Contracts and Property
Management, field work means official work performed by an employee whose job requires
travel involving multiple stops within or outside the accepted local commuting area. Some
examples of field work include:
   3.47.1. Medical officers performing outpatient medical service away from a hospital.
   3.47.2. Military recruiters who proceed directly from their domiciles to conduct official
   recruiting matters, when it is determined to be impractical for the recruiter to first proceed to
   an office location where the GMV is normally garaged.
   3.47.3. Do not use the field work exception when:
       3.47.3.1. The individual’s workday begins at his or her official government duty station.
       3.47.3.2. The individual normally commutes to a fixed location, however far removed
       from his or her official duty station.
       3.47.3.3. When it would be more advantageous to the government to provide the member
       a vehicle for home-to-work transportation rather than have the member travel a long
       distance to pick up a vehicle and drive back toward or beyond his/her residence to
       perform his/her job, MAJCOMs should consider requesting home-to-work authorization
       under compelling operational circumstances.
3.48. Approval Procedures for Field Work: Submit all Air Force field work requirements
biennially to HQ USAF/A4L for consolidation and submission to the SECAF for approval. Out-
of-cycle requests may also be submitted through the MAJCOM to HQ USAF/A4L.
3.49. Logging Home-to-Work Transportation Requirements: The person(s) or position(s)
authorized home-to-work transportation by the SECAF (under provisions of Paragraph 3.44
 40                                           AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


through 3.47) must maintain a log for a period of 2-years (RDS: T24-03-R17.00). The log
enables auditors or inspectors to determine whether or not the home-to-work transportation was
used for official purposes only. The log must contain:
   3.49.1. The name and title of the individual (or other identification, if confidential).
   3.49.2. The name and title of the authorizing individual.
   3.49.3. The vehicle registration number.
   3.49.4. The dates, location, duration, and circumstances requiring the home-to-work
   transportation.
   3.49.5. Precautions taken to ensure the security of the vehicle.

Section 3N— General Policy on Bus Transportation Support

3.50. Bus Transportation Services: IAW 10 U.S.C. § 2632, Transportation to and from
Certain Places of Employment and on Military Installations, the Air Force provides bus service
for official purposes and as U.S. law allows. The Air Force operates enough buses to effectively
support the mission. The capability to transport groups of people on official business reduces the
requirement for small passenger-carrying vehicles. Do not provide this service to nonessential
activities when private or commercial transportation is available. The availability of vehicles
and operators may limit military support. Paragraphs 3.51 – 3.63 describe official bus services
the Air Force is authorized to provide.

Section 3O— Categories and Administrative Requirements of GMV Bus Transportation
Services

3.51. Group Transportation Service: This is a fare-charging service that requires a vehicle
with a minimum of 12-passenger seats to transport military and civilian employees. This service
provides domicile-to-duty transportation from other than government installations. For example,
an installation that is located so far from the source of manpower that government assistance is
necessary to make sure personnel have adequate transportation. Another example is a situation
where an overseas area does not have adequate public or private transportation, or where local
political situations, security, personal safety, or geographic locations of duty stations make this
transportation essential to conduct Air Force business. Each MAJCOM or FOA reviews
operational data annually to ensure continued service is justified. Provide a certification of
review completion, the results of the review, and a current list of locations to HQ USAF/A4LE
by 1 November each year (RCA: HAF-A4L (A) 8103, Annual Group Transportation Review
Certificate). This report is designated emergency status code D. Immediately discontinue
reporting data requirements during emergency conditions. The use of GMV buses (owned,
contractor-owned, leased or chartered to private or public carriers) is authorized under terms
approved by HQ USAF/A4L. To establish Group Transportation Service:
       3.51.1. Submit requests through command logistics readiness channels to HQ
       USAF/A4L for approval. Requests must include the following information:
           3.51.1.1. The name, mission, and location of the activity.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           41


           3.51.1.2. The current military and civilian strength and any authorized changes that
           might affect transportation requirements to include a breakdown of shifts if necessary.
           3.51.1.3. A description of existing transportation available including the use of
           POVs, car pools, and group riding arrangements.
           3.51.1.4. Location where the service is required and the distance between the
           installation and each point.
           3.51.1.5. The number of people requiring recurring transportation between the
           installation and each point. Estimates based on customer surveys are acceptable for
           establishing a new service.
           3.51.1.6. A statement describing any efforts to make existing transportation (public
           or private) adequate and efforts taken to induce private operators to provide the
           required service.
           3.51.1.7. The type of service proposed and pertinent information about arrangements
           such as rentals, charters, rates, routes, and schedules. Include the type, source,
           number, and seating capacity of the equipment to be used. Enclose a fare quote and a
           map of the area. The request must indicate that local commercial carriers do not have
           a desire nor the capacity to provide the service if GMVs will perform the service.
           3.51.1.8. A statement of appropriated funds availability to operate the service.
           3.51.1.9. The proposed start date.
3.52. Mass Transit Service: A fare-charging bus service that provides domicile-to-duty
transportation on military installations or between Geographically Separated Units (GSU) within
an established POD. It may be used to provide service to and from on-base domiciles, on-base
shopping areas, or installation recreation areas on a routine basis if the traffic volume warrants.
   3.52.1. To establish Mass Transportation Service, the MAJCOM/A4 must determine:
       3.52.1.1. A potential exists for saving energy and reducing air pollution.
       3.52.1.2. Other mass transportation providers are unable or have declined to provide
       adequate transportation facilities or service after a reasonable effort has been made to
       induce them to do so.
       3.52.1.3. There is no regularly scheduled mass transportation that operates at least twice
       a day, five times a week between the sending or receiving installations that picks up and
       drops off passengers within 1/2 mile of the installations, provides pick-up from the
       sending installation not later than 0800 hours and provides last departure from the
       receiving location not later than 1900 hours and is licensed and operates in accordance
       with reasonable maintenance and safety standards.
       3.52.1.4. The service utilizes transportation assets properly and efficiently.
       3.52.1.5. If the MAJCOM validates that the service may produce fuel economies and a
       reduction in pollution, it may:
           3.52.1.5.1. Rent or lease motor vehicles. Compute the fare to recover all rental/lease
           costs including contract administration costs, salaries, and operations and
           maintenance costs.
 42                                          AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


           3.52.1.5.2. Program procurement of vehicles to support mass transportation. When
           assets are purchased specifically and exclusively for mass transit, a fare must be
           charged to recover all acquisition costs.
           3.52.1.5.3. Lease or charter vehicles from private or public carriers. Costs must be
           recovered in the fare system.
       3.52.1.6. Vehicle used will hold 12 or more riders and operate at 50 percent of capacity
       on a monthly basis. For example, service scheduled for three times a week using a 28-
       passenger bus would require a minimum monthly ridership of 168-duty passengers (do
       not include space-available ridership) to justify use.
3.53. Approval Authority for Mass Transit Service: The installation commander requests
authority to establish mass transit service through command logistics readiness channels to
MAJCOM/A4. Include the following information:
   3.53.1. The name, mission, and location of the activity. Show the relationship of the main
   installation to the GSU. Military leased housing areas located off the installation are
   considered annexed. This does not include housing privately leased by DOD employees or
   military members.
   3.53.2. The number of persons to use the service. Persons authorized to use this service
   include active duty military, DOD, or other government civilian employees working on the
   installation; contractor employees working on the installation in overseas areas; and
   dependents living, working, having business on the installation or attending school on the
   installation where school bus travel is not authorized.
   3.53.3. A description of the existing transportation services including POVs, private or
   commercial transportation, car pools, and group riding arrangements. Include any potential
   for saving energy and reducing air pollution.
   3.53.4. A definition of the locations where service is required. Use the most direct route of
   travel between GSUs consistent with safe operations.
   3.53.5. A statement indicating the service does not compete with commercial enterprises in
   the area.
   3.53.6. The type of service proposed and information about all necessary arrangements such
   as rates and methods of computation, routes, schedules, and seating capacities of the
   vehicles. State the proposed fare and include a map of the route.
3.54. Reimbursement for Mass Transit Service: Unless waived in Paragraph 3.54.2.1, a
reasonable fare must be charged for mass transportation provided under this authority. All fares
and proceeds must be accounted for and deposited into the treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
   3.54.1. The fare shall be a pro rata share of all costs of providing the mass transportation
   service, including capital investment, salaries, operations, and maintenance. If the vehicle is
   used for operational- (missions) and mass transportation, only the cost directly related to
   mass transportation must be recovered. Since these motor vehicles are acquired in direct
   support of the Air Force mission, acquisition costs shall not be recovered through the fare
   system.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         43


   3.54.2. For OCONUS locations, a reasonable fare shall be charged which is not more than
   what would be charged if such service were available through local commercial or municipal
   transportation services.
       3.54.2.1. The SECAF may waive all passenger fares. Forward waiver requests through
       command logistics readiness channels to HQ USAF/A4L for SECAF approval. The
       following must be substantiated:
          3.54.2.1.1. The sending location does not have adequate medical, dental,
          commissary, or Base Exchange facilities; the rider’s place of work is located on the
          receiving installation; the use of POVs is restricted in the area served.
          3.54.2.1.2. The receiving installation is more than one mile from the sending
          installation.
          3.54.2.1.3. Fare charged exceeds $1.00 per passenger, per round trip.
          3.54.2.1.4. Mass transportation service provided under this authority will be for the
          primary purpose of providing access to life support facilities, e.g. commissaries,
          AAFES facilities, or military hospitals, for all Airmen and their dependents.
3.55. Mass Transit Service for Isolated Areas: IAW DOD 4500.36-R, C5.5.1, MAJCOM
Commanders may establish such fare free bus service for military personnel, DOD civilians,
dependents, and contractor employees, assigned to designated isolated locations. Before
granting such approval the following specific objective criteria must be met:
   3.55.1. Provide no-fare bus transportation (12-passenger or more) service for locations
   designated as an isolated area. Isolated areas are those locations not adequately serviced by
   regularly scheduled commercial or municipal transit services. Consider the Continental
   United States (CONUS) locations as isolated areas only under unique circumstances.
   3.55.2. Mass transportation service provided under this authority will be for the primary
   purpose of providing access to life support facilities for military members, DOD civilians,
   contractors, and their dependents.
   3.55.3. Installation commanders’ forward requests through MAJCOM logistics readiness
   channels for MAJCOM commander approval. Requests for both CONUS and OCONUS will
   include the same information as requested in Paragraph 3.53
3.56. Administrative Requirements for Mass Transit Services: All the above criteria for
both fare-charged and fare-free mass transportation must be met, documented, and retained on
file at MAJCOM/A4L. At a minimum, the following will be retained as a permanent record as
long as the service is in force.
   3.56.1. Description of the mass transit services.
   3.56.2. Synopsis of schedules and routes of the mass transit services.
   3.56.3. Factual synopsis to support each of the objective criteria set out in Paragraph 3.52
   3.56.4. Installation commander’s evaluation statement that mass transportation support
   meets the criteria established above and is still required.
   3.56.5. This program will receive close scrutiny by inspecting agencies; therefore, approval
   must strictly comply with these provisions.
 44                                           AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


       3.56.5.1. There will be no additional funds to defray cost of this service.
       3.56.5.2. Requests that require an exception to the above criteria must be submitted
       through the MAJCOM/A4L to HQ USAF/A4L and approved by the SECAF as required
       by law.
       3.56.5.3. Service must be reviewed locally at least every 6 months to ensure that the fare
       schedule is adequate and that the most efficient form of service is provided. For audit
       purposes, retain the 6-month review as a permanent record as long as the service is in
       force.
3.57. Emergency Bus Service: This is a fare-charging bus service for military and DOD
civilian personnel during public transportation strikes or transportation stoppages. Establish this
service to support projects when a continued delay would adversely affect national defense.
Transportation for routine workloads such as constructing, repairing, or overhauling aircraft,
ships, or materiel peculiar to the military departments does not qualify under this policy. When
public transportation strikes are imminent or in progress, commanding officers who determine
that transportation between domiciles and places of employment is essential must submit the
following information through MAJCOM logistics readiness channels to HQ USAF/A4L for
approval:
   3.57.1. The name of the installation or activity requiring transportation support.
   3.57.2. The general nature of the transportation requirements, including any efforts to induce
   private transportation companies to provide this transportation.
   3.57.3. The titles of critical projects.
   3.57.4. The availability, type, and number of vehicles required.
   3.57.5. The number of personnel, by project, to be transported.
   3.57.6. The proposed fares.
3.58. Shuttle Bus Service: The capability to transport groups of individuals on official business
between offices on installations or between nearby installations is a recognized requirement and
is essential to mission support. The use of an effective shuttle bus system reduces the
requirements for recurring dispatch vehicles. Shuttle bus services are provided fare-free. Costs
for this category of transportation are paid from appropriated funds. Provide shuttle bus service
using DOD-owned or DOD-approved contract vehicles. Use the most efficient vehicles to
accommodate duty passengers. Conduct semiannual surveys and analyses to ensure the service
remains valid and cost-efficient.
   3.58.1. Authorized Users. Shuttle bus service provides support on or between installations
   for transporting:
       3.58.1.1. Military personnel and DOD employees between offices and work areas of the
       installation or activity during designated hours when justified by the ridership. Routes
       will service offices and work centers only. Unauthorized stops include base housing
       areas (to include government leased housing) and any recreational or shopping areas
       unless these areas are reasonably unavoidable. Domicile-to-duty transportation using a
       shuttle service is not authorized.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         45


         3.58.1.1.1. Service shall be provided for designated isolated sites with limited
         support facilities where military personnel and dependents need additional support
         (medical, commissary, and religious) that directly affects health, morale, and welfare
         of the family. The LRS commander is the approval authority.
         3.58.1.1.2. Do not establish service to transport members to/from parking areas and
         work locations. This is considered partial domicile-to-duty. When an emergency or
         critical condition exists, temporary establishment of this type of support is permitted.
             3.58.1.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Shuttle bus service provided from on base
             parking areas to work areas is permitted during installation exercises and
             inspections when use of POVs within the play area is restricted.
     3.58.1.2. Enlisted personnel residing in dormitories, between the dormitory and work
     areas when they are required to support the defense mission. Do not provide this service
     when other forms of transportation such as mass transit, privately owned conveyance, or
     car or van pools are adequate to meet the needs of the member. The installation
     commander makes these determinations.
     3.58.1.3. Employees from non-DOD Federal agencies conducting official business. Do
     not alter established (mission) routes to support these members.
  3.58.2. Space-Available Transportation. The following categories of passengers may use
  shuttle-bus services on a space-available basis only. Do not change the size of the vehicle
  required to support active duty personnel to accommodate space-available personnel.
     3.58.2.1. Off-duty military personnel or DOD civilian employees.
     3.58.2.2. Dependents of active duty personnel.
     3.58.2.3. Retirees.
     3.58.2.4. Visitors to the base (intra-installation only).
     3.58.2.5. In OCONUS areas, volunteers of Type-2 Affiliate Private Organization as
     identified in DOD Instruction 1000.15, Private Organizations on DOD Installations.
  3.58.3. Shuttle bus service in support of TDY personnel and transient aircrews. Establish
  special shuttle bus services at installations to accommodate large numbers of TDY personnel
  and transient aircrews when the service would be the most cost effective and efficient
  support.
     3.58.3.1. Authorized stops will include on or off-base lodging, duty locations, and NAF
     facilities only. Establishing shuttle stops for off-base entertainment is prohibited.
     3.58.3.2. LRS commander is the approval authority.
  3.58.4. Under appropriate authority, in accordance with federal law and DOD policy,
  transportation support is authorized for certain non-federal entities. Refer to DOD 4500.36-R
  and DODI 1000.15. This does not include UDI support.
  3.58.5. Establishment of shuttle bus routes and schedules require careful planning. The
  number of personnel using this service, work schedules, traffic studies, and potential for
  saving energy and reducing air pollution will be considered. The bus used must be no larger
  than the most economical available to accommodate duty passengers. Bus service routes will
 46                                          AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


   not include housing, recreational, or shopping areas unless such areas cannot be reasonably
   avoided in serving the authorized locations.
   3.58.6. Approved schedules will be reviewed semiannually to decide if conditions continue
   to warrant their operation or if adjustments to routes or schedules should be made.
3.59. MWR Support: Bus transportation in support of DOD-authorized Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation (MWR) programs or family service center programs may be provided when such
transportation can be made available without detriment to the DOD mission. This service is
limited to full support of Category A MWR activities, substantial support of Category B MWR
activities, and some limited support of Category C MWR activities. The categories of MWR
activities and funding support authorized are contained in AFI 65-106, Para 2.1 and Figure 2.1.,
Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and Non-appropriated
Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS).
   3.59.1. All requests for support must be coordinated through the LRS commander and Force
   Support Squadron commander. The installation commander is the approval authority. When
   available, NAF and/or commercial transportation sources will be used.
       3.59.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) GMVs will not be provided unless assigned NAF vehicles
       are non-existent or unavailable. Family Support Squadron (FSS)/Non-appropriated Fund
       (NAF) VCO will provide written proof that NAF assets are unavailable. GMV support
       will only be provided if not detrimental to mission accomplishment.
   3.59.2. Category C activities at approved remote and isolated locations are generally
   authorized Category B level APF support, based on availability of resources at each location.
   AFI 65-106, Figure 3.1. identifies approved remote and/or isolated locations for NAF/MWR
   support reasons.
   3.59.3. Services cannot be provided for domicile-to-duty transport. The following are
   examples of general mass transportation services that are routinely provided when
   requirements of Paragraph 3.59.1 have been met and service can be made available without
   detriment to the mission:
       3.59.3.1. Nonreimbursable.
           3.59.3.1.1. Command or base varsity teams on official orders composed of personnel
           who officially represent the Air Force in scheduled events.
           3.59.3.1.2. Military personnel or dependent spectators attending local events in
           which a command or base-sponsored team is participating. Does not include
           providing personnel movement to view or attend an Air Force Band or Tops-in-Blue
           concert or event.
           3.59.3.1.3. Entertainers, guests, and their supplies and equipment essential to morale
           and welfare programs. Note: Use of utility type vehicles for cargo movements is
           authorized.
           3.59.3.1.4. Civilian groups transported to/on military installations in the interest of
           community relations when officially invited by the installation commander or other
           competent authority and deemed nonreimbursable IAW AFI 35-105, Community
           Relations.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             47


           3.59.3.1.5. Base-sponsored tours and trips when operated on a nonprofit basis.
           Assets may be used only after mission requirements have been met.
           3.59.3.1.6. Scouting programs (Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America) operating at
           U.S. military installations located overseas.
           3.59.3.1.7. Child-development-center-sponsored activities      when       vehicles     and
           personnel are available without detriment to the mission.
       3.59.3.2. Reimbursable.
           3.59.3.2.1. Transportation may be provided to MWR/NAF category C revenue-
           generating organizations (refer to AFI 65-106, Para 5 and Attachment 2). Such
           service shall be accomplished on a reimbursable basis. A fare is charged for all
           operations and maintenance costs (formula in Table 3.2 will be used to determine
           reimbursement). Do not use vehicle acquisition costs when determining the fare.
           3.59.3.2.2. Limit GMV bus support to on-installation wing events only. Unit level
           activities are prohibited from GMV support unless required to correct immediate
           health or safety issues.
           3.59.3.2.3. Specific guidance for supporting Private Organizations can be found in
           AFI 34-223, Private Organizations (PO) Program. Private organizations generally
           do not get either NAF or APF support.
3.60. Fares and Proceeds: Accounting and Finance (ACF) and LRS will determine how to
account for and deposit fares and proceeds. As a general rule, return proceeds to transportation
Operations & Maintenance (O&M) accounts for unfunded support. Deposit proceeds in the U.S.
Treasury as “Miscellaneous Receipts” according to Air Force financial guidance. Recover only
costs directly related to category of transportation provided if the vehicle supports both
operational (mission) and group/mass transportation using Table 3.2 below. In overseas areas
only, the fare may not exceed the fare charged by commercial municipal transportation (if such
transportation were available). In isolated areas the fare charged will not exceed $1.00 per
passenger, per round trip.

Table3.2. Computing Reimbursement and Bus Fares:
 Step 1 (To Determine Operations Cost)
   a. Determine vehicle operator cost using the average hourly pay for the            $34.01
   operator’s rank (AFI 65-503, Table A20-2, Military Pay Rates Per Unit of
   Time:     http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI65-503.pdf).
   Obtain most current rate from local accounting & finance office. Example:
   An E-4 hourly rate is $34.01.
   b. Determine the number of hours necessary to complete the transportation          8 (hours)
   request. Example: 8 hours
   c. Multiply steps a and b                                                          $272.08
   d. Determine total miles required to support request                               250 (miles)
   e. Determine the vehicle cost by obtaining the annual fleet average direct cost    .47
   per mile for a particular vehicle type from OLVIMS data. Example: 28-
   passenger bus (B121) with an average cost per mile of 47 cents. See Note 2
 48                                           AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


   f. Multiply steps d and e                                                         $117.50
   Notes:
   1. An operator cost is not charged if an off-duty volunteer drives the vehicle.
   2. Obtain lease vehicle costs from leasing agency, i.e. GSA.
   3. If total costs are all that is required, steps 2 and 3 are not needed.
 Step 2 (To Determine Fare Cost)
   a. Determine number of passenger seats requested. Do not count the operator       28
   or driver seat. Example: a 28-passenger bus is requested.
   b. Add steps 1c with 1f and divide by 2a ($201.44 + 117.50 div. by 28)            $13.91
   Note: Fare cost will include all mileage driven to support the request in the
   computation. For example, if the vehicle travels 10 miles to pick up the first
   passenger, include that mileage in the computation.
 Step 3 (To Determine Mass-Transit Fare Cost)
   a. Use the average number of passengers transported per day to determine the      300
   fare per person. Re-compute fees semiannually per Paragraph 3.9.2.2.6.
   b. Add steps 1c with 1f and divide by 3a ($272.08 + 117.50 div. by 300)           $1.30
3.61. Modified Shuttle Bus Services Support: Used for transporting military personnel and
DOD civilians between offices and mass transit facilities, e.g., airport, train, and bus terminals.
   3.61.1. A GMV designed to transport passengers will be used, i.e. bus or van.
   3.61.2. Provide service when:
       3.61.2.1. No scheduled shuttle service operates on a routine basis twice a day, five times
       a week, between authorized locations.
       3.61.2.2. Civilian shuttle service providers are unable or have declined to provide
       adequate transportation facilities or service after a reasonable effort has been made to
       induce their support.
       3.61.2.3. Service will enhance the rider’s quality of life.
       3.61.2.4. GMV used will be a 12-passenger van or larger and operates at 50 percent
       capacity on a monthly basis.
       3.61.2.5. The installation/place of employment is a significant distance from the mass
       transit facility.
   3.61.3. Approval authority for modified shuttle bus services support in the Air Force rests
   with the MAJCOM/A4. This requirement is purposefully more restrictive than guidance in
   DOD 4500.36-R to maintain program integrity and oversight.
       3.61.3.1. MAJCOM/A4L and LRS commanders will retain a file copy of all approved
       services.
   3.61.4. Units approved to provide this service will forward their analysis to
   MAJCOM/A4LE NLT 15 January of each calendar year.

Section 3P— General and Administrative Procedures for Transporting Dependent School
Children in the United States
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           49


3.62. Transporting Dependent School Children in the United States: These policies apply
to all DOD dependent students who attend schools in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands, Guam, and
Midway Island. It also applies to DOD dependents and other children eligible to attend schools
operated by the DOD Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS).
       3.62.1. Authorities: There are two distinct authorities for providing this transportation:
           3.62.1.1. Title 10 U.S.C. § 2164, as amended: In consideration for federal assistance
           to local education agencies (LEA) providing education for children residing on
           federal property, the agencies that provide transportation to school children in their
           districts shall provide transportation to children residing on Air Force installations
           located within their school districts. If transportation is provided for local students
           but not Air Force dependent students, the Air Force may provide transportation to
           those students. The cost of providing this transportation may be sought from the local
           education agency pursuant to Department of Education procedures.
           3.62.1.2. Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2639, Transportation to and from School for
           Certain Minor Dependents, authorizes each military department to provide funds
           specifically appropriated for the transportation of military dependents between their
           school and the military installation when schools are not accessible by regular means
           of transportation. Provide support when an appropriate official of the local education
           agency advises the school district they will not provide school transportation. Once
           these requirements are met, the installation commander forwards a letter to the LRS
           commander indicating that transporting school children is authorized. Provide the
           most economical, efficient service using GMVs (owned, leased, or contracted
           service). Revalidate the commander’s letter annually through the local school
           district.
       3.62.2. Provide transportation to:
           3.62.2.1. Local public schools when the school is not accessible.
           3.62.2.2. Nearby public schools, other than the local public schools, when either the
           nearby schools are not accessible or when the SECAF determines that local public
           schools where children would normally attend are unable to adequately provide for
           their education and that attendance at other public schools (to include public schools
           for the handicapped) in a nearby school district can be arranged and that the
           transportation cannot be provided as described above.
       3.62.3. Each child may make one trip to and one trip from school per day.
       3.62.4. The dominant user coordinates transportation arrangements to minimize
       transportation resources involving more than one DOD installation.
       3.62.5. The walking distance between residence and school or between residence and
       designated bus stop is established for dependent children by the local public school
       authority.
       3.62.6. To make connections with a regular means of transportation, children may use
       available, regularly scheduled DOD transportation within and between installations when
       they travel to and from school. Similarly, provide special transportation within the
50                                        AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


     installation if this will serve to make schools accessible by a regular means of
     transportation.
     3.62.7. Develop written agreements that specify the services and support provided
     (include reimbursement procedures) to local education agencies when it is necessary for
     the Air Force to provide transportation for dependents to public schools or to schools
     operated on DOD installations.
     3.62.8. Credit reimbursement costs to applicable appropriations. Reimbursement costs
     consist of all costs of operations, maintenance, depreciation of equipment, and
     compensation costs of the drivers directly engaged in providing the service. DOD
     7000.14-R (Volume 11A), DOD Financial Management Regulation, governs
     reimbursement.
        3.62.8.1. For civilian drivers, compute the compensation cost on the basis of their
        gross payroll compensation, plus a factor of 29-percent of their gross payroll
        compensation for fringe benefits.
        3.62.8.2. For military operators, compute the compensation cost on the basis of the
        reimbursement rates for military personnel accelerated by the factors specified by the
        local finance officer.
     3.62.9. Transportation may be provided to private or parochial schools within a
     reasonable distance when:
        3.62.9.1. The private school is not accessible by a regular means of transportation
        and private school transportation, (either with or without cost to the member) is not
        available; and the parent of a child submits a written request for transportation to the
        head of the installation (do not approve requests to avoid transportation costs to the
        member).
     3.62.10. The installation commander or designee may approve transportation support
     when one of the following conditions exists:
        3.62.10.1. The public schools available in the locality are inadequate for the
        educational welfare of the children concerned. An adequate education is considered
        one that meets the State certification and regional accreditation requirements.
        3.62.10.2. The vehicle used for transporting dependent children to public schools has
        extra space and can transport the child attending private or parochial schools without
        materially deviating from the established route.
        3.62.10.3. The DOD installation is so remotely located that the private school is not
        accessible by regular means of transportation.
        3.62.10.4. Upon validation of student transportation requirements by the installation
        commander:
            3.62.10.4.1. Military in-house transportation resources must be used to the
            maximum extent possible.
            3.62.10.4.2. If funds are available, installation commanders may authorize
            commercial transportation when in-house transportation resources are not
            available. Each commercial contract must contain an agreement by the contractor
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            51


             to furnish the service without discrimination on the grounds of race, creed, color,
             sex, or national origin. The MAJCOM or FOA Logistics Readiness Division
             must approve all requests and subsequent changes.
             3.62.10.4.3. Use vehicles for other official transportation needs when not
             transporting students.
             3.62.10.4.4. Normally, military transportation using part-time drivers is used
             except when it is more economical to use commercial contract transportation
             services, based on comparative cost analysis of in-house versus commercial
             contract school bus service.
             3.62.10.4.5. Exceptions to General Policy: The installation or community
             commander may make exceptions to the school routes when the existing route is
             through areas of heavy traffic, blighted urban or residential districts, or potentially
             dangerous construction, industrial areas, or during severe weather conditions. All
             other exceptions require SECAF approval. The installation commander must
             send requests, with full justification, through the MAJCOM or FOA Logistics
             Readiness Division to HQ USAF/A4L.

Section 3Q— General and Administrative Procedures for Transporting Dependent School
Children in Overseas Areas

3.63. Transporting Dependent School Children in Overseas Areas: These policies apply to
all students attending DOD-operated or non-DOD schools located outside the United States.
      3.63.1. Authority: The Secretary of Defense may establish and operate a program to
      provide a free public education, through secondary schools, for dependents in overseas
      areas per Title 20 U. S. C. Section 921, Defense Dependents Education System. This
      authorization includes the provision of any necessary incidental services.
      3.63.2. Commuting Area: The DOD Education Activity (DODEA) Area Transportation
      Management Office establishes a commuting area to determine eligibility for
      transportation at each Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DODDS) school. This
      area is based on availability of adequate housing within the proximity of the school,
      DODEA commuting distance policy, and available resources. Elapsed travel time from
      the farthest point within the commuting area should not exceed 1-hour unless waived by
      the Chief, DODEA Area Transportation Management Office. The commuting area does
      not have to be equidistant in all directions from the school, nor must it be as far as 1-hour
      commuting time if sufficient and adequate housing is available within a closer distance.
      If a locality otherwise within the commuting area has difficult or unsafe access (e.g.,
      during the winter), it should be excluded from the commuting area.
          3.63.2.1. The installation or community commander will give the commuting area
          widespread publicity during incoming personnel processing, Housing Referral Officer
          visits, sponsor pro-grams, etc., so every sponsor is well informed before looking for
          family housing.
          3.63.2.2. The installation or community commander will ensure that all incoming
          sponsors certify in writing that they are aware of the commuting area and understand
          that, if they choose to live in housing outside the commuting area, they are
52                                         AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


        responsible for transportation of dependent students between their home and the
        school or an existing stop within the commuting area.
     3.63.3. Walking Area: The DODEA Area Transportation Management Office also
     establishes a walking area for each school. Normally, walking distance to a school or bus
     stop should not exceed 1 mile for students in kindergarten to grade 6 and 1.5 miles for
     students in grades 7-12. Walking areas are expanded and contracted to conform to the
     natural boundaries such as a housing area, neighborhood, etc. Do not provide
     transportation to students within the walking area except for students with disabilities
     when required by their Individual Education Plan (IEP).
     3.63.4. Authorized Transportation: In many areas, the DODEA Area Transportation
     Management Office manages school bus service. The following policies apply where the
     AIR FORCE provides school bus services.
        3.63.4.1. DOD Operated Schools:
            3.63.4.1.1. Provide one round-trip between family residential areas and DODDS
            schools for dependent students who reside outside the walking area and within the
            commuting area (or who are transported at the sponsor’s expense to an existing
            bus stop within the commuting area) of a DODDS school. Do not provide a
            second round trip to/from home for lunch. Establish centrally located school bus
            stops in the area of student residences and/or alternate care providers, such as a
            Child Development Center within the commuting area. Provide curb-to-curb
            service only for students with disabilities when required by their IEP.
            3.63.4.1.2. Provide commuting transportation to non-federally connected space-
            available students on existing routes only if space is available on the route(s) to be
            used. Do not provide commuter passes or bus tickets instead of transportation in
            kind to non-federally connected students.
            3.63.4.1.3. Provide transportation to students participating in school-sponsored
            educational activities such as field trips if vehicles and operators are available and
            support will not conflict with mission support requirements.
            3.63.4.1.4. Provide transportation for students participating in voluntary after-
            school activities (e.g., sports programs) from the school to a limited number of
            central locations, such as major housing areas and public transportation terminals,
            as approved by school officials and subject to the availability of funds, vehicles,
            and drivers.
            3.63.4.1.4.1. Transport of DoDDS sports teams and groups to airports and train
            stations for overnight/multiple day trips will fall under DoD Terminal
            Transportation rules identified in DoD 4500-36r, C2.5.3.2.
        3.63.4.2. Non-DOD Schools:
            3.63.4.2.1. Students who attend a non-DOD school at DOD expense and who
            reside beyond the walking distance of the non-DOD school shall use
            transportation provided or arranged by the non-DOD school when included as
            part of the tuition fee. When non-DOD schools do not provide transportation, or
            when the cost of providing transportation is charged separately, the Chief,
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                       53


            DODDS Area Service Center, will determine the proper transportation.
            3.63.4.2.2. Provide transportation to dependent students of DOD military or
            civilian personnel who attend non-DOD schools in overseas areas at no expense
            to the U.S. Government only when such attendance has been approved by the
            DODDS Area Superintendent.
        3.63.4.3. Special Education Transportation: Place special emphasis on meeting the
        transportation needs of students with disabilities. The installation must provide
        equitable transportation to these students. The Chief, DODEA Area Transportation
        Management Office, after consultation with the base LRS commander, will determine
        the most cost effective method of transporting students with disabilities (e.g.,
        conventional GMVs, modification of existing government vehicles, lease, or contract
        support).
            3.63.4.3.1. Provide commuting transportation to special education students who
            reside within walking distance of the school or bus stop or at any distance within
            the commuting area, when the nature of their handicap so dictates, as documented
            in the IEP.
            3.63.4.3.2. Provide any special transportation services prescribed by the Case
            Study Committee (CSC) of the receiving school. Examples of special services
            include, but are not limited to, curb-to-curb service, a special bus stop within an
            IEP-specified distance of the student’s residence, use of special harness or child
            seat, transportation of a seeing eye or hearing dog, or a one-on-one safety
            attendant for medically fragile or physically aggressive children.
            3.63.4.3.3. Ensure that all vehicles transporting special education students are
            equipped with a seat belt for each passenger.
            3.63.4.3.4. Provide a safety attendant who is trained to assist students with
            disabilities for all vehicles transporting more than two special education students
            or transporting any student requiring a special four point harness. Ensure that
            vehicles used to transport students who normally use wheelchairs are equipped
            with a lifting device or ramp which can be secured to the vehicle and are equipped
            with approved wheelchair restraining devices. Note: Before providing
            transportation to special education students for whom a safety attendant is
            required, the VOCC supervisor and the vehicle operator must ensure trained
            personnel are available to accompany those students during travel.
     3.63.5. Transportation Resources: Students shall be transported at the lowest practical
     cost to the U.S. Government.
        3.63.5.1. Periodic Review: The DODEA Area Transportation Management Office
        will analyze transportation services a minimum of every 6-months, in coordination
        with the base LRS commander. Analysis will include a thorough review of student
        demand, school bus routes, and schedules, and will consider the following factors:
            3.63.5.1.1. Staggering school operating hours to permit buses to operate multiple
            trips per day.
            3.63.5.1.2. Altering school organization plans and establishing flexible school
54                                     AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


        boundaries to maximize transportation resources.
        3.63.5.1.3. Consolidating school closures for administrative activities (meetings,
        training, conferences, etc.) to avoid half-day sessions and scheduling these
        activities to coincide with host nations’ holidays whenever possible.
        3.63.5.1.4. Developing routes and schedules to optimize the use of buses and
        seating capacity and to reduce total mileage and driving time. Use the projected
        number of space-required students as the basis for routes. Do not use larger
        capacity vehicles to accommodate space-available students or other ineligible
        passengers.
        3.63.5.1.5. Allowing students in kindergarten through grade 6 to ride three to a
        bench seat on trips of 30-minutes or less.
        3.63.5.1.6. Using part time employees for in-house operations whenever possible.
        3.63.5.1.7. Requiring students in grades 7-12 to use regular public or DOD
        transportation (e.g., base shuttle buses) where available, feasible, and cost-
        efficient. DODDS would reimburse for this service if student use resulted in
        direct costs increase to the military.
     3.63.5.2. Economic Cost Analysis: Determine the most economical means of
     providing school bus services through in-depth comparative analysis of in-house to
     contract operations. Analysis must consider the overall cost to the Government of
     providing school bus transportation with DOD vehicles. Use commercial contract
     vendors to provide transportation support to DODDS schools when it is determined to
     be more economical. Otherwise, use military transportation, with part-time drivers
     when possible. Integrate school busing with other installation mass transportation
     functions whenever reasonable to do so. Include equipment acquisition costs as a
     factor in the cost analysis. However, DODDS shall not be required to reimburse the
     Air Force for government-owned equipment, acquisition costs, or amortization of
     these equipment costs, or for lease, rental, or other equipment usage costs when the
     underlying cost analysis has indicated that the leased equipment is less costly than the
     government-owned equipment. Conduct an economic cost analysis in accordance
     with DOD Instruction 7041.3, Economic Analysis for Decision Making, under any of
     the following circumstances:
        3.63.5.2.1. When arranging for initial transportation services to a new school or
        before changing from existing military transportation to contract transportation.
        3.63.5.2.2. When the number of contractors is insufficient to ensure competitive
        bids for transportation services to schools currently serviced by contract
        transportation.
        3.63.5.2.3. When requested by the Chief, DODEA Area Transportation
        Management Office.
     3.63.5.3. Proposed Changes to Services: Installation commanders shall coordinate
     with the Chief, DODEA Area Transportation Management Office, on any significant
     proposed change to school bus services. The concurrence of the Chief, Area
     Transportation Management Office, or designee, shall be obtained before
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      55


        implementing any such change. All documentation associated with the provision of
        school bus services, e.g., cost studies, solicitation packages and amendments thereto,
        shall be provided to DODDS upon request.
     3.63.6. Bus Safety and Security:
        3.63.6.1. Student Conduct: The DODEA has developed standards of behavior for
        students riding school buses and guidelines for disciplinary actions when students
        misbehave on buses.
            3.63.6.1.1. Installation commanders must ensure that students and their parents,
            guardians, and sponsors know what the standards of student behavior aboard
            school buses are before the school year begins. School bus riding is a privilege,
            which may be withdrawn if a student misbehaves.
            3.63.6.1.2. At bases where the installation commander has retained primary
            responsibility for school buses passenger management, the commander will apply
            guidelines established by DODEA to ensure consequences of misconduct are
            applied equitably throughout overseas areas.
        3.63.6.2. Safety Reviews: Installation commanders must conduct periodic safety
        reviews a minimum of every 6-months of school buses and loading and unloading
        areas. Ensure that any contracts for school bus services contain a provision
        permitting similar safety reviews of contractor vehicles and services.
        3.63.6.3. School Bus Monitors: Do not hire, or contract for, school bus monitors to
        maintain order on the bus except where required by host nation statute. However,
        communities may provide school bus monitors on a volunteer basis.
        3.63.6.4. Safety Attendants: The Chief, DODEA Area Transportation Management
        Office, may authorize school bus safety attendants for vehicles transporting special
        education students or vehicles transporting only kindergarten through grade 2
        students. Duties of a safety attendant are to ensure that children enter and exit the
        school buses safely and/or to assist students with disabilities. Normally, only one
        adult other than the driver shall be assigned to a vehicle. Where drivers speak
        English, safety attendants are authorized only when required for special education
        buses.
        3.63.6.5. Security Personnel: When the installation commander deems that local
        conditions jeopardize the security of school bus services, the commander may place
        appropriately trained security personnel aboard those buses. Security personnel will
        not concern themselves with passenger conduct. DODDS funds will not be used for
        this purpose.
        3.63.6.6. Contingency Plans: Installation commanders shall work with appropriate
        DODDS officials to develop and publish contingency plans for transporting students.
        Ensure that overall base contingency plans for natural disaster, bomb threat, etc.
        include DODDS schools and student transportation.
     3.63.7. Exceptions for Commuting Area or Walking Distance: The Chief, DODEA Area
     Transportation Management Office, may grant exceptions to the commuting area or
     walking distance criteria after considering circumstances and alternatives. Requests for
56                                         AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


     exceptions are initiated by the installation or community commander, endorsed by the
     local concerned principal and the DODDS District Superintendent and forwarded to the

                         ELEMENT MANPOWER MANAGEMENT

Section 4A— General Information and Administration

4.1. Overview: Manpower and its effective use is an inherent responsibility of the DSS. The
use of accurate manpower/workload data collection procedures and personnel productivity
analysis is vital to the effective utilization of personnel and maximizing the level of service to the
customer.
4.2. Air Force Manpower Standards (AFMS): The primary workload factors for Vehicle
Operations manpower is number of vehicles authorized to Vehicle Operations. The base
population is the second workload factor for those functions responsible for Documented Cargo
operations. Core manpower requirements represent work processes common to all Vehicle
Operations and are outlined in a process oriented description. Variances are additives that
provide additional manpower to support unique work processes not covered by the core. This
information is derived from the AFMS 42A1, which should be available at every element.
Management will ensure all supervisory personnel are familiar with content and methodology
used to earn Vehicle Operations manpower. Reviewing the AFMS Statement of Conditions,
Process Oriented Description, Approved Variances, and Process Analysis Summary is the first
step in determining the expected level of customer service, identifying potential variances, and
measuring the element’s ability to support mission demands.
4.3. Indirect Workloads: Indirect work involves those tasks that are not readily identifiable
with the work center’s specific product or service. The major categories of standard indirect
work are: Administers Civilian, Officer, and Enlisted Personnel; Directs Work Center Activity;
Provides Administrative Support; Prepares for and Conducts/Attends Meetings; Administers
Training; Manages Supplies; Maintains Equipment; and Performs Cleanup. See AFMS 00AA,
Standard Indirect Description.
4.4. Workload Data Collection and Productivity: The accuracy of workload data entered in
the OLVIMS Dispatch Module is critical to assessing productivity, substantiating existing
manpower variances, and building historical data to support potential manpower variances. A
minimum of 12-months historical workload data will be maintained on file. At a minimum,
collect the following data monthly for 12-months retention.
   4.4.1. Manpower Report (automated):
   4.4.2. Summary of work by module category codes; i.e., number of requests supported and
   total in-service time in man-hours.
   4.4.3. Summary of work for approved driving-related variances i.e., number of requests
   supported and total in-service time in man-hours. Include purpose, submission for new
   variances, data required, etc.
   4.4.4. All requests not supported for reasons of NMA or NVA categories. Note: Requests
   not supported due to NMA/NVA must be documented within the OLVIMS Dispatch
   Module.

  4.4.5. Current Unit Manpower Document: The Unit Manpower Document (UMD) displays
  the number and type of manpower requirements for your unit by grade, AFSC, etc.
     4.4.5.1. UMDs contain authorization (funded), peacetime (required), authorized
     (unfunded), CMEs (Contract Manpower Equivalents), and wartime plan manpower
     positions. Line entries contain all the vital information concerning each manpower space
     such as grade, AFSC, rated position identifiers, special experience identifier, position
     number, etc. The UMD reflects authorized positions only, it does not show the personnel
     assigned. The UMD is the single source for information about authorizations
     (manpower) each unit has been allocated to perform its mission. The UMD contains
     unique abbreviations and codes that depict relevant data pertinent to the unit.
     Recognition, identification, and proper use of these codes are vital to effective vehicle
     operations manpower management.
     4.4.5.2. UMDs are produced from a database called the Manpower Programming and
     Execution System (MPES), maintained by Manpower and Organization (FSS/FSMM)
     and your MAJCOM/A1M staff. Changes are distributed to units in the form of
     Authorization Change Notices (ACNs). UMD authorization changes are inputted by
     Manpower and Organization and forwarded to the MAJCOM/A1M staff for coordination
     with the applicable MFM. If the MFM approves the change, the MAJCOM/A1M staff
     processes the change for update to the UMD in MPES. Manpower and Organization
     forwards a copy of the approval/disapproval notice to the requesting unit. Review all
     UMDs to ensure you understand the changes made to your unit’s manpower
     authorizations.
     4.4.5.3. Budgetary constraints affect authorized manpower. Military and Civilian
     Personnel Flights assign personnel based on authorized manpower positions. A grade
     imbalance between authorized and required manpower occurs as a result of the Career
     Progression Group (CPG) program, or limits on total military grades. For example, only
     one percent of the total enlisted force is Chief Master Sergeants. HQ USAF implements
     Congressional grade constraints by creating CPG factors for each AFSC. MAJCOMs are
     limited to the grades derived by applying these factors to the total number of positions
     authorized within the appropriate AFSC. This can result in an insufficient number of
     grades to ideally perform all work requirements, especially from a command perspective.
     Nonetheless, MAJCOMs are restricted to the number of authorized grades derived.
     Command functional managers distribute grades based on priority of need. Grade
     imbalances are determined by comparing the authorized (funded) grade (GRD) to the
     peacetime (required) grade (RGR). If the authorized grade is lower than the peacetime
     required grade, you have a grade imbalance.
     4.4.5.4. The UMD reflects required manpower; it does not provide information about the
     individual(s) filling the authorized position. Personnel assigned are depicted on the Unit
     Personnel Management Roster (UPMR). Questions concerning assigned individuals or
     requests for additional personnel to fill existing authorizations should be referred to the
     Military or Civilian Personnel Flights.
     4.4.5.5. Many of the codes on ACNs, Authorization Change Requests (ACRs), and
     UMD products are not used in the day-to-day management of manpower resources. The
     attachments at the end of the AFMS contains definitions for some of the terms,
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      59


     abbreviations, acronyms, and data field items to aid in understanding the various codes
     on manpower products. Contact Manpower and Organization Office for information
     relating to specific data elements and their meanings.
  4.4.6. Current UPMR: The UPMR is a cross between an alpha roster and the UMD. It
  shows the authorized positions with the associated information such as Pos #, DAFSC, Auth
  Grade, FAC, PAS, required Security Clearance, and RPI codes. The UPMR also shows who
  is assigned to each position with personnel data items including: Name, SSAN, assigned
  DAFSC, PAFSC, CAFSC, 2AFSC, current Grade, ETS, Excess/Overgrade codes (if
  applicable), Technician ID, etc. This document highlights any mismatches between what is
  authorized for each position and what the position incumbent has for assigned data. Each
  position is authorized one incumbent, however under some circumstances a second
  individual could be assigned to a position for a limited period of time. This is known as an
  “excess” condition. In situations where the incumbent position is graded higher than what is
  authorized by his/her position an over-grade situation occurs.

                                 ELEMENT BUDGETING

Section 5A— General Information and Administration

5.1. Developing an Element Budget: Develop and support budget estimates for facilities,
personnel, and vehicles IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and
Volume 2, Budget Management for Operations. At a minimum, elements will develop an annual
Financial Plan (FP) to ensure adequate funding is established and included in the Commanders
Statement (Section I) of the FP. This statement includes assumptions, statements on force
changes, mission changes, equipment changes, conversions, and any other changes that will
affect financial requirements. It also addresses unique problems and states the impact of
operating at the level of effort provided in the approved baseline program. Financial
Management sections may appoint specific managers for budgeting IAW section 2.10. that
states, “fixed responsibilities when possible; The commander is ultimately responsible for
formulating and executing the financial plan. Identify other managers with their specific
financial management responsibilities e.g., the civil engineer with real property maintenance
and repair, the transportation officer with vehicle and transportation requirements.”
5.2. Financial Plan: The Element Supervisor (ES) provides budgetary data to unit leadership
for inclusion in the LRS annual budget inputs. The FP may include the items listed in Table 5.1
(list is not all-inclusive). Element of Expense and Investment Codes (EEIC) are added for your
benefit. Consult with your local resource advisor to determine most current and appropriate
EEIC.

5.3. Additional Funding Venues: Additional funds can be sought for end of year purchases
through local “fallout” procedures and/or unfunded requests. Your squadron/group Resource
Advisor (RA) can assist with these.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                         61


5.4. Financial Obligations with Support Agreements: Support Agreements are used to
identify support responsibilities between parties involved, to include financial obligations. The
EC will assign priorities and services detailed in the agreement in accordance with AFI 25-201,
Support Agreement Procedures. AFI 65-601v1, also contains guidance for budgeting and
reimbursement guidance.
   5.4.1. Reimbursements should be sought from these agreements based on the arrangement.
   The EC will act as a technical advisor when host-tenant agreements are being made.
   5.4.2. Support Agreement services must be reimbursable for all non-host Wing units and
   Medical Group (MDG) support for services above the standard base operating support (BOS)
   provided to all base users, e.g., base shuttle and government taxi service.
5.5. Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI) Program: Includes Fast Payback
Capital Investment (FASCAP) and the Productivity Investment Fund (PIF) programs. FASCAP
can be used for projects up to $200,000 and PIF for projects exceeding $200,000 where other
funding is not authorized or allocated. For example, the 3080 program can be used for major
equipment purchases like car washing systems, building renovations, etc. For additional
information refer to AFI 38-301, Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment Programs and
AFPD 38-3, Productivity Enhancing Capital Investment (PECI) Programs.
5.6. Liaison with Squadron RA: Maintaining a close rapport with the LRS RA will facilitate
sound financial management programs.
5.7. Government Purchase Card (GPC) Program: Normally Vehicle Operations will have
GPC holders as part of the VOCC Support Section. This person should be the primary
cardholder. Refer to AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card Program, for
additional guidance.

  requirements.
  6.3.3. Coordinates with unit VCOs for vehicle forecasting and rescheduling.
     6.3.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Unit commanders may appoint a liaison to coordinate unit
     transportation needs when the squadron does not have a VCO/VCNCO program. Submit
     appointment letters to local VOCC.
  6.3.4. If a 24-hour operation, acts as single point of contact for the squadron during other
  than normal duty hours. In the event of an emergency, the VOCC dispatcher will:
     6.3.4.1. Notify the LRS commander of simulated or actual disasters or other emergency
     incidents.
     6.3.4.2. Record the sequence of action and events.
     6.3.4.3. Use GeoBase/Grid Map systems to determine vehicle, personnel, and installation
     situational awareness and plotting requirements.
         6.3.4.3.1. Use grid coordinate techniques on base/locally manufactured maps and/or
         the Military Grid Reference System as outlined in AFMAN 24-306. These mapping
         techniques can be used for day-to-day operations or for deployed environments.
         6.3.4.3.2. GeoBase, according to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site
         Planning, is an Air Force initiative to attain, maintain, and sustain geospatial
         infrastructure supporting all installation requirements. GeoBase systems are normally
         housed on the installation secure network. It consists of three dimensions used for
         various base functions:
             6.3.4.3.2.1. GeoReach and Expeditionary Basing provides a Common Installation
             Picture (CIP) using information acquired from intelligence sources and assists
             with various planning aspects such as aircraft parking, munitions storage, and
             other beddown force requirements.
             6.3.4.3.2.2. IGESP, formerly Base Support Planning, was primarily developed for
             locations with a permanent Air Force presence. This collaborative planning effort
             was established with a deliberate planning timeline. The term IGESP describes
             all plans developed to meet deliberate planning requirements, contingency
             planning requirements, and any other site planning requirements.
             6.3.4.3.2.3. In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning Committee (IGESPC): A
             planning body appointed by the installation commander to develop the base site
             plan (normally comprised of senior level leadership). The IGESPC is the focal
             point for plan development and reports to the commander on the status of plan
             development and implementation.        It integrates the numerous base-level
             requirements and functional support actions to present a coordinated overview of
             activity within the committee. This committee was formerly known as the Base
             Support Planning Committee (BSPC).
     6.3.4.4. Identify and reroute dispatched operators away from areas affected by simulated
     or actual emergencies.

  6.3.5. Effectively communicates using all authorized communication devices (e.g., two-way
  radios and telephones). Radios are primary means of communication between the VOCC
  and dispatched operators. The 10-Series codes are described in Chapter 9.
  6.3.6. Notifies all sections and dispatched operators of weather warnings.
     6.3.6.1. Records all pertinent information such as thunderstorms, lightning, strong
     surface winds, heavy rains, and freezing precipitation, etc.
     6.3.6.2. Up channels requests to leadership to terminate or curtail operations when
     driving conditions deteriorate.

                         DOCUMENTED CARGO OPERATIONS

Section 7A— General Information and Administration

7.1. Responsibilities: Vehicle Operations is responsible for all Documented Cargo services
(except Due-In for Maintenance (DIFM) turn-ins) within the confines of the installation.
Documented Cargo will include delivery of supplies and equipment, except base service store
items, to base units by using a Time Definite Delivery (TDD) concept. TDD concept of
operations is the standard for delivery of supplies, equipment, and cargo. It utilizes scheduled
sweeps over designated routes/areas of the installation. Frequency of scheduled sweeps and
number of delivery routes/areas is a local determination driven by mission, volume of cargo, and
customer needs. Vehicle Operations will tailor sweep frequencies/routes to provide support for
primary mission of the installation/base. Delivery frequencies/routes should minimize the need
for individual unit delivery requirements.
   7.1.1. Establish OI(s) for Documented Cargo processes and items that require special
   handling instructions/procedures (e.g., classified, health hazard, pilferable, electrostatic
   discharge).
   7.1.2. Assist Materiel Management Flight (MMF) Document Control section in resolving
   document errors generated in the cargo movements. MMF is the overall OPR for all delivery
   document issues.
       7.1.2.1. MMF will provide the Documented Cargo section with copies of delivery
       destinations, unit POCs, and the Classified Receipt Listing. Documented Cargo will
       ensure current copies are on-hand.
           7.1.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Classified Receipt Listing. The Vehicle Operations
           Element (VOE) will work with the Materiel Management Flight (MMF) to ensure the
           Classified Receipt Listing identifies only those vehicle operators (2T1s) authorized to
           receive, handle, and transport classified assets. The MMF will be notified within 24
           hours or next duty day when a vehicle operator’s clearance eligibility and/or access
           level is downgraded or changed (e.g., loss of clearance, name change, etc.), as
           designated by the unit commander or proper authority (e.g., Security Forces Squadron
           or Unit Security Manager).
           7.1.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) A statement certifying all personnel on the list have
           received annual Information Security training and the date of training for each
           member listed.
           7.1.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) A statement certifying all personnel have read this
           supplement and the AFI 24-301 mandated Documented Cargo operating instruction
           detailing the handling instructions and movement procedures for classified
           items/cargo
           7.1.2.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) A statement certifying all personnel on the list have
           been trained IAW the most current AFGSC2T1JQS-001.
68                                         AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


     7.1.2.2. When SATS is in use, the smart card contains most of this information; however
     in the event SATS is unavailable, hard copy documents containing this information will
     be required.
  7.1.3. Notify MMF immediately of all unnecessary delays caused by the absence of
  receiving personnel, incorrect addresses, organizational refusal, improper documentation, etc.
  Items precluded from delivery due to these circumstances will be returned to MMF for
  resolution and included on the next scheduled sweep or may be picked up from MMF by the
  customer.
  7.1.4. Ensure all dispatchers and operators are briefed on established procedures to properly
  dispatch and document cargo movements, to include processes for classified materiel
  handling.
     7.1.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Pre-movement procedures. Prior to dispatching an operator
     to move classified materials/assets, the dispatcher will refer to the Vehicle Operations
     Classified Receipt Listing and ensure the operator is certified to move classified
     materials. The dispatcher and operator will follow local procedures. The dispatcher will
     ensure the operator has an updated Classified Receipt Listing on their person prior to
     dispatching the operator for a classified movement.
     7.1.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Movement Procedures.                 Operators will check all
     documentation to verify the classification of the asset/material prior to handling the item.
     The operator will also ensure the paperwork is properly marked IAW the classification of
     the item. After picking up the item, the operator assumes full responsibility for the
     security of the classified asset and must maintain 100% positive control. At no time will
     the operator leave the item unattended or out of sight. The dispatcher or operator will
     call the unit to receive the classified item to ensure someone on the classified listing is
     and available to receive the item prior to delivering the item. The operator will proceed
     directly to the drop off point for the package.
     7.1.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) VOCC/Documented Cargo supervisor along with the
     destination unit will determine by name and Classified Receipt Listing, who will receive
     the classified item(s). Any change to this upon delivery of the classified item will be
     coordinated with VOCC/Documented Cargo Supervisor prior to leaving the item with
     another individual. A Classified Receipt Listing will be utilized in any case.
     7.1.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Delivery Procedures. Operators will ensure the item is
     delivered to the correct individual/organization as identified by the VOCC and the
     originator. Upon delivery, the operator will use the MMF Classified Receipt Listing to
     verify the person receiving the package is authorized to sign/receive classified materials
     for that unit.
     7.1.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) Operators will annotate the name, rank, duty phone and
     organization/office symbol of the person signing for the classified material and report that
     information to the dispatcher upon returning to VOCC.
     7.1.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) A copy of the paperwork will be retained for deliveries when
     Enterprise Solution Supply (ES-S) is not being used (e.g., DD Form 1348-1A, Issue
     Release/Receipt Document or DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping
     Document). Operators will ensure that name, rank, duty phone, and organization/office
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          69


       symbol of the person signing for the material is annotated on the DD Form 1348-1A, and
       copy 2 is given to Documented Cargo and/or VOCC upon return.
       7.1.4.7. (Added-AFGSC) Documented Cargo.              When performing classified
       Documented Cargo operations, operators will carry the Classified Receipt Listing at all
       times, regardless of whether or not the AMS is used.
       7.1.4.8. (Added-AFGSC) The Documented Cargo Supervisor will coordinate with the
       MMF to ensure the Classified Receipt Listing is the most current listing available.
           7.1.4.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) The AFI 24-301-mandated Documented Cargo OI will
           reference this supplement.
   7.1.5. Attend periodic meetings between DDF, MMF, and major customers to ensure
   delivery schedules/sweeps meet mission priorities and customer needs.
   7.1.6. Priority cargo, to include Priority 01 and MICAPs, will be delivered as soon as
   possible (goal is within 30 minutes). MMF is responsible for notifying Vehicle Operations
   when these priorities are ready for delivery (placed on the shelf). Exception: Scheduled
   sweeps may be used if delivery will meet customer requirements. LRS commanders, in
   conjunction with the DSS, will determine scheduled sweep delivery times/durations based on
   local need.
   7.1.7. Priority items/parts resulting from due-out release (DORs) will be delivered via
   scheduled sweeps, unless VOCC is contacted for an unscheduled delivery.

Section 7B—Documented Cargo Operations Responsibilities and Authorities

7.2. Services: Documented Cargo services will be supported out of the VOCC to the maximum
extent possible. However, LRS and/or Vehicle Operations leadership may establish alternate
locations (sub-motor pools) to support Documented Cargo services if local mission dictates this
to be the most effective, efficient means of support. If alternate locations are established, they
will be staffed using existing manpower authorizations. Minimize batch processing in OLVIMS
Dispatch Module of Documented Cargo workload data to the maximum extent possible.
7.3. Documented Cargo Movements:
   7.3.1. Intra-MMF movement of cargo will remain an MMF responsibility. However,
   movement of cargo from MMF storage/issue locations to the Aircraft Part Stores (APS) and
   Flight Service Centers (FSC) will be supported by Vehicle Operations.
   7.3.2. The movement of DIFM turn-in items will be supported and managed by the MMF
   FSC. DIFM issues will be handled in the same manner as other MILitary STandard
   Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) cargo and will be supported by Vehicle
   Operations.
   7.3.3. Movement of cargo internal to a unit e.g., maintenance squadrons, civil engineer,
   communication squadron, operations squadrons, will remain a unit responsibility. This does
   not preclude Vehicle Operations from providing normal cargo movement support when the
   unit does not have the capability to move such item(s).
 70                                          AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


   7.3.4. Residual workload (e.g., sorting and staging of cargo, facilitation of customer
   requirements) will remain the MMF responsibility. MMF will presort cargo to accommodate
   established sweep/route schedules.
   7.3.5. Customers supported by the flightline parts store regardless of location are responsible
   for pickup of their procured items. Vehicle Operations will only deliver items to customers
   that are not normally supported by a flightline parts store.

Section 7C—General Responsibilities and Authorities

7.4. MMF Responsibilities: Retains primary responsibility for facilitating communication
between MMF elements, customers, and Vehicle Operations. TDD concept of operations is the
prime method for all cargo delivery (i.e. scheduled sweeps). MMF will inform Vehicle
Operations of priority deliveries (01 and MICAP), identification of turn-in requirements, and
notification of special equipment needs for bulk cargo distribution, etc.
   7.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) MMF will inform Vehicle Operations for Priority deliveries (and
   MICAP only when customer is citing work stoppage), identification of turn-in requirements,
   and notification of special equipment needs for bulk cargo distribution, etc.
7.5. SATS: Used in concert with Documented Cargo requirements. Deployment of SATS is
not a prerequisite to establishing Documented Cargo services. MMF is responsible for all SATS
hardware (i.e. warranty, maintenance, and replacement), accountability, and issue of SATS
equipment to operators.
7.6. Defense Reutilization Marketing Services (DRMS) Support: Formerly known as the
Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO). VOCC/Documented Cargo section delivers
shipments/materials to DRMS generated from the Cargo Movement Element or MMF. This
includes directed and non-directed (lateral) shipments originating from FSC and APS to the
Cargo Movement Element, Outbound Freight Section.
7.7. Non-MILSTRIP Cargo: Provide support for non-MILSTRIP cargo when units do not
have the capability to move the cargo. This includes all unit-level GPC purchases.

                   OPERATOR RECORDS AND LICENSING (OR&L)

Section 8A— General Information and Administration

8.1. Policy: Air Force motor vehicles shall only be operated by military, civilian employees,
approved civilian contractors, and NAF employees who meet all criteria of this instruction.
   8.1.1. The Vehicle Operations EC or Supervisor (or person designated, in-writing, by LRS
   commander as the authentication official) is the installation licensing authority. All
   exceptions to this licensing policy must be approved by HQ USAF/A4LE. Note: ANG and
   AFR units operating their own LRS or transportation functions may operate their own
   licensing function in accordance with this instruction.
   8.1.2. Public Law 99-570, The Federal Employee Substance Abuse Education and Treatment
   Act of 1986, and The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 were signed into law to
   improve highway safety (by ensuring large truck and bus operators are qualified to operate
   those vehicles) and to remove unsafe and unqualified drivers from the highways. The Act
   established minimum national standards for licensing drivers and requires testing and
   licensing standards for truck and bus drivers to check a person's ability to operate those
   vehicles. All active duty military drivers were waived from the CDL requirements by the
   Federal Highway Administrator. However, military GMV training, qualification and
   certification will remain the same. At state discretion, firefighter or other civilian equivalent
   emergency response vehicles, farm vehicles, and drivers removing snow and ice in small
   communities can be waived from the CDL requirements. Contact your local DMV for any
   CDL or waiver requirements for off-base operations.
   8.1.3. Air Force Academy cadets are authorized to operate Air Force vehicles.
   8.1.4. ROTC cadets in their junior/senior year who are issued military identification cards on
   annual training are considered active duty military.
   8.1.5. Military or government civilians assigned to or detailed to provide support to CAP
   may operate GMVs.
   8.1.6. JROTC instructors are employees of their local school districts and not the Air Force.
   Therefore, they are not authorized to operate GMVs for those duties.
   8.1.7. Foreign military personnel may operate Air Force vehicles when on official orders
   performing temporary duty or deployed to an Air Force installation. The individual must
   present an international license and/or applicable military license issued by their military
   service. Before operating any Air Force vehicle, the vehicle operator must demonstrate
   proficiency and be briefed by the sponsoring unit on official use policies, accident reporting,
   vehicle abuse, and operator care responsibilities. Permanently assigned foreign military
   personnel may operate Air Force vehicles provided such support is approved by the
   installation commander, often by MOU or MOA, and are in compliance with other licensing
   requirements in this chapter.

8.3. Driver Records: The OR&L staff maintains active records (AF Form 2296, Vehicle
Operator Information) for all authorized operators requiring additional licensing assigned to the
installation. Operator records are retained in the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management
System (OLVIMS).
   8.3.1. When personnel transfer from one squadron/installation to another, their driver record
   must be activated by the OR&L office at the gaining base before operating a GMV.
   8.3.2. Military Members: Personnel with an AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle
   Operator Identification Card scheduled for a PCS move, retirement, or separation will
   outprocess from their servicing OR&L to retrieve their AF Form 2296. OR&L personnel
   will out process member from OLVIMS and through the vMPF. OR&L will coordinate with
   MPS, Outbound Assignments to ensure compliance.
       8.3.2.1. Civilian Employees: OR&L will coordinate with the local Civilian Personnel
       Office to obtain a listing of personnel retiring or separating to purge vehicle operator
       information files. Personnel scheduled for a PCS move, retirement, or separation will
       outprocess from their servicing OR&L to retrieve their AF Form 2296. OR&L personnel
       will out process member from OLVIMS.
       8.3.2.2. A complete purge of the system will be conducted annually. OR&L personnel
       will prepare a report for each unit identifying licensed personnel in their squadron. The
       VCO/VCNCO will verify the listing and return to OR&L for system update.
8.4. Military/Civilian Employee Licensing: Operation of AF GMVs (owned, leased or rented)
requires possession of a valid state motor vehicle license. Operation of nontactical AF GMVs
where gross vehicle weight (GVW) is less than 10,000 pounds (4x2), 11 passengers or less
requires no further licensing. Operation of all other AF GMVs (owned, leased or rented)
requires additional training and certification. This includes 4x4 vehicles, vehicles identified as 12
passengers or more to include the 15 passenger van (e.g. B192), and any tactical vehicles less
than 10,000 pounds GVW. Completion of this additional training and certification is
demonstrated on a valid AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification

Section 8B— Licensing for Military Personnel

8.5. Military Personnel: When military personnel separate from the service, they may keep
their AF Form 2293 if the words “NOT VALID-SEPARATED FROM THE SERVICE” are
over-stamped or legibly marked on the front and back of the form. See Paragraphs 8.9 and 8.10
for civilian and contractor licensing requirements.
   8.5.1. When military personnel transfer from active duty to active reserve status, the AF
   Form 2293 remains valid.
   8.5.2. Basic Military Training School or Technical Training School students whose valid
   state issued motor vehicle operator’s license expires during training, may be issued a
   temporary AF Form 2293 for a period not to exceed 45-days. A technical training instructor
   conducts vehicle training on government property. A temporary license will not be issued to
   a student with a suspended or revoked state or commercial license. Ensure the expiration
   date of the temporary permit is entered in the AF Form 2296.
   8.5.3. Only the USAF Vehicle Operator Apprentice Course may utilize “span of control” for
   training students in vehicle operations. Technical Training students in formal training may

8.13. Suspension/Revocation of GMV Operator’s Driving Privileges: Vehicle operator
driving privileges will be suspended, revoked, and reinstated using the guidance contained in
AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision. Base law enforcement activities,
acting on behalf of the installation commander, administer the program. OR&L office will keep
a separate file with the AF Forms 2293 and 2296, suspension/revocation letter, and other
applicable notes. These files will be maintained IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management
Program.
   8.13.1. Security Forces Squadron (SFS) notifies the OR&L office when individuals have
   their driving privileges suspended, revoked, or reinstated. SFS provides OR&L office the
   suspension/revocation lists.
   8.13.2. Individuals who have their driving privileges suspended or revoked must return their
   AF Form 2293 to the OR&L office. Actions causing the revocation or suspension will be
   entered in OLVIMS-DISPATCH. OR&L must contact unit commanders for the return of the
   individual license or a letter requesting a waiver to the suspension/revocation. This
   information, along with the suspended/revoked code, must be added to OLVIMS-
   DISPATCH for tracking (this includes using the memo field). OR&L will accomplish these
   actions each month.
   8.13.3. All GMV driving privileges are suspended when an individual’s authority to drive
   civilian vehicles on base is suspended. Upon reinstatement of on-base driving privileges for
   civilian vehicles, full GMV driving privileges (including off-base) will be restored (including
   reissue of the AF Form 2293) unless specifically withheld by competent authority, i.e.,
   Security Forces, individual’s commander.
   8.13.4. Unit commanders or equivalent may suspend or revoke a vehicle operator’s GMV
   driving privileges for due cause. The commander must notify the OR&L office in writing of
   this action and ensure the operator’s AF Form 2293 is returned to the OR&L section.
   8.13.5. If involved in a vehicle accident, an operator surrenders the AF Form 2293, with the
   SF 91, to the VCO. Unit commanders may reinstate the license immediately based on prima
   fascia evidence or at their discretion. All suspended licenses will be sent to OR&L office to
   preclude issue of duplicate license while suspended.
   8.13.6. Suspension for Substance Abuse: The unit commander determines if a person
   involved in substance abuse will have their GMV operating privileges suspended and
   reinstated. The commander must notify OR&L office of all suspension and reinstatement
   actions per Paragraph 8.13.4.
8.14. Restoration of Driving Privileges: While the state operator’s permit is still suspended
GMV driving privileges may be restored while personal, on-base driving privileges are
suspended (if requested by appropriate command authority). The same level of authority that
approves the GMV driving suspension must also approve the reinstatement. A copy of the
approval must be maintained in the OR&L office. An AF Form 2293 is then issued for on-base
operation only. Reinstatement in these cases is based on mission essentiality of the person
involved and a certification that the person cannot be assigned duties that do not involve driving.
8.15. Reinstatement of a State Operator’s Permit: GMV driving privileges are automatically
reinstated unless deemed inadvisable by competent command authority.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                           79


8.16. Reexamining an Operator: An operator is given a reexamination on abilities to safely
operate a vehicle when:
   8.16.1. Considered necessary by the unit commander due to an accident, evidence of abuse
   or moving violations, or a display of poor judgment or behavior.
   8.16.2. Affected by a physical impairment that results in a physical profile change as
   determined by competent medical authority. Note: Unit commanders are encouraged to
   send repeat offenders with poor judgment and behavior through Course 5 offered by Ground
   Safety.

Section 8H— Operator Certification and Administrative Responsibility

8.17. Operator Certification: The intent of the program is to ensure highly qualified operators,
vehicle operation safety, and standardized training on the installation. Vehicle Operations, TVO
Section will provide vehicle operator certification services for all personnel assigned to the
installation for specific vehicle types. Members with a CDL license for these specific vehicle
types may be excluded for vehicles covered on their CDL. This is an installation certification
program and should not be confused with a “training” program. Each unit is responsible for
providing operator training.
   8.17.1. Conduct vehicle operator certification program by:
       8.17.1.1. Establishing specific driving routes to evaluate trainees.
       8.17.1.2. Developing written tests and coordinating over-the-road routes with ground
       safety office and security forces. Use approved lesson plans, CDL study material, etc., as
       source documents to construct these tests.
       8.17.1.3. Administering written and over-the-road evaluations of trainees for general
       purpose vehicles designed to carry 16 or more passengers and all tractor/trailer
       combinations.
       8.17.1.4. MAJCOMs will issue specific program guidance for their bases.
           8.17.1.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Once a trainee has successfully tested on a category of
           vehicles, additional vehicles of that type can be added to the license without testing
           again after being trained by the unit trainer. For example, the bus test is good for all
           size buses; the tractor/trailer test is good for all combinations, etc. Normal licensing
           procedures found elsewhere in this chapter will be followed.
           8.17.1.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Each vehicle category will be certified separately with
           different written and road tests.
           8.17.1.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) TVO will maintain a log of all military and civilian
           personnel certified on assets identified in paragraph 8.17.1.4.3. for a period of 4
           years. The log will list name, rank, unit assigned, date certified, and test score
           8.17.1.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Tests will consist of a minimum of 25 questions, with
           a passing score of 75%. Over-the-road tests will be documented on a general purpose
           checklist, with key steps identified (turns, backing, coupling, speeds, proper
           inspection, etc.). A point value will be assigned to each key point. The checklist
           should correlate with the up to date plan of instruction (POI) and validate technical
 80                                          AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


          proficiency and competency. The road test will consist of proper inspection,
          coupling, movement within the confines of a training area (obstacle course), and
          over-the-road operations on-base and in the local community. Test routes should be
          designed so the trainee is fully tested on all aspects of the vehicle.
   8.17.2. A student operator will possess an AF Form 171, which serves as a learner’s permit
   and be accompanied by a vehicle trainer while driving. The AF Form 171 becomes a valid
   learner’s permit only after completing Section I, Trainee Information. Block 21 must specify
   the specific vehicle types the trainee is being trained to operate.
       8.17.2.1. If trainees fail the written or over-the-road evaluations, they will not be
       certified until sufficient training has been accomplished and trainee passes reevaluation.
       The unit trainer is required to provide additional training. OR&L staff will only
       administer the certification tests and over-the-road-evaluation.
       8.17.2.2. Upon successful completion of written and over-the-road evaluations, OR&L
       office will update the AF Form 2296 and issue an AF Form 2293. When the AF Form
       2296 is updated, the AF Form 171 is returned to the unit VCO for filing purposes. VCO
       will file returned AF Form 171 for a minimum of 1-year (See RDS: T24-03R10.00; note
       214).
       8.17.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Unit trainers will document the following statement on the
       trainee’s AF Form 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government
       Driver’s License prior to referring the trainee to the VOE for certification, "Member has
       been fully trained on the vehicle types identified and is ready for third party
       certification.”
       8.17.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) For personnel changing stations, certification will be
       transferable through the OLVIMS from their previous base. If not, the individual must be
       tested and certified. All personnel currently qualified to operate identified vehicles will
       not be required to test. However, if additional vehicles in any given category are added
       and the test has never been administered, testing and certification is required.

     construction of defensive firing positions, movement to defensive firing positions, and
     reacting to attacks. The primary duty weapon will be utilized during Phase III of CORT
     to enhance realism and familiarize students with the tools necessary to ensure mission
     accomplishment. Use Tactical Convoy Operations, AFTTP(I) 3-2.58, as a guide.
     11.7.3. The following could be some functions of Vehicle Operations in a
     deployed/contingency environment to include Military Operation Other Than War
     (MOOTW):
        11.7.3.1. Support of Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO): Includes support
        to NEO reception areas and bus transportation for the evacuation of dependents and
        personal baggage. It may also include accounting for POVs. Example: Mass
        evacuation due to terrorist threat and/or activity. This could include evacuation
        efforts in conjunction with civil authorities.
        11.7.3.2. Support of Air Base Operability (ABO) includes the movement of 2-4
        echelon medical materiel, mass casualty transportation, and transportation support of
        off-base medical staging facilities. Example: Major Accident Response Exercise
        (MARE) to support mass casualty incident requiring transportation for injured and
        wounded personnel to the nearest facility for care. Many of the functions performed
        during peace time mass casualty response closely relate to war time casualty
        movement after an attack.
     11.7.3.3. Force Support squadron support includes movement of commissary stocks for
     re-supply of protective shelters, transportation support to mortuary affairs, and supply/re-
     supply of on/off-base recovery areas. Example: Tractor-trailers transporting pallets of
     Meals-Ready-to-Eat (MREs) for shelter re-supply or crash recovery operations in support
     of mortuary affairs to secure and transport remains to storage facilities.
        11.7.3.4. Munitions support: Provide transportation support for intra-base munitions
        movements as required. Movement of hazardous materials (UXO, fuel, etc.) and
        waste, as authorized by Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) (DOD 4500.9-R).
        11.7.3.5. Support aircrew (transient and home station) transportation requirements:
        Example: Vehicle Operations provides aircrew support to all deployed aircrew as
        dictated by the expeditionary commander.
        11.7.3.6. Inter/Intra-base movement of cargo: Example: Vehicle Operations
        provides tractor-trailer service to support cargo movements during various real world
        deployments (i.e., movement of disabled vehicles to DRMS staging areas, MREs,
        inbound/outbound aircraft departures and arrivals).
        11.7.3.7. Provide transportation support to move WRM supplies and equipment for
        deployment. Example: Tractor-trailer support is provided to transport any necessary
        supplies and equipment to sustain organizational war fighting capabilities.

          11.7.3.8. Operation of MHE in support of aircraft loading and unloading operations
          beyond the capability of the air freight terminal: Support includes providing qualified
          tractor and trailer operators as necessary. Example: Vehicle Operations provides
          fully qualified tractor-trailer and MHE operators to assist the Cargo Deployment
          Function (CDF) in aircraft loading and downloading. This occurs on a regular basis
          during wing exercises and real world deployment and redeployment operations.
       11.7.3.9. Vehicle recovery operations: Collects attrition support vehicles i.e., POVs,
       AAFES vehicles, NAF, host nation provided vehicles. Retrieves disabled vehicles for
       transport to vehicle management, and provides emergency removal services to clear
       runways and access roads. Example: Most Vehicle Operations have retrieval vehicles
       within the fleet; i.e. 5-ton or rollback wreckers. Disabled vehicles are removed from the
       flightline and access areas as directed. Operators will also work closely with SFS to
       remove vehicles identified for impound.
       11.7.3.10. Supports line-haul transportation requirements: This provides vehicles and
       qualified vehicle operators as necessary to meet DOD and Air Force line-haul
       requirements. Example: Convoy operations; preparations for aircraft recovery to
       transport large amount of supplies and equipment to sustain operations at remote
       locations (see AFMAN 24-306). Line-hauling a life line of necessary supplies
       transported to sustain an installations war fighting capabilities. Operators should be
       HAZMAT and tractor-trailer qualified in order to support the mass movement of supplies
       and hazardous cargo.
          11.7.3.11. Determines critical VOCC vehicle shortfalls and reports requirements to
          the LRC. Example: VOCC will track and maintain all assigned vehicles. The
          current status of these will be tracked using OLVIMS Dispatch Module, graphs,
          letters or pictorials. Vehicle status is reported during exercise/operations as required
          by contingency checklists. Shortfalls can hamper an operations ability to sustain war
          fighting capabilities. It is very important to maintain accountability of vehicle assets
          and report information for corrective action.
          11.7.3.12. Maintain a current status on all VOCC dispersed vehicles. Example:
          SORTS report provided to Readiness monthly and/or vehicle status board in VOCC
          for tracking and quick identification.
          11.7.3.13. Operating vehicles in CWDE.
          11.7.3.14. Operating M-series vehicles such as 2.5-ton or 5-ton cargo trucks (e.g., M-
          series includes M998, M35, M923, M1098, M1114, M1116, M915, M543).

Section 11G—Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Procedures

11.8. Vehicle Operations TTPs: The following section contains specific references to vehicle
operation. TTPs incorporate best practices and solutions to mitigate consequences of Counter-
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (C-CBRN) attacks and sustain operations in C-
CBRN environments. The decision to use them depends upon the threat and conditions present
at the airbase. Include C-CBRN defense TTPs in unit or work center checklists and job guides.
The Civil Engineer Readiness and Emergency Management Flight can provide assistance on C-
CBRN defense actions and help functional area experts develop TTP to support specific
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             95


operations. TTPs in the following paragraphs do not supersede or replace requirements within
equipment technical orders. Follow established procedures for safe operations and identify
conflicts or hazards through the Air Force Technical Order System or Safety System.
       11.8.1. Contamination Avoidance: Personnel assigned duties at base/unit entry control
       points, or who perform facility and unit area entry identification and control duties, are
       critical to the success of the base and unit contamination avoidance activities. These
       elements are the first line of defense for personnel and equipment that enter/depart the
       areas and move throughout the base. They are also the last line of defense to evaluate
       personnel and material and prevent contamination from entering and possibly
       contaminating the facilities. In addition to security measures, these posts should check
       all personnel, vehicles, and material that enter/depart the unit area or facility. They
       should ensure that detector paper is properly pre-positioned and that personnel know the
       contamination status of the area and their destination. Note: These posts are not
       responsible for placing the detector paper. Placement is an individual or operator
       responsibility. However, they are responsible for checking people, vehicles, and
       equipment when entering the unit area for positive paper indications.
       11.8.2. Vehicle and Equipment Decontamination:
          11.8.2.1. Contaminated vehicles and equipment are still serviceable. Do not abandon
          or stop protecting items contaminated from previous attacks. Personnel that use the
          proper Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) and protective measures can use
          contaminated vehicles and equipment. Vehicle operators and passengers should place
          plastic sheeting or other barrier materials on seats if the seat area or the individual are
          (or were previously) contaminated. Body heat and pressure (from sitting) increases
          the potential for liquid chemical agents to penetrate the ensemble. Consider using
          barrier material to cover the steering wheels. This is especially important for vehicles
          that have open cabs or driver’s compartments.
          11.8.2.2. Focus decontamination efforts on surface areas of vehicle or equipment that
          will be continuously touched. Operationally decontaminate porous and non-porous
          surfaces contaminated with liquid chemical agent within 1-hour of the time of
          contamination. Decontaminate the non-porous surface areas to reduce the contact and
          transfer hazard from agent that does not evaporate or does not absorb into the surface.
          Regardless of the decontamination technique used, it will be easy to remove agents
          from smooth panels. However, chemical agents tend to remain at low levels in
          crevices, rivet heads, and joints.
          11.8.2.3. Non-porous surfaces, such as glass and unpainted metal, do not allow liquid
          chemical agents to rapidly penetrate their surface. These locations represent the most
          dangerous areas on a contaminated surface. Use M295 decontamination kits or a 5-
          percent chlorine bleach solution to reduce contamination from vehicle surfaces.
          Note: When using a 5-percent chlorine bleach solution on vertical surfaces, the
          solution is not likely to remain in contact with the surface long enough to be fully
          effective.
          11.8.2.4. Plastic and rubber components are porous materials that absorb liquid
          chemical agents. Once the agent absorbs, it remains embedded in the material and
          some level of vapor hazard will remain for extended periods.
96                                         AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


        11.8.2.5. Chemical or biological agents in solid or particle form do not penetrate or
        adhere to most surfaces and are easily removed or neutralized with liquid
        decontamination solutions.
        11.8.2.6. If canvas storage covers, seatbelts, webbing, carpet, and other textile
        materials are contaminated with liquid chemical agents, there are no effective or
        operationally feasible methods to decontaminate. Should these items become
        contaminated, place barrier material over the items or replace them.
     11.8.3. Vehicle Paint Schemes:
        11.8.3.1. Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) is a supplemental coating
        applied to vehicles and equipment to enhance the ability of operators to
        decontaminate the item after a chemical attack. Most non-CARC painted surfaces
        readily absorb liquid chemical agents. However, it may take up to 6 hours for
        chemical agents to absorb into those few vehicle or equipment items that have been
        painted within the previous two years. CARC paint older than 2 years readily sorbs
        chemical agents. Due to the slower rate of absorption with CARC paint, the contact
        and transfer hazard remains viable as long as the agent is on the surface.
        Additionally, the resulting vapor concentrations are at their maximum limit. If it is
        necessary to use CARC painted vehicles or equipment within 6 hours of
        contamination, decontaminate the entire exterior in addition to those areas that will be
        continuously touched.
        11.8.3.2. Polyurethane Paint: The majority of vehicles and equipment on Air Force
        installations are painted with polyurethane compounds. Chemical agents readily
        absorb into this type of paint. Thus, decontamination operations will not have a
        significant effect unless decontamination activities take place very shortly after the
        time of contamination (within minutes). When the liquid agent absorbs into the paint,
        it reduces the residual contact hazard and may present a vapor off-gassing hazard for
        long periods.
     11.8.4. Pre and Post attack preparations/actions:
        11.8.4.1. Contaminated Vehicle Identification and Marking: Each vehicle and
        equipment operator is responsible for placing M8 paper on their vehicle or equipment
        prior to attacks. They are also responsible for identifying and marking contamination
        found after attacks. Check pre-positioned M8 paper as soon as possible and mark
        contamination when post-attack movement is directed by the Installation Control
        Center (ICC) or UCC. When the item is contaminated, mark with the appropriate
        symbol. This is done to enable maintenance personnel to take the necessary
        protective actions and precautions when performing maintenance. The operator must
        also notify their UCC of the contamination items status. For vehicles, place the
        marker in lower center portion of the windshield. Each vehicle operator will annotate
        the AF Form 1800 when the marker is placed. Include the date and time of the
        contamination, the agent type, and the location of the contamination on the vehicle.
        If the inspection form is not available or becomes contaminated, provide the same
        information, along with the vehicle or equipment registration or identification
        number, to the unit UCC. The UCC consolidates unit information and passes this
        information to the EOC. The EOC reports the information to the ICC or VMF as
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                      97


        appropriate. For vehicles, the UCCs will also notify the VMF and include the POC
        information, vehicle location, contamination type, damaged or unserviceable status,
        and vehicle registration number.
     11.8.4.2. Pre and Post Attack Operations: Pre-attack actions include planning a vehicle
     covering strategy, protecting the vehicle fleet, and pre-positioning M8 paper on all
     vehicle assets. Post-attack actions include prioritizing vehicle use after an attack,
     conducting expedient vehicle decontamination, and performing vehicle maintenance
     procedures in a contaminated environment. Additional post-attack activities include
     providing long-term identification of contaminated vehicles and supporting open-air
     Casualty Collection Area (CCA) operations.
        11.8.4.3. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Operations: During
        pre-attack actions, shut down breathing air compressors and HVAC operations.
        Suspend all operations requiring respirator usage. These actions will prevent the
        potential spread of contamination and exposure to personnel and building interiors.
        11.8.4.4. Dispersal and Expedient Hardening: Vehicle dispersal is a valuable asset
        protection technique. The probability is high that effective dispersal will protect
        some vehicle assets from contamination or damage from conventional weapons
        effects. However, use dispersal actions with expedient hardening and overhead cover
        whenever possible. Additionally, personnel must guard against the tendency to park a
        large number of vehicles at any one location due to the ease of access.
        11.8.4.5. When identifying or constructing dispersal sites, choose a combination of
        features that provide the best available expedient or natural protection and support
        mission needs.
        11.8.4.6. Locate multiple dispersal sites in areas that are not within the effective
        range of adversary ground force weapons. If possible, locate sites on a concrete or
        asphalt surfaces and ensure there are at least two entry and exit routes. One of the
        routes should be a concrete or asphalt surface. Enhance protection by locating
        dispersal sites in areas that is under the direct observation or control of a security
        forces defensive fighting position or an owner-user security checkpoint. To simplify
        retrieval and post attack reconnaissance tasks, place sites near a unit work area.
        11.8.4.7. Consider using dispersed vehicles as storage locations for alternate mission
        supporting materials, such as tools and equipment.
        11.8.4.8. Use contaminated vehicles only when uncontaminated vehicles of the same
        type are unavailable. If possible, coordinate with the requesting unit to delay non-
        critical operations until the uncontaminated vehicle is available. This strategy
        requires close cooperation between the LRS UCC and UCCs for units which use UDI
        vehicles. The LRS UCC consolidates reports on the unserviceable and contaminated
        vehicles and then provides them to the LRS representative in the EOC. The EOC
        LRS representative will work with vehicle operations section and base UCCs to
        develop a vehicle priority list to support critical wing activities with operational,
        uncontaminated vehicles.
        11.8.4.9. As a safety precaution, always wear BDO or JLIST gloves when working
        with or around previously contaminated vehicles if a chemical or biological attack
 98                                             AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


              occurred on the installation. Dispose of contaminated waste within a closed and
              marked container or in a marked plastic disposal bag at the unit contaminated waste
              disposal point, or in the nearest work center contaminated waste disposal point. If
              transporting contaminated waste from the work site to another location, place the
              contaminated waste inside marked plastic bags or closed containers before loading
              into the vehicle.
              11.8.4.10. Contaminated busses move contaminated passengers and non-
              contaminated busses move non-contaminated passengers. However, there will be
              times when insufficient resources are available for use or mission dictates the prompt
              movement of personnel. During these times, use caution and place plastic barrier
              materials on the seats to prevent cross contamination.
              11.8.4.11. Vehicle Contamination Specifics: There is no machine, kit, team,
              technique, or procedure presently capable of fulfilling all decontamination
              requirements. Depending on the vehicle surface, the agent may absorb into the
              surface in times ranging from less than one minute up to approximately an hour.
              Vehicle decontamination operations will not have a significant effect once the agent
              has absorbed into the surface. Thus, there is no need for extensive vehicle
              decontamination and there is no need to establish a formal vehicle decontamination
              team. Placing barrier materials over the item(s) and, or replacement are the best
              mitigation techniques. Vehicles must be expediently decontaminated, specifically the
              parts that will continuously be touched within 1-hour of contamination. However,
              ensure vehicles are clearly identified as containing a residual chemical hazard. The
              operator’s or work center’s accomplishment of expedient decontamination using
              M295 decontamination kits will suffice to continue operations. Use M295
              decontamination kits or a 5-percent chlorine bleach solution to decontaminate
              appropriate asset surfaces if more than cursory contact is necessary, i.e. leaning on
              hood compartment, kneeling in truck bed.
              11.8.4.12. Ensure all personnel are wearing the appropriate MOPP. Once cargo
              loading/unloading is complete, determine the type, location, and degree of
              contamination remaining on the vehicle and ensure to transport personnel to the CCA
              as required. The ICC will make the final decision as to Mission Criticality Level.
              See Table 11.1 below for specific levels.

Table 11.1. Mission Criticality Level Codes:
Mission
Criticality      Definition
Level
Critical    Property is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 4-hours,
            regardless of existence of contamination.
Priority    Property is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 12-hours,
            regardless of existence of contamination.
Accelerated Property is sufficiently important that it must be transported within 24-hours,
            regardless of existence of contamination.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                             99


Routine         Mission can be delayed until contamination levels are such that MOPP 4 is not
                required, regardless of how long it takes the contamination to dissipate.
Negligible      Mission can be delayed until there is no measurable indication of contamination;
                property should not normally be accepted inside property movement area and
                save room for higher priority property.
             11.8.4.13. Movement of contaminated and clean cargo.
                11.8.4.13.1. If the transport vehicle is uncontaminated, take the following
                precautions to keep it clean during the contaminated cargo movement process.
                11.8.4.13.2. Expediently decontaminate the portions of the material handling
                equipment exposed to either the cargo pallet or the transport vehicle (forklift tines
                and rollers on the K-Loader). Use M295 decontamination kit or 5-percent
                chlorine bleach solution to decontaminate.
                11.8.4.13.3. Place plastic or another barrier material in the bed of the transport
                vehicle over the area the cargo will sit on.
                11.8.4.13.4. The vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport
                vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
                11.8.4.13.5. Local cargo handlers should perform the actual cargo loading.
                Cargo handlers should not touch or stand on or inside the vehicle unless
                absolutely necessary. If they must touch or stand on or inside the vehicle, they
                should use decontamination troughs containing 5-percent chlorine solutions to
                decontaminate their gloves and boots before they make contact. Check the clean
                transport vehicle for evidence of cross-contamination and decontaminate with the
                M295 decontamination kit if contaminated. Seal vehicle chocks or other transport
                vehicle accessories that may have come in contact with contaminated surfaces
                inside a plastic bag prior to loading.
                11.8.4.13.6. Appropriately mark the vehicle and the cargo to clearly identify the
                hazard associated with the contaminated cargo.
                11.8.4.13.7. Use the following guidelines when loading and transporting clean
                cargo after attacks with chemical or biological agents.
                   11.8.4.13.7.1. Determine the contamination status of the material handling
                   equipment (forklifts and K-loaders) and the transport vehicle or vehicles.
                   11.8.4.13.7.2. If the material handling equipment and/or transport vehicle is
                   contaminated, take the following precautions to prevent them from cross-
                   contaminating the 463L cargo pallet during the cargo movement process.
                   11.8.4.13.7.3. Expediently decontaminate the portions of the material
                   handling equipment that will come in contact with the cargo.
                   11.8.4.13.7.4. Place at least two sheets of plastic or another layer of barrier
                   material in the bed of the transport vehicle over the area the cargo or pallets
                   will sit on.
                   11.8.4.13.7.5. Ensure the cargo has at least a double wrap of barrier material.

      11.8.4.13.7.6. The vehicle operator should be the only person in the transport
      vehicle and must wear the appropriate level of IPE.
      11.8.4.13.7.7. Local cargo handlers should perform the actual cargo loading.
      Cargo handlers should not touch or stand on or inside the vehicle or vehicles
      unless absolutely necessary. If they must touch or stand on or inside the
      vehicle or vehicles, they should use decontamination troughs containing 5-

Section 12D— Monitoring Contractor Performance

12.5. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP): The QASP is the document government
personnel use to assess contractor performance. It provides for effective and efficient monitoring
to ensure acceptable service, and provides data and historical perspectives to evaluate
performance. The objective of the QASP is to ensure acceptable performance, effective quality
control, and a beneficial contract for the Air Force. The QASP will identify specific surveillance
methods for inspections and will be used to evaluate the services provided by the contractor. The
surveillance plan includes:
   12.5.1. A Performance Requirement Summary which contains the necessary information to
   develop the plan.
   12.5.2. A Sampling Guide and Tally Checklist to describe and record random sampling
   surveillance.
   12.5.3. A locally developed form to inspect periodic items as specified in the performance
   requirement summary.
   12.5.4. A form specified by the Contracting Office, to record customer complaints and
   document unacceptable contractor services. Note: Use the form specified by the Contracting
   Office to implement the plan. Provide a copy of the plan to the contracting officer.
   12.5.5. Document satisfactory or unsatisfactory job tasks on tally checklists. Satisfactory
   performance is determined by performance criteria in the contract which specifies an
   acceptable quality level. Unacceptable performance is brought to the attention of the
   contractor, and the COR prepares reports as directed by the local Contracting Office. The
   COR uses subjective judgment and criteria set out in a decision table to determine
   unacceptable levels of performance. Provide the report to the contracting officer who can
   initiate action against the contractor.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                        103


12.6. Surveillance Methods: The first source of information for a contract surveillance
function is the Management Information System. This data collection method is used to identify
problems in the work area. The data is useful to both the contractor and the COR, but since data
is mostly supplied by the contractor, the system should not be relied on exclusively to evaluate
performance.
   12.6.1. Random Inspection/Sampling: Random inspections to evaluate performance provide
   the QAP with a valuable management tool. Random samplings provide good overall
   performance indicators. Each job is evaluated in detail and the level of performance is
   recorded. The critical element in a random sampling evaluation is that the observations are
   truly random and they depict the typical average performance.
   12.6.2. Checklists: The checklist system is an easy method to identify the routine functions
   of the contractor’s activities. Prepare initial checklists from previously existing inspection
   guidelines and specific provisions in the contract. Review and modify the checklist as
   necessary to ensure accuracy and currency.
   12.6.3. Customer Complaints: The COR can use customer complaints to identify potential
   problem areas. The COR must respond quickly to the customer complaint with an objective
   evaluation. Feedback and involvement with the unsatisfied customer is crucial if the
   complaint system is to have validity.

Section 12E— General Contract Administration Responsibilities

12.7. Contract Administration: The following are the primary functions/personnel the COR
will routinely deal with:
   12.7.1. Functional Area Chief (FAC): The FAC is a functional director or commander of
   any functional area with government program management responsibility for contracted
   services, which provide some or the entire functional mission. For example, the LRS
   commander is a FAC. They are generally responsible for:
       12.7.1.1. Developing and sustaining a sound Quality Assurance Evaluation Program
       (QAEP).
       12.7.1.2. Implementing the QASP.
       12.7.1.3. Developing the SOW, PWS or PRD surveillance plans and evaluation guides.
   12.7.2. The Contract Administrator (CA): A qualified contracting individual appointed by
   the contracting officer to administer a particular contract.
   12.7.3. The Contracting Officer (CO): The Air Force agent authorized to award and/or
   administers contracts. The CO acts as an agent between the Air Force and the contractor and
   is the only person authorized to enter into contracts. The CO is responsible for reviewing the
   contractor’s performance to ensure that it is satisfactory and that the Air Force receives the
   products and/or services requested.

with another moving or stationary object. Mechanical failures resulting from operator abuse or
negligence are not accidents under this definition.
Non-DOD Schools— Schools including dormitory facilities, other than DOD Dependent
Schools, that provide suitable educational programs, usually on a tuition basis. The term
includes resident facilities operated by approved non-DOD schools to provide room and board
for eligible handicapped dependents when DOD Dependents Schools cannot provide an

functions, activities or operations.
Official Travel— The individual is on funded orders and can claim reimbursement for the mode
of travel on a travel voucher. Personnel in a permissive TDY status or on invitational orders can

planning, directing, and controlling the assignment and movement of transportation equipment
and drivers in the transporting of personnel and cargo.
Operations Support— Commercial design vehicles in use by units conducting combat or
tactical operations or for training personnel for such operations.
Operator Inspection and Service— Those maintenance inspections and functions performed by
the operator, before, during, and after operation to ensure the vehicle is safe and serviceable.
Permissible Operating Distance— DOD maintains and operates in peacetime only those owned
or leased motor vehicle assets needed to meet approved DOD emergency and wartime

excess of DOD capability shall be met by the use of commercial carriers. The POD is that
distance from the installation that GMVs travel before competing with commercial carriers (see
DODD 4500.36-R). As a guide, a 100-mile radius is sufficient to support operations at most
bases. Identify frequently traveled points that exceed the standard radius. Vehicles used to
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            119


support the USAF Courier transfer stations, Armed Forces Courier Service, AF Bands, AF

Private School (United States Only)— An elementary or secondary school that provides
education within a span of grades 1 through 12, plus kindergarten, established by an agency

Public Transportation— Transportation that is or may be made available by a commercial firm
or public utility on a regularly scheduled basis as a part of its public service and for which fares
are collected.
Reasonable Distance— A term used in connection with providing transportation to private
schools. As a guide, a distance of approximately 20-miles from the installation to the school is
considered to be a reasonable distance.
Responsive Manner— Transportation service which is available and capable of providing the
traveler movement to/from locations in order to meet their traveling requirements. While a
traveler’s schedule or traveling locations may not allow for use of public or commercial
transportation, travelers must make every attempt to utilize existing regularly scheduled
transportation when available, feasible and cost effective. The numbers of personnel and/or
excess baggage are common factors to be considered in determining whether or not
transportation is responsive. Cost per passenger mile, as defined in Table 3.2 will be used to
determine whether to support using GMVs or other means of transportation support. As a
general rule, the standard airlines definition of excess baggage will apply.
Scheduled DOD Bus Services— Scheduled bus services provided by DOD Components, to
include, bus services contracted by DOD Components.
Shuttle Service— This fare-free service is established to meet DOD requirements and operates
only in duty areas.
Space Available (Space A)— Any seating available after accommodating space required
passengers. The vehicle size or contract cost will not be increased to accommodate space-

bus can not be scheduled for use to transport additional Space-A passengers desiring transport to
the same or nearby destination).
Sub-Motor Pools— An element of the central transportation, motor pool that is required to be
physically located in another area due to lack of space, mission requirements or geographic
conditions of the installation.

motor vehicle modified to military specification to meet direct transportation support of combat
 120                                         AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


or tactical operations, or for training of personnel for such operations. The USAF uses
commercial design vehicles in tactical roles due to the on-pavement environment of their
flightlines.
Taxi Service— Transportation services provided by vehicles dispatched with drivers on an "on-
call" basis without appreciable delay or the need for prior arrangement for service. Taxi service
vehicles may or may not be radio-equipped.
U-Drive-It (UDI)— Vehicles available to using organizations and activities of the installation
for temporary support of official use functions and operated by personnel assigned to the using
Agency in support of home-station mission, contingencies, TDY support, and combat service
support operations. Support is normally limited to 72-hours.
Vehicle Operations Fleet— Vehicles assigned to provide transportations services for temporary
use by other organizations.
Walking Distance— In overseas areas, the walking distance is the distance between a student’s
primary residence and school or designated bus stop, normally not to exceed 1-mile for students
in kindergarten through grade 6; and 1.5-miles for students in grades 7 through 12. These areas
should conform to natural boundaries such as a housing area, a neighborhood, etc. In the
CONUS walking distances are established by local school authorities.

airfield access to individuals who fail the protanope and deuteranope color vision tests. The first
step in flightline training is to initiate an AF Form 171.
   A4.4.1. The trainer will conduct the daytime and nighttime orientation on the flightline.
   Items to train/familiarize on will include:
       A4.4.1.1. All Entry Control Points (ECPs).
       A4.4.1.2. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) checkpoints.
       A4.4.1.3. Taxiways/hardstands.
       A4.4.1.4. Airfield lighting and markers.
       A4.4.1.5. Runway crossing procedures and vehicle crossing lights.
       A4.4.1.6. Familiarize trainee with the location of all red lines. Red lines could be
       covered during different times of year, so trainee must know where they are located.
   A4.4.2. Know the airfield markings.
       A4.4.2.1. Runway Hold Line Position Marking: Yellow.
       A4.4.2.2. Instrument Hold Line Position Marking: Yellow.
       A4.4.2.3. Taxiway Edge Marking: Yellow.
       A4.4.2.4. Taxilane Marking: Yellow.
       A4.4.2.5. FOD Check Marking: White.
   A4.4.3. Upon completion of day and night orientation annotate the AF Form 171.
   A4.4.4. Flightline pre-test: A pre-test should be given on flightline ECP and runway
   crossing procedures. If the individual is unsure or not comfortable after taking the pre-test,
   retrain and retest as necessary prior to actual testing.
   A4.4.5. Final flightline test: Once the trainee feels comfortable and has successfully taken
   the pre-test, the final test can be administered. The final test for flightline and runway
   crossing is normally a controlled document and may be located at Base Operations if not
   issued to the TVO Section as a test-proctor. The trainer may give the flightline and runway
   crossing tests to the trainee at the same time. Ensure the trainee is in a relaxed and quiet
   environment for testing purposes. Blank maps on runway crossing may be used. In order to
   pass the test, the trainee must score at least an 80-percent on the flightline test and a 100-
   percent on the runway crossing test. Test scores will be annoted in Section 19 on the AF
   Form 171 for issue of the flightline competency card.
   A4.4.6. Practical driving evaluation: After an individual has successfully completed their
   flightline tests, the trainee will return to the flightline with the trainer for a Practical Driving
   Evaluation. The trainee will keep their AF Form 171 with them at all times while training on
   the flightline. The trainee will drive while being evaluted by the trainer. It is the trainer's
   responsibility to ensure the trainee is ready for crew runs after the evaluation or if the trainee
   still requires additional familiarization with the flightline.
   A4.4.7. Control tower tour: All trainees must complete a tower orientation. Trainees must
   bring the AF Form 171 for flightline competency card issue to their tower orientation. Upon
   orientation completion, a member at the tower will initial appropriately on the AF Form 171.
AFI24-301_AFGSCSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                          129


   A4.4.8. Aircrew and proficency training on the flightline: After the individual has
   completed the final tests, the trainer will coordinate with VOCC on scheduled crew runs.
   Trainer and trainee will initially go on crew runs together. The trainer is responsible for
   training on the proper procedures and base policies for driving on the flightline and crossing
   active runways. The trainee will not be released to a shift until the individual has the
   required knowledge on the flightline, runway crossing, and is comfortable in performing
   crew runs on their own. Note: Color blind personnel are normally resricted to ramp
   operations only.
A4.5. Local Driving Orientation: The TVO Section will conduct a local driving orientation
for on and off base with the trainee. On-base orientation is designed for a new individual to get a
feel for the base and to get oriented with the main buildings and locations. The most important
places to point out during base orientation are:
   A4.5.1. Flying squadrons and hangars, as well as, the maintenance hangars.
   A4.5.2. Base Operations and Passenger Terminal.
   A4.5.3. Headquarters, Numbered Air Force, tenant organization buildings, as applicable.
   A4.5.4. Joint Mobility Center (JMC) or deployment processing centers.
   A4.5.5. Main Billeting Office and enlisted/officer billeting.
   A4.5.6. Commissary, Base Exchange, and Shoppette locations.
   A4.5.7. Base Hospital or clinic.
   A4.5.8. Military dining facilities.
   A4.5.9. Documented Cargo sweep routes.
   A4.5.10. Base shuttle bus routes.Note: Off-base orientations are specific areas that need to
   be pointed out in order to support official business transportation requirements.
   A4.5.11. Airport familiarization training: This should include the departures and arrival
   areas for International and Domestic terminals, United Service Organizations (USO)
   terminals, government vehicle parking slots (if applicable), etc.
   A4.5.12. Local ANG/AFR bases.
   A4.5.13. Frequently used hotels.
   A4.5.14. Frequently used automotive dealerships and vehicle rental agencies.
A4.6. Develop Training Records: The individuals training records will be loaded into TBA by
the NCOIC of TVO Section. The NCOIC of TVO will conduct an initial evaluation and
feedback on all Airmen in training. Mandatory items in the training records are addressed in AFI
36-2201v3, Air Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration. The training
records will also include/track:
   A4.6.1. Initial and recurring training documentation.
   A4.6.2. CDC material, progress, and reports.            Include pass/fail documentation and
   counseling, as necessary.

NOTE: When an individual reports to their first duty assignment they will be assigned to the
TVO Section. The goal is to train the individual on all vehicles, equipment, flightline, runway
crossing, base and downtown orientation before being released to the duty section. The
individual will have general knowledge of the base and Vehicle Operations missions.

1. In order for us to provide quality service and adhere to Air Force (AF) directives, we must
utilize Department of Defense and AF assets prior to renting. Your help is required in
forecasting vehicle requirements in sufficient time to allow us to prepare our vehicles or recall
vehicles from lower priority users. By doing so, you will directly contribute to significant cost
savings to the AF, wing, and possibly your own unit.

2. We have determined no government vehicles (own, rented, or leased) are available from
Vehicle Operations to meet your mission requirement. You have two options at this point:

   a. If you use your Privately Owned Vehicle for an official medical appointment, you may be
   entitled to reimbursement through the Medical Administrative Office or Military Personnel
   Flight Finance Section and the SF 1164, Claims for Reimbursement for Expenditures on
   Official Business.

   b. You may have adequately justified your need for support to be recalled from the wing or
   outsourced from commercial agencies. To obtain possible support contact Vehicle
   Management & Analysis in Vehicle Management at XXX-XXXX.

    be provided when the justification is based solely on reasons of rank, position, prestige or
    personal convenience (i.e., generic policies allowing support to wing or group commanders and
    command chiefs, or individuals of a certain rank/pay grade such as O-6 and above). The Head of
    the DOD Component concerned exercises authority over civilian personnel. Violations should
    be reported to the authorizing individual’s superior or the IG.

2. For all rules except 3 and 4, official travel is directed at the transportation to/from commercial
or military terminals, domicile or place of employment/primary duty. The Deployment and
Distribution Flight Chief is the government vehicle official use approval authority for any
request which appears to conflict with or is not sufficiently addressed in any cited governing
directives or guidance.

3. Methods of transportation listed which do not meet mission requirements in a responsive
manner (see definition in this AFI) must be documented objectively on a case-by-case basis.
Requests to provide other GMV support as a result of unresponsive transportation services listed
above will be annotated in the OLVIMS Dispatch Module request remarks field and a copy of
the justification will be retained for audit and inspection purposes.

4. National Capital Region units refer to AI 109 and AFDW policy.
