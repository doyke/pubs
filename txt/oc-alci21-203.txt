                               EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE

2.1. Maintenance Concept: This chapter provides guidance for maintenance procedures and
practices to ensure reliability and mission support capability of Depot Industrial Plant Equipment
(DIPE), Non-DIPE, and On-Condition Maintenance (OCM) equipment.
2.2. Maintenance Program Determination.
   2.2.1. Types of Equipment. The 76th Maintenance Support Squadron (76 MXSS), with the
   aid of the maintenance groups, determines which equipment requires specific operator
   maintenance (OM) and the equipment to be included in the preventive maintenance (PM) and
   predictive maintenance (PdM) programs managed by the 76 MXSS.
       2.2.1.1. DIPE is defined as permanently affixed/fixed location equipment not readily
       movable or other equipment as determined by the 76 MXSS Equipment Specialists.
       DIPE will be identified with a 76 MXSS identification number (e.g., OC number). The
       following criteria will be applied to determine if equipment will be included in the
       maintenance management PM and/or PdM program.
           2.2.1.1.1. Equipment creating an unsafe or hazardous environment if failure
           occurred, due to lack of PM and/or PdM, will be included.
           2.2.1.1.2. All weapon peculiar equipment having specific PM and/or PdM
           requirements delineated by an applicable TO will be included.
           2.2.1.1.3. Equipment subject to breakdown repairs that are expensive compared to
           PM and/or PdM will be included.
           2.2.1.1.4. Equipment critical to production and where failure would result in costly
           downtime will be included.
           2.2.1.1.5. Equipment not critical to the depot maintenance process (e.g., small drill
           press) that can be repaired without regard to downtime or equipment availability
           should be excluded.
           2.2.1.1.6. Equipment of small dollar value, where the cost of PM and/or PdM is
           likely to exceed the cost of replacement upon failure, should be excluded.
       2.2.1.2. Attachment 10 contains a list of examples of items that will be excluded. The
       list is not all inclusive and exceptions can/may be made.
       2.2.1.3. Non-DIPE is defined as any support equipment that is not classified as DIPE and
       does not have a 76 MXSS identification number, IAW AFMCI 21-127, Depot
       Maintenance Plant Management, Chapter 2.
       2.2.1.4. OCM is defined as depot machinery and shop equipment which has no periodic,
       recurring inspections and does not have a 76 MXSS identification number.
2.3. Preventive Maintenance.
   2.3.1. PM consists of equipment maintenance actions performed on a periodic basis
   according to a specific set of instructions and a predetermined time schedule. The objective
12                                                            OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014


  of PM is to protect the equipment capability and investment by removing causes of failure
  and making adjustments to compensate for normal wear before failures occur.
  2.3.2. PM for OC-ALC equipment will be performed by the operator, 76 MXSS or
  contractor personnel, on a periodic basis according to a predetermined schedule. The
  description of operator and 76 MXSS PM and level of accomplishment is as follows:
     2.3.2.1. Operator PM consists of two categories, general and specific, and is performed
     by the operator on each shift (or if only used periodically) upon the initial starting of
     equipment.
         2.3.2.1.1. General Operator PM applies to all equipment to ensure serviceability of
         equipment prior to use. It consists of a review of equipment documentation for
         current status (AFTO Form 244, DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Repairable) Tag-
         Material, or the user interface to Facilities and Equipment Maintenance (FEM)
         System [FEMWEB], if applicable) and a Daily/PU visual inspection of equipment for
         conditions; such as malfunctions, damage, cleanliness, proper lubrication, and
         potential safety/fire hazards. Any of these conditions, which cannot be corrected by
         the operator, will be called to the attention of the supervisor for corrective action. No
         daily certification of this inspection is required to be documented on AFTO Form
         244. Equipment will be cleaned and lubricated at intervals consistent with equipment
         care and good housekeeping standards.
         2.3.2.1.2. Specific Operator PM includes, but is not limited to, maintenance of a
         critical nature which, if neglected, could result in costly equipment damage or create
         an unsafe condition. The performance of this maintenance will be documented on
         AFTO Form 244, part II, for daily specific operator PM and part III, for all other
         specific PM requirements. The inspection requirements are listed on the AFMC
         Form 306 (or equivalent), applicable equipment/general TO and AFOSH stds,
         commercial operator manuals, etc.
         2.3.2.1.3. The shop supervisor/appointee (appointed by letter) will monitor both
         general and specific operator maintenance to ensure accomplishment by reviewing
         the AFTO Form 244 for accuracy and completeness. The supervisor/appointee will
         document the review on part IV of the AFTO Form 244 every 6 months (paragraph
         1.2.4.).
     2.3.2.2. 76 MXSS PM is performed by the Plant Management Flight
     (76 MXSS/MXDVA) and the Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL)
     Flight (76 MXSS/MXDCA) on a scheduled basis (e.g., monthly, quarterly or yearly).
     2.3.2.3. PM performed on DIPE by contractors will be tracked and documented on the
     AFTO Form 244 or in the FEM System.
         2.3.2.3.1. Existing contracts include the requirement for the contractor to document
         PM on the AFTO Form 244 or in the Facilities and Equipment Maintenance
         (Facilities and Equipment Maintenance (FEM)) System.
         2.3.2.3.2. All new contracts that are awarded are to include the requirement for the
         PM to be documented in the FEM System.
OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014                                                                    13


2.4. Predictive Maintenance Work is a process of using electrical and mechanical testing and
diagnostic devices to predict when a piece of equipment is deviating from its normal operating
parameters. It is also designed to protect equipment capability and investment by removing
causes of failure and making adjustment to compensate for normal wear before failure or an
unsafe condition occurs. The Predictive Maintenance Team will provide necessary trending data
and analytical reports to management and initiate a work order in the FEM system.
   2.4.1. Predictive Maintenance Includes:
       2.4.1.1. Infrared Thermography: Infrared thermography can detect electrical
       anomalies such as loose connections, overloaded circuits and failed motors. It can also
       detect failing bearings, steam systems, coupling and alignment problems, air leaks, fluid
       levels, and blocked heat exchangers.
       2.4.1.2. Oil Analysis: Immediate benefits are from the decrease in oil purchases by
       changing the oil based on condition versus changing the oil based on time. Impending
       equipment failures such as failed bearings and gears can be detected.
       2.4.1.3. Vibration Analysis: The vibrations that exist in all rotating machinery have
       unique “signatures.” Detailed analysis makes it possible to identify abnormal signals and
       determine appropriate corrective action.
       2.4.1.4. Ultrasonic Analysis: Identifies various types of leaks, e.g., compressed air,
       process gases, vacuum, steam, hydraulic and refrigerants. These are used to trend
       mechanical operations and detect electrical discharges such as corona, tracking and
       arcing.
       2.4.1.5. Laser Alignment: Positioning two or more machine components so that their
       rotational centerlines are collinear at the coupling point under operating conditions. The
       PdM team may assist technicians with the operation of laser shaft alignments.
       2.4.1.6. Motor Analysis: Identifies and analyzes electrical defects using all major
       electric tests including surge, polarization index, DC hipot, megohm, and winding
       resistance. It also identifies power quality issues, machine and motor performance and
       estimates energy savings, detects voltage levels and unbalance, rotor cage condition,
       efficiency, under/over current, harmonic and total distortion, torque ripple and load
       history.
2.5. Responsibilities.
   2.5.1. The maintenance groups (76 AMXG, 76 CMXG, 76 MXSG, 76 PMXG, 76 SMXG,
   etc.) will:
       2.5.1.1. Submit a completed Department of Defense (Department of Defense (DD))
       Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request (SAAR), to OC-ALC/ITED (IT System
       OPR) for a minimum of one primary and one alternate who will be the Contract
       Maintenance Liaison (Contract Maintenance Liaison (CML)) responsible for managing
       FEM work orders for tasks accomplished by contractors required to use FEM, but do not
       have access to FEM, on DIPE within their group. This will ensure that FEMWEB
       accurately reflects equipment status (i.e., Red X, Red / & Red -) when maintenance is
       accomplished by contractors required to use FEM, but do not have access to FEM.
       Contractors that are required to use FEM and have access to FEM (security clearance,
14                                                          OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014


     FEM account, crew Identification (ID)Identification (), etc.) will manage their own FEM
     work orders. Contact information for OC-ALC/ITED (IT System OPR) is available at
     https://wwwmil.tinker.af.mil/ites/sysInfo.asp?sysId=D130
         2.5.1.1.1. Equipment owners within the groups are responsible for ensuring that
         contractor maintenance is satisfactorily accomplished and the equipment is in
         serviceable condition before accepting the equipment.         When the work is
         accomplished by contractors required to use FEM, but do not have access to FEM,
         documentation for the acceptance of work accomplished by contractors will be
         forwarded to the group primary or alternate CML so the work orders can be closed.
  2.5.2. Engineering organization within the applicable maintenance groups will:
     2.5.2.1. Complete Parts I and II of AFMC Form 388, Machine Tool and Equipment

     2.5.2.4. Ensure any modifications made to equipment, such as installation of safety
     guards, interlocks, etc., are brought to the attention of 76 MXSS/MXDEA. Subject
     modifications can then be incorporated into the AFMC Form 388 and the appropriate PM
     requirements can be determined.
     2.5.2.5. Ensure that all engineering requests/inquires relative to equipment in the FEM
     system reference the 76 MXSS identification number (e.g., OC number) assigned to the
     particular piece of equipment.
     2.5.2.6. Determine if equipment that is no longer in use for an extended period (e.g.,
     intermittent workload) will be needed for future workload.
         2.5.2.6.1. If the equipment is not going to be needed to support future workloads, it
         must be either transferred to another organization or turned in to Supply/Defense
         Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO).
         2.5.2.6.2. If the equipment is needed to support future workloads, it must be
         determined whether Maintenance Support and/or Operator PM will be continued or
         suspended.

                    TRAILER INSPECTION AND DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Background. Preventive Maintenance (PM) consists of equipment maintenance actions
performed on a periodic basis according to a specific set of instructions and a predetermined
schedule. The objective of PM is to protect the equipment investment by removing causes of
failure and making adjustments to compensate for normal wear before failures occur.
7.2. Description of PM. PM for OC-ALC trailers will be the responsibility of the
owner/operator. It will be done on a periodic basis IAW criteria defined in the applicable TO
guidance for each specific type of trailer (engine, rail, flatbed or special purpose).
7.3. Operator PM.
   7.3.1. Operator PM consists of two categories, general and specific, and is performed by the
   operator prior to towing or upon the initial use of the trailer. The supervisor will ensure
   operators are aware of and trained to perform PM prior to towing or initial use.
       7.3.1.1. General Operator PM is a prior-to-use visual inspection of the trailer for
       conditions such as malfunctions, damage, cleanliness, proper lubrication and potential
       safety/fire hazards. This inspection does not require documentation on the AFTO Form
       244. Problems that cannot be corrected by the operator will be annotated on the trailer’s
       AFTO Form 244, part V, and called to the attention of the supervisor for corrective
       action. When trailers are considered unsafe to operate, immediately contact the
       appropriate trailer maintenance shop for repair.
       7.3.1.2. Specific Operator PM includes, but is not limited to, maintenance of a critical
       nature, which, if neglected, could result in costly equipment damage or create an unsafe
       condition. The inspection requirements are listed on the AFMC Form 306, checklist,
       work cards or applicable technical orders. This inspection will be documented IAW
       chapter 1.
           7.3.1.2.1. The specific daily inspections will be conducted by the person using the
           trailer each time the trailer is used (moved from one location to another). The
           accomplishment of these inspections will be documented on AFTO Form 244 upon
           the first use of the day.
7.4. Monitor Maintenance. The trailer user/owner will monitor general and specific operator
maintenance to ensure accomplishment.
7.5. Six Month Scheduled PM. If a 6-month scheduled PM is required, users can call the
applicable trailer maintenance shop to schedule service. The applicable trailer maintenance shop
supervisor will maintain a maintenance log and schedule of required PM.
7.6. Unscheduled Maintenance or Wheel Bearing Pack (WBP). When unscheduled
maintenance or WBP is required, users must off load trailer, remove all foreign objects, and
deliver it to the applicable trailer shop or unserviceable staging area. The trailer should be
tagged with DD Form 1577-2 annotated with user/owner’s name, phone number and
discrepancy. The AFTO Form 244 must be properly annotated with required maintenance and/or
discrepancy in accordance with Chapter 1.
 34                                                              OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014


7.7. Repair Centers. The 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group Trailer Repair Shop, 566 AMXS, is
the primary repair center for 76 AMXG trailers. 547 PMXS is the primary repair center for 76
PMXG engine trailers that accompany applicable engines. 76 MXSG/MXDVABB is the
primary repair center for 76 MXSG non-engine trailers. Each repair center will be responsible
for intermediate PM (e.g., monthly, semi-annual or annual) inspections and other required
maintenance.
7.8. Trailer Configuration Changes or Modifications. The user/owner will provide the
applicable trailer repair center with information on any trailer configuration changes or
modifications as they occur.
7.9. Trailer Painting Requirements. Trailers will be painted in accordance with the specific
equipment TO or TO 35-1-3, Corrosion Prevention and Cleaning, Painting, and Marking of
USAF Support Equipment (SE). The specific equipment TO will take precedence.
7.10. Responsibilities.
   7.10.1. Operator Responsibilities. Prior to towing or using each trailer, the user will:
       7.10.1.1. Ensure AFTO Form 244, and AFMC Form 306, applicable equipment/general
       TO, commercial operator manual, work card or checklist are attached and required PM is
       current. If the PM is not current, the user will annotate the AFTO Form 244 IAW
       Chapter 1. If the forms are missing, the user will obtain new forms, perform and
       document the prior-to-use inspection, as well as document the scheduled inspection (e.g.,
       180 day, WBP) due dates.
       7.10.1.2. Perform visual inspection IAW the AFMC Form 306, checklist, work cards or
       applicable TOs.
       7.10.1.3. Annotate the AFTO Form 244 IAW Chapter 1.
       7.10.1.4. Trailers with discrepancies, which render trailer inoperable or unsafe, will not
       be used. If trailer is loaded, it will be unloaded, freed of foreign objects and brought to
       unserviceable staging area.
       7.10.1.5. Ensure cotter pin or safety locking pin is inserted in the pintle hook at all times.
   7.10.2. Trailer repair centers will:
       7.10.2.1. Maintain and repair all trailers owned by their organization (paragraph 7.7.).
       7.10.2.2. Establish and maintain a trailer maintenance schedule to ensure that all
       maintenance is complied with.
       7.10.2.3. Ensure trailers are identified and marked with a locally assigned identification
       number using a three or four letter group identifier and a sequential number starting with
       001. Trailers will be marked in accordance with the specific equipment TO or TO 35-1-
       3. The specific equipment TO will take precedence.
       7.10.2.4. Determine when trailers require complete or touch-up painting to maintain the
       appearance of the trailers.
       7.10.2.5. Ensure that AFMC Form 306, Preventive Maintenance Instructions, are
       provided with the AFTO Form 244 and is attached to each trailer.
OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014                                                               35


  7.10.3. Trailer PM and CM will be documented on the AFTO Form 244 IAW Chapter 1.
  PM is considered past due when the due date is exceeded by one frequency cycle or 60 days,
  whichever is less.
 36                                                           OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014

   MOBILE MAINTENANCE STANDS/FIXTURES/CARTS/PLATFORMS/TABLES/
               CABINETS AND DEXION CARTS SECURING

8.1. General. Mobile maintenance stands/fixtures/carts/platforms/tables/cabinets and dexion
carts will be secured by setting all brakes and locking devices, if so equipped. If not equipped,
the owning organization will determine the need for securing devices.
   8.1.1. Any item that requires securing devices will be retrofitted with locks and/or brakes. A
   minimum of two securing devices will be installed and operational. Approved chocks can be
   used as a temporary securing device until permanent devices are installed. Locking devices
   will be set while in use or in storage.
   8.1.2. All B series maintenance stands will be modified by the addition of a safety chain to
   be latched across the access opening side of the platform when employees are working on the
   platform. The chain is designed as an awareness tool only, not as fall protection. The safety
   chain is designed to alert employees when they are close to the open edge of the platform and
   may be in danger of stepping off of the platform.
       8.1.2.1. Employees will not take any action to remove or bypass this safety device in an
       effort to render it unserviceable. The safety chain will not be used as a seat.
       8.1.2.2. Should a safety chain be found damaged/unusable, the employee who discovers
       the discrepancy will annotate the AFTO Form 244, Part V, with a Red X IAW Chapter 1
       and the stand will be considered unserviceable until the discrepancy is corrected.
       8.1.2.3. It is not necessary to latch the safety chain when descending the stand or when
       personnel are not present on the platform.
8.2. Push Carts. Securing devices will not be required on manual push carts that are being used
to transport aircraft parts from one location to another. These carts will not be towed.

      9.1.5.5. For non-real property listed cranes (identified as DIPE, have an OC number, and
      managed in FEM) perform and document inspections IAW Chapter 2 of this document.
      9.1.5.6. For real property listed cranes, perform an operational inspection before use of a
      crane as follows:
          9.1.5.6.1. The first employee to use the crane for the day will use OC-ALC Form
          105, Overhead Crane Operator Inspection Checklist (Attachment 7), to inspect the
          crane and ensure it is safe for use.
          9.1.5.6.2. The checklist may be laminated and securely attached to the remote or
          pendant control for convenience. Personnel may use wax pencils or dry erase pens to
          annotate satisfactory/unsatisfactory/not applicable on the checklist.
          9.1.5.6.3. Once the inspection is complete and the crane is found to be operating
          satisfactorily, personnel will document the inspection on the AFTO Form 244.
          9.1.5.6.4. Employees are instructed to annotate any discrepancies found on the
          AFTO Form 244. Suspend all operations immediately if any of the items indicated
          on the checklist with an asterisk (*) are observed to be in an unsatisfactory condition.
          In addition to suspending the operation when any unsafe condition is observed,
          immediately notify the workplace supervisor.
          9.1.5.6.5. The AFTO Form 244 will be maintained with the remote control if the
          crane is so equipped.
      9.1.5.7. Not engage in operation of the crane hoist when physically or otherwise unfit.
      9.1.5.8. Consult their supervisor before handling the crane hoist whenever there is doubt
      as to the safety of the crane, and may refuse to operate the crane until the safety problem
      is corrected.
      9.1.5.9. Be familiar with the crane hoist care. If adjustments or repairs are necessary, or
      any defects are known, report promptly to the supervisor and refuse to operate until the
      crane is adjusted or repaired.
      9.1.5.10. Ensure cables and slings are inspected and current prior to use. Note: Only
      wire cables or web slings will be used; no ropes or chain slings. Damaged or
      unserviceable slings must be destroyed to prevent reuse and disposed of as refuse.

       9.2.2.1. All maintenance and periodic inspections are accomplished by Civil Engineering
       (CE) personnel as shown on Attachment 8, Overhead Crane Maintenance and Inspection
       Schedule. Requests for maintenance will be called in to the CE Work Order Desk at 734-
       3117.
       9.2.2.2. When an overhead crane (bay) is locked out, the bays on either side of it must
       also be locked out to prevent re-energizing of the crane. The Maintenance Operations
       Center (MOC), 736-2500, will be informed by those locking out the bays. The MOC will
       then contact the appropriate tool cribs informing them to refrain from issuing remote
       controls until the locked out crane is once again operational.
9.3. Safe Practices. For the protection of all personnel, operators and maintenance personnel
will use all safeguards provided and will obey all regulations and established requirements.
   9.3.1. Ascending or descending ladders. Personnel will use both hands while ascending
   and descending ladders. Any tools, toolboxes, or materials will be hoisted and lowered with
   a rope.
   9.3.2. Bridges and Cranes. Bridges and cranes may be pushed when necessary to perform
   maintenance only. Operators are strictly prohibited from pushing bridges and cranes solely
   for the purpose of personal convenience to exit the cab or the overhead crane.
   9.3.3. Capacity. Under no circumstances will a crane hoist be used for lifting loads above
   the posted capacity.
   9.3.4. Carrying Loads. Loads shall not be carried over employees below.
   9.3.5. Centering. The point of lift of cranes will be centered directly over the load to avoid
   lifting the load from an angle, thus eliminating additional strain on the hoist or swinging the
   load when lifted.
   9.3.6. Expansion Joints and Turntables. Only CE maintenance personnel are authorized
   to operate cranes over bridge rail expansion joints or on turntables and then the operator will
   take precaution and proceed at the slowest possible speed.
   9.3.7. Fuses. Under no circumstances will the operator change or replace blown fuses.
       9.3.7.1. For non-real property listed cranes (identified as DIPE, have an OC number and
       managed in FEM), use FEMWEB to initiate a repair trouble call IAW Chapter 2.5.3.1.6.
       of this document to accomplish this task.
       9.3.7.2. For real property listed cranes, notify the CE Work Order Desk at 734-3117 to
       accomplish this task.
   9.3.8. Ground Crew. Personnel operating the remote control will not be considered part of
   the ground crew. Signal men/spotters will be used, as required, by applicable standards.
   9.3.9. Hoisting. Operators will not move the load, to include hoisting, lowering, swinging,
   or traveling, while anyone is on the load or hook.
   9.3.10. Hook in Low Position. When the hook is in the extreme low position, at least two
   complete wraps of wire rope must remain on the drum. Wire rope ends shall be safely and
   securely attached to the drum by means of a clamp or socket arrangement approved by the
OC-ALCI21-203 15 JULY 2014                                                                    41


   crane or wire rope manufacturer. NOTE: When traveling with an empty hook, keep hook
   above head level.
   9.3.11. Kinks. Permanent damage will result from kinked cables when the kink has been
   pulled through by tension on the cable. In such cases, the cable will not be used and will be
   replaced immediately.
   9.3.12. Limit Switches. The trip setting of hoist limit switches shall be determined by pre-
   operation tests with an empty hook.
   9.3.13. Loose Objects. Operators will ensure that all loose objects, such as tools, are
   removed or secured prior to moving cranes.
   9.3.14. Other Bridges. All other bridges must be left in an unlocked position when not in
   use.
   9.3.15. Performing Work on Cranes. Prior to maintenance being performed, the crane bay
   in need of repair and the bays on either side of it must be locked out to prevent reenergizing
   of the crane. No maintenance personnel will perform any work on a crane, for any purpose,
   without first notifying the operator. Maintenance personnel must ensure the operator
   understands what is to be done and what part the operator is to take in the work.
   9.3.16. Rated Load. The rated load of the crane shall be plainly marked on each side of the
   crane and clearly legible to the operator.
   9.3.17. Safety Latches. Safety latches will be used on hooks to prevent slings from
   separating from hooks while hoisting or lowering is in progress. Do not use slings or crane
   hooks without safety latches.
   9.3.18. Sharp Corners. Considerable care will be used if the load to be lifted has sharp
   corners, or if there will be sharp bends over an unyielding surface.
   9.3.19. Side Pulls. Cranes shall not be used for side pulls except when specifically
   authorized by OC-ALC (for non-real property listed cranes) or CE (for real property listed
   cranes) maintenance personnel who have determined the equipment will not be damaged and
   that various parts of the equipment will not be overstressed.
   9.3.20. Suspended Load. Never leave a hanging or suspended load unless personal safety is
   in jeopardy. Ground the load to relieve the tension on hoisting equipment. If unable to land
   load, rope off affected area and post warning signs.
   9.3.21. Tag Lines. Tag lines will be used for all free-swinging loads.
   9.3.22. Travel. In all lifting operations by horizontal cranes, the vertical movement will be
   completed before starting the horizontal movement.
9.4. Historical Records.
   9.4.1. For non-real property listed cranes (identified as DIPE, have an OC number, and
   managed in FEM) historical records will be maintained IAW Chapters 1 and 2 of this
   document.
   9.4.2. For real property listed cranes, the AFTO Form 244 will be used to document the
   preoperative/daily inspection conducted by the operator, and maintenance conducted by CE.
   The form will be kept on file by the shop for a minimum of one year.

   9.4.3. For real property listed cranes, the AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data (or
   electronic equivalent) will be used to document the monthly and annual/periodic inspections
   and significant repairs and test conducted by CE. The AFTO Form 95 is maintained
   indefinitely by CE for the lifespan of the equipment and must be readily available.
9.5. Training/Safety Briefings. Initial overhead crane operator training is provided by the OC-
ALC and documented in ETMS and/or TSS.

A9.2. General Information.
A9.2.1. Know the characteristics of the particular crane you are operating.
A9.2.2. Be alert; do not be distracted. Always keep your eyes on a moving load. The operator
IS ALWAYS responsible for the lift and movement of the load.
A9.2.3. Good housekeeping is a must.
A9.2.4. Ensure PPE is used and is in good repair.
A9.2.5. Inspect your machine daily before operation.
A9.2.6. Always have a fire extinguisher on hand and know how to use it.
A9.2.7. Take signals from only one person and use standards signals (refer to AFOSHSTD 91-46
for hand signals).
A9.2.8. Never exceed the rated capacity.
A9.2.9. Make a “dry run” in tight areas.
A9.2.10. Always maintain at least 2 wraps of wire rope around the drum.
A9.2.11. Use Tag Lines on loads.
A9.2.12. No “horseplay;” Don’t be a “cowboy.”
A9.3. Pre-Operational Inspection. Operators must inspect equipment daily before use, using the
OC-ALC Form 105, and document the inspection and any discrepancies on the AFTO Form 244.
Report any unsafe condition to workplace supervisor and do not operate crane until repaired.
A9.3.1. Know the location of the disconnect switch and be sure that it is readily accessible and
not blocked.
A9.3.2. Check the wire rope by lowering the block to the lowest level and looking for
kinked, crushed, cut, broken strands, or bird caged wiring.
A9.3.3. Make sure the wire rope is properly seated in its drum and sheave grooves without any
slack or overlapping.
A9.3.4. Check hooks for cracks, bending, twists or wear. Safety latch must be present. Ensure
latch is fully operational. Hooks should rotate freely in block assembly without any grinding.
A9.3.5. Sheaves should rotate freely without any grinding from the bearings. The sheave guard
must be unbroken and intact. No part of the sheave guard should be in contact with the wire rope or
sheave.
A.9.3.6. Check the block assembly for structural damage or cracks in any components.
A9.3.7. Make sure all buttons are labeled correctly.
A9.3.8. Operate all buttons to ensure they release immediately and do not stick.
A9.3.9. Check bridge and trolley brakes for hold and no drift. Also must coast to a stop to prevent

load from swinging.
A9.3.10. Check upper and lower hoist limit switches.
A9.3.11. Operate the crane and hoist for several feet in each direction that it travels. Listen for
any unusual noises. Look for any jerky movements.
A9.3.12. Trolley and trolley direction and speed must be smooth and operate at all speeds.
A9.3.13. Do not operate a crane or hoist if limit switches, steel ropes, chains, or other
components are worn or in disrepair.
A9.3.14. Last but not least, ensure no obstructions will interfere with the normal motion of the
hoist, cab, or bridge.
A9.4. Safe Operation Principles.
A9.4.1. Operators must be thoroughly familiar with all applicable standards.
A9.4.2. Do not exceed the rated load capacity of the crane, hoist, chain, slings, or other
components.
A9.4.3. Slings, load chains, and other lifting devices must be fully and securely seated in the
hook before moving a load. Remove slack from the sling, chain, or cable before lifting a load.
A9.4.4. Ensure PPE is in good repair and used (hard hat, steel toe shoes, safety glasses or
goggles, gloves, etc.).
A9.4.5. Workers in the direction of travel must be warned to move and remain clear of a
lifted move at all times.
A9.4.6. Do not suspend loads over personnel.
A9.4.7. Under no circumstances may anyone ride the hook or load.
A9.4.8. Directional movement should be made smoothly and deliberately. Avoid rapid
movements in any direction. Operate crane at full speed.
A9.4.9. To avoid swinging loads:
A9.4.9.1. Locate the hoist directly above the lifting point of the load before lifting;
A9.4.9.2. Lower loads directly below the hoist;
A9.4.9.3. Keep hoisting ropes vertical;
A9.4.9.4. Do not pull or push the load; and
A9.4.9.5. Use Tag Lines as necessary.
A9.4.10. Take up slack slowly to reduce dynamic stress.
A9.4.11. You may jog load into position if necessary.
A9.4.12. No unauthorized side pulls are allowed.
A9.4.13. Maintain 2 wraps of wire rope around the drum at all times.
A9.4.14. When lifting loads, test the hoist brakes by returning the switch to the “OFF”
(neutral) position after raising the load a few inches off the floor. If the brakes do not hold, lower
the load and do not operate the crane. Report the failure immediately and DO NOT USE until
repaired. Disconnect power and have it Locked Out/Tagged Out.
A9.4.15. Ensure loads are lifted high enough to clear obstructions before moving the bridge or
trolley. Whenever possible maintain a minimum clearance of one foot above the loads and to the
sides. Raise the load only to the height necessary to clear lower objects.
A9.4.16. Never pull a hoist by the pendent cable.
A9.4.17. Never leave the controls unattended while a load is suspended. If it becomes
necessary to leave the controls, lower the load to the floor.
A9.4.18. Know where the disconnect switch is located and make sure that it is readily
accessible and not block.
A9.4.19. If loss of electrical power occurs, place controls in the “OFF” position to prevent

unexpected startup upon restoration of power.
A9.4.20. Never operate a crane or hoist that has been Locked Out/Tagged Out or if you feel it is
unsafe to operate.
A9.4.21. Keep visual contact with signalman at all times.
