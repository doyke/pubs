305AMWI13-204     19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                          5


     1.3.1. McGuire has a designated runway selection program. Runway 06/24 is the
     primary instrument runway and will be the runway in use unless conditions such as
     weather airfield lighting, runway construction, Navigational Aid (NAVAID) availability,
     etc. dictate otherwise. Runway 06 is designated the calm wind runway (wind less than
     five knots). Either runway 18 or 36 will be designated as the secondary runway.
     Selection of the secondary runway will be based on wind, airfield/weather conditions and
     consideration for maintaining traffic flow in the same general direction (e.g. runways 24
     and 18 or runways 6 and 36).
     1.3.2. Tower operates the wind direction and velocity sensors for the primary instrument
     runway. Wind sensor information is available at all control positions. Wind information
     can be obtained from any runway, upon request, regardless of the active runway.
     1.3.3. Tower supervisor, after coordination with the RAPCON supervisor, will designate
     the runways in use IAW Federal Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) 7110.65. After
     a runway change has been made, Tower will notify the following agencies:
        1.3.3.1. Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops).
        1.3.3.2. Base Weather.
        1.3.3.3. RAPCON.
        1.3.3.4. Fire Department.
        1.3.3.5. Command Post.
     1.3.4. Suspending Runway Operations. AM Ops will send the appropriate Notice to
     Airmen (NOTAM) in response to any condition that could temporarily affect safe airfield
     operations. Prior to resuming runway operations, AM Ops personnel must conduct an
     airfield check of all affected areas. Suspension and resumption notifications shall be
     passed to the Tower. Tower personnel shall then inform RAPCON of the suspension or
     resumption.
     1.3.5. Opening and Closing Runways. Runway closures will only be authorized by the
     Airfield Manager (AFM) or designated representative, after proper coordination with the
     305th Operations Group Commander (305 OG/CC) and (Higher Headquarters) HHQ (if
     necessary). AM Ops shall send appropriate NOTAMs to close/open a runway and
     conduct an airfield check prior to opening a closed runway.
  1.4. NAVAIDS. The reporting of interruptions, malfunctions, restoration and inspection
  activities of Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) and emergency power
  generators supporting ATCALS is covered in an operations letter between the 305 OG and
  87th Mission Support Group (MSG). This operations letter explains NAVAID maintenance
  and downtime procedures. Preventative Maintenance Inspection (PMI) schedules for
  McGuire are listed in the IFR En-Route Supplement.
     1.4.1. NAVAID facilities. These include the McGuire Very High Frequency (VHF)
     Omni directional Range Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC), Instrument Landing System
     (ILS), Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (GPN-30), and Precision Approach Radar-2000
     (PAR-200). Table 2 details local NAVAID frequencies, identifiers and location.

     (OBSTACLE/AIRCRAFT/VEHICLE) IN THE HAMMERHEAD AT DEPARTURE
     END OF RUNWAY (06/24) WITHIN 500 FT OF RUNWAY CENTERLINE‖
     3.5.2. McGuire Tower shall not clear an aircraft for takeoff while an
     obstacle/aircraft/vehicle is in the hammerhead area that falls within the 6/24 departure
     area before issuing the below cautionary advisory to the effected aircrew on local control
     frequency. Phraseology: ―CAUTION (OBSTACLE HEIGHT IN FT I.E. SEVEN ZERO)
     FT AGL (OBSTACLE/AIRCRAFT/VEHICLE) IN THE HAMMERHEAD AT
     DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY (06/24) WITHIN 500 FT OF RUNWAY
     CENTERLINE‖
     3.5.3. If the height of the obstacle/aircraft/vehicle in the hammerhead area is unknown,
     the height of 70ft shall be used, as this is the highest tail height of aircraft currently in
     service. If it is an obstacle or vehicle (such as a crane) that exceeds 70ft, the height of the
     object shall be obtained from AMOPS and that shall then be used.
     3.5.4. If an obstacle/aircraft/vehicle will remain in the hammerhead within the 6/24
     departure area for a lengthy period of time, a cautionary advisory shall be entered on the
     ATIS at the Watch Supervisors discretion.
  3.6. Airfield Maintenance. All airfield maintenance shall be pre-coordinated with Airfield
  Management. Any maintenance vehicles (airfield sweeper, grass mowers, airfield lighting,
14                                                   305AMWI13-204         19 NOVEMBER 2012



 etc.) or pedestrians required to operate within the airfield environment must follow the
 procedures and guidelines outlined in JBMDLI 13-201. Airfield Management will notify
 Tower of all airfield maintenance activities that may affect ATC operations.
 3.7. Airfield Construction. All construction projects or local actions that may restrict or
 suspend the normal use of runways, taxiways or ramps will be coordinated with the AFM
 NLT 45 days prior to beginning work. Airfield Management will send NOTAMs when
 required and advise designated agencies.
     3.7.1. All construction projects on the airfield must have pre-construction meetings a
     minimum of 30 days before construction begins.
     3.7.2. Airfield pre-construction meeting members will include representatives from the

 tenant flying units no later than 72 hours prior to start. Required information includes:
     3.8.1. Time/date of exercise.
     3.8.2. Affected area of the airport movement area.
     3.8.3. ATC facilities involved and the desired degree of involvement. NOTE: ATC
     facilities participate in base exercises to the greatest extent possible, consistent with
     flying safety. Each facility Watch Supervisor (WS)/Senior Controller (SC) will ensure
     that exercise participation does not degrade ATC services to aircraft. The WS/SC can, if
     necessary, interrupt or discontinue facility participation in any exercise if flight safety is
     in question or if it interferes with the recovery of an emergency aircraft.
 3.9. Drag Chute Equipped Aircraft Procedures. If an aircraft transiting McGuire must
 utilize a drag chute, Tower will instruct the aircraft not to release its drag chute, but to taxi to
 parking with the chute in trail, if possible. If it is not possible for an aircraft to taxi with a
 drag chute attached, Tower will direct the aircraft to use Alpha or Delta taxiway, based on

   4.4. Noise Abatement Procedures.
      4.4.1. ATC instructions/directives take precedence over noise abatement procedures.
      4.4.2. From 0600-2200L all practice approaches (circling, TADD, VFR) will avoid over
      flight of JB MDL housing below 1,600ft MSL. From 2200-0600L all ―practice‖
      approaches (circling, TADD, VFR) will avoid over flight of JB MDL housing.
      4.4.3. McGuire Clinic and Deborah Hospital will not be flown over by any aircraft at any
      time.
      4.4.4. Aircraft will not fly over HCLA 1 & 2 below 2,500ft AGL when aircraft are
      parked there.
   4.5. Intersection Departures (Table 5). Tower controllers may initiate/authorize intersection
   takeoffs. The measured distance from the intersection to the runway end will not be issued to
   base aircraft unless specifically requested. The distance remaining, rounded down to the
   nearest 50 ft, from each intersection where takeoff is authorized is as follows:

Table 5. Intersection Departure Distances
  Taxiway        Runway 24          Runway 06           Runway 18
      B             2,100               7,900               N/A

   4.6. Opposite Direction Operations and Crossing Runway/Course Operations
      4.6.1. Opposite direction arrivals and departures are permitted, dependent upon existing
      traffic, to the runway in use. Unless an opposite direction operation is a known special
      mission (SKE, ALTRV, controlled departure times, alert launch, etc.), an opposite
      direction operation should not take priority over aircraft conforming to the normal traffic
      flow. This priority is not intended to be so rigorously applied as to grossly degrade air
      traffic service. Pilots who have ALTRV, timed departures, etc. will advise ground
      control of their slot time NLT 15 minutes prior to taxiing. Note: Opposite direction
      operations are defined as Runway 18 vs Runway 36 and Runway 24 vs. Runway 06 and
      runway 24 (departure) vs runway 36 (arrival).
          4.6.1.1. Opposite Direction IFR Operations Minima.
              4.6.1.1.1. Opposite direction Arrival vs. Arrival. The first arrival must have
              crossed the landing threshold prior to a succeeding aircraft continuing closer than
              ten miles on final/flying miles from the runway.
              4.6.1.1.2. Opposite direction Arrival vs. Departure or Option. An opposite
              direction IFR arrival shall not proceed inbound closer than ten NM from runway
              threshold until the IFR departure or option is airborne and altitude separated or
              turned/clear of the final approach course.
305AMWI13-204    19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            23


        4.6.1.2. Opposite Direction VFR Operations Minima.
           4.6.1.2.1. Opposite direction separation standards in paragraph 4.5.1.1. may be
           reduced to six NM when the succeeding aircraft is VFR and has the preceding
           aircraft in sight or the Tower provides visual separation if applicable.
           4.6.1.2.2. Departure/arrival: Departure must be airborne and altitude separated or
           turned/clear of the final approach course prior to the arrival reaching six mile
           final/flying miles from the runway mile final.
           4.6.1.2.3. VFR aircraft in the pattern will not turn base until an opposite direction
           departure is airborne and turned/climbed clear of the final approach course or an
           opposite direction arrival has landed.
           4.6.1.2.4. Aircraft inbound to initial for an overhead approach shall not proceed
           closer than five NM initial, not lower than 2,500 ft MSL before the departing
           aircraft is airborne and turned/clear of the final approach course. Note: 1,000 ft
           vertical separation will be required when an IFR aircraft’s flight path will overlap
           the flight path of a heavy jet/B757.
     4.6.2. Crossing Runway/Course Operations.
        4.6.2.1. Crossing Runway/Course Operations involve runways 06 and 18, runways
        06 and 36, runways 24 and 18 and runways 24 and 36 and vice versa.
        4.6.2.2. Crossing Runway/Course Operations not involving heavy aircraft, ATC shall
        apply JO 7110.65 Ch 3 sec 9 and 10. Note: Option aircraft will be considered as
        arriving aircraft until crossing landing threshold and after crossing landing threshold
        option aircraft will be considered departing aircraft for the purpose of applying
        separation criteria.
        4.6.2.3. Crossing Runway/Course Operations involving heavy jet/B757. ATC shall
        apply no less than five miles separation (when both aircraft involved are airborne) or
        two minutes separation (when at least one of the aircraft is awaiting departure on the
        ground) in those instances of Crossing Runway/Course Operations involving heavy
        jet/B757 aircraft as follows:
           4.6.2.3.1. When the heavy jet/B757 is the preceding aircraft and the succeeding
           aircraft will fly through the airborne path of the heavy jet/B757
           4.6.2.3.2. When the succeeding aircraft is operating directly behind a heavy
           jet/B757, or directly behind and less than 1,000 ft below a heavy jet/B757, or
           following a heavy jet/B757 conducting an instrument approach. Note 1: When
           applying wake turbulence separation criteria, directly behind means an aircraft is
           operating within 2,500 ft of the flight path of the leading aircraft over the surface
           of the earth. Note 2: Application of these procedures does not relieve controllers
           from the responsibility of providing other appropriate separation contained in JO
           7110.65, AFI 13-204V3 or other superseding orders.
        4.6.2.4. Crossing Runway/Course Separation Exceptions
           4.6.2.4.1. IAW FAAO 7110.65 para 3.10.4, VFR aircraft may land on a crossing
           runway behind a heavy jet/B757 when arrival paths will cross. EXAMPLE-
24                                               305AMWI13-204        19 NOVEMBER 2012



            “Runway six cleared to land. Caution wake turbulence, Heavy C-17 landing
            runway three six.”
            4.6.2.4.2. ATC shall apply no less than five miles initial radar separation for
            departure vs departure Crossing Runway/Course operations involving runways 18
            and 24 for all aircraft types. In the aforementioned operation the five miles
            separation is measured from the crossing point of the departure flight paths. Note
            1: IAW FAAO 7110.65 para 4.5.2.4b, the five miles separation criteria may be
            reduced to meet applicable FAAO 7110.65 separation standards when coordinated
            between ATC facilities.
     4.6.3. Pilots requesting Opposite Direction or Crossing Runway/Course operations must
     be prepared to expeditiously comply with ATC instructions.
 4.7. Circling Approaches. Practice circling approaches are authorized and will be
 permitted in conjunction with other traffic by ATC. These approaches will be IAW
 published approach procedures except:
     4.7.1. Circling approaches will not be practiced from 2200L - 0600L for noise
     abatement. EXCEPTION: Approach to runway 36 circle for runway 06 or approach to
     runway 06 circle for runway 36.
     4.7.2. Aircraft executing practice-circling approaches will avoid JB MDL housing areas,
     McGuire Clinic and Deborah Hospital in Browns Mills, NJ.
     4.7.3. Requests for circling approaches are approved by Tower based upon known or
     anticipated traffic. The circling approach maneuvers listed below offer the best
     opportunity for approval. Other circling approach maneuvers restrict airport operations
     due to conflicting aircraft flight paths/wake turbulence separation requirements and may
     not be practical when other aircraft are present.
        4.7.3.1. From runway 06 to a left base for runway 36.
        4.7.3.2. From runway 36 to a right base for runway 06.
        4.7.3.3. From runway 24 to a left base for runway 18.
        4.7.3.4. From runway 18 to a right base for runway 24.
     4.7.4. Locally assigned aircraft conducting circling approaches, when executing a missed
     approach/go around from a circling approach, will execute a climbing turn in the
     direction of the runway of intended landing, intercept final approach course for the
     runway of intended landing, and then execute local climb out. Note: This procedure
     applies to local training missions conducting practice approaches only.
        4.7.4.1. Aircraft conducting circling approaches as published in Flight Information
        Publication (FLIP) due to operational necessity will comply with missed approach
        procedures as outlined in AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures
        (i.e. fly missed approach procedure for the approach flown, not to the runway of
        intended landing) and notify Tower/RAPCON of intended missed approach as soon
        as possible. Note: It is imperative that pilots advise ATC if executing a missed
305AMWI13-204        19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                       25


            approach for the approach flown, and not to the runway of intended landing, to
            deconflict potential Crossing Runway/Course operations.
            4.7.4.2. Crossing runway/course separation if applicable, will be applied IAW
            section 4.5.2 for circling approaches to the runway of intended landing. Ex: Rwy 18
            Circle Rwy 24, with an aircraft conducting approaches to Rwy 24, no crossing
            runway/course separation required, standard FAAO 7110.65 separation criteria will
            apply.
      4.7.5. To de-conflict with traffic within Class D airspace, pilots may be instructed to
      maintain an altitude at or below 1,100 ft MSL while circling.
   4.8. Category II ILS Operations.
      4.8.1. In order to conduct Category (CAT) II ILS operations to runway 06, the
      equipment listed in Table 6 must be operational. This table will also indicate what
      equipment can be in/out of service and still be usable for CAT II ILS operations, as well
      as required NOTAMS.

      4.8.2. Aircraft or vehicles in the ILS critical areas will temporarily suspend CAT II ILS
      operations during CAT II weather conditions.
26                                                  305AMWI13-204        19 NOVEMBER 2012



     4.8.3. The above criteria were extracted from AFMAN 32-1076, Design Standards for
     Visual Air Navigation Facilities and FAAO 6750.24D, Instrument Landing System and
     Ancillary Electronic Component Configuration and Performance Requirements.
 4.9. Local Clearance for Base Assigned Aircraft.
     4.9.1. Aircraft shall contact clearance delivery prior to taxi for local IFR clearance.
     Aircraft must then contact ground control for taxi instructions.
     4.9.2. Aircraft that taxi back will receive their local clearance from clearance delivery
     again prior to contacting ground control for taxi instructions for their successive
     departure.
     4.9.3. For locally assigned aircraft that depart the Tower VFR pattern to enter the radar
     pattern, an altitude and turn issued by the radar controller is considered IFR clearance to
     McGuire via the requested approach. Aircraft in the VFR pattern requesting to enter the
     radar pattern shall coordinate with Tower one pattern prior to entering the radar pattern.
 4.10. Multiple Approaches/Standard Climbout. Standard climb out for multiple practice
 approaches shall be: fly runway heading, climb and maintain at or below 1600 until
 departure end then climb and maintain 2000. When given ―EXECUTE LOCAL
 CLIMBOUT" this procedure shall be adhered to.
 4.11. Protection of the 360-degree Overhead Pattern. When the overhead pattern is in
 use, all IFR/VFR aircraft that depart or are on the go, shall be issued a restriction to maintain
 at or below 1,600 ft until runway departure end before climbing to the assigned altitude.
 Example: ―(CALL SIGN), MAINTAIN AT OR BELOW 1600 UNTIL DEPARTURE END
 THEN CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 2000‖.
 4.12. Standard Go Around and Breakout Procedures.
     4.12.1. Go Around procedures.
        4.12.1.1. IFR Aircraft inside the final approach fix will execute local climbout and
        expect radar vectors.
        4.12.1.2. VFR aircraft will fly runway heading, climb to the appropriate pattern
        altitude and await instructions from the Tower.
     4.12.2. When a go around will not alleviate the conflict inside the final approach fix,
     Tower shall specify the direction of breakout; example: ―(CALL SIGN), BREAKOUT
     TO THE WEST (reason)‖. The aircraft will be transferred to RAPCON to be
     reestablished in the approach/arrival pattern.
     4.12.3. Breakout Procedures. When an aircraft is outside the final approach fix, Tower
     will coordinate breakout procedures with RAPCON. If time does not permit
     coordination, the following standard procedures shall be applied:
        4.12.3.1. Runway 24: Turn right heading 360, climb and maintain 2,000 ft, contact
        arrival
        4.12.3.2. Runway 06: Turn right heading 180, climb and maintain 2,000 ft, contact
        arrival
305AMWI13-204     19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                           27


         4.12.3.3. Runway 36: Turn Right Heading 150, climb and maintain 2,000 ft, contact
         arrival
         4.12.3.4. Runway 18: Turn left heading 060, climb and maintain 2,000 ft, contact
         arrival
         4.12.3.5. Aircraft will be informed: ―(CALL SIGN) APPROACH CLEARANCE
         CANCELED, TURN LEFT/RIGHT (HEADING), MAINTAIN (ALTITUDE)‖.
  4.13. Local Aircraft Handling Priorities.
     4.13.1. FAAO 7110.65 governs aircraft operational priorities. Excluding FAA or local
     priorities, traffic will be handled on a first-come, first-served basis.
     4.13.2. Local Aircraft Priorities. Except for the priorities set forth in FAAO 7110.65,
     local aircraft priorities will be provided in the following order:
         4.13.2.1. JCS Priority missions as defined by Air Mobility Command Instruction
         (AMCI) 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations.
         4.13.2.2. OPLAN 8010 Missions. EXCEPTION: These aircraft will be given top
         priority when on a USSTRATCOM-assigned mission IAW BUGGY RIDE/BUST
         OUT LOA.
         4.13.2.3. Distinguished Visitor (DV) arrivals/departures.
         4.13.2.4. AMC Controlled Departure Time sorties (defined exclusively as sorties in
         which an airdrop route or an air-refueling route [either tanker or receiver] is planned
         as the first activity after takeoff). NOTE: The term "Controlled Departure Time"
         (CDT) does not apply to "on time" departure-window requirements (e.g. the "pad").
         However, this priority may be requested by 87 ABW Command Post for AMC
         missions.
         4.13.2.5. Drop mission formations and SKE missions.
         4.13.2.6. IFR Full Stop Landings.
         4.13.2.7. IFR Departures (Non-local pattern, Tower or RADAR).
         4.13.2.8. Practice VFR Tactical Arrivals and Departures (TADs).
         4.13.2.9. Practice Approaches.
     4.13.3. Aircrews will notify ground control NLT 15 minutes prior to their CDT and
     inform the controller of their actual CDT. Delaying to call Tower/ground control until
     the runway hold short line may not provide sufficient time for the controller to re-
     sequence traffic or guarantee a RADAR release to meet the required CDT. Once traffic
     has been vectored to final and transferred from RAPCON to Tower control, an inbound
     aircraft will have priority over departures that are not pre-coordinated with
     Tower/ground.
     4.13.4. Where a conflict exists, McGuire Airfield facilities will provide ATC services on
     a priority basis, consistent with flight safety and the orderly movement of air traffic.
     When aircraft with identical priorities are in direct conflict, 87 ABW/CP shall determine
     priority.
28                                                305AMWI13-204        19 NOVEMBER 2012



     4.13.5. Aircraft may be afforded priority over other operations when specifically
     requested by 87 ABW/CP. The 87 ABW/CP will coordinate the request with AM Ops.
     AM Ops will inform ATC facilities of any special priority requests.
 4.14. Flight Planning Procedures.
     4.14.1. All aircraft departing McGuire airfield must have a flight plan on file with AM
     Ops prior to takeoff.
        4.14.1.1. See Section 6.2. for flight filing procedures for local VFR flight plans for
        tenant squadron helicopter operations.
     4.14.2. Crews may file their flight plan in person at AM Ops.
     4.14.3. Flight plans may be sent to AM Ops via:
        4.14.3.1. Fax, ext 754-6465. A confirmation call by the sender is required after the
        transmitted fax machine indicates it has been completed. The pilot in command is
        responsible for assuring the flight plan is transmitted to AM Ops at least one hour
        prior to aircraft takeoff (two hours for international (ICAO) flight plans).
        4.14.3.2. Email. Electronically signed flight plans, or scanned copies of signed flight
        plans may be sent to AM Ops inbox (SCC-BASEOP/McGuire AFB) at
        SCCBASEOP@us.af.mil. A confirmation call by the sender is required after the
        email is indicated as sent. The pilot in command is responsible for assuring the flight
        plan is emailed to AM Ops at least one hour prior to aircraft takeoff (two hours for
        international (ICAO) flight plans). NOTE: This does not apply to alert missions.
     4.14.4. The user will maintain the original flight plan IAW WEB-RIMS Records
     Disposition Schedule (RDS).
     4.14.5. In the event a crew must change or amend their original flight plan once on-board
     the aircraft, the following procedures will be followed:
        4.14.5.1. The crew will contact AM Ops via Pilot-to-Dispatch (PTD) radio and
        provide the desired flight change information.
        4.14.5.2. AM Ops will input the amended flight plan into the Aeronautical
        Information System Replacement (AIS-R). The revised flight plan will carry a Full
        Route clearance remark and will require full read-back to Clearance Delivery to
        ensure the accuracy of the changed routing.
     4.14.6. IAW AFI 11-255V3, Intergraded Flight Management Responsibilities and
     Procedures, Flight Manager coordination is required for any changes to filed ATS flight
     plans for flight managed sorties (originating AIS address KRCHYXYX for TACC only.
     In circumstances where operational requirements necessitate a flight plan change and
     prior coordination with the Flight Manager is not possible, the Aircraft Commander may
     approve a flight plan change from an authorized alternative agency (e.g., Airfield
     Operations, Flight Service Station, etc.,), but must coordinate the change with the Flight
     Manager as soon as practical.
305AMWI13-204      19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            29


  4.15. No Flight Plan Departures/Arrivals and Unauthorized Arrivals.
     4.15.1. When ―no flight plan‖ aircraft contact the Tower for engine start or landing
     clearance, Tower will verify with AM Ops that the aircraft has a flight plan on file. If
     there is not a flight plan on file, Tower will deny engine start approval or landing
     clearance, unless an emergency exists. EXCEPTION: Alert aircraft may start engines
     prior to contacting tower for taxi and takeoff clearance.
     4.15.2. Unless an emergency exists, Tower will refuse landing clearance to all civilian
     ―no flight plan‖ aircraft requesting to land at McGuire Airfield until AM Ops grants
     approval.
     4.15.3. In the event of an unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft arrival, Tower will
     activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). Tower will direct the aircraft to turn
     off the runway at the first available taxiway and hold position. AM Ops will activate the
     Secondary Crash Net (SCN) immediately after activation of the PCAS. NOTE: An
     unauthorized/unidentified aircraft is defined as any aircraft with which communications
     has not been established prior to landing and/or any other aircraft that has been denied
     landing privileges yet does not follow instructions.
         4.15.3.1. If the flight cannot be confirmed as being valid, AM Ops will notify
         Security Forces IAW JB MDL Integrated Defense Plan (JIDP).
         4.15.3.2. In the event the pilot does not follow the Tower's instructions and continues
         to taxi, the Tower will treat that operation as an unauthorized aircraft movement IAW
         Annex M, Appendix 11, JIDP.
  4.16. Inbound Aircraft Notifications. AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and
  Programs specifically states the conditions under which ATC will forward information
  concerning inbound aircraft. It is the responsibility of the aircrew to notify Command
  Post/AM Ops of their pending arrival if transporting DVs, or if it is a special interest flight.
  ATC will not routinely be the focal point for the dissemination of this information. The
  FLIP/IFR Enroute Supplement contains published frequencies for contacting Command
  Post/AM Ops. This capability must be utilized to the maximum extent.
  4.17. Local Procedures for Forwarding IFR Flight Plans.
     4.17.1. AM Ops shall:
         4.17.1.1. Notify Tower of all proposed flight plans. All aircraft that will remain in
         McGuire's airspace shall be identified as "Locals." All other aircraft shall be
         identified as "Departures‖ (include type departure procedure).
         4.17.1.2. Notify RAPCON of all IFR proposed departures that will remain in
         McGuire's airspace.
         4.17.1.3. Transmit IFR departure flight plans via Aeronautical Information System
         Replacement (AISR) to New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (NYARTCC).
         EXCEPTION: Departures that intend to remain entirely within McGuire RAPCON
         airspace (i.e., flights from McGuire to Lakehurst or South Jersey Regional, etc.), and
         altitude reservation (ALTRV) flights will be forwarded to the RAPCON.
30                                                  305AMWI13-204      19 NOVEMBER 2012



        4.17.1.4. When the NYARTCC computer, McGuire RAPCON flight data system
        (FDS) or the AISR are out of service, call all IFR departure flight plan information to
        Flight Service Station (FSS) and McGuire RAPCON. EXCEPTION: Departures
        intending to remain within McGuire RAPCON delegated airspace or in the Tower
        enroute control (TEC) system, as defined in the Department of Defense (DOD) Flight
        Information Publication, Airport/Facility Directory for Northeast U.S.
        4.17.1.5. Forward the following departure flight plan information to RAPCON when
        required:
            4.17.1.5.1. Aircraft identification.
            4.17.1.5.2. Number and type aircraft, including navigational/beacon equip suffix.
            4.17.1.5.3. Proposed Estimated Time of Departure (ETD).
            4.17.1.5.4. Requested final altitude.
            4.17.1.5.5. Departure Procedure/route of flight.
            4.17.1.5.6. Destination.
            4.17.1.5.7. Time en route.
            4.17.1.5.8. Remarks.
 4.18. ASR/Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) Outages.
 During RADAR outages, local training missions will be terminated. Aircraft have the option
 to depart the area or fly VFR with the Tower. NOTE: McGuire has two RADAR feeds;
 Primary: The McGuire RADAR (AN/GPN-30 DASR) and Secondary: Gibbsboro RADAR
 (ARSR-4). The Gibbsboro RADAR feed is only used if the McGuire RADAR feed is not
 operational. Vectors for approaches are not available when the Gibbsboro RADAR feed is
 being used (due to a 13 second scan delay). Pilots can expect approach clearance from the
 initial approach fixes when Gibbsboro is being utilized.
 4.19. Airborne Radar Approaches/Airborne Radar Directed Approaches (ARA/
 ARDA). Due to no published ARA/ARDA approaches at McGuire Airfield, aircraft
 requesting either of these approaches shall be vectored and cleared for a VOR, TACAN or
 ILS (Localizer only) approach. Once the aircraft is established on downwind, the pilot may
 request to resume own navigation to turn final. Aircraft choosing this maneuver can expect a
 12 DME restriction to comply with noise abatement procedures.
 4.20. Civil aircraft, other than emergencies, will not be allowed to land unless an approved
 civil aircraft landing permit number/aircraft landing authorization number is on file and
 verified at AM Ops IAW AFI 10-1001 Civil Aircraft Landing Permits. Upon verification
 from AM Ops, a PPR number will be issued to allow for landing at McGuire Airfield.
     4.20.1. Civil Use of McGuire ATCALS. Civil aviation aircraft are authorized to use
     McGuire ATCALS for practice approaches. However, use is restricted to low approaches
     only, traffic conditions permitting.
 4.21. Unusual Maneuvers. Unusual maneuvers are not authorized in the McGuire Class D
 Airspace, except as authorized by local operating procedures. Unusual maneuvers include:
305AMWI13-204      19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                             31


  any intentional maneuver involving an abrupt change in an aircraft’s altitude, an abnormal
  altitude, or abnormal acceleration not necessary for normal flight. IAW FAAO 7110.65,
  unusual maneuvers will not be approved unless they are essential to performance of flight in
  Class D Airspace. All requests must be coordinated through 305 OSS/OSA and approved by
  305 OG/CC.
  4.22. Precision Approach Radar (PAR). McGuire operates a PAR-2000 precision
  approach radar. The McGuire feed radar must be in service for PAR approach capability. In
  the event the McGuire radar feed is out of service, PAR approaches will be unavailable.
  Hours of availability for PAR approaches are as published in the NOTAMS or IFR
  Supplement.
     4.22.1. MAG-49 will coordinate with 305 OSS/OSA for any additional PAR
     requirements based on flight operations and drill schedules.
  4.23. Tactical Arrival/Departure Procedures. Procedures for tactical arrival/departure
  (TAD) operations can be found in the JB-MDL TAD/NVG LOA.
  4.24. KC-10 / KC-135 Cell Departure Procedures. All KC-10 and KC-135 cell departures
  shall be conducted in nonstandard formation using MARSA procedures. When initially
  calling ground control for taxi, aircraft will identify themselves as a cell departure with their
  companion cell aircraft. For example "...CELL DEPARTURE WITH OPEC 41 AND
  FORCE 32.‖
     4.24.1. RAPCON shall:
         4.24.1.1. Assign a block altitude to allow intra-cell vertical spacing of 500 ft between
         each aircraft in the formation, and shall assign block altitudes for initial, interim, and
         final altitudes.
         4.24.1.2. Assign each aircraft an individual beacon code and have them squawk on
         departure.
         4.24.1.3. Assign all nonstandard formation departures the breakup fix as the
         clearance limit, IAW FAAO 7110.65.
         4.24.1.4. Issue control instructions for the flight to the lead aircraft. (i.e., ―TEAM 51
         HEAVY FLIGHT,….‖)ATC will not issue instructions for the flight until all aircraft
         in the flight are airborne, unless necessary for safety of flight.
         4.24.1.5. Issue individual control instructions to single aircraft in the flight as
         necessary (radar contact, traffic, emergency action, for example).
     4.24.2. The lead aircraft shall:
         4.24.2.1. Ensure each element of the flight has the correct ATC instructions,
         including individual squawks for departure.
         4.24.2.2. Request a change to departure after takeoff clearance has been issued and
         before departure roll.
     4.24.3. Tower shall ensure that all applicable information is issued prior to frequency
     change. If needed, Tower will issue additional instructions on guard.
 32                                                  305AMWI13-204        19 NOVEMBER 2012



      4.24.4. On departure, all aircraft will squawk the IFR code assigned by clearance
      delivery.
      4.24.5. After the lead aircraft has departed, the other elements in the flight may request
      visual cutoff to join. McGuire RAPCON will respond to the request with ―VISUAL
      CUT-OFF APPROVED‖ or ―UNABLE DUE TO (REASON), REMAIN ON THE
      DEPARTURE PROCEDURE.‖
      4.24.6. In night/IMC, ATC will allow the flight to remain on the departure procedure, to
      the maximum extent possible.
      4.24.7. If entering McGuire airspace in a flight, aircraft may request break up and
      vectors for approaches.
5. Emergency Procedures
   5.1. Firefighting/Rescue Capability. During reduced firefighting/rescue capability at
   McGuire, certain operational restrictions exist. AM Ops will verify the firefighting/rescue
   capabilities status daily upon completion of the primary and secondary crash phone checks.
   Anytime a major piece of Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting equipment is out of service, the Fire
   Chief or their representative will personally brief the AFM or designated representative. AM
   Ops will complete the Firefighting/Rescue Capability QRC and send any applicable
   NOTAMs.
   5.2. Reporting USAF Mishaps. Designated Wing Safety Officers will notify appropriate
   chains of command for any mishaps occurring on McGuire Airfield.
   5.3. Jettison of Aircraft Stores.
      5.3.1. Primary Salvo Area. When possible, external stores will be jettisoned over the
      ocean in Warning Area 107. Recommend the Coyle VORTAC 120 radial be intercepted
      and flown so the item can be jettisoned beyond 20 DME at or below 2,500 ft.
      5.3.2. Secondary External Stores Jettison Area. A secondary area for emergency use
      only is a 1 nautical square mile area located in the center of the Ft Dix Firing Range
      (R5001A/B). The center of the drop area is 4.6 DME on the GXU 095 degree radial.
      The center point of the western edge is 7 NM south of the southern tip of Brindle Lake
      (Attachment 13). CAUTION: Use of this Emergency External Stores Jettison Area
      must be coordinated with Tower and requires at least 15 minutes advance notice to shut
      down the firing range.
      5.3.3. If aircraft parts/stores are inadvertently dropped in other than designated areas, the
      pilot will pinpoint the area of the drop and immediately upon landing, report particulars
      concerning the incident to AM Ops and the unit's operations section and complete
      necessary dropped object report. If under RAPCON control, notify the controller
      immediately so he/she can mark the position on the radar indicator. If dropped object is
      suspected of being on the airfield, operations will be suspended along the aircraft’s
      previous route.
      5.3.4. If a dump/spill of fuel (hazardous discharge) occurs over the state of New Jersey,
      state law requires that the amount and type of discharge, location in flight (RAD/DME or
305AMWI13-204     19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                            33


     Lat./Log.), wind speed and direction at the time of the discharge and the likely areas to be
     affected be reported to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
     Communication Center.
     5.3.5. Emergency Fuel Jettison Procedure. (Attachment 14)
        5.3.5.1. PREPI intersection (CYN 100 degree radial at 54 DME, RBV 122 degree
        radial at 62 DME) has been designated as the emergency fuel jettison area for the 108
        Wing (108 WG), 514 AMW, and 305 AMW.
        5.3.5.2. Hold east of PREPI intersection, 7NM legs with right turns. Altitudes may
        vary from 5,000 to 17,000 ft MSL as assigned by New York Center. Prior
        coordination with Atlantic City Approach control is required before approving 5,000
        ft. Preferred pattern altitudes are:
            5.3.5.2.1. Abort pattern: 5,000 ft MSL.
            5.3.5.2.2. Emergency Fuel Jettison pattern: 5,000 17,000 ft MSL. NOTE: ATC
            personnel may vary these procedures based on the individual emergency (i.e.,
            length of holding leg, altitude assignment).
  5.4. Bailout Procedures.
     5.4.1. Time permitting, aircraft in distress will contact McGuire RAPCON on an
     emergency frequency, place the aircraft transponder to emergency setting and proceed to
     the Coyle VORTAC at an altitude of 3,000 ft MSL. All personnel except the pilot will
     bail out over the Coyle VORTAC. The pilot will fly a magnetic heading of 120 degrees
     for a period of two minutes past Coyle VORTAC or until reaching the coastline. The
     aircraft will be flown at the specified Tech Order KTAS, trimmed for level flight, the
     auto pilot will be engaged, if operable, and then the pilot will abandon the aircraft.
     NOTE: Fighter aircraft will turn to magnetic heading of 120 degrees over the Coyle
     VORTAC, reduce power to idle and eject.
     5.4.2. RAPCON will.
        5.4.2.1. Alert Tower, AM Ops and the applicable ATC agency as required by
        USAF/FAA directives.
        5.4.2.2. Monitor aircraft position with radar.
        5.4.2.3. Request the pilot to advise ATC when bail out is started. ATC will radar
        plot the bailout point to assist in rescue/recovery operations.
        5.4.2.4. Monitor the aircraft trajectory to determine the crash location.
        5.4.2.5. Notify Tower of bailout.
     5.4.3. Tower will activate the primary crash alarm system when bailout procedures are
     used.

  (CPIs). McGuire Tower will notify AM Ops and RAPCON each time they receive an UHF
  ELT/CPI signal.
34                                                 305AMWI13-204         19 NOVEMBER 2012



     5.5.1. AM Ops will provide all available information to required agencies per applicable
     QRC (i.e., frequency, strength of signal, time initially heard).
     5.5.2. RAPCON will coordinate with AM Ops and Tower to comply with appropriate air
     traffic procedures IAW FAAO 7110.65 if an ELT/CPI signal is determined to be located
     somewhere off base either through ground search or airborne pilot reports.
     5.5.3. Aircrew Flight Equipment will:
        5.5.3.1. Immediately dispatch specialists with the necessary equipment to locate and
        deactivate the ELT/CPI.
        5.5.3.2. Notify AM Ops of the results of the search.
        5.5.3.3. Document actions as required.
 5.6. Operation of the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS)/ Emergency Response
 Procedures. The Tower, AM Ops, Fire Headquarters, Flight Medicine and Primary Care
 Clinic comprise the local PCAS. Each agency has transmit and receive capability. The
 system can be activated only from the Tower. The following procedures govern the
 activation and use of the system.
     5.6.1. McGuire Tower will:
        5.6.1.1. Activate the PCAS for all aircraft mishaps, military or civilian, observed or
        reported, within McGuire's airspace. The PCAS will also be activated for all in-flight
        and ground emergencies, suspected hijack/unauthorized aircraft movements, aircraft
        bomb threats, hot brakes, fuel spills (when requested by Fire Dept.), and as directed
        by the Tower watch supervisor or Aircraft Commander.
            5.6.1.1.1. All parties will remain on system until told to secure net.
            5.6.1.1.2. In the case of an imminent emergency situation, the Tower will provide
            minimum information of callsign, type aircraft, nature of emergency and pilot’s
            desires to alert fire headquarters and to expedite their response time. All other
            information will be passed as received on a time permitting basis.
        5.6.1.2. Hold the movement of ground traffic affecting the emergency response until
        emergency equipment is positioned in the designated standby points. Ground traffic
        that can be routed clear of emergency equipment may continue operations.
        5.6.1.3. Discontinue all arrivals, departures, taxi operations and affected ground
        traffic movements in sufficient time to ensure availability of the landing area to
        emergency aircraft.
        5.6.1.4. Reactivate the PCAS if the aircraft actually crashes, veers off the runway or
        other airport surface or essential information is received. Aircraft location will be
        given in general terms. Grid coordinates will be given if requested by the fire
        department. NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, Fire Chief or senior fire officer on
        scene will be designated as the on scene commander. Duties and responsibilities of
        this person will be IAW applicable CES regulations.
305AMWI13-204     19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                        35


         5.6.1.5. Upon termination of fire fighting/rescue operations, and/or maintenance
         activities connected with the emergency by the on scene commander, resume normal
         operations after authorization by Airfield Management.
         5.6.1.6. Perform a daily operational check of the PCAS at 0830L to ensure
         satisfactory operation. All outages and malfunctions should be reported immediately
         to JCC/NCMO (305 CS Job Control).
         5.6.1.7. Monday-Friday, 0730-1600L, Flight Medicine will answer and respond to
         the crash phone activation. Ambulatory service will acknowledge and respond to
         crash phone activation when Flight Medicine is closed.
     5.6.2. McGuire RAPCON will notify the Tower of an emergency aircraft under its
     control with the following information: aircraft call sign, aircraft type, nature of
     emergency, fuel remaining, personnel on board, estimated time of arrival, landing runway
     and cargo or weapons information (if available). If RAPCON becomes aware of a
     suspected hijack/unauthorized movement inbound to McGuire Airfield RAPCON will
     notify the Tower who in turn will activate the PCAS IAW paragraph 5.6.1.1.
  5.7. Operation of the Secondary Crash Net (SCN). This circuit can only be activated by
  AM Ops. SCN agencies are limited to those agencies requiring emergency action/response
  to aircraft accidents/incidents. The SCN stations include: 87 ABW Command Post, AM Ops,
  Fire Department, Weather, EOD, Flight Medicine, Security Forces, Safety, Public Affairs,
  Ambulatory Services, 108 WG Command Post, CE, Emergency Management and Vehicle
  operations. AM Ops will:
     5.7.1. Activate the SCN for all observed or reported emergencies.
     5.7.2. Transmit all available information immediately upon receipt. MAFB Form 15,
     Emergency Notification Checklist will be utilized for recording and passing information.
     All information will be repeated verbatim. When questions are necessary they will be
     acknowledged after all information has been transmitted. If there are no further
     questions, each station is automatically released upon receipt and understanding of the
     message.
     5.7.3. Notify all agencies, using the SCN, if additional information is received.
     5.7.4. Use the SCN and pass termination of emergency messages. Example: ―The in-
     flight emergency on Reach 8053, C-17, Terminated at 0935 Local. If there are no
     questions, all parties are released.‖
     5.7.5. Perform a daily check with all stations at 0835L to insure the system is
     operational. This should be done after the PCAS check. All outages and malfunctions
     must be reported immediately for repair/fix action.
  5.8. NAVAID Emergency Warning and Evacuation Alarm. The emergency warning and
  evacuation alarm system is used to notify personnel in and around the Localizers, VORTAC,
  Glideslopes, and Inner markers that an emergency aircraft is approaching to land.
     5.8.1. Tower will activate the alarm any time an aircraft with a known or suspected
     emergency condition intending to land at McGuire Airfield has commenced approach and
     is within 10 NM of the runway. Tower will deactivate the alarm when the hazard no
     longer exists.
36                                                  305AMWI13-204         19 NOVEMBER 2012



     5.8.2. The alarm located at all airfield sites will be inspected by maintenance personnel
     IAW work center inspection criteria.
 5.9. Evacuation of ATC Facilities. Watch supervisors will direct the evacuation of their
 respective ATC facility for any emergency situation as deemed necessary (e.g. fire, bomb
 threat, etc.). Air traffic control services shall be limited until primary facilities are returned
 to service. ATC facilities will only be evacuated in the event of a real (not exercised)
 emergency as required. There are no alternate Tower or RAPCON facilities/procedures at
 McGuire Airfield. NOTE: All actions will be performed on a time permitting basis. Safety
 of personnel will be paramount.
     5.9.1. Tower ONLY evacuation.
        5.9.1.1. Tower shall:
            5.9.1.1.1. Activate the primary crash alarm system. State "MCGUIRE TOWER

    7.5. Rescue Protection for Aeromedical Airlift Aircraft. The following procedures are
    required only when the pilot requests AIREVAC priority handling.
305AMWI13-204      19 NOVEMBER 2012                                                             45


     7.5.1. Tower is the focal point for all requests for information pertaining to these aircraft.
     7.5.2. The Tower will notify the fire department via landline of the arrival of
     Aeromedical Airlift Aircraft when the pilot requests AIREVAC priority handling.
  7.6. Bird/Wildlife Control and Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. For
  detailed guidance on the McGuire bird/wildlife control program, refer to SPLAN 91-212, JB
  MDL BASH Plan. Two BASH reduction phases are implemented at McGuire.
     7.6.1. Phase I. The period from December through July. Historical data shows these
     months to have relatively few bird strikes.
     7.6.2. Phase II. Period of historically high bird activity. Phase II is implemented by the
     installation Bird Hazard Working Group (normally 1 Aug - 30 Nov). Additional
     restrictions (as outlined in JB MDL BASH Plan 91-212, the IFR supplement and
     NOTAMS) apply during this period.
     7.6.3. Bird Hazard Conditions (BHC). BHC is the same as Bird Watch Condition. Bird
     activity includes any birds that may create a hazard. Listed below are standard BHC that
     will be used at McGuire Airfield to warn aircrew and support personnel of the current
     bird threat to operations. Conditions are as follows.
         7.6.3.1. BHC LOW: Normal bird activity (as a guide, fewer than five large birds
         (waterfowl, raptors, gulls, etc.) or fewer than 15 small birds (terns, swallows, etc.) on
         or above the airfield with a low probability of hazard.
         7.6.3.2. BHC MODERATE: Increased bird population (approximately five to 15
         large birds or 15 to 30 small birds) in locations that represent an increased potential
         for strike.
         7.6.3.3. BHC SEVERE: Defined as high bird population (as a guide, more than 15
         large birds or more than 30 small birds) on or immediately above the runway or other
         specific locations (taxiways, infield areas, departure or arrival corridors, etc.) that
         represents a high potential for strike. NOTE: Keep in mind a single bird in a critical
         location may elevate the BHC to moderate or severe (i.e., vulture).
     7.6.4. Operational restrictions apply to all AMC aircraft operating at McGuire Airfield.
     Deviations require operating units OG/CC (or equivalent) or higher approval.
     Tenant/supported unit aircrew’s chain of command is best positioned to apply ORM
     principles in weighing the increased risk of a bird strike against the operational needs of
     the unit.
         7.6.4.1. BHC LOW: No operational restrictions apply, however personnel are
         reminded to maintain vigilance for bird and wildlife hazards.
         7.6.4.2. BHC MODERATE: All local Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)/Visual Flight
         Rules (VFR) all traffic pattern training activity will cease. The Pilot in Command is
         the approval authority for takeoffs and landings during BHC Moderate. ATC and
         Command Post, in coordination with AM Ops, will advise aircraft on anticipated
         delay, if known, for bird dispersal or a return to BHC Low. Airborne aircraft will
         divert, hold, or full-stop.
46                                                305AMWI13-204         19 NOVEMBER 2012



        7.6.4.3. BHC SEVERE: All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Airborne aircraft
        will divert or hold. Deviations require operating unit’s OG/CC (or equivalent) or
        higher approval.
 7.7. Airfield Photography
     7.7.1. IAW JIDP, all photography in restricted areas within the legal confines of
     McGuire Airfield is prohibited unless authorized by the Chief, Public Affairs Division.
     The AFM is the alternate approving official for photography on the airfield.
     7.7.2. Non public affairs personnel shall be authorized airfield photography only by a
     letter signed by the Public Affairs Division or designated representative.
        7.7.2.1. Letter must be hand carried while photographing in restricted areas.
        7.7.2.2. Individuals taking pictures without an approved letter shall be escorted out of
        the restricted area, and their film or digital record file confiscated.
     7.7.3. An AF Form 52, Evidence Tag, will be issued as a receipt for the confiscated film.
     AFOSI should be notified and, at their discretion, given the opportunity to interview the
     subject.
     7.7.4. Public Affairs personnel must escort all news media personnel photographing on
     McGuire Airfield at all times.
     7.7.5. The maximum ratio of escortees to escorts on McGuire Airfield is ten to one. (A
     maximum of ten personnel being escorted by one escort official in the airfield restricted
     area IAW AFI 31-101).
 7.8. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Procedures for Requesting Changes. AM
 Ops shall review each new FLIP edition for accuracy and consistency of airfield related data.
 Agencies or personnel requesting changes or additions to the FLIPs shall route requests
