                                                Chapter 1

                         THE VEHICLE CONTROL OFFICER CONCEPT

1.1. Vehicle Control. The Air Force adopted the Vehicle Control Officer (VCO) concept to help manage
and maintain the vehicles assigned to each organization or agency. As the Primary or Alternate VCO you
must ensure that you devote a concentrated effort through your unit or agency to achieve this goal. Should
a question arise regarding vehicle matters (See Attachment 2) for contact information.

1.2. Uses. The VCO and the Vehicle Control Non-Commissioned Officer (VCNCO) has many duties to
ensure the basic goals of vehicle management and care of the unit vehicle fleet are met. These duties are
outlined below:
    1.2.1. Act as a liaison between your unit and the 62d Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS). The VCO
    is the focal point for all government vehicle matters for your unit.
    1.2.2. Control unit vehicles and obtain additional transportation services, when required, to meet your
    unit’s mission.
    1.2.3. Defend requirements, when necessary, for existing vehicles, justify requests for additional
    vehicle requirements, and comply with all aspects of the vehicle rotation program.
    1.2.4. Make sure organizational (operator) maintenance is performed, report vehicle malfunctions to
    the vehicle maintenance customer service section, and ensure vehicles are made available for sched-
    uled maintenance and safety inspections.
    1.2.5. Prevent misuse, abuse, and damage to unit vehicles, investigate incidents of abuse, misuse and
    accidents, and recommend corrective action to your commander.
    1.2.6. Ensure only qualified and licensed personnel operate assigned vehicles or specialized mounted
    equipment. Notify the Operator Records and Licensing section of any change in operator's driving sta-
    tus (for example, inability to drive due to physical condition, withdrawal of state license, etc).
    1.2.7. Use only qualified unit instructors approved by the Vehicle Operations Officer (VOO) to train
    and supervise special purpose vehicle operators on all aspects of these vehicles. This includes original
    equipment and any add-on accessories such as cranes, radios, pintle hooks, etc.
    1.2.8. Make sure operators have emergency items such as tools, tires, etc., before going off base.
    1.2.9. Arrange for the security of vehicles when not in use.
    1.2.10. Ensure unit vehicles are maintained in a clean condition at all times, to include waxing (once
    per quarter or as required). All assigned unit vehicles must be washed in the Vehicle Operations car
    wash facility at least twice monthly. The General Services Administration (GSA) reimburses the cost
    of washing vehicles (up to 2 times monthly) for all leased vehicles. Therefore, each time a GSA vehi-
    cle is washed; it must be documented in the GSA wash rack log located in the Dispatch Office.
    1.2.11. Establish effective control and operator training for use of the Voyager Fleet Services Card.
    Minimize potential for fraud, waste and abuse of the card. Ensure assigned personnel are aware of
    their responsibilities protecting government resources.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                5


   1.2.12. Personnel who are assigned Temporary Duty (TDY) to McChord AFB and use any vehicles
   will send credit card receipts to the VOO within 24 hours after return to home station. Deployed per-
   sonnel will be governed by the VOO in the Area of Responsibility (AOR).
   1.2.13. Ensure necessary data such as registration numbers, mileage, name, grade, and organizations
   are legible on the receipts.
   1.2.14. Receive vehicles from the VOO. Receipts for vehicles authorized to tenant units by their par-
   ent command must be receipted directly to the tenant from the Registration Equipment Management
   System (REMS) monitor.
   1.2.15. Procure supplies, tools, and equipment for unit vehicles such as highway warning kits, tire
   chains, polish, wax, chamois, sponges, jacks, lug wrenches, fire extinguishers, and spare tires (unless
   items are original equipment on vehicles). These items will be obtained through unit supply channels.
   1.2.16. Brief unit personnel concerning engine-idle time. Idle time is limited to one minute when the
   vehicle is in a "standby or waiting" status. When operational commitments dictate, this policy may be
   exempted (e.g., fire trucks).
NOTE: Radio equipped vehicles use internal battery power to operate communication equipment. If you
must use this equipment when the engine isn't running use the "accessory position" on the ignition switch
to avoid damage to the vehicle's electrical system.
   1.2.17. Make sure all operators use and complete the correct AF Form 1800, Operators Inspection
   Guide and Trouble Report in accordance with AFMAN 24-307, Procedures for Vehicle Maintenance
   Management. Review them to make sure all major safety discrepancies have been reported to Vehicle
   Maintenance Customer Service for correction. At the first of each month transcribe all deferred main-
   tenance action to a new AF form 1800. Waived items will be recorded on a duplicate AF form 1800
   and kept with the current one. Keep the old AF form 1800 on file for one year in accordance with
   AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule. The VCO must also ensure that an adequate supply
   of inspection guide and trouble reports is on hand.
   1.2.18. Upon request, provide data and justification to the VOO or other proper authority on mini-
   mum essential vehicle levels to support your unit.
   1.2.19. Conduct operator safety briefings at least once a month to discuss accident trends, prevention,
   and procedures. A record of the topics briefed will be maintained in the unit’s continuity book.
   1.2.20. Conduct monthly inspections to ensure vehicles are serviceable, clean, and operator inspec-
   tions are being performed. The proper operator inspection guide and trouble reports can be used as a
   guide when performing these inspections. A minimum 10% of each unit’s vehicles will be inspected
   each month. The objective is for all vehicles to be inspected each year. A monthly inspection log
   should show the following:
       1.2.20.1. Total number of vehicles assigned.
       1.2.20.2. Date of inspection.
       1.2.20.3. Vehicle registration numbers and discrepancies discovered.
       1.2.20.4. Corrective actions and status of previous month discrepancies.
   1.2.21. Maintain the VCO Continuity Binder as described (See Attachment 7).
6                                                                         62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


    1.2.22. When unit vehicles are no longer required to support your mission it is YOUR responsibility
    to notify Vehicle Management and Analysis for reassignment of the vehicle.
    1.2.23. No alcoholic beverages will be transported in a government vehicle after the original cap,
    seal, or stop has been broken. Under no circumstances will a driver operate a Government Motor
    Vehicle (GMV) while or after consuming alcoholic beverages.
    1.2.24. Unit commanders who wish to use a government vehicle to support squadron functions, such
    as picnics or parties, must submit a vehicle request justification letter through the VOO or Vehicle
    Operations Manager (VOM). The request, including times, dates, registration number of vehicles to
    be used, will be evaluated and approved/disapproved by return correspondence. The above policy
    includes unit vehicles.
    1.2.25. Provide Vehicle Management and Analysis with a quarterly list of vehicles used off the instal-
    lation.
    1.2.26. Provide Vehicle Management and Analysis an annual Minimum Essential Listing (MEL). The
    MEL is the minimum number of vehicles your squadron requires to perform its mission. Please format
    your list as follows: vehicle type by management code, total number assigned, minimum required, and
    any special equipment (i.e., pintle hook, radio, etc).

1.3. Appointment and Training of VCOs.
    1.3.1. The first step to having a good vehicle program is the appointment of a Primary and Alternate
    VCO.
    1.3.2. After the commander has selected the VCOs, an appointment letter must be submitted to Vehi-
    cle Management and Analysis (See Attachment 3).
    1.3.3. Upon receipt, Vehicle Management and Analysis will schedule the person or persons for train-
    ing and receipt for controllable items within ten days. Training will consist of the following:
       1.3.3.1. Responsibilities as the focal point for all vehicle matters.
       1.3.3.2. Controlling unit vehicles.
       1.3.3.3. Defending requirements, when necessary, for existing authorizations
       1.3.3.4. Using qualified and approved unit instructors for vehicle training.
       1.3.3.5. Ensuring operators have the proper items before going off base.
       1.3.3.6. Security of vehicles.
       1.3.3.7. Control and use of Voyager Fleet Services Card.
       1.3.3.8. Receipting for vehicles.
       1.3.3.9. Providing supplies.
       1.3.3.10. MEL and Priority recall procedures.
       1.3.3.11. Operator safety briefings.
       1.3.3.12. Monthly VCO vehicle inspections.
       1.3.3.13. Vehicle lesson plans.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                  7


       1.3.3.14. Publications needed for the VCO program.
   1.3.4. Upon completion of the training session you must sign a statement of understanding concern-
   ing your responsibilities.
   1.3.5. It is important to note the current VCO or VCNCO cannot be relieved of his/her duties until the
   new unit representative(s) has been fully trained and has signed for controlled items.
   1.3.6. Replacement VCO or VCNCO must be identified to Vehicle Management and Analysis within
   30 days of receiving permanent change of station (PCS) orders. The unit commander must sign the
   appointment letter.

1.4. Vehicle Refueling.
   1.4.1. The military service station furnishes fuel for government vehicles. To obtain fuel, the operator
   must have a Vehicle Identification Link (VIL) key. In order to prevent static electric discharge, vehicle
   operators who refuel vehicles should make sure the fuel dispensing nozzle remains in contact with the
   gas tank filler neck while dispensing fuel.
   1.4.2. The Fuels Management Flight encodes all base VIL keys. To code/recode a VIL key go to
   Vehicle Management and Analysis for a VIL key-coding letter. (Units provide their own VIL keys)

1.5. Off-Base Vehicle Dispatches.
   1.5.1. When vehicles are dispatched outside the immediate area of the installation, vehicle operators
   must be provided with the proper route, Voyager Fleet Services Card, and any other appropriate doc-
   uments. Vehicles must also contain:
   1.5.2. Spare tire and wheel.
   1.5.3. Jack.
   1.5.4. Lug wrench.
   1.5.5. Other emergency equipment required by local and national laws: road flares, reflectors, tire
   chains, etc.
NOTE: When a group of vehicles is dispatched as a convoy, a jack and a lug wrench need not be pro-
vided for each vehicle, only per type vehicle.

1.6. Permissible Operating Distance (POD).
   1.6.1. Military transportation cannot compete with civilian carriers for transportation outside a mili-
   tary installation.
   1.6.2. The POD below is provided for mission-essential vehicles and transportation support to meet
   the mission requirements of McChord AFB:
   1.6.3. One hundred miles in the northerly direction to include Mount Vernon, WA.
   1.6.4. Two-hundred fifty miles in the easterly direction to include Moses Lake and Yakima, WA.
   1.6.5. Seventy-five miles in a westerly direction to include Bangor Naval Station, WA.
   1.6.6. One-hundred fifty miles in the southerly direction to include Portland, OR.
8                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


    1.6.7. Point to point from McChord AFB to Fairchild AFB, WA.
    1.6.8. Exceptions may be required for certain activities, and in such cases specific instances may be
    granted. Requests for exemption will be on a case-by-case basis and will be subject to approval by the
    Chief Dispatcher.
    1.6.9. The Vehicle Operation Manager has established the POD and must approve any subsequent
    changes to the POD.

1.7. Organizational Maintenance.
    1.7.1. Organizational maintenance is the key to effective vehicle care. An effective organizational
    maintenance program increases vehicle life, reduces maintenance costs, and ensures vehicles will be
    available to meet your mission requirements.
    1.7.2. Organizational maintenance consists of performing the required inspections; keeping the vehi-
    cle clean and waxed (once quarterly), minor servicing (such as adding fuel and oil), and the installa-
    tion of mounted tires. A daily inspection must be accomplished for all vehicles used during a given
    duty day. Vehicles that are not used on a daily basis will be inspected at least once every seven calen-
    dar days. All assigned unit vehicles must be washed in the vehicle operations car wash facility at least
    twice monthly.
    1.7.3. Utilize one of the following inspection guides and trouble reports for conducting your inspec-
    tions and for recording any discrepancies requiring repairs.
    1.7.4. Operator Inspection Guides and Trouble Reports:
       1.7.4.1. AF Form 1800, Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for General Purpose
       Vehicles.
       1.7.4.2. AF Form 1806, Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for Aircraft Towing
       Tractor, Base Maintenance Equipment, Deicers, High Reach and Snow Removal.
       1.7.4.3. AF Form 1807, Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for Fuel Servicing.
       1.7.4.4. AF Form 1810, Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for 463L and Material
       Handling Equipment (MHE).
       1.7.4.5. AF Form 1812, Operators Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for All “P”-series Fire
       Fighting Vehicles.
    1.7.5. A pre-operational check of the vehicle is accomplished to ensure it is ready and safe to operate.
    Start by looking for damage and leaks. If you discover damage to a vehicle that is not indicated on the
    1800 series form, bring it to the attention of your VCO before operating the vehicle. This allows an
    investigation to be made and prevents you from being held responsible.
    1.7.6. Look under the vehicle for evidence of leakage. Ignore minor oil and grease drips that are the
    result of normal operation. You may find fuel, oil, coolant, gear lubricant, or brake fluid. Fuel will
    have a gasoline odor, softens asphalt paving, and evaporates rapidly. Engine oil is normally black,
    oily, and thin compared to gear lubricant, which is black and thick. Coolant is water and anti-freeze. It
    does not evaporate rapidly and may be clear or greenish in color. Brake fluid is normally a clear, oily
    fluid with a sharp odor. Be sure to determine the type of fluid and its source. After the vehicle is
    started and moved, it may be very difficult to determine the location of the leak.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                     9


   1.7.7. Look at the tires to see if they appear to be inflated normally. Also, check the 1800 series form
   to see if all tires have been gauged and documented (this must be done by the 10th of each month).
   Check for obvious cuts or bulges, and remove any rocks or other objects lodged in the tread and
   between dual tires. Damaged and soft tires (one apparently leaking air) should be changed.
   1.7.8. Be sure to check all fluid levels. This includes checking the oil level by pulling the dipstick,
   checking the brake and power steering fluid level, making sure the washer fluid reservoir is full, and
   ensuring the radiator is full of coolant. The overflow container is usually marked to indicate "warm"
   and "cold" level. The proper level can be visually checked through the side of the container.
   1.7.9. Check all drive belts. See if they are frayed or cracked. If a belt looks too loose or tight, check
   its tension. Depress the belt between two pulleys with your thumb. It should deflect about 1/2 inch
   with reasonable pressure.
   1.7.10. Check to see if the battery is clean and free of corrosion. The cables should be fastened tightly.
   Move the cable connections to see if they are tight enough. Tighten loose connections with the proper
   size wrench. During starting, note if the battery spins the engine freely without hesitation. If the starter
   is sluggish, the battery should be written up on the proper 1800 series form to be checked for condi-
   tion.
   1.7.11. Check to see if the horn operates.
   1.7.12. Turn on and check all the lights to see if they operate. Also, look for broken or missing reflec-
   tors, and light lenses.
   1.7.13. Check the vehicle instruments before and after starting the engine. For example, the ammeter
   should show zero with the ignition switch off and, quite likely, a discharge with the switch on. It
   should register a charge after the engine is operating. Be sure all instrument readings are normal or
   write them up to be checked. You should also check the fuel supply at this time.
   1.7.14. Examine the wiper blades to see if they are cracked or if pieces of rubber are missing.
NOTE: Do not check the wipers for operation if a blade is missing. You may scratch the glass with the
wiper arm.
   1.7.15. Examine the cargo compartment to be sure it is in good condition, without splintered doors or
   cracked side rails. Tailgates should have good hinges or anchors and should fasten securely. When a
   tarpaulin is installed, check it for holes and cleanliness. It should be securely fastened. When cargo is
   loaded, the weight must be distributed and loose cargo must be secured to prevent loss or shifting.
   Also, check any mounted equipment for serviceability.
   1.7.16. Inspect the seat belts to be sure they are anchored and not excessively frayed. If the vehicle is
   equipped with a fire extinguisher, see that it is in place. If it has a visual indicator, see if the extin-
   guisher has been used. Also, check the rear mirrors and adjust them so you can use them easily.
   1.7.17. Before you move the vehicle, make some checks on the steering and brakes. Turn the steering
   wheel to be sure that the linkage is attached and there is not an excessive amount of free travel. Step
   on the brake pedal to see if the brakes are working properly, and apply the parking brake to check its
   operation.
   1.7.18. One more point that should be mentioned here: open the drain cocks on the air tanks of an air
   brake system to discharge any condensation after each use. If this water isn't drained, it could cause
   corrosion or rust inside the system. If the corrosion or rust flakes off, particles could be forced through
10                                                                            62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


     the lines causing failure or poor operation of parts of the brake system. Also, this water may freeze in
     the tank or lines. After draining the water from the tank, be sure you close the petcock immediately –
     don't wait until the next time you operate the vehicle (during winter months drain air tanks DAILY).
     1.7.19. You are responsible for carefully noting how your vehicle operates. Enter any malfunction or
     indication of improper operation on the appropriate 1800 series form and inform your supervisor.
     Open discrepancies should be reported to Maintenance within 24 hours for proper corrective action.
     1.7.20. As previously mentioned, your maintenance responsibilities are not limited to just inspecting
     your vehicle. You are responsible for cleaning the vehicle. You are also required to service your vehi-
     cle with fuel, oil, coolant, and air. In this section, we will discuss these responsibilities.
     1.7.21. Servicing. Servicing is the checking and necessary replenishment of fuel, oil in the crankcase,
     water or antifreeze in the cooling system, washer fluid in the reservoir, air in the tires, and battery fluid
     levels.
     1.7.22. Fuel. Fuel tanks should be kept as full as practical. This is especially important during cold
     weather to prevent condensation of moisture inside the tank. Moisture not only contaminates the fuel
     but also may freeze within the fuel lines. Gas tanks should not be filled to the top of the filler pipe.
     This allows for expansion of gasoline during hot weather. Take the following precautions during vehi-
     cle fueling to prevent the possibility of fire or explosion:
         1.7.22.1. Do not fuel vehicles near open flames or spark producing devices.
         1.7.22.2. Do not fuel vehicles indoors.
         1.7.22.3. Do not smoke or permit others to smoke.
         1.7.22.4. Turn the vehicle ignition (and all other ignitions) off.
         1.7.22.5. Make sure the nozzle of the fuel hose is in constant contact with the intake pipe of the
         vehicle's fuel tank. This eliminates sparks from static electricity.
         1.7.22.6. Ensure spilled fuel is collected (absorbent material) or evaporated before starting the
         engine.
         1.7.22.7. Whenever large amounts of fuel are spilled, notify the fire department immediately to
         remove the hazard.
         1.7.22.8. Where fuel filler pipes are located close to the engine manifold or other source of igni-
         tion, allow the engine to cool before fueling the vehicle.
     1.7.23. Oil. Check the engine oil or automatic transmission fluid frequently with the dipstick. You
     cannot rely upon the oil pressure gauge to show the amount of oil in the crankcase; it shows pressure
     only. Add only the proper amount of oil.
     1.7.24. Water. Keep the coolant in the radiator at the proper level below the overflow pipe. An over-
     heated engine should be allowed to cool before coolant is added to the radiator to prevent damage to
     the engine. If you must add coolant to an overheated engine, let the engine run and add coolant very
     slowly. In freezing temperatures, antifreeze should be added. If no antifreeze is available, care must be
     exercised to prevent freezing. When the cooling system must be drained, it is necessary on most
     engines to drain the cylinder block as well as the radiator. Use clean water to fill the cooling system.
     1.7.25. Tires. Tires should be inflated to the recommended pressures as identified by stenciled or on
     the data plate (usually located on the door or behind the seat). If you find the tire size is different than
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                    11


   what is identified on the data plate, inflate the tire to the recommended pressure identified on the tire
   and not the data plate. Tires are required to be gauged at least monthly and documented on the AF
   Form 1800. A visual check should be made infrequently for soft or flat tires and air added when nec-
   essary.
   1.7.26. Cleaning. As previously mentioned, the cleaning of a vehicle is also the operator’s responsi-
   bility. Just cleaning the exterior of the vehicle isn't enough. The engine, accessories, interior, undercar-
   riage, and any auxiliary equipment must be kept clean as well.
   1.7.27. Engine. If a cleaning agent is needed to clean an engine, use only Air Force-approved sol-
   vents. Gasoline and other highly flammable liquids must never be used as cleaning agents. Before
   applying the solvent, get a small piece of wood or a putty knife and scrape away any caked grease or
   dust. Once the engine is clean, it takes only a few minutes each day to keep it clean. After you finish
   driving the vehicle each day, take a rag and wipe the dust and oil from the engine and its subassem-
   blies.
   1.7.28. Occasionally, radiator cores become plugged with bugs, leaves, brush, etc. If this happens, do
   not attempt to clear the core by using a stick or other sharp instrument. The radiator core is soft and is
   easily damaged. You can wash the foreign material out by flushing with a water hose from the engine
   side of the radiator. Be sure the water pressure isn't great enough to damage the core. If you can't get
   the material out with water, use compressed air.
NOTE: Use extreme caution when using compressed air. Serious injuries have been caused because of
improper use. Do not blow dirt or dust from your clothes. If the air is strong enough to blow dust or dirt
from your clothes, it is strong enough to reach the body. Horseplay with an air hose can end with tragic
results. It has been estimated an internal pressure of only four pounds per square inch can rupture the
intestine. Never direct compressed air at anyone. Never use compressed air to clean dirt or debris from a
work area. An eye can very easily be injured or put out by flying debris.
   1.7.29. Interior. The inside of your vehicle must be kept clean at all times. Remove all trash, books,
   bottles, oil rags, etc., from under and behind the seats. A vacuum cleaner is ideal for cleaning the
   seats, upholstery, and carpets. Brush out the floor of the cab with a whiskbroom and then use a damp
   sponge to clean the floor mats. A sponge and cleaning agent are also good for cleaning upholstery,
   dash, armrests, and window strips. Never turn a water hose on inside a vehicle, as this will soak the
   mats and cause floorboards to rust. Sweep and dry mop the floors of buses. Sweep the beds of trucks
   and trailers.
   1.7.30. Exterior. Normally, all you need to wash the exterior of your vehicle is a pressure hose, rags,
   and a brush. Use a mild detergent. Never use aircraft soap to clean a vehicle. When washing a vehicle,
   wet it first to avoid scratching the paint, then start from the top and work down. Then wet the wheels
   and use the brush to break loose any caked mud or dust. After this is done, rinse thoroughly. Use a
   chamois to dry the vehicle and prevent water spots. The vehicle should be waxed at least quarterly or
   more often if needed. Never wax a vehicle in the sun.
   1.7.31. Undercarriage. Normally, the pressure hose is sufficient for cleaning the undercarriage,
   though unusual conditions may necessitate the use of steam. Whichever method is used for this clean-
   ing, spray grease seals and fittings as little as possible.
NOTE: Steam is dangerous and must be handled with care. Consult your supervisor prior to operating
any type steam-cleaning machine. You must be trained on the proper use and safety aspects prior to being
allowed to use the machine.
12                                                                          62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


     1.7.32. Auxiliary and special equipment. Normally, auxiliary and special equipment, such as motors,
     generators, compressors, etc., can be kept clean with just a rag.
     1.7.33. The proper care and use of tires is essential for prolonging the life of tires; therefore, the fol-
     lowing practices and precautions should be carefully observed:
     1.7.34. Driving Habits. Careful driving habits do much to lengthen the life of tires. Therefore, you
     should avoid fast engagement of the clutch, sudden stops and starts, fast accelerations, excessive
     speeds, etc., because these practices cause rapid tread wear. Road obstructions such as rocks, ruts,
     curbs, chuckholes, and railroad crossings should be avoided or driven over carefully. Front axle drives
     should be disengaged except when extra traction is needed in mud, ice, snow, sand, etc. Tires should
     never be run flat or soft. Overloading vehicles is a common cause of tire failure. Report the first signs
     of mechanical irregularity to Vehicle Maintenance so that corrections can be made.
     1.7.35. Air Pressure. Correct air pressure is the foundation of reliable tire performance. Tires are
     designed to operate at specified air pressures. Therefore, pressures should be checked frequently with
     an accurate gauge. After the tires are inflated be sure each tire has a valve cap. This cap prevents dirt,
     which may cause leakage, from entering the valve core. The cap also serves as a second seal on the
     valve stem to help maintain proper air pressure.
     1.7.36. Matching Tires. For longer tire life and more efficient performance, dual tires and tires on all
     wheel drive vehicles must be of the same size, tread design, and tread wear.
     1.7.37. Tire Rotation. To equalize tread wear, tires should be rotated periodically. The suggested time
     and order of tire rotation is usually given in the manufacturers’ manual or applicable Technical Orders
     (TO).
     1.7.38. Tire Injuries. It is dangerous to drive with a seriously damaged tire because it may blow out,
     causing you to lose control of the vehicle. You should inspect the tires frequently for injuries, and
     remove glass, nails, stones, and other foreign materials embedded in tires or lodged between dual
     wheels.
     1.7.39. Spare Tire Installation. As the operator of a vehicle, you are responsible for removing a dam-
     aged or flat tire and installing the spare. The discussion here will be limited to the removal and instal-
     lation of spare tires as this is the area of probable occurrence.
     1.7.40. Wheel Removal. Before you begin jacking up a vehicle to remove a wheel, secure the vehicle
     to prevent it from rolling off the jack. Place blocks in front of and behind one wheel that will remain
     on the ground diagonally opposite the wheel you’re removing. The jack must be placed on a firm
     foundation as close as possible to the wheel that is to be removed. Before the wheel is clear of the
     ground, loosen the wheel nuts one-half turn. Then jack the vehicle up until the wheel clears the ground
     – never more than two inches. Place a block under the axle and let the weight of the vehicle rest on it.
     If this is not done, the vehicle might fall and cause personal injury or vehicle damage. The wheel nuts
     and bolts on a vehicle have either right or left-hand threads or both. When removing tires from a bus,
     truck tractor, trailer, or other heavy equipment, caution should be used to insure the metal wedge
     plates are loose before taking the lug nut off. The lug nuts should be turned enough to allow the wedge
     plate to be tapped loose to release any tension.
     1.7.41. Wheel Installation. Before installing a wheel on a vehicle, clean the contacting surface of the
     wheel and hub so the wheel will run true. When you are installing the wheel on the hub, be careful not
     to damage the stud threads. The top nut should be installed first, but not tightened. You can hold the
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                    13


   bottom of the wheel in place with your foot while you install the other nuts alternately on opposite
   sides. Then tighten the nuts alternately on opposite sides of the wheel to insure the wheel is properly
   aligned with the wheel hub. On dual wheels, be sure that the inner wheel stud nuts are drawn tight
   before you put on the outer wheel. Also, dual wheels must be installed so the ventilating holes of the
   outer wheel are directly in front of the ventilating holes of the inner wheel. This is necessary to permit
   air to cool the tires and brake drums. For easier checking and inflation of tires and for quick location
   of valve stems, even in darkness, valve stems on dual wheels are placed diametrically opposite each
   other – 180 degrees apart.

1.8. Vehicle Modification Requests.
   1.8.1. In accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 24-307, Procedures for Vehicle Maintenance Management
   and Air Force T.O. any change of a vehicle from its original factory design is considered a vehicle
   modification. Examples include installation of seats, lights, radios, etc.
   1.8.2. Modification Policy. Any major modification to vehicles and equipment is processed as pre-
   scribed in AFMAN 24-307. Contact Vehicle Maintenance for information on this directive. This alters
   the vehicle permanently and makes it usable for only one kind of mission.
   1.8.3. A change in configuration is made only when the need cannot be met otherwise. Installing a
   commercially available optional part or accessory that serves the same need as the original item, but
   does not alter the basic vehicle, is not a change.
   1.8.4. Adding special equipment to meet a certain operational needs is still considered a modification
   if the vehicle is still used for its original purpose. The installation of such items must be held to a min-
   imum. The requesting activity must send the justification for a change in writing to Vehicle Manage-
   ment and Analysis for their recommendation (See Attachment 4). If approval is recommended,
   Vehicle Management and Analysis will coordinate the request through the VOO and Vehicle Mainte-
   nance Officer (VMO) to determine mechanical and structural feasibility. The Major Command (MAJ-
   COM) fire protection office must approve major accessories and major optional equipment added to a
   fire truck.
NOTE: Vehicle Maintenance does not budget or fund for this equipment. Special equipment needed to
meet certain operational requirements (i.e. cargo shells, campers, hydraulic tailgates) will be funded by
the requesting organization.

1.9. Vehicle Security.
   1.9.1. As a VCO, you must make sure your unit's vehicles are secure. This includes protecting fuel in
   the vehicles from pilferage.
   1.9.2. Vehicles dispatched off base overnight should be parked in the Vehicle Management Flight
   compound at the destination installation. If the destination is an area other than a military activity,
   every effort should be made to select a well lighted, secure parking area for the vehicles.
   1.9.3. As a rule, if a vehicle operator leaves the vehicle unattended for any reason, the ignition key
   should be removed and the vehicle locked, except vehicles designated as emergency response vehicles
   (crash-fire trucks, security vehicles, ambulances, etc.) or when a vehicle is parked in a hazardous area
   (fuel dump, flight line, ammunition storage, loading or unloading area, etc.). For this purpose, flight
   line is defined as any area where the presence of the vehicle could interfere with normal aircraft move-
   ment.
14                                                                         62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


1.10. Accident Reporting and Investigation Procedures.
     1.10.1. Definitions:
        1.10.1.1. Vehicle Accident. A vehicle accident is an occurrence involving a motor vehicle result-
        ing from a collision with another moving or stationary object.
        1.10.1.2. Vehicle Abuse. Vehicle abuse is any act or omission that has caused, or may cause, dam-
        age to a vehicle that cannot be attributed to fair wear and tear, an accident, or an incident.
        1.10.1.3. Vehicle Incident. When damage to a vehicle as a result of actions beyond the operator’s
        or other responsible individual's control, such as damage resulting from an act of nature.
        1.10.1.4. Government Motor Vehicle (GMV). Any United States Air Force (USAF) owned or
        leased motor vehicle. This includes vehicles from General Services Administration (GSA) or
        another commercial vendor, and vehicles leased or rented by the government or any individual
        acting on behalf of the government while on official orders. It also includes military and commer-
        cial designed vehicles on loan to the United States (US) Armed Forces or Federal Agencies.
     1.10.2. The operator should immediately notify their supervisor, VCO, or unit commander of a GMV
     accident. Everyone is responsible for reporting vehicle abuses. However, in most cases, Vehicle Main-
     tenance notifies the unit of instances involving vehicle abuse. All accidents involving military vehi-
     cles must be reported on the Standard Form (SF) 91, Operators Report of Motor Vehicle Accident.
     When a vehicle is involved in an accident the operator must:
        1.10.2.1. Render any possible assistance to the injured.
        1.10.2.2. Warn other motorists of any existing hazards.
        1.10.2.3. For on-base GMV accidents notify Security Forces at extension 2-5624 before the vehi-
        cle is moved. For off-base accidents, notify the civilian authorities (i.e., local police, county sher-
        iff, or state highway patrol.
        1.10.2.4. Complete SF 91 and deliver it, along with the operator’s AF Form 2293, US Govern-
        ment Motor Vehicle Operator’s Identification Card to the unit VCO as soon as possible.
        1.10.2.5. Comply with state and base laws that govern reporting vehicle accidents.
        1.10.2.6. If required, send official civilian police reports through channels to the proper claims
        officer for review to make sure the rights of the US government are not prejudiced by an admis-
        sion of liability that obligates the government.
        1.10.2.7. Bring the vehicle to the Vehicle Maintenance shop for inspection if it is still operational.
        Otherwise request wrecker service.
        1.10.2.8. Ensure you complete the SF 91 as accurately as possible. If you need help, contact Oper-
        ator Records and Licensing (ORL) section of Vehicle Management.
        1.10.2.9. Notify the base legal office for all GMV accidents involving privately owned vehicles or
        property. This notification is accomplished by submitting a completed copy of the SF 91 to the
        Claims Section. The Claims Section handles all transactions between the Air Force and private
        parties regarding claims against the US Government. If a copy of the police report is available, this
        should be provided to the legal office.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                 15


   1.10.3. Measures to Prevent Vehicle Accidents. Accidents involving Air Force motor vehicles impose
   a drain on Air Force resources. An aggressive and continuing motor vehicle safety accident preven-
   tion program must be conducted to reduce this loss. The objective of this program is to emphasize
   safety awareness and reduce accident potentials. Unit accident prevention programs should include:
       1.10.3.1. Conducting vehicle safety briefings on a monthly basis.
       1.10.3.2. Ensuring an adequate stock of equipment is maintained and readily available for vehi-
       cles dispatched off base (i.e., flares, warning kits, chains, etc.).
       1.10.3.3. Designating the most qualified individuals as unit instructors.
       1.10.3.4. Providing operators with instructions to follow when accidents occur (including critical
       telephone numbers to call).
   1.10.4. Measures to Prevent Vehicle Accidents and Abuses. The characteristics of an effective unit
   vehicle accident and abuse prevention program include:
       1.10.4.1. Ongoing Training Efforts. Training is continuous. New personnel must be trained and all
       personnel need periodic refreshers. Operator awareness will eliminate vehicle abuse/misuse.
       1.10.4.2. Commander and VCO Involvement. An effective program depends on the amount of
       emphasis placed on it. Everyone must work towards the same goal.

1.11. Reporting Accidents and Abuses. Damage to GMVs should be recorded at the earliest possible
date.
   1.11.1. Follow reporting procedures outlined in paragraphs 1.10.2. to 1.10.2.9. Ensure that the opera-
   tor completes the SF 91 immediately after the accident and turns it over to you. If the operator is inca-
   pacitated and cannot complete the form, have a passenger fill one out to the best of their ability.
NOTE: This form is not required for vehicle abuse.
   1.11.2. Ensure the GMV is turned in immediately to Vehicle Maintenance for an evaluation of the
   damages resulting from the accident or suspected vehicle abuse. Prepare a release letter (See Attach-
   ment 5) for vehicles involved in accidents or abuse and hand carry to Vehicle Maintenance.
NOTE: Vehicle Maintenance will not begin repairs without the release letter from the unit.
   1.11.3. Documentation of GMV Accidents/Abuses:
       1.11.3.1. Establish a case file for each GMV accident or abuse occurring within your unit.
       1.11.3.2. Use a folder for each case.
       1.11.3.3. Label the folder to differentiate each accident or abuse case. Utilize numerical sequences
       for each case.
       1.11.3.4. Standard Form 91. Keep the original in your case file and give copies to any agencies
       that need it, such as the base legal office.
       1.11.3.5. Vehicle Maintenance work order indicating the damages and estimates of repairs. Work
       orders are generated for both accidents and abuses.
       1.11.3.6. Copy of vehicle release letter for Vehicle Maintenance.
       1.11.3.7. Civilian and military police reports (for accidents only).
16                                                                       62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


        1.11.3.8. Photos of accident/abuse.
        1.11.3.9. VCO investigation letter of the accident or abuse (See Attachment 6)
        1.11.3.10. AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Repairable Value Statement. This form is obtained
        from Vehicle Maintenance. You will need this form if an individual is going to be held liable for
        the damage.
        1.11.3.11. Financial repayment should be considered when gross negligence is suspected. A
        Report of Survey (ROS) should be initiated using procedures in AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Sur-
        vey for Air Force Property and the Base ROS Handbook available at 62d LRS, Procedures and
        Accountability section. The 62 MSG/CC makes the final decision on all ROS. A finalized copy of
        any one of these three forms as applicable: DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of
        Property Loss, DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher or DD Form
        1131, Cash Collection Voucher. NOTE: The term “finalized copy” means any above-mentioned
        form(s) has been processed through the base finance office to reimburse the government for the
        damages.

1.12. Accident/Abuse Investigation. The using organization commander designates an official to inves-
tigate each accident and provides results to safety. The Chief of Safety investigates and analyzes all acci-
dents or suspected acts of abuse and determines the causes or possible corrective actions. Accident trends
involving government owned or rented motor vehicles are analyzed or investigated by the Chief of Safety.
The investigation should address the following:
     1.12.1. Determining the Cause of the Accident or Abuse. The investigative report must thoroughly
     document the facts and circumstances of the damage and should answer questions such as who, what,
     when, where, why, and how. For abuses, information can be obtained by questioning the crew chief,
     operators, and/or witnesses.
     1.12.2. Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence. Include this information in your investigation letter to
     the commander.

1.13. Abuse Case Closures. The unit commander is the only person within an organization that can
close abuse cases, regardless if the investigation results proved that the operator was not at fault. Docu-
ment your investigation results and provide the entire package to your unit commander who will endorse
the investigation results and concur with closing the case.

1.14. Filing of Case Packages. All case files should be maintained and filed for six years after case is
closed IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, Table 24-3, Rule 13.

1.15. Elite Fleet Vehicle Inspection Program.
     1.15.1. Program Scope/Objective. The Elite Fleet Program is established to promote the overall man-
     agement of the 62d Airlift Wing's (AW) vehicle fleet. The program focuses on improving the appear-
     ance and mechanical condition of the wing’s vehicles and recognizes VCOs, VCNCOs, and operators
     who maintain their vehicles in outstanding condition. The program applies to all units possessing
     GMVs, including tenant units.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                17


   1.15.2. Vehicle inspections will be conducted semiannually during each calendar year. Units will
   compete in one of three categories: large, medium, or small. Large units have 26 or more vehicles
   assigned, medium units have 10-25 vehicles assigned, and small units have 1-9 vehicles assigned.
   1.15.3. Trophies will be presented to the winning unit in each category to recognize the top Elite Fleet
   Program.
   1.15.4. Scoring. Points are awarded for vehicle care, operator knowledge, VCO knowledge and VCO
   Book. The points are as follows: 96-100 Outstanding, 86-95 Excellent, 76-85 Satisfactory, 70-75 Mar-
   ginal, 70 and under is Unsatisfactory.
   1.15.5. Vehicle Care. A comprehensive vehicle inspection will be conducted on 25% of the unit’s
   assigned vehicles. Each vehicle will be inspected using the applicable 1800 series form as a checklist.
   Vehicles start with the maximum of 50 points per vehicle with deductions made for discrepancies
   found during the inspection. All scores will be totaled and divided by the number of vehicles
   inspected (e.g., 5 vehicles inspected: 40 + 40 + 35 + 45 + 50 = 210 points; divided by 5 = 42 for the
   vehicle inspection score). Vehicles with safety write-ups automatically receive zero (0) points. Vehi-
   cles with discrepancies found and corrected on the spot will have no points deducted for the corrected
   discrepancy.
   1.15.6. Operator Knowledge. Operator knowledge will be assessed a maximum of 15 points per oper-
   ator. Points will be awarded based on the operator knowledge checklist. Operator scores will be
   totaled then divided by the number of operators participating.
   1.15.7. VCO Knowledge. VCO knowledge will be assessed a maximum of 15 points. Points will be
   awarded as outlined on the VCO knowledge checklist.
   1.15.8. VCO Continuity Book. The VCO Continuity Book will be assessed a maximum of 20 points.
   Points will be deducted for each section not correctly maintained. Points will be awarded as outlined
   in the VCO Book Checklist.
   1.15.9. Inspection Results. Unit inspection results will be sent to squadron commanders at the end of
   each inspection. The winners for that quarter will be announced at wing stand-up by the 62 MSG/CC.

1.16. Vehicle Control Function (VCF) Manager Vehicle Inspections.
   1.16.1. The VCF Manager will conduct Annual Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) during the second quar-
   ter. Vehicle utilization, rotation, and the overall vehicle program will be discussed during this visit.
   1.16.2. The SAV is conducted in conjunction with the Elite Fleet Inspection. Appointment letters and
   vehicle analysis are forwarded to the VCO at least 15 days prior to the scheduled visit.
   1.16.3. The VCF Manager will conduct a no-notice vehicle inspection of unit’s vehicles. This will
   help gain an accurate look at the unit vehicle care program.

1.17. Vehicle Control Continuity Binder.
   1.17.1. Each unit VCO will maintain a Vehicle Control Continuity Binder. This book is your tool to
   help manage your unit program.
   1.17.2. This book should be passed on to the new VCO whenever this position changes.
   1.17.3. The VCO continuity binder will contain all the mandatory items listed in Attachment 7.
18                                                                       62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


     1.17.4. The continuity folder is a special interest item during all Assistance Visits and higher head-
     quarters inspections.
     1.17.5. The VCO should conduct a self-inspection of the book at least quarterly and document it.

1.18. Vehicle Rotations.
     1.18.1. General Purpose and Materials Handling Equipment (MHE) vehicles must be rotated within
     their assigned organization, unless the cost of moving equipment from one vehicle to another exceeds
     the savings to be gained from rotation.
     1.18.2. One way to do this is by centralized vehicle pooling, if possible. The VOO may direct rotation
     of some vehicles to reach these goals.
     1.18.3. The VCO must establish a local program and controls with procedures to monitor the rotation
     within the assigned organization to make sure that:
     1.18.4. Low mileage vehicles are rotated with high mileage vehicles.
     1.18.5. MHE with low hourly utilization is rotated with equipment having a high hourly utilization.
     1.18.6. Older vehicles become eligible for replacement before newer models of the same type.
     1.18.7. No unauthorized modification or deviation from standard marking and painting policy is
     accomplished that prevents the rotation of vehicles.
     1.18.8. Local procedures for rotating a government asset are as follows:
        1.18.8.1. Once the vehicle is identified as a high or low mileage asset, the registration number is
        placed in rotation status.
        1.18.8.2. All registration numbers are confirmed as eligible for rotation.
        1.18.8.3. A rotation letter is forwarded to each applicable unit with the date the rotation is to
        occur.
        1.18.8.4. The VCO will ensure each vehicle scheduled for rotation will be turned into Vehicle
        Maintenance before the actual rotation to have any modifications removed or swapped to the other
        vehicle.
        1.18.8.5. Each VCO must be present for the rotation to ensure the vehicle he/she receives is in sat-
        isfactory condition.
        1.18.8.6. Both VCOs will thoroughly inspect each vehicle before signing the appropriate accep-
        tance forms. After this is accomplished the fuel key will be changed to reflect the correct organi-
        zation code.
     1.18.9. The VCO is responsible for conducting intra-squadron rotations. (i.e., vehicle from one shop
     to another within your organization).

1.19. VCO Meetings.
     1.19.1. Vehicle Control Officer Meetings are conducted on a semi-annual basis. The Vehicle Control
     Function Manager arranges these meetings, schedules guest speakers, and prepares the agenda as nec-
     essary. Items discussed may include the following:
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                    19


       1.19.1.1. Changes to directives, policies, or procedures since the last meeting.
       1.19.1.2. Accidents, abuses, misuse, problem areas, trends, prevention, and cost.
       1.19.1.3. Fleet status and projected replacements due in.
       1.19.1.4. Vehicle utilization trends by vehicle type.
       1.19.1.5. Anticipated problem areas for the next 6 months.
       1.19.1.6. Operations and maintenance cost.
       1.19.1.7. Vehicle operator training.
       1.19.1.8. Inspection results (general).
       1.19.1.9. Energy conservation.

1.20. Vehicle Priority Listing.
   1.20.1. To help manage our base vehicle fleet we have developed a vehicle priority list. It is designed
   to help all of us in many different situations. This list establishes the priority for each of your vehicles
   based on the mission it supports. The priorities are defined as:
       1.20.1.1. PRIORITY 1 – Direct Mission Support: These vehicles are utilized in direct support of
       the launch and recovery of aircraft.
       1.20.1.2. PRIORITY 2 – Indirect Mission Support: These vehicles support Priority 1 resources or
       have a mission that would be hampered by the non-availability of vehicles.
       1.20.1.3. PRIORITY 3 – Administrative Support: These vehicles are used to support official busi-
       ness during duty hours that are not considered essential to mission accomplishment.
NOTE: Allowance Standard Code (ASC) 019 defines each authorization category code by using an "O"
for operational support or Priority 1, an "S" for support or Priority 2, and an "A" for administrative sup-
port or Priority 3.
       1.20.1.4. The vehicles are arranged in numerical sequence from one, two, three, etc., from the
       most critical to mission support. The last vehicle becomes the first to be recalled or the last to be
       filled should a vehicle shortage occur.
   1.20.2. To update the list each year we solicit your inputs concerning changes (with justification) and
   submit it to the 62 MSG/CC for final action. You must be practical and only address your daily oper-
   ational needs.
   1.20.3. As explained earlier, when unusual needs, operations, or emergencies occur, the plan will be
   implemented. As a VCO, you should always keep the following in mind:
   1.20.4. Unit minimum essential levels by vehicle type.
   1.20.5. Keep Vehicle Management and analysis advised of your status (e.g., if your unit falls below
   your minimum essential level or you have a special project which needs more vehicles).

1.21. Vehicle Recall Procedures.
   1.21.1. Using justification provided by the VOO and VCOs, Vehicle Maintenance, in conjunction
   with Vehicle Management and Analysis, establishes a minimum essential level (MEL) for each orga-
20                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


     nization and compiles a comprehensive priority list by vehicle type. This enables the VOO to with-
     draw lower priority vehicles to:
        1.21.1.1. Replace higher priority vehicles that require extended maintenance.
        1.21.1.2. Satisfy organizational shortages when the numbers of vehicles fall below the minimum
        essential levels.
        1.21.1.3. Support emergency recalls plans.
     1.21.2. Unique vehicles such as fire fighting vehicles, ambulances, and wreckers will not be recalled.
     1.21.3. The MEL/Priority Vehicle list will be updated annually or as often as deemed necessary to
     reflect the changes in the wing’s mission.
     1.21.4. A separate listing is required for priority replacements, emergency vehicle recalls and mini-
     mum essential levels. The priority vehicle replacement listing is constructed as follows:
        1.21.4.1. The list will contain an entry by vehicle type for all like vehicles assigned to more than
        one unit, for example, Multistops assigned to Civil Engineering Squadron (CES), Aerial Port
        Squadron (APS), and LRS would be listed in the recall sequence under "Multistop".
     1.21.5. To establish proper recall sequence, the following priority system will be utilized:
        1.21.5.1. PRIORITY 0 – Command Vehicles.
        1.21.5.2. PRIORITY 1 – Direct Mission Support.
        1.21.5.3. PRIORITY 2 – Indirect Mission Support.
        1.21.5.4. PRIORITY 3 – Administrative Support.
NOTE: Vehicles that are in Priority 3 would be recalled first, Priority 2 vehicles would be recalled sec-
ond, and Priority 1 vehicles would be recalled last.
     1.21.6. Upon implementation of the recall, Vehicle Operations will:
         1.21.6.1. Contact Vehicle Maintenance to determine the number of vehicles that are deferred for
         maintenance or parts. Other unit vehicles will not replace these vehicles.
         1.21.6.2. Recalled vehicles are inspected as they arrive.
         1.21.6.3. The appropriate 1800 series form is used as an inspection checklist.
     1.21.7. Information pertinent to each recall exercise is documented and includes as a minimum:
         1.21.7.1. Directing authority.
         1.21.7.2. Time recall was initiated.
         1.21.7.3. Response time.
         1.21.7.4. Problems encountered.
         1.21.7.5. This information is to be reviewed by the 62 MSG/CC and corrective actions taken or
         adjustments made as required.
     1.21.8. Recall of vehicles from other units by other than 62 LRS personnel is strictly prohibited. The
     ONLY officials authorized to recall vehicles are dispatchers and Vehicle Management and Analysis
     personnel. If you need a vehicle (regardless of the type) you must first contact Dispatch Operations.
     They will verify your requirement and source the vehicle from available agencies to include other
     units and possible rental.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                             21


                                              Chapter 2

                        OBTAINING NEW VEHICLE AUTHORIZATIONS

2.1. Justification Letter.
   2.1.1. VCOs must complete an authorization justification letter (See Attachment 8).
   2.1.2. Vehicle Management and Analysis will use the justification letter to prepare an AF Form 601,
   Equipment Action Request. This justification input may be the only opportunity your unit will have
   to explain the need for the vehicle, so be as specific as possible.
   2.1.3. The Vehicle Maintenance Officer will review the justification to ensure the organization has
   provided all required information and that it is correct. The VMO will approve or disapprove the
   realignment or increase of vehicle authorizations.
   2.1.4. The 62 MSG/CC will make a final approval or disapproval before the AF Form 601 is for-
   warded to Air Mobility Command (AMC), Vehicle Management Flight.

2.2. REMS Management Programs.
   2.2.1. The Registered Equipment Management System (REMS) Manager is your single point of con-
   tact within Vehicle Management and Analysis on all vehicle authorization and assignment actions.
   This person only deals with the VCOs.
   2.2.2. Key points to remember about REMS:
       2.2.2.1. Before any vehicle can be shipped out TDY, PCS or leave this installation for any reason
       it must be cleared through REMS. To accomplish this you need to complete the TDY request.
       Transportation will clear the vehicle for shipping.
       2.2.2.2. Vehicle rotations or other vehicle movement actions must be reported to REMS.

2.3. Vehicle Priority Purchase.
   2.3.1. Each year, no later than 15 April, a report of proposed vehicle purchases is forwarded to HQ
   AMC/A47V for review. A working group composed of unit VCOs, a representative from Vehicle
   Maintenance, and the Fleet Manager compiles the wing’s submission. The 62 MSG/CC is the final
   approving authority for the installation.
   2.3.2. We are allowed to submit up to15 vehicle types to meet our mission requirements. Both vehicle
   replacement codes and shortages within the base fleet determine eligible vehicle types. Vehicle Man-
   agement and Analysis compiles the eligible vehicle types and forms a working group consisting of six
   units VCOs, the Vehicle Maintenance Manager, and the Fleet Manager. The 62 MSG/CC is the final
   approving authority for the installation.
22                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


                                                 Chapter 3

                    GOVERNMENT MOTOR VEHICLE LICENSE PROGRAM

3.1. Responsibilities of GMV license holders.
     3.1.1. The purpose of the Operator Records and Licensing (ORL) section is to establish and maintain
     a database identifying all personnel who operate GMVs. These forms are used to track information:
        3.1.1.1. AF Form 2296, Vehicle Operator Information (Part 3): Every authorized operator
        assigned to McChord regardless of motor vehicle type or Gross Vehicle Weight are required to
        have one. The AF Form 2296 is a permanent record and is forwarded to the new duty station each
        time a military member transfers.
        3.1.1.2. AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator's Identification Card: Every
        operator of Air Force special purpose vehicles must have a valid AF Form 2293. The operator's
        permit is also computer generated. The permit has no expiration date for military members. How-
        ever, civilian employees must renew their AF Forms 2293 every time they renew their state
        driver’s licenses. Permits issued to contractor personnel must indicate, "Valid Only during Period
        Covered by Employment" in the restrictions section.
            3.1.1.2.1. The possession of an operator's permit does not give you a permanent license. Per-
            mits will be suspended or revoked when:
            3.1.1.2.2. On-base driving privileges are suspended or revoked for any reason.
            3.1.1.2.3. State operator's permit is suspended or revoked.
            3.1.1.2.4. Member has been involved in drug or alcohol abuse (if determined necessary by the
            unit commander).
            3.1.1.2.5. Anytime for cause when approved by the unit commander or equivalent.
        3.1.1.3. Operators will be given an immediate re-examination of their ability to safely operate a
        vehicle when:
            3.1.1.3.1. The unit commander considers it necessary after an accident, evidence of vehicle
            abuse, misuse, moving violation, or a display of immature judgment or attitude.
            3.1.1.3.2. The individual is affected by a physical impairment that results in a physical profile
            change.
            3.1.1.3.3. Permits are authenticated for each type of vehicle (identified by different manage-
            ment codes) you are qualified to operate.
        3.1.1.4. The member must sign the permit before it is authenticated and issued by ORL section
        personnel. Duplicate permits are issued to replace those lost, dam-aged, or stolen. Your qualifica-
        tion record will be checked to verify your qualification before a duplicate is issued. If your quali-
        fications cannot be substantiated for any reason, you will be re-examined.
        3.1.1.5. Operators retain their permits when they are transferred to a new base. However, the indi-
        vidual must present their AF Forms 2293 and 2296 to their new unit’s VCO upon arrival to vali-
        date their qualifications. The qualifications will be entered in the computer and a new license will
        be issued.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                  23


       3.1.1.6. Upon separation from the service, personnel may retain their AF Form 2293 provided it
       is over-stamped or legibly marked, "NOT VALID—SEPARATED FROM THE SERVICE" on the
       front and back. A government operator's permit cannot be used in place of a state driver's license
       for the operation of privately owned vehicles.
NOTE: Our ORL section uses a computer program to maintain vehicle operator records, licenses, vehi-
cle trainers, etc. The current program limits the number of qualifications to 46 vehicles, which shouldn’t
be a problem for most members.

3.2. Authorization to Drive on the Flight line
   3.2.1. The following procedures are established to obtain flight line driver’s training and certification
   on AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency. IAW 62d AW Instruction 13-4, Control of Vehicular
   Traffic in Flight Line Areas all drivers required to drive on the flight line will have an AF Form 483.
   3.2.2. The ORL section of Vehicle Management and Analysis does not conduct flight line validation
   training. Instead, unit VCO/VCNCOs serving as the Flightline Driving Program Manager will con-
   duct the necessary training using McChord Form 603, Flightline Driver Training and Certification.
   Additionally, the airfield manager or designated representative will be responsible for certifying an
   individual for flight line driving on AF Form 483.
   3.2.3. Unit VCOs will requisition AF Form 483, This form will be issued by the Flightline Driving
   Program Manager and certified by the airfield manager. The vehicle operator will carry this form at all
   times along with the AF Form 2293. The unit Flight line Driving Program Manager will certify that
   the individual was qualified and the airfield manager will validate the AF Form 483.
   3.2.4. The Chief of Airfield Management and Chief of Ground Safety ensure course currency to pro-
   vide assistance in interim course development.

3.3. Motor Vehicle Operators Qualification Requirements.
   3.3.1. All personnel who operate military vehicles and equipment must possess an AF Form 2293 for
   the type vehicle driven.
   3.3.2. New Operators. Information for issuing the AF Form 2293 can be obtained from the ORL sec-
   tion. However, the ORL section does not have the staff or the required equipment to teach personnel
   to drive. Initial training in vehicle operation, when required, is accomplished by qualified driver train-
   ing instructors in the unit or through contract with commercial driver training agencies.
   3.3.3. Renewals and Changes to Licenses. To renew or amend an AF Form 2293, the member's com-
   mander or VCO must send an AF Form 171, Request for Drivers Training and Addition to Military
   Operators License to the ORL section. ORL section personnel must screen previous records to deter-
   mine whether renewal is authorized. A new AF Form 2293 will be issued, provided the member meets
   the requirements. AF Forms 2293 for military members are valid until termination of active service
   unless their state license is suspended or revoked. Civilian personnel are required to renew their AF
   Form 2293 every 4 years – usually when their state driver’s license expires.
   3.3.4. Qualifications for Special Vehicles. VCOs should maintain a list of operators licensed for spe-
   cial purpose vehicles who may be needed by the unit in support of mobility or emergency require-
   ments. This will ensure an adequate number of operators are available, trained, and licensed to meet
   mission requirements. To qualify for special equipment the following must be done:
24                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


        3.3.4.1. The operator must have an AF Form 171 signed by the unit VCO.
        3.3.4.2. Before certifying an operator's qualification for a specific vehicle on the AF Form 2293,
        the operator's knowledge of vehicle operating and service instructions (T.O.s and manufacturers
        guide) must be evaluated.
        3.3.4.3. The individual’s ability to operate and service the equipment will be verified by qualified
        personnel designated by your organization to serve as instructors to train and supervise student
        operators.
NOTE: Coordinate all vehicle lesson plans through the VOO/Vehicle Operations Superintendent and the
Vehicle Maintenance Manager. The using unit commander approves the lesson plan. ORL will retain cop-
ies of all approved unit vehicle lesson plans.
     3.3.5. High Risk Operators. VCOs should identify operators with a history of vehicle abuse, misuse,
     or accidents. These operators are classified as high risk. If the unit commander feels the person is not
     capable of handling the responsibilities that come with the AF 2293 they will need to suspend their
     driving privileges and return the AF 2293 to the Vehicle Operations Officer as soon as possible. In
     addition, the VCO must notify the VOO of any changes to an operator's status, such as inability to
     drive due to physical condition, withdrawal of state driver’s license, etc.

                                  FLEET ANALYSIS PROGRAM

4.1. Analysis Programs.
   4.1.1. The Fleet Analysis program is a function of Vehicle Management and Analysis and provides
   information and analyses vital to meeting the customer’s needs and ensuring all vehicle fleet services
   are provided in an efficient, effective, and economical manner.
   4.1.2. This program consists of 12 analyses in three major categories that were developed to meet this
   goal. Below is a description of the two categories, which involves you as the VCO:
       4.1.2.1. Utilization. Identifies which specific types of vehicles meet, or do not meet AF goals on
       utilization, fuel, operation and maintenance cost. During annual SAV and approximately six
       months after the annual SAV, a brief report of this data will be provided for your review and
       action.
       4.1.2.2. Authorization. Is an in-depth review of both current vehicle authorizations and requests
       for any additions or changes.
NOTE: Special analyses can be performed on your unit any time you request.
26                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


                                                 Chapter 5

                                           VEHICLE REFUELING

5.1. The Vehicle Identification Link key.
     5.1.1. The base refueling station furnishes fuel for government owned and leased vehicles. To obtain
     fuel, the operator must have a Vehicle Identification Link (VIL) key.

5.2. Voyager Fleet Credit Card Control and Use.
     5.2.1. The Voyager Fleet credit card is used for obtaining fuel and minor vehicle repairs when dis-
     patched to areas that do not have government refueling facilities available.
     5.2.2. To obtain a Voyager Fleet credit card for one-time or short-term use, the VCO must first submit
     a letter to Vehicle Dispatch for approval to include:
        5.2.2.1. Reason for requesting the card.
        5.2.2.2. Inclusive dates for use.
        5.2.2.3. Why this requirement cannot be satisfied by the base refueling facility.
     5.2.3. If your unit requires a credit card on a daily basis, the VCO must submit a detailed justification
     letter. This letter must be signed by the unit commander or VCO and include the following:
        5.2.3.1. Detailed Justification.
        5.2.3.2. Why the card is needed.
        5.2.3.3. How often the card will be used, number of trips off base, etc.
        5.2.3.4. Estimated purchase amount each year.
        5.2.3.5. Be sure that your unit budgets for any off-base fuel purchases if you receive a Voyager
        Fleet credit card on a permanent basis.
        5.2.3.6. Keep in mind all purchase tickets (receipts) must be turned in once a week (or when the
        card is returned to Vehicle Operations).
     5.2.4. Once the card is issued to you, you must establish effective control over it. Follow these proce-
     dures:
        5.2.4.1. Issue the card on a hand receipt to the user.
        5.2.4.2. Keep a log of purchases for your own budget records.
        5.2.4.3. This is the only credit card used to obtain service from commercial service stations. The
        use of the credit card must be kept to an absolute minimum. You are responsible for servicing the
        vehicle before you leave on a trip to reduce the need for credit card purchases. When required, the
        following items and services may be procured; gasoline (regular grade only except when higher
        octane is required by the manufacturer's specifications); diesel fuel; lubricating oil, and antifreeze
        products.
        5.2.4.4. A copy of the service station delivery receipt must substantiate credit card purchases. You
        must be sure the odometer reading and the registration (or license) number of the vehicle, and your
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                   27


       name, grade and organization are put on the receipt. The delivery receipt must also show the credit
       card number, date of purchase, name and address of the station, the grade, quantity, price per gal-
       lon of fuel, and the total amount charged. Credit card purchases may be made from several service
       stations. You will receive an operator guide on how to use your Fleet Services credit card and the
       AF Form 15, US Air Force Invoice. The operator’s guide will also tell you what stations accept
       these forms.
       5.2.4.5. Whenever you use a credit card, return the copy of the delivery receipt and any trading
       stamps or other premiums to the Vehicle Operations Dispatcher. The operator or person who signs
       the delivery receipt is held directly responsible for any errors or omissions of the required infor-
       mation. The dispatcher will forward the delivery tickets to Vehicle Management and Analysis.
       Vehicle Management and Analysis personnel will transfer a copy of the delivery tickets to Fuels
       Management. When the invoice is received it will be matched against the delivery tickets, and if
       correct, the Fleet Manager will execute certification on the invoice and forward to Accounting and
       Finance for payment.
       5.2.4.6. When government fuel facilities are nearby, you must use them instead of commercial
       fuel stations. The dispatcher will advise you if a government facility is readily available or if you
       must use a commercial source. If you fail to use readily available government facilities, you may
       be held liable for the bill. You are responsible for the control and purchases made with the card
       issued to you. Protect the government and yourself by ensuring the card is not left in the vehicle
       when it is parked or unattended.
   5.2.5. When a credit card misuse occurs, the Vehicle Management and Analysis Section will provide
   a letter outlining the violation and request an investigation.
   5.2.6. Operators will be responsible for paying Accounting and Finance for any unauthorized pur-
   chases.
NOTE: Remember that once you have signed for this card from Vehicle Operations you are responsible
for its use and control. If it is misused, you could be held responsible!

5.3. General Services Administration (GSA) Voyager Credit Card Control and Use.
   5.3.1. The Voyager Fleet credit card is used for obtaining fuel and vehicle repairs for your GSA vehi-
   cle through commercial vendors. The following items and services may be procured: gasoline, (regu-
   lar grade only except when higher octane is required by the manufacturer’s specifications), diesel fuel
   (use self-service pumps when available); lubricating oil, windshield wipers, flat tire repair, light bulbs,
   etc. How to pay at the pump:
       5.3.1.1. Check your mileage.
       5.3.1.2. Make sure the station accepts the Voyager credit card.
       5.3.1.3. Insert the card into the slot and remove quickly.
       5.3.1.4. Enter PIN (last five digits of Tag number).
       5.3.1.5. Enter the odometer reading.
       5.3.1.6. Choose the proper fuel for your vehicle to begin refueling.
28                                                                       62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


     5.3.2. If mechanical repairs are needed, call Vehicle Maintenance Customer Service at 982-3179 or
     Vehicle Management & Analysis (VM & A) at 982-5593/5591. If you are away from the base and
     emergency repairs are needed, call GSA Maintenance Control Center at 1-888-622-6344 for instruc-
     tions. Your expenses are limited to $100.00 without an authorization number from GSA.
     5.3.3. Newer GSA leased vehicles are covered by the manufacturer’s warranty for 36 months or
     36,000 miles (or longer). If your assigned vehicle is still under warranty and you require roadside
     assistance, call the respective manufacturer’s 24-hour roadside assistance hotline:
        5.3.3.1. Chevrolet: 1-800-243-8872.
        5.3.3.2. Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth/Jeep: 1-800-521-2779.
        5.3.3.3. Ford: 1-800-241-3673.
        5.3.3.4. GMC: 1-800-462-8782.
        5.3.3.5. Oldsmobile: 1-800-443-6537.
     5.3.4. Involved in an Accident? If you are on base, call Security Forces at 982-5624, then call Vehicle
     Dispatch at 982-2684. If you are off base, call the GSA Accident Management Center at
     1-800-325-2958, then call the local police, then call Vehicle Dispatch at (253) 982-2684. The accident
     reporting forms (SF 91 & 94) are located in the accident packet in your glove box. Both forms must be
     filled out if you have an accident in a GSA vehicle.
     5.3.5. All occupants must wear seat belts whenever the vehicle is in motion.
     5.3.6. Federal Property Management Regulation 101-39.300 prohibits the use of tobacco products in
     GSA Fleet vehicles.
     5.3.7. The Voyager Fleet credit card is a controlled item; you must safeguard it at all times. Once you
     have signed for it, you are responsible for its use and control. GSA closely monitors purchases made
     with it. When they discover improper purchases, they “bill back” the user for those purchases. If this
     occurs, your unit will be held responsible for reimbursing the LRS for those expenses, and you may be
     prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); there is no excuse for misusing the
     Voyager Card.
     5.3.8. Report lost or stolen Voyager Fleet credit cards immediately to Vehicle Management and Anal-
     ysis (982-6456) or our local GSA Fleet Services Representatives.

5.4. Short and Long Term Lease or Rental.
     5.4.1. A short-term vehicle lease or rental is one that is leased or rented for up to 364 days. We are
     permitted to rent or lease vehicles to meet peak workloads and unusual or emergency requirements for
     periods not to exceed one year without established vehicle authorizations. However, if the rental/lease
     period is expected to exceed 60 days (general purpose vehicles only), we must request in writing, sup-
     port from MAJCOM before executing the rental/lease agreement. AFI 24-301, Vehicles Operations,
     paragraph 5.9.4, states, “62 LRS/LGRVO (Vehicle Operations Section) is the office of primary
     responsibility (OPR) on all installation rental and lease approvals. The 62 LRS commander will coor-
     dinate on all lease requests prior to submission to Contracting.”
     5.4.2. The OPR for all vehicle rentals and leases for the installation is the 62 LRS/LGRVM, Fleet
     Management and Analysis section. They are tasked with validating and coordinating all requests
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                             29


  through contracting to ensure vehicles are not rented or leased without prior validation regardless of
  who funds for the rentals or leases. The unit requesting the vehicle lease/rental or the ultimate user
  will be required to provide the necessary funding. International Merchant Purchase Authorization
  Cards (IMPAC) may be used for payment if the cost does not exceed $2,500.00. An AF Form 9,
  Request for Purchase must be submitted through Contracting for all vehicle rentals or leases exceed-
  ing this limit.
  5.4.3. A long-term vehicle lease covers a period exceeding one year. Requirements must be submitted
  through and approved by the LRS Commander. A detailed justification, vehicle type, length of rental
  period, and a statement identifying funds are available must be included. All submissions must be sub-
  mitted 90 days in advance, as we must have HQ AMC/LGTV approval prior to entering the lease.
30                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


                                                 Chapter 6

                                 USE OF GOVERNMENT VEHICLES

6.1. Official Vehicle Usage.
     6.1.1. AFI 24-301 has established specific guidelines on the use of GMVs.
     6.1.2. To assist in evaluating your needs for official use of GMVs, the 62 LRS has provided the fol-
     lowing guidelines:
        6.1.2.1. General Information. The use of government vehicles is not authorized for personal busi-
        ness or pleasure.
        6.1.2.2. If that is understood, then federal laws, Department of Defense policies, and Air Force
        restrictions covered in the rest of this section all seem easier to understand and accept. Remember
        to ask these key questions, “Is the purpose of my trip related to the Air Force mission?” or “Am I
        likely to cause public criticism for the appearance of misuse?”
     6.1.3. Determining Official Use. VCOs should adhere to several rules when they determine official
     use:
        6.1.3.1. Motor vehicles are NOT assigned exclusively to one official or employee unless the
        nature of the responsibilities, or the frequency, urgency, or extent of the requirements for motor
        vehicle service requires assignment. Except for specific positions designated by command and
        control, assigning vehicles to persons for reasons of grade or prestige is unauthorized.
        6.1.3.2. When DOD scheduled bus service or scheduled public transportation is NOT available,
        DOD-owned or rented or leased vehicles may be used to provide transportation, wholly or in part,
        for persons going to or returning from temporary duty stations.
        6.1.3.3. Government vehicles may be used for TDY travel between domiciles or places of
        employment and commercial or government transportation terminals when economically feasible.
        6.1.3.4. Commanders may authorize use of government transportation by those not otherwise
        entitled to when danger to public health and safety is of such imminent seriousness that approval
        by the Secretary of the Air Force would be impossible. HQ USAF/LGT must be notified when
        such transportation is provided. This authorization is given with the understanding that DOD must
        be reimbursed, unless reimbursement is subsequently waived by the Assistant Secretary of
        Defense (Comptroller).
        6.1.3.5. Transportation may be provided for military and civilian personnel officially taking part
        in public ceremonies, parades, and military field demonstrations.
        6.1.3.6. Civilian groups may be transported to military installations to take part in base activities
        in the interest of community relations when the installation commander or other competent
        authority invites them. A reimbursement is not required.
        6.1.3.7. Transportation services may be provided to support Community Service Programs IAW
        AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. Reimbursement MUST be obtained.
        6.1.3.8. Prospective military recruits may be provided transportation for interviews, in process-
        ing, and orientation.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                31


      6.1.3.9. Individuals and their families are not authorized motor vehicle transportation for personal
      social engagements or personal business. Family pets are also restricted in those circumstances.
      6.1.3.10. Operational readiness teams or other no-notice inspection groups required to make
      odd-hour visits from their quarters to inspect organizations are authorized transportation. When
      required for odd-hour visits, the team may park the vehicles at the billets, either on or off base;
      however, the vehicles may not be used for unofficial business.
      6.1.3.11. Government vehicles MUST NOT be used for transportation to, or be parked at: com-
      missaries, base exchanges (including all concessions), bowling alleys, officer and NCO clubs, or
      any nonappropriated fund activity unless personnel using the vehicle are on official government
      business or TDY.
      6.1.3.12. Transportation to or from Air Force scheduled appointments, (i.e., record checks, dental,
      or hospital outpatient appointments) is considered official use for active duty personnel. Priorities
      in the paragraph below labeled "Choice of Vehicle to Be Used" must be followed. If possible,
      shuttle bus service mass public transportation must be used rather than a military taxi.
NOTE: Dependents remain the sponsor's responsibility but may be provided transportation on a
space-available basis on scheduled services.
      6.1.3.13. TDY personnel for transportation to off-base restaurants or lodging may use government
      vehicles. Government vehicles may NOT be used for transportation to other off-base commercial
      facilities except for official business. A GMV is not allowed to park at a casino or bar for any rea-
      son to include TDY dining.
      6.1.3.14. Persons conducting official off-base business may use GMVs for transportation to
      enroute off-base restaurants when mission or fuel considerations make returning to the base
      impractical. Persons may NOT use GMVs to go to private quarters.
      6.1.3.15. A spouse officially invited to attend a function or ceremony with the military member is
      authorized travel by government vehicle. When separation of the spouse and member occurs dur-
      ing the official functions, the spouse is afforded the same transportation as the member.
      6.1.3.16. When guidance does not specifically fit the request the commanders will use these fac-
      tors to determine whether transportation may be furnished:
          6.1.3.16.1. Purpose of the trip in relation to the Air Force mission.
          6.1.3.16.2. Availability of adequate commercial transportation.
          6.1.3.16.3. Destination requested.
          6.1.3.16.4. Geographical location of the base in relation to the destination requested.
          6.1.3.16.5. Availability of GMVs.
          6.1.3.16.6. Public criticism that may ensue over the APPEARANCE OF MISUSE.
   6.1.4. Choice of Vehicle to Be Used. When motor vehicle transportation is essential to the perfor-
   mance of official business, these methods must be considered IN THE ORDER SHOWN; to the
   extent they are available and capable of meeting mission requirements:
      6.1.4.1. DOD Scheduled bus service.
      6.1.4.2. Scheduled public transportation.
32                                                                        62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005


        6.1.4.3. DOD motor vehicle (includes military taxi service).
        6.1.4.4. Voluntary use of a private owned motor vehicle on a reimbursable basis.
        6.1.4.5. Commercial taxicab on a reimbursable basis.
     6.1.5. Transportation between Domicile and Place of Employment. With the passage of Public Law
     99-550 in October 1986, 31 United States Code (USC), Section 1344, is now the sole source of
     authority for use of Government transportation between a residence and place of employment. Under
     31 USC, Section 1344(b) certain positions are specifically designated as eligible for home-to-work
     transportation. For the Air Force, those include ONLY the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of
     Staff. Others may be authorized home-to-work transportation by the Secretary of the Air Force.
     6.1.6. Legality of Service Requested. It is the vehicle user responsibility to make sure that motor vehi-
     cles are used for official purposes. Accordingly, when service is requested, VCOs and dispatchers
     must provide information regarding transportation policies. The VOO and VCO MUST review all
     cases where legality is questionable and if found improper, they MUST provide a report covering the
     subject to the person's commander. See the following Section on Vehicle Misuse.

6.2. Vehicle Misuse and Abuse.
     6.2.1. As the VCO you are responsible to your commander for preventing, reporting, and investigat-
     ing vehicle abuses and misuses within your unit.
     6.2.2. Vehicle Abuse. Mechanical failures or damage that is not the result of fair wear and tear, defec-
     tive materials, or workmanship are considered evidences of vehicle abuse. Some examples of vehicle
     abuse are:
        6.2.2.1. Tampering with governors.

                                                 Chapter 7

                                       VEHICLE MAINTENANCE

7.1. Maintenance Programs
     7.1.1. All advanced maintenance will be performed or coordinated by the Logistics Readiness Squad-
     ron Vehicle Maintenance Section.
     7.1.2. Some maintenance actions are scheduled in advance based on miles, hours of operation, or cal-
     endar time. Proper scheduling should be effected to ensure vehicles do not operate past the due date or
     mileage of the scheduled cycle. Vehicle Management and Analysis (VM&A) provides a letter indicat-
     ing the scheduled maintenance requirements for your organization. The VCO should make sure vehi-
     cles are delivered to Customer Service at the time agreed on by VM&A. You should schedule
     servicing in advance with VM&A to reduce the impact of vehicle loss during periods of peak work-
     loads.
     7.1.3. The vehicle safety inspection should be a regular occurrence. This in-depth inspection of the
     vehicle requires tires to be removed so that the brakes and the bearings can be checked and repacked
     once every three years. This inspection will usually take an entire day but if any discrepancies are
     found, plan on it taking longer.
     7.1.4. Unscheduled Maintenance. Vehicle malfunctions must be reported to the Vehicle Receiving
     section within one normal workday. A malfunction that affects safe operation must be reported at
     once. The user must make sure that the vehicle is made available to the maintenance activity, in a
     clean condition, for required repairs. Failure to report malfunctions constitutes vehicle abuse. The fol-
     lowing procedures will need to be followed:
        7.1.4.1. The vehicle should be cleaned inside and out to include: behind and under seats, ashtray,
        floorboards, glove box, windows, dashboard, bed of trucks, trunks of sedans, mud on undercar-
        riages, free of all accumulations of dirt on outside of car or truck.
        7.1.4.2. The vehicle's paint should have a nice gloss and should show little to no signs of corro-
        sion.
        7.1.4.3. The vehicle engine compartment and engine should be cleaned as well as the battery and
        battery box.
        7.1.4.4. Vehicles should have all organizational equipment removed from the vehicle that is being
        turned in for scheduled maintenance. If the vehicle is being turned in for a minor discrepancy it
        might not be required to remove equipment. Customer Service personnel will inform the operator
        if the equipment has to be removed on unscheduled maintenance.
        7.1.4.5. The appropriate 1800 series form should show the correct month.
        7.1.4.6. On the inside page, the discrepancy should be noted in the operator report section. It
        should also have the date it was found and the operator who found it.
        7.1.4.7. When the discrepancies are reported to Vehicle Maintenance, the operator will also sign
        and date on the inside of the form in the appropriate place.
        7.1.4.8. When turning in the vehicle, a Vehicle Receiving person will assist in looking over the
        vehicle to check for any additional discrepancies.
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                35


      7.1.4.9. A tire pressure check must be annotated on the back of the Inspection Guide and Trouble
      Report prior to turning the vehicle in.
   7.1.5. Estimated In-Commission Times.
   7.1.6. Vehicle Maintenance duty hours are from 0700 to 1600 Monday through Friday.
   7.1.7. To eliminate or cut down on the large number of calls handled by VM&A, VCOs should be the
   "only" person to contact VM&A concerning vehicle status.

7.2. Maintaining Unit Vehicles.
   7.2.1. The Air Force has established vehicle serviceability standards that are explained in detail in TO
   36-1-191, Technical and Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance. It is the job of the
   maintenance activity to determine repairs required to meet the serviceability standards. To be service-
   able, a vehicle must be safe and dependable. Safety must never be compromised throughout the life of
   the vehicle. A vehicle must be able to perform its job safely and consistently. The serviceability of
   vehicles is judged by:
      7.2.1.1. Age and mileage.
      7.2.1.2. Purpose of its use and the job it is expected to do.
      7.2.1.3. Remaining service life.
      7.2.1.4. Relative value of services to be returned in comparison with the cost of renovation,
      replacement, or repairs.
      7.2.1.5. Safety of operation.
   7.2.2. You must remember that serviceability is always a matter of judgment. If your unit is not satis-
   fied with the maintenance provided, contact the VMO or Superintendent.

                                                  Chapter 8

                              TYPES OF MOTOR VEHICLE PROGRAMS

8.1. Operations Supervision Programs.
     8.1.1. Part of your responsibility, as a VCO is to get necessary motor vehicle transportation for your
     unit. One source is unit assigned vehicles. For other needs (peak workloads and unusual require-
     ments), Vehicle Dispatch has designated certain vehicles for needs that cannot be supported by unit
     assigned vehicles. They consist primarily of passenger carrying vehicles such as sedans, station wag-
     ons, buses, and a number of cargo vehicles. Wrecker service is also available for vehicle recovery. The
     primary responsibility of the Vehicle Dispatch Section is to provide taxi, aircrew, cargo operations,
     pickup & delivery, Mission Capable (MICAP), U-Drive-It (UDI), bus, and wrecker service and to
     monitor the overall management of the base motor vehicle fleet.
     8.1.2. Military Taxi Service. The taxi service objective is to provide a quick response, point-to-point,
     service to all requesters requiring official transportation. To reach this goal, taxis cannot be dispatched
     to one user for an extended period of time. The maximum waiting time at each destination is 5 minutes
     unless otherwise approved by the dispatcher. If a user requires additional time, it may be necessary to
     call for another taxi or explain the circumstances to the dispatcher at the time of request. Taxis will not
     be used for a messenger service. Taxi operators must not leave their vehicles to pick up or deliver cor-
     respondence, etc., as the base distribution function is responsible for this task.
     8.1.3. Passenger and Cargo Service. The Vehicle Dispatch Section has a limited number of passenger
     and cargo vehicles to support organizations that do not have vehicles available and to augment units
     with assigned vehicles. Large cargo vehicles, tractors, and trailers, are provided with a Vehicle Oper-
     ations operator if qualified operators are not available in the requesting unit. They must not be regular
     taxi service. UDI vehicles are not dispatched to any organization on a recurring dispatch basis.
     8.1.4. Wrecker and Vehicle Recovery Service. Wrecker service is provided by Vehicle Dispatch dur-
     ing normal duty hours when requested by Vehicle Maintenance. During normal duty hours an operator
     should accompany the vehicle to Maintenance to expedite entry into the repair system. Wrecker ser-
     vice after normal duty hours may be obtained by contacting the Vehicle Operations dispatcher.
     Requests after normal duty hours should be limited to priority vehicles, vehicles blocking traffic or
     creating a safety hazard, and government owned vehicles disabled off base. The wrecker operator will
     transport the disabled vehicle to the Vehicle Maintenance compound. The using organization must
     process the vehicle through Customer Service before repair can begin. After normal duty hours, the
     wrecker operator will secure the vehicle and leave the ignition keys with the Vehicle Operations dis-
     patcher. The using organization must pick up the keys from the dispatcher and process the vehicle into
     Vehicle Maintenance the next duty day for repair. If the vehicle must be left in an unsecured area, the
     vehicle must be secured prior to the operator's departure. The VCO must ensure that the Operator's
     Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, ignition keys, and fuel key are available to the wrecker operator
     prior to dispatch. Emergency wrecker service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This ser-
     vice may be obtained by calling the Vehicle Operations Dispatcher. The only time wrecker service
     will be provided to move POVs is when it is requested by Security Forces.
     8.1.5. Aircrew Transport. Transportation will be provided for home-based aircrew transportation sup-
     port to and from the aircraft and support facilitates. Transportation is also provided for transient air-
62AWPAM24-1 14 JUNE 2005                                                                                37


  crews as required. Transient aircraft will be met within 10 minutes of the time requested by the
  aircrew. During their stay, dispatch will respond to their requests for transportation.
  8.1.6. Tractor and Trailer Service. Arrangements for movement of cargo by tractor/trailer must be
  made through the Vehicle Operations dispatcher. Requests of this nature must be made well in
  advance in order to determine specific requirements for the load. This will also ensure timely service
  is provided.
  8.1.7. Bus Support. Buses may be used to support Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) activities
  under certain circumstances. All MWR requests must be coordinated through and approved by the
  Chief of MWR. Then submit the request to LRS for final approval. Bus support to off-base, private
  organizations is authorized under certain circumstances. IAW AFI 24-301 civilian groups may be
  transported to the base to take part in base activities in the interest of community relations when offi-
  cially invited by the installation commander. Transportation may be provided to military and civilian
  personnel officially taking part in public ceremonies, parades, and military field demonstrations.
  Transportation services may be provided to support community service programs as prescribed in AFI
  35-101 (on a reimbursable basis).
  8.1.8. UDI Vehicles. The Vehicle Dispatch Section has a limited number of sedans and carryalls
  assigned to be used in support of Distinguished Visitors (DVs) visiting the base. Colonels (and civil-
  ian equivalents) or above are authorized this service. To obtain transportation for any visiting DV,
  send a McChord IMT 185, Request for Motor Vehicle Services to Vehicle Dispatch at least 72 hours
  in advance. The requests will only be accepted if the form is signed by the VCO, VCNCO, or the unit
  commander and should be sent at the earliest possible time to ensure support can be provided.
