                                               Chapter 1

          USAF AIRSPACE PLANNING, MANAGEMENT, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Management Objectives. The objective is to provide airspace in which USAF test and training mis-
sions can be conducted as realistically as possible, while maximizing safety and minimizing the impact on
other users, surface activities, and the environment. Military users should acquire only that airspace
required for mission accomplishment and return airspace to the National Airspace System (NAS) or host
nation in a timely manner when not in use or when no longer required. This “Joint Use” policy ensures
effective management of assigned airspace.
   1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Airspace Use Philosophy. HQ ACC is committed to the development and
   maintenance of required airspace necessary to safely accomplish 100 percent of present and future
   readiness training. ACC supports the effective and efficient use of all navigable airspace in the United
   States, including special use airspace (SUA) and airspace for special use (ASU). HQ ACC promotes
   real-time access to ACC-managed airspace by nonparticipating aircraft whenever it is not required for
   essential flight operations and training. HQ ACC/A3A will identify future SUA requirements to HQ
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as they become quantifiable.
   1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Exclusive Use. ACC units require "exclusive use" in ACC-managed airspace
   (see Attachment 1, Terms).
   1.1.3. (Added-ACC) Flight Operations/Training. Conduct flight operations/training only in appro-
   priate SUA/ASU unless authorized by HQ ACC/A3. Agencies planning to use SUA/ASU must be
   familiar with special procedures/requirements detailed in LOAs/LOPs.

1.2. Responsibilities and Command Relationships. The Airspace, Ranges, and Airfield Operations
Directorate (AF/A3O-A) is responsible for policy and oversight of civil aviation collaboration, airspace,
ranges, and airfield operations as designated by HQ USAF, Deputy Chief of Staff, Air, Space & Informa-
tion Operations, Plans & Requirements, through the Director of Operations and Training. AF/A3O-A is
the OPR for AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airspace, Airfield, and Range Management. The Ranges and
Airspace Division, (AF/A3O-AR) is the focal point for USAF airspace management. The USAF manages
airspace through the major command (MAJCOM) offices for airspace management, as well as the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) Headquarters (FAA/AJR-01) and FAA Air Traffic Organization (ATO)
Service Area Air Force Representatives (AFREPs). This instruction applies to each MAJCOM function-
ing as the USAF component of a unified command as outlined in unified command directives and to the
National Guard Bureau (NGB) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
1.2. (MOUNTAINHOME) Responsibilities and Command Relationships. Chief, Airspace Manage-
ment (CAM) (366 OSS/OSOA), is located within the 366th Operations Support Squadron (366 OSS) and
is the single point of contact (POC) for 366 FW airspace management issues. CAM is responsible for the
development, management and reporting of wing controlled SUA and ASU to include MTR. Addition-
ally, CAM is the primary liaison for formal coordination between FAA and 366 FW. This does not apply
to day-to-day working coordination between air traffic control agencies or Military RADAR Units
(MRU) and Salt Lake City Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), unless an incident or violation has
occurred.
   1.2.1. Chief, Ranges and Airspace Division (AF/A3O-AR) shall:

       ments.
       1.2.1.2. Co-chair regional Airspace and Range Councils (ARC).
       1.2.1.3. Support and implement policies, recommendations, and/or decisions of the Policy Board
       on Federal Aviation (PBFA) IAW Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5030.19.
       1.2.1.4. Coordinate/cooperate with Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) and provide AF
       representation to the PBFA Airspace Subgroup.
       1.2.1.5. Interface, through the PBFA with the FAA concerning service-specific policy matters.
       1.2.1.6. Work Congressional issues involving military airspace and ranges.
NOTE: Military airspace is a term used to indicate both Special Use Airspace (SUA) and Airspace for
Special Use (ASU).
       1.2.1.7. Serve as the focal point for airspace procedural issues.
       1.2.1.8. Interface with functional counterparts of other military departments.
       1.2.1.9. Coordinate with other public and private interests and agencies as required to support
       USAF airspace and range requirements.
       1.2.1.10. Provide functional oversight of the Airspace Management School.

       1.2.1.12. Maintain/update the USAF portion of FAA publications concerning airspace.
    1.2.2. Air Force Representative (AFREP). Each military service has designated personnel within
    each FAA Service Area to facilitate coordination with the FAA on air traffic and airspace issues. In the
    case of the USAF, these personnel are referred to as AFREPs. AFREPs are authorized by the Execu-
    tive Director of the PBFA to coordinate, negotiate, and communicate USAF positions on airspace and
    air traffic control matters within established policy and guidelines. They represent the USAF in nego-
    tiations with competing aviation and land use interests, guide development of air traffic control (ATC)
    requirements, and they assist with airspace proposals and environmental documents. AFREPs provide
    guidance and coordination services to their assigned units in the creation of and changes to airspace.
    Figure 1.1. shows FAA service area boundaries as well as locations of AFREP offices. The AFREP
    offices guide development of ATC requirements and airspace proposals to satisfy MAJCOM mission
    needs. The HQ FAA USAF Liaison serves as the Director of USAF/FAA interoperations, supervises
    all AFREPs, administers the DoD/Department of Transportation reimbursable program within the
    FAA, and reports to AF/A3O-A. The AFREP appointment letter is listed at Attachment 2.
       1.2.2.1. AFREPs shall:
           1.2.2.1.1. Act as liaison officers for HQ USAF on matters dealing with FAA at the headquar-
           ters and service area levels.

1.3. Airspace/Range Councils (ARC)—General (US Air Forces in Europe N/A). The USAF sponsors
regional and national ARC meetings to ensure that all USAF offices involved in airspace and range oper-
ations have a common understanding of objectives and key issues. The councils provide for a thorough
review of airspace and range issues by interdisciplinary teams at all management levels. The council
meetings are open to all military services, land management agencies, and other interested or concerned
parties. The use, creation, modification, or transfer of military airspace and ranges has the potential to
become controversial. Because today’s actions are closely scrutinized by numerous Federal and State
agencies, as well as, public and private organizations and special interest groups, the USAF must be pre-
pared to address concerns raised at the local, regional, or national level during the development of any
range or airspace action. To better address these challenges and ensure continued access to test and train-
ing space, the USAF has established review processes in the form of ARCs designed to:
1.3. (MOUNTAINHOME) Airspace/Range Councils (ARC)--General. CAM is the MHAFB primary
airspace delegate to the MAJCOM and Region ARC, and the Airfield Operations Board (AOB) meetings
chaired by the 366th Operations Group Commander (366 OG/CC). Airspace items of interest or concern
that are appropriate for these forums should be fronted to the CAM at least 2 weeks prior to the ARC/
AOB meeting for inclusion in the agenda.
   1.3.1. Foster interagency involvement and cooperation at the appropriate level and the appropriate
   time in the airspace process.
   1.3.2. Advise units, MAJCOMs, and HQ USAF on airspace and range issues, and provide for cross
   flow of information and lessons learned in development. Regional councils are aligned to provide a
   geographic focus on airspace/range issues. They are open to delegates from all military services; land
   management agencies, and other interested or concerned parties with which the USAF should
   exchange constructive information concerning flight activities in the region. Council meetings may be
   hosted by military units, MAJCOMs, and/or Regional AFREPs, or other agencies as appropriate and
   approved by the regional co-chairs.
   1.3.3. Regional Council. The councils are co-chaired by one senior active duty officer and one senior
   NGB officer. Senior officers (O-6 and above) responsible for airspace and range management over-
   sight at the unit, MAJCOM, and/or NGB State Headquarters level are preferred co-chairs. Co-chairs
   may be elected by the council, or appointed by AF/A3O-A or the NGB/CF. At the wing commander’s
   discretion, units with minimal range or airspace management responsibility or requirements may elect
   not to participate in the councils. Commanders who exempt their units from council participation must
   notify the council chair through the AFREP. Since cross-communication and cooperation is the ulti-
   mate goal of the councils, agendas should include time for breakout meetings to allow those working
16                           AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


     specific issues time to gather. The council meetings typically include a DOD Session and a Manage-
     ment Session.
     1.3.3. (ACC) Commanders wishing to exempt their unit from council participation must notify HQ
     ACC/A3A prior to notifying the council chairperson and AFREP.
        1.3.3.1. DOD Session. The purpose of the DOD Session is to identify issues and shortfalls in test/
        training space or its attributes, present concepts to address shortfalls or meet new requirements,
        and to develop a consistent communications approach to clearly state proposed resolutions. Mem-
        bership includes, as a minimum, the regional AFREP, representatives from the MAJCOM, Opera-
        tions Group commanders or designees, and unit airspace managers. The regional co-chair shall be
        responsible for inviting other services present in the region to participate. Units should coordinate
        presentations on concepts for new or modified test/training space through their MAJCOM Air-
        space/Range Management Office.
            1.3.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Units planning to present a concept for new or modified test/train-
            ing airspace at a regional council meeting must coordinate their presentation with HQ ACC/
            A3AA NLT one week prior to the meeting date.
        1.3.3.2. Management Session. The Management Session is a forum for dialogue between DOD
        units and other agencies with either an aeronautical or an environmental stake in military flight
        operations. Representative non-DOD participants may include the FAA, National Park Service
        (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Forest Service (USFS), Fish and Wildlife Service
        (USFWS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), State Aviation Officials, and other bodies/groups
        focused on national aviation issues. Military units are requested to provide a short presentation
        (approximately five minutes) on their typical flight operations, training requirements, areas com-
        monly overflown, and issues being worked to include current airspace. The Management Session
        also provides the opportunity for other agencies to address perspectives and present aeronautical
        or environmental issues. Since cross-communication and cooperation is the ultimate goal of the
        councils, agendas should include time for breakout meetings to allow those working specific
        issues time to gather.
            1.3.3.2.1. (Added-ACC) Airspace managers attending their respective regional management
            session will present a short briefing (approximately five minutes) on their typical flight opera-
            tions, training requirements, areas commonly overflown, and issues being worked to include
            current airspace. Units will coordinate this briefing with HQ ACC/A3AA NLT one week prior
            to the meeting.
            1.3.3.2.2. (Added-ACC) Unit airspace managers that are unable to attend their respective
            regional session meeting will provide HQ ACC/A3AA with a short power-point presentation
            (approximately five minutes) on their typical flight operations, training requirements, areas
            commonly overflown, and issues being worked to include current airspace. The HQ ACC/
            A3AA representative attending the meeting will make the presentation.
     1.3.4. Regional Executive Session. The purpose of the Executive Session is to provide senior-level
     oversight of the regional airspace/range process and issues identified at the council meeting. The
     Executive Session should present a strategic direction to plan and promote development of aerospace
     test and training resources to support present and future military needs in the regions. Participants
     should formulate a strategic course of action that will focus long-term regional goals and national
     security objectives resulting in programmatic guidance leading to the resolution of range and airspace
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                       17


   issues. The goal is to preserve a highly capable force structure within the region, supported by effi-
   cient and effective training infrastructures.
       1.3.4.1. In addition to the co-chairs, attendance is limited to MAJCOM representatives, AFREPs
       and other military representatives (MILREPs), and senior NGB representatives from each state in
       the region. The strategic interests of individual units will be represented by their MAJCOM and/or
       their NGB state representative. If units have specific issues that require the attention of the Exec-
       utive Session, they should attend at the discretion of the MAJCOM and only with the concurrence
       of a co-chair. Unless specifically authorized by the co-chairs, attendance by non-DOD representa-
       tives is inappropriate. Non-DOD participants may be invited at the discretion of the co-chairs to
       address specific issues. Co-chairs are responsible to invite other equivalent level representatives
       from other military departments.
   1.3.5. National Airspace/Range Executive Council (NAREC). The NAREC will convene to allow
   senior USAF leaders to review pending and proposed range and airspace actions from a national per-
   spective and provide feedback to regional councils, MAJCOM, and HQ USAF. The NAREC meeting
   will also serve as a forum for senior USAF leaders to focus on a national strategic vision for ranges/
   airspace and keep members informed of national-level events and trends affecting airspace and range
   actions. NAREC membership includes as a minimum, the chair of each regional council and the
   senior officers charged with airspace and range responsibilities from the MAJCOM and Air Staff. The
   NAREC is co-chaired by AF/A3O and an equivalent NGB general officer. All AFREPs and MAJ-
   COM airspace and range managers and Range/Airspace Division Chiefs should attend this meeting.
   Senior representatives from other government agencies and services may be invited by the regional
   co-chair and should be approved by the national co-chairs as required.
   1.3.6. NAREC/Regional Meeting Outlines. Meetings should be arranged to address on-going issues,
   assign OPR/OCRs, and track action progress. MAJCOM, state, and/or unit representatives can also
   brief pertinent issues to the Council.
   1.3.7. Unit/MAJCOM/Airspace and Range Councils—General. The ARCs provide a forum for
   designing, updating, and tracking proposed airspace and range actions in support of unit flying mis-
   sions. Units and MAJCOMs may conduct their own ARCs to address specific airspace and range
   needs.
   1.3.7. (ACC) ARC memberships at the unit level will consist of, as a minimum, representatives from
   operations, environmental, legal, and public affairs. A senior officer, normally the unit Operations
   Group commander or equivalent, will chair the ARC.
   1.3.8. NAREC/Regional Airspace and Range Council Minutes. All minutes from the NAREC and
   regional ARCs will be forwarded to the MAJCOM POCs for Airspace and Range Management. All
   MAJCOM Airspace and Range Management offices will forward applicable regional ARC minutes to
   units within that region.
1.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Alleged Military Pilot Deviations. CAM is the OPR to process
alleged violations of FAR by 366 FW aircrews unless specifically reassigned by 366 OG/CC. CAM will
conduct investigations of alleged pilot deviations, spill-outs or spill-ins of SUA and over-flight, noise or
sonic boom complaints. Investigation findings will be submitted to 366 OG/CC for required disciplinary
or training actions as necessary.

     1.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) When notified of an alleged violation investigation, aircrew
     members shall provide a detailed written narrative of the incident to CAM within 2 working days.
     This narrative shall contain as a minimum:
        1.4.1.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Basic mission data (e.g., call sign, date and time, mission
        profile, speed, altitude, etc.)
        1.4.1.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Chronology of what happened
        1.4.1.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Incident weather conditions
        1.4.1.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Quality of communications
        1.4.1.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Other pertinent information relevant to the investigation
     1.4.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) CAM will conduct an initial investigation into the facts sur-
     rounding the incident, which may require fact-finding interviews with the incident aircrew. CAM will
     collect and maintain a file of pertinent documents concerning the alleged violation, including pilot
     narrative/interview details, flying schedule, flight plan (DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan/stereo
     flight plan), or any other significant documentation appropriate for completion of the investigation.
     Once the violation package arrives from FAA, this file will be used to conduct the final investigation
     and formulate a return response. The final investigation package will be maintained by 366 OSS/
     OSOA until no longer needed, but must be kept not less than 1 year from closeout date of investiga-
     tion.
1.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft
(MARSA). MARSA is used to facilitate IFR aircraft operations when military mission requirements
demand less than the standard separation specified by ATC. Individual aircrews do not have authority to
implement MARSA unless they are in compliance with the procedures outlined in Mountain Home AFB
Instruction (MHAFBI) 11-250, Airfield Operations and Base Flying Procedures. The only authority for
granting MARSA at MHAFB is 366 FW/CC (Commander), and must be detailed, in writing, as to when
and where authorized.
1.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Letter of Agreement (LOA) Review and Approval. 3 6 6 O S S /
OSOA will maintain a master library of current airspace management LOAs dealing with airspace in
which the wing trains. These LOAs will be reviewed annually, coordinated with Airfield Operations
Flight (366 OSS/OSA), Stan/Eval (366 OG/OGV), Cowboy Control MRU (266 RANS/DO) and review
status relayed as part of the Airfield Operations Board briefing. Revision of wing airspace management
LOAs will include coordination with HQ ACC/A3AA. Annual reviews should be completed and docu-
mented by the end of each calendar year.
1.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Airspace Legal Review. CAM will annually review the following
documents to ensure adequate and accurate documentation exists to support aircrew understanding of pro-
cedures for compliance maintenance:
     1.7.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Mountain Home Range Complex (MHRC) April – June
     Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) annual restrictions in aircrew guidance and other publications.
     1.7.2. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) ETI Record of Decision for the United States Air Force ETI,
     dated 10 March 1998.
     1.7.3. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Supplement to the Record of Decision for the United States
     Air Force ETI, signed September 1998.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                    19


   1.7.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Settlement Agreement between the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of
   Duck Valley Reservation and the United States, signed on behalf of the Air Force on 7 August 1996.
   1.7.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Settlement Agreement Resolving Claims Over United States
   Air Force Composite Wing and Proposal for ETI, signed November 1999. Reviewing these docu-
   ments in January of each year will ensure the compelling reasons for maintaining/instituting them, are
   valid from a mission completion/requirement standpoint as they relate to airspace. This review also
   provides a rationale for addressing modifications to these legal structures, if required.
1.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Environmental Analysis. CAM will maintain a library of existing
environmental compliance records for wing managed training airspace. This documentation will be used
to determine baseline data for operations conducted within training airspace. Additional operations
requiring certification will be requested via AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
through the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron, Environmental Flight (366 CES/CEVA).

                                                   Chapter 2

                               AIRSPACE FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS

2.1. Special Use Airspace (SUA). SUA is a designation for airspace that is of a defined vertical and lat-
eral dimension that alerts users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those activities from other
airspace users to enhance safety. Certain limitations or restrictions may be placed on non-participating air-
craft. Except for controlled firing areas (CFA), SUA is depicted on aeronautical charts. Additional infor-
mation on SUA may be found in the following: Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 73, Special Use
Airspace, current edition; FAAO 7400.2, FAAO 7400.8, Special Use Airspace; and Flight Information
Publications (FLIP): General Planning (Chapter 2), AP/1A, AP/2A, and AP/3A. SUA includes Con-
trolled Firing Areas (CFA), Military Operations Areas (MOA), Restricted Areas, Warning Areas, Alert
Areas, Prohibited Areas, and National Security Areas (NSA) (CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii only).
     2.1.1. Controlled Firing Area (CFA). CFAs contain civilian and military activities that could be haz-
     ardous to non-participating aircraft. These include rocket testing, ordnance disposal, and small arms
     fire. CFAs are differentiated from MOAs and restricted areas in that the hazardous activities are sus-
     pended to avoid a potential hazard to non-participating aircraft. Radar or a ground lookout is utilized
     to indicate when an aircraft might be approaching the area, and activities are then suspended. CFAs
     are not depicted on aeronautical charts.
     2.1.2. Military Operations Area (MOA). Airspace designated for nonhazardous military activity,
     established outside Class A airspace, below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), and within US territo-
     rial airspace. Activities conducted in MOAs include, but are not limited to, aerobatics, air combat tac-
     tics, and formation training. This airspace serves to segregate non-participating Instrument Flight
     Rules (IFR) aircraft from the activity and inform non-participating Visual Flight Rules (VFR) aircraft
     where these activities are being conducted. VFR aircraft are not restricted from transiting MOAs.
     2.1.3. Restricted Area. Designated areas established by appropriate authority where aircraft flight,
     while not wholly prohibited, is subject to restriction. They are shown on aeronautical charts and pub-
     lished in Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). Restricted Areas are designated rulemaking airspace under 14
     CFR Part 73, where restrictions are placed on all non-participating aircraft. This airspace is used to
     contain military activities that are hazardous to non-participating aircraft, and lies within the territorial
     airspace of the United States. The term "hazardous" implies, but is not limited to, live firing of weap-
     ons and/or aircraft testing.
     2.1.4. Warning Area. Airspace of defined dimensions extending from 3 or 12 nautical miles (NM)
     outward from the coast of the United States containing activity that may be hazardous to non-partici-
     pating aircraft. The purpose of warning areas is to warn non-participating pilots of the potential dan-
     ger. Warning Areas may be located over domestic waters, international waters, or both. They are
     equivalent to ICAO "danger areas" and are exclusively located over the coastal waters of the US and
     its territories. Activity may be hazardous, but international agreements do not provide for prohibition
     of flight in international airspace so no restriction to flight exists. DOD Directive 4540.1, Use of Air-
     space by US Military Aircraft and Firings Over the High Seas, 13 January 1981, applies to activities
     conducted in this airspace. Executive Order 10854, Extension of the application of the Federal Avia-
     tion Act of 1958, establishes the relationship between the DOD, State Department, and FAA regarding
     warning areas and military operations within international airspace under the purview of FAA air traf-
     fic services. Presidential Proclamation No. 5928, Territorial sea of the United States of America, 27
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                       21


  December 1988, codified in Title 3, Code of Federal Regulations, extended the US territorial bound-
  ary limit from 3 to 12 NM.
  2.1.5. Alert Area. Airspace designated to inform pilots of a high level of training activity or any
  unusual activity where prior knowledge would significantly enhance air safety. Examples of alert
  areas include very busy airports or areas of high-density oil-rig helicopter traffic. Activity conducted
  in this airspace is in accordance with FARs (unless waived or exempted). There are no restrictions
  placed on non-participating IFR or VFR aircraft.
  2.1.6. Prohibited Area. Prohibited areas prohibit overflight of a surface area in the interest of national
  security or environmental protection. Aircraft are prohibited from flying within a prohibited area
  without permission of the using agency. There are no prohibited areas managed by the DOD. Exam-
  ples of prohibited areas include the White House, the National Mall, and Camp David. Prohibited
  areas are depicted in most publication with a “P” followed by a numeric identifier, e.g., P56.
  2.1.7. National Security Area (NSA). An NSA is designated where there is a requirement for
  increased security and safety of ground facilities. When it is necessary to provide a greater level of
  security and safety, flight in NSAs may be temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions
  of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 99.7, Special Security Instructions, current edition.
     2.1.7.1. Per FAAO 7400.2, an NSA is designated to enhance national security and protect national
     assets. An NSA is identified on sectional aeronautical charts to inform users of the NAS regarding
     the NSA’s vertical and lateral dimensions, but is not an exclusionary airspace that can be used to
     prevent aircraft from entering that airspace. FAAO 7400.2 states, “pilots are requested to voluntar-
     ily avoid flying through an NSA.” Hence, charted NSAs are advisory in nature only. An NSA is
     not a vehicle to preclude aircraft from entering the designated airspace, or to protect any asset or
     operation within or beneath the NSA. Caution: Units/installations should balance the advantage of
     charting an NSA to the disadvantage of highlighting a national asset to the general public.
     2.1.7.2. If it is determined that security measures within an established NSA require the tempo-
     rary restriction of flight activity, a temporary flight restriction (TFR) would need to be coordinated
     with the FAA to restrict flight within that volume of airspace charted as an NSA. In addition to
     requesting a TFR through FAA channels IAW 14 CFR Part 99.7, and FAAO 7210.3, Facility
     Operation and Administration, units/installations shall coordinate through their respective MAJ-
     COM airspace management offices and AF/A3O-AR.
     2.1.7.3. If a unit determines that an NSA is required as a candidate measure to achieve required
     increased protective measures for the installation or owned facility, the unit should address the
     requirement through the base/installation anti-terrorism/force protection working group. As a nor-
     mal practice of identifying installation security risks and protective measures, use the criteria
     established in FAAO 7400.2 to determine the dimensions of the required airspace. The dimensions
     should be limited to the minimum required to promote the protection of the national asset or area
     identified (e.g., identify the area of interest vice the entire base property). For processing actions
     for an NSA, see para 3.4.
  2.1.8. Joint Use. Under the ‘joint-use’ concept, SUA is released to the controlling agency and
  becomes available for access by non-participating aircraft during periods when the airspace is not
  needed by the using agency for its designated purpose. Such use enhances safety and benefits the
  NAS. The USAF encourages the use of military radar units and the provisions of military air traffic
  services for SUA complexes when such services are available to enhance safety and utility.

NOTE: The sole responsibility to remain within assigned SUA rests with the pilot, whether flying under
IFR or VFR.

2.2. Airspace for Special Use (ASU) Designations. These designations are in either FAAO 7610.4 or in
military regulations and documents. ASU designations are not rulemaking actions and some (contained
solely in military documents) may not require coordination with the FAA for establishment. ASU is used
to collectively identify non-SUA assets. ASU is airspace of defined dimensions wherein activities must be
confined because of their nature and where limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are
not a part of those activities. ASU includes Aerial Refueling (AR) Tracks/Anchors, Air Traffic Control
Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) areas, TFR, Cruise Missile
Routes, Local Flying Area, Military Training Routes (Instrument Routes [IR]/Visual Routes [VR], and
Slow Routes [SR]).
     2.2.1. Aerial Refueling (AR) Airspace. Airspace developed according to the provisions of FAAO
     7610.4 to conduct air refueling. Permanent air refueling airspace is designated as either a track or an
     anchor or established via a letter of agreement (LOA) with the appropriate ATC facility responsible
     for the airspace. After coordination with ATC, refueling routes or anchors are processed through the
     appropriate AFREP for publication in FLIP. Temporary or special AR airspace may also be estab-
     lished by coordination/agreement with the ATC facility having purview over the airspace.
     2.2.2. Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA). Defined airspace normally within Class A
     airspace (above 18,000 feet MSL) and established in accordance with FAAO 7610.4 by an LOA with
     the ATC facility having responsibility for the airspace. ATCAAs were established to permit the con-
     tinuation of MOA activities above 18,000 feet MSL. They can be combined with an MOA or estab-
     lished as a stand-alone piece of airspace. MOAs are depicted on aeronautical charts, but ATCAAs are
     not. Non-participating aircraft are separated from the military activity being conducted within the
     ATCAA by ATC. VFR aircraft are permitted to enter an MOA, but are not permitted to enter most
     ATCAAs because they are not permitted to fly VFR above 18,000 feet MSL.
     2.2.3. Low-Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Areas. Usually large geographic areas established
     for random VFR, low altitude navigation training to preclude flying over the same point more than
     once per day. Activities are in accordance with all applicable FARs and flown at an airspeed of 250
     knots or less. MAJCOMs will determine establishment criteria. There is no required coordination with
     the FAA. LATN areas are not published on aeronautical charts. Environmental documentation in
     accordance with AFI 32-7061 is required. Send copies of LATN areas to the appropriate AFREP. A
     full description of the LATN area(s) and any restrictions will be maintained in the unit flight opera-
     tions office.
     2.2.3. (ACC) Low Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area Development. L AT N a r e a s a r e
     developed for aircraft that normally operate at airspeed of 250 knots or less. LATN areas should pro-
     vide pilots with a varying degree of geographical landmarks for navigation, reconnaissance, low alti-
     tude equipment operation/analysis, etc. LATN areas shall, to the maximum extent possible, include a
     land mass that will allow aircraft to operate all appropriate aircraft systems to meet mission require-
     ments and encompass a variety of ground tracks to ensure that the same ground track is not used on a
     recurring (daily) basis.
        2.2.3.1. (Added-ACC) LATN areas shall normally be established at or below 1500 AGL.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                      23


     2.2.3.2. (Added-ACC) Compliance with all applicable FARs is mandatory. The avoidance of per-
     sons, structures, and obstructions is paramount.
     2.2.3.3. (Added-ACC) A Test and Training Space Need Statement (T/TSNS) will be initiated for
     each new LATN area to be developed. Forward the T/TSNS and a map of the proposed LATN area
     to HQ ACC/A3AA for evaluation and review. HQ ACC/A3AA will provide assistance as required
     in the development of the LATN area. The unit’s OG is the approval authority for the LATN once
     coordination is accomplished.
     2.2.3.4. (Added-ACC) Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) documentation will be in
     accordance with Title 32, CFR, part 989. Environmental documentation shall be retained on file
     by the proponent and updated as required to reflect current operations.
     2.2.3.5. (Added-ACC) Documentation establishing LATN areas shall be kept on file by the pro-
     ponent in accordance with USAF RDS Table 13. A copy of the approved documentation and area
     chart will be provided to HQ ACC/A3AA.
  2.2.4. Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR). A TFR can be established to protect people or property
  from a temporary hazard when the presence of low-flying aircraft would magnify, alter, spread, or
  compound the hazard. TFRs provide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft and
  prevent unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event that may generate a high
  degree of interest. TFRs are commonly used to increase the safety of aircraft performing aerial fire-
  fighting operations. This information is available via NOTAM and the implementing NOTAM will
  contain specific information to preclude misunderstanding.
  2.2.5. Cruise Missile Routes. Cruise missile operations conducted in excess of 250 knots and below
  10,000 feet MSL are conducted in restricted areas, MOAs, and along selected IRs during daylight
  hours under VFR conditions. Cruise missiles will be accompanied by two escort aircraft that have the
  ability to maneuver the missile out of the flight path of conflicting traffic at all times.
  2.2.6. Local Flying Areas. Most military facilities develop local flying areas within which they can
  conduct routine, non-hazardous training activity. These areas are normally developed in conjunction
  with local FAA controllers and airspace managers and are de-conflicted with other airspace such as
  Class B, C, or D airspace, SUA, or ASU.
  2.2.7. Military Training Routes (MTR). The MTR program is established by the FAA and the DOD
  for the purpose of conducting low-altitude, high-speed training. Generally, MTRs are established
  below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Each segment of an MTR
  route is allocated a floor and ceiling altitude and lateral boundaries, described in NM left and right of
  centerline. MTRs are established according to the criteria in FAAO 7610.4. Routes are established as
  either IR or VR. The DOD has a speed exemption to 14 CFR Part 91.117 (see FAAO 7610.4). The
  FAA has approval authority over IR establishment and the appropriate MAJCOM approves establish-
  ment of VRs. Environmental documentation in accordance with AFI 32-7061 is required to establish
  MTRs. VRs are processed through the FAA via the AFREP. AFREPs assign all route numbers. Ulti-
  mately, MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on FLIP AP/1B Area Planning Chart, and
  FAA sectional charts. Some MTRs are on DOD Low IFR enroute charts.
  2.2.7. (MOUNTAINHOME) CAM is the focal point for all MTR actions and management issues
  related to same. CAM should perform the Mountain Home specific actions or requirements listed
  below:
24                       AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


     2.2.7.1. MTR Evaluations. MTR evaluations include route reviews that have a management focus
     and annual flight evaluations that have an operational focus. Units with scheduling authority for
     an MTR will conduct and document evaluations for all MTRs with a floor at or below 1,500 feet
     Above Ground Level (AGL) by the last day of the anniversary month. Failure to complete them in
     the prescribed time limits necessitates closing the route/segment, unless waived by the MAJCOM
     (or NAF where the MAJCOM has delegated this responsibility to the NAF). All MTRs shall be
     surveyed across their entire route width and length and aircrew route briefing guides updated to
     reflect new areas of concern. The SUA/MTR Review, Attachment 4, contains additional informa-
     tion required when reviewing MTR.
        2.2.7.1.1. Route Review. Route reviews should be conducted by the unit airspace manager
        using the Chart Updating Manual (CHUM), FLIP AP/1B, Sectional Aeronautical Charts, Tac-
        tical Pilotage Charts, and other aeronautical charts. Route reviews should annotate the follow-
        ing:
        2.2.7.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOME) CAM should perform chart route reviews on the beginning
        date of any 56-day (8-week) charting cycle. This will amount to a "table top" review of MTR
        routes using the current sectional chart (Falconview graphics accepted), AP/1B/chart,
        E-CHUM, and any other documents or charts necessary to validate the route (airspace) safety
        requirements. This time should also be used by CAM to become familiar with the other signif-
        icant changes in the charting period for the airspace under their control. Significant findings
        would be the basis for updated route briefing guide(s) as required. These reviews should be
        documented for each charting cycle.
            2.2.7.1.1.1. Charted/uncharted obstacles or hazards within 100 feet of the MTR floor and
            2 NM of the lateral boundary.
            2.2.7.1.1.2. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of public-use airports.
            2.2.7.1.1.3. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace. Also
            consider Class E airspace associated with non-towered airports and instrument approach
            procedures.
            2.2.7.1.1.4. Entry/exit/route segment within 5 NM of airways and charted VFR flyways.
            2.2.7.1.1.5. Potential bird attractant areas within 2 NM of a route that may attract large
            concentrations of birds.
            2.2.7.1.1.6. Potential noise-sensitive areas within 3 NM of a route. Review areas where
            restrictions are identified to minimize the impact of noise.
            2.2.7.1.1.7. TFRs established by FAA NOTAMs (i.e., wild fires, DOI environmentally
            sensitive animal breeding areas, and parachute jumping areas).
            2.2.7.1.1.8. Other potential flight safety hazards.
            2.2.7.1.1.9. Route reviews should also verify the accuracy of aircrew route briefings and
            ensure MTR Special Operating Procedures and Remarks published in FLIP AP/1B are
            accurate and complete. Review previous route evaluations to ensure any other previously
            identified findings have been appropriately addressed.
            2.2.7.1.1.10. Unit Civil Engineering environmental office shall review the route for envi-
            ronmentally sensitive areas.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                       25


          2.2.7.1.2. Route Evaluation. Route evaluations are intended as ongoing operational checks as
          to how a specific route is mission planned, entered, flown, and exited during day-to-day oper-
          ations. Route evaluations are used to document uncharted or undocumented obstacles, envi-
          ronmentally sensitive areas, and other potential flight safety hazards, to include planning
          deficiencies and potential flight conflicts with other routes, Class B, C, and D airspace, and air
          traffic service procedures. Data gathered during route evaluations are to be used to recommend
          changes to USAF policy and procedures and to update in-flight guides, FLIP, and other perti-
          nent publications. Airspace managers should work with route schedulers and users to develop
          local evaluation methods to facilitate effective route evaluation by users and document fol-
          low-up and corrective action taken to alleviate flight safety hazards identified during evalua-
          tions.
NOTE: There is no required frequency for route evaluations. They should be accomplished by aircrew
on an as needed basis based on actual operations where problems were encountered.
          2.2.7.1.2. (MOUNTAINHOME) Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and other civilian helicopter/aircraft
          support is the primary means to accomplish annual MTR surveys (route evaluation), and the
          exact vehicle/agency used will be at the discretion of CAM, as funding permits. CAM should
          recognize the legitimate relationship between CAP and USAF, and make every effort to utilize
          CAP to the extent possible for MTR and other required airspace surveys. 366 FW flying units
          may be tasked by 366 OG/CC to provide one aircrew member per survey to fly as route survey
          observer if airspace manager is not available. If CAP/helicopter/aircraft support is not avail-
          able, flying units will be tasked by 366 OG/CC at the request of CAM to perform route sur-
          veys. Routes will be surveyed at a maximum of 420 knots ground speed at the lowest usable
          route altitude. Additional time may be required for multiple passes over route segments greater
          than 5 nautical miles wide. If military aircrews will be conducting route surveys, squadron
          operations officers will ensure aircrews selected are highly experienced and cleared for
          low-level operations at the lowest altitude commensurate with surveyed route. Selected 366
          FW aircrews will contact 366 OSS/OSOA at least 1 week prior to survey for a detailed brief-
          ing on route survey requirements and reporting details. If civilian aircraft are selected to con-
          duct the surveys, the pilot-in-command should contact CAM at least 2 weeks prior to survey
          date to discuss observers, pickup locations and schedule operations times/dates. Another
          potential avenue for completing the airspace surveys is the 124th Wing of the Idaho ANG. This
          support will be requested by CAM through the 124th Wing Operations Group Commander and
          authorized on a time and resource permitting basis. Coordination and reporting procedures
          between CAM and tasked aircrews will be as detailed for 366 FW aircrew members.
          2.2.7.1.3. MTR Annual Flight Evaluation. The annual flight evaluation complements the
          ongoing route evaluation program by continuing the operational check of the route. The
          annual flight evaluation provides important data, as it is not completed under the same mission
          conditions (e.g., aircraft type, speed, required systems checks, etc.) and ensures a comprehen-
          sive operational review of the MTR. Conduct the evaluation during the anniversary month
          after publication or within a year since the last flight evaluation (MTR segments with a floor
          of 1,500 feet AGL or higher need not be evaluated).
             2.2.7.1.3.1. Failure to meet the annual suspense shall preclude the use of MTRs until eval-
             uation requirements are met, unless waived by the MAJCOM.
26                         AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


              2.2.7.1.3.1. (ACC) Failure to complete the evaluation in the prescribed time limits neces-
              sitates closing the route unless waived by HQ ACC/A3A. Units will document and main-
              tain route evaluations.
              2.2.7.1.3.2. Evaluations should be conducted at low airspeeds to allow more time for
              observation. Evaluation aircraft should be either conventional aircraft capable of low air-
              speeds or helicopters. Use of Civil Air Patrol, aero club, or contract/charter is encouraged.
              Should such aircraft be unobtainable, the evaluation should be conducted at the slowest
              operational airspeed consistent with the type of aircraft normally flying the route.
              2.2.7.1.3.3. The route should be evaluated to ensure obstruction clearance at the minimum
              altitude usable for training. The evaluation aircrew should consider the route’s minimum
              defined altitude when considering an obstacle’s flight safety potential, as other units may
              train at lower altitudes. If possible, the airspace manager should act as a pilot or as an
              observer on as many evaluation flights as possible.
              2.2.7.1.3.4. Flight evaluation crew members should be familiar with low-altitude flying
              and evaluation requirements. They should receive a pre-brief from the scheduling activity
              and provide a de-briefing to the scheduling activity.
                  2.2.7.1.3.4.1. (Added-ACC) Airspace manager should serve as observer on as many
                  evaluation flights as possible.
              2.2.7.1.3.5. The scheduling activity, in coordination with the airspace manager, must
              develop an MTR survey schedule. The airspace manager must ensure the necessary charts
              are available for the evaluation and inform the Obstruction Evaluation/Airport Airspace
              Analysis (OE/AAA) Program Manager of uncharted obstructions within 100 feet below
              the floor and within 2 NM of the lateral boundary of the MTR or any other hazards to air
              traffic affecting low-altitude navigation.
              2.2.7.1.3.6. Routes less than 4 NM wide may require two passes; one each side of the cen-
              terline. Routes greater than 4 NM wide may require additional passes to complete an ade-
              quate evaluation. Route centerlines are established for charting and route width measuring
              purposes only and may not require a direct pass.
              2.2.7.1.3.7. All users must be alert for new obstructions/hazards. Aircrews should be
              briefed to report any observed construction (i.e., temporary cranes, mines, temporary heli-
              pads, etc.) or uncharted obstructions/hazards to the scheduling activity/airspace manager.
              Information should include latitude and longitude coordinates and estimated height and
              description of obstructions/hazards.
NOTE: Professional judgment is the key to effective evaluations. Visual acuity may vary greatly and the
parameters above are given as guidelines only. Evaluation aircrew must consider the impact of foliage,
haze, clouds, fog contrast (light), airspeed/ground speed, terrain, snow, and task saturation.
              2.2.7.1.3.8. The evaluation aircrew should consider the following when conducting evalu-
              ations:
NOTE: Document a potential hazard’s latitude and longitude for identification purposes. Provide an esti-
mated or actual height of the obstruction if possible.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                27


              2.2.7.1.3.8.1. Accuracy, adequacy, and availability of mission planning materials for
              the route.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.2. Accuracy and completeness of the aircrew route briefing.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.3. Potential hazards during entry and exit procedures, to include possible
              ATC conflicts, ATC center/sector boundaries, possible communication problems, fre-
              quency congestion, and task saturation.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.4. Identify obstacles not listed in the CHUM that pose a hazard.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.5. Possible ATC conflicts from public-use airports to include portions of
              the route within 5 NM of Class B, C, and D airspace. Also consider Class E airspace
              associated with non-towered airports and instrument approach procedures.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.6. Possible ATC conflicts from airways, charted VFR flyways or practice
              areas, and other MTRs.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.7. Potential for bird strikes from bird attractant areas to include known
              migratory routes.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.8. Built-up areas showing new development (buildings) including evi-
              dence of mining activity.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.9. Environmentally sensitive areas not previously identified.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.10. Possible interference to night vision goggle operations.
              2.2.7.1.3.8.11. Other potential flight safety hazards.
           2.2.7.1.3.9. The evaluation aircrew should return the survey documentation to the sched-
           uling activity/airspace manager. Aircrews should also debrief the scheduling activity on
           specific observations and their potential to create conflicts and/or task saturation with
           flight operations.
    2.2.7.2. Evaluation Results. Airspace managers must coordinate with schedulers and the senior
    operational commander on any route, or a segment of a route, found to contain potential flight
    safety hazards. An assessment of the hazard must be conducted prior to closing or reopening the
    route or route segment. Ensure corrective actions are documented.
       2.2.7.2.1. Report uncharted obstacles on MTRs to the scheduling activity/airspace manager as
       soon as possible after landing. Airspace managers shall update uncharted obstacles, within 100
       feet of the floor and within 2 NM of the lateral boundary of the MTR for inclusion in the Spe-
       cial Operating Procedures in FLIP AP/1B of the evaluated route.
           2.2.7.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Use FAA Form 7110-4 to identify uncharted obstacles, for
           inclusion in the Special Operating Procedures.
           2.2.7.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) Uncharted obstructions above 200 AGL should be reported to
           the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) through HQ ACC/A3AA.
       2.2.7.2.2. Units shall remove all references to charted obstacles from the route Special Oper-
       ating Procedures in FLIP AP/1B. Include uncharted obstacles in the aircrew route briefing
       guides.
28                           AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


        2.2.7.3. Aircrew Route Briefing Guides. Units shall prepare and maintain aircrew route briefing
        guides for each MTR for which they are the scheduling activity. Briefing guides will include spe-
        cial operating procedures and constraints and may emphasize items already mentioned in FLIP
        AP/1B.
        2.2.7.3. (MOUNTAINHOME) Airspace manager will provide detailed route briefings on pub-
        lished and unpublished obstacles, noise sensitive areas, de-confliction requirements, etc., for wing
        managed MTRs to 366 FW/CP (Command Post), 366 OSS/OSOS (Airspace Scheduling) and fly-
        ing units that use MTRs regularly. 366 OSS/OSOS will present route briefings to all other units
        scheduling the route during normal duty hours via electronic means. After duty hours, 366 FW/CP
        will be responsible for route briefing. Route briefs should be completed/distributed within 1 week
        of actual route survey completion date. If details of the survey indicate a potential hazard, the
        route should be closed by CAM until such time the hazard can be verified and aircrews advised
        appropriately.
            2.2.7.3.1. (Added-ACC) Route briefing guides’ route deconfliction procedures, special oper-
            ating procedures, and/or constraints that are not covered in the FLIP AP/1B.
            2.2.7.3.2. (Added-ACC) Establish procedures to ensure opposite direction MTRs are not
            simultaneously scheduled.
            2.2.7.3.3. (Added-ACC) An MTR will be used only for those activities for which it was
            designed and environmentally accessed.
        2.2.7.4. FLIP AP/1B, Special Operating Procedures/Remarks. FLIP AP/1B provides information
        and operating instructions for all MTRs. Therefore, it is critical that units ensure information listed
        in FLIP AP/1B is complete and accurate. Originating and scheduling activities must ensure FLIP
        AP/1B identifies those procedures for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft on their respec-
        tive MTRs. At a minimum, units shall include the following in Special Operating Procedures or
        Remarks:
            2.2.7.4.1. Potential hazards during entry, exit and flying of the route. Include listing all Class
            B, C, and D airspace within 5 NM of the route. Include reference to the applicable Sectional
            Aeronautical Chart.
            2.2.7.4.2. Unpublished/uncharted obstruction data pending publishing/charting.
            2.2.7.4.3. Route deconfliction procedures.
            2.2.7.4.4. Possible bird attractant areas and migratory routes.
            2.2.7.4.5. Noise and low-level flight sensitive areas.
            2.2.7.4.6. Uncharted airports.
            2.2.7.4.7. Other potential flight safety hazards.
     2.2.8. Slow Speed Low Altitude Training Routes (SR). SRs are low-level training routes used for mil-
     itary air operations conducted at or below 1,500 feet AGL and at an airspeed of 250 knots or less.
     Unlike IR and VR MTRs, SRs are not technically part of the MTR system and therefore have no direc-
     tive guidance in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) or FAAO 7610.4. MAJCOMs will deter-
     mine establishment criteria. There is no requirement for coordination with the FAA. SRs are published
     in FLIP AP/1B; however, they are not published on aeronautical charts. Environmental documenta-
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                    29


   tion in accordance with AFI 32-7061 is required. There is no overall mechanism to inform military or
   civilian aviators that an SR is active, as Automated Flight Services Stations are not notified. A full
   description of the SRs and any restrictions will be maintained in the unit flight operations office.
       2.2.8.1. (Added-ACC) Slow Speed Low Altitude Training Route (SR) Development. S R ’s
       are developed for aircraft that normally operate at airspeeds of 250 knots or less.
          2.2.8.1.1. (Added-ACC) Altitudes and Corridors. SRs shall be established at or below
          1500 AGL. SR widths will be of sufficient size to encompass all planned activities required for
          the aircraft training profile. Under no circumstances should the route be wider than 20 NMs.
          2.2.8.1.2. (Added-ACC) Compliance with all applicable FARs is mandatory. The avoidance
          of persons, structures, and obstructions is paramount.
          2.2.8.1.3. (Added-ACC) Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) documentation will
          be in accordance with Title 32, CFR, part 989. Environmental documentation shall be retained
          on file by the proponent and updated as required to reflect current operations.
          2.2.8.1.4. (Added-ACC) Documentation establishing SR will be accomplished using a FAA
          Form 7110-4. Maintain all documents in accordance with USAF RDS Table 13, rule-4.
2.3. (Added-ACC) Scheduling SUA/ASU. SUA/ASU is a DoD resource. Although ACC-managed/
scheduled SUA/ASU is established to support ACC requirements, scheduling agencies of ACC SUA/
ASU will support the requirements of other DoD airspace users. ACC-managed SUA/ASU will be sched-
uled on an exclusive use basis. ACC units using SUA/ASU scheduled by other DoD agencies may operate
on a mutual/concurrent use basis consistent with the host unit’s policy.
2.4. (Added-ACC) Exercise Airspace. The coordination and or development of airspace to support spe-
cial events such as Field Training Exercises, Operational Readiness Inspections, Evaluations, or Joint
Chiefs of Staff Exercises may require the involvement of the unit, NAF, DRU and/or MAJCOM airspace
managers as trusted agents.
   2.4.1. (Added-ACC) Develop temporary or modify existing airspace for exercises IAW FAAO
   7610.4 and/or 7400.2. Use of exercise airspace may require environmental assessment. Conduct exer-
   cise planning with sufficient lead time to meet FAA timelines to secure airspace approval and notifi-
   cation.
2.5. (Added-ACC) Arming of Weapons. The arming of a weapon does not constitute a hazardous activ-
ity because a separate and distinct action must be taken to release the weapon. Therefore, an armed
weapon is considered non-hazardous until the pilot makes a deliberate attempt to release the weapon.
2.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) MHRC Airspace/ATCAA Descriptions. M H R C                      Airspace
(Attachment 15 (Added), Illustration of MHRC) is the area south of MHAFB made up of: Paradise East/
West, Owyhee, Jarbidge MOAs, ATCAA (as assigned by the Salt Lake City ARTCC) R3202 and R3204.

       2.9.4.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) The following details are applicable to the Saddle Corri-
       dor only:
       Altitudes: Its typical vertical boundaries are FL 180 to FL 220, or as assigned by Salt Lake City
       ARTCC.
       Restrictions: The Saddle Corridor is designed to function only as transition airspace between
       MHRC and Saddle MOA, as required. It is NOT authorized as "fighting" airspace for engage-
       ments, kill regeneration or marshalling and such activities will NOT take place therein.
   2.9.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) MHRC ATCAA: The MHRC ATCAA typically extends from
   the top of the existing restricted areas and MOA to FL 500. When not cleared/assigned at the time of
   initial check-in with Cowboy Control, aircrews are responsible to ensure ATCAA areas and altitudes
   have been approved for assignment before operating above FL180 over MOA structures or above FL
   290 over restricted areas.

                                                  Chapter 3

                         PROCESSING AIRSPACE AND RANGE ACTIONS

3.1. Test/Training Space Needs Statement (T/TSNS). T/TSNS is defined as air, land, or sea that is used
to conduct test/training activities. In a T/TSNS, proponents describe the operational requirement, concept,
alternatives, and an analysis of competing stakeholders in a brief document. The T/TSNS should be com-
pleted prior to initiating the USAF EIAP and once validated, can serve as the starting point for developing
the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA). Actions to establish or modify test/train-
ing space (including ranges, ATCAAs, MOAs, MTRs, Restricted Areas, Warning Areas, or permanent
airspace), except those purely administrative in nature, will be reviewed by the unit, MAJCOM, and AF/
A3O-AR. Coordination should include MAJCOM Civil Engineer (office responsible for Environment
Analysis), Legal, and PA offices. Modification to test/training space that does not alter the dimensions,
altitudes, times of designation (such as changing the designation of the controlling or using agency or cor-
rection of typographical errors in the published description), or LOA changes, will be reviewed by the
unit and MAJCOM and do not require a T/TSNS.
     3.1.1. Airspace actions in this preliminary stage should be referred to as “concepts”, since there is no
     assurance that outlined solution will move forward to be developed into a formal action that would
     require an aeronautical/environmental proposal developed in cooperation with the FAA. During infor-
     mal liaison with stakeholders, it is important to keep in mind the use of the flexible and less formal-
     ized status of a “concept” rather than a more developed and stringent action required in a proposal
     status.
     3.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOME) Recommended Airspace/Range Changes. Personnel with recom-
     mendations for new airspace/range requirements, or current airspace modifications, should notify
     CAM of the conceptual need with specific justification in writing utilizing the Airspace Modification
     Request (Attachment 18 (Added), Airspace Modification Request Worksheet).
     3.1.2. (Added-ACC) Processing Airspace Proposals. Prior to beginning an airspace proposal, unit
     airspace managers should review the ACC Airspace Master Plan and contact HQ ACC/A3AA to coor-
     dinate the proposal. The unit airspace manager must coordinate with the Airfield Operations Flight
     Commander to ensure TERPS considerations are addressed.
        3.1.2.1. (Added-ACC) Develop airspace proposals IAW the FAAO 7610.4 and/or FAAO 7400.2.
        Use the current sectional chart, or full size printed facsimile of the current sectional chart, to depict
        the airspace proposal. Submit the proposal through the chain of command to HQ ACC/A3AA.
     3.1.3. (Added-ACC) The airspace management proponent must keep a copy of completed airspace
     action (to include the applicable final environmental documentation) for historical records. See USAF
     RDS, Table 13-4.
     3.1.4. (Added-ACC) Development of SUA/ASU. Prior to initiating a new airspace proposal, exam-
     ine the suitability of existing SUA/ASU, the capacity of the airspace being examined to accommodate
     projected requirements, and coordinate with local air traffic control (ATC) agencies. Process changes
     in the same manner as new proposals.

3.2. T/TSNS Procedures. Development of the T/TSNS will vary depending upon the level of initiation
and scope of the need. Units may initiate their own T/TSNS for perceived needs, or by direction from
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                       37


their MAJCOMs for a unit mission change. For example, an F-16 unit may be directed to change their
mission from air defense to general purpose, or a fighter unit may be equipped with a new missile with
capabilities and tactics that dictate different training space characteristics. At a higher level, a MAJCOM
may have the need to initiate a significant change in training for a completely new weapon system. New
and ongoing T/TSNSs will also be addressed at the applicable ARC, for the purpose of providing a
regional perspective to ongoing initiatives. Unit or MAJCOM procedures apply as follows:
   3.2.1. Unit T/TSNS. For unit proponents, the T/TSNS is initially coordinated through the unit and
   approved by the wing commander (or equivalent). The T/TSNS is then forwarded to the MAJCOM
   for review, comment, and/or concurrence, as appropriate.
       3.2.1.1. MAJCOM and Air Staff Review. If the MAJCOM concurs with an initiative (this
       includes the NGB and AFRC), the MAJCOM will forward the T/TSNS to AF/A3O-AR, for Air
       Staff review and comment. The Air Staff (AF/A3O-AR, SAF/IEI, SAF/IEE, AF/A7CPB, SAF/
       GCN, AF/A3O-AD [AFREP], and other offices deemed appropriate) review shall be completed
       within 30 working days of AF/A3O-AR receipt. AFREPs will ensure that the T/TSNS is coordi-
       nated with other Service Area MILREPs to determine any impact to USAF or other service air-
       space actions. If the 30-day suspense cannot be met, AF/A3O-AR will notify the MAJCOM. The
       Air Staff will identify issues during this initial review prior to further MAJCOM processing and
       approval.
   3.2.2. MAJCOM T/TSNS. If the T/TSNS is initiated by a MAJCOM, the MAJCOM forwards it to
   AF/A3O-AR for Air Staff review. A MAJCOM-initiated T/TSNS would be appropriate when a new
   weapon system or weapon could require a significant change in test/training space configuration (e.g.,
   F-22, JDAM, etc.).

3.3. Writing the T/TSNS. The T/TSNS shall be as clear and concise as possible, with a depth and scope
sufficient to allow a reasonable review and assessment. The document length does not need to be more
than five pages (not including any supporting attachments). The T/TSNS covers the same subject matter
as the formal DOPAA; however, it is not expected to address all items in the level of detail required in a
DOPAA. The T/TSNS should be an "in-house" effort, as opposed to preparation by a contractor. The for-
mat for T/TSNS is as follows:
   3.3.1. Title: The title of the T/TSNS shall be a concise description of the concept and have a unique
   alphanumeric designation. The format will be: MAJCOM, 2-digit year, 3-digit sequence number
   (assigned by MAJCOM), unit or proponent, and the title of the initiative (Example: ACC-06-001:
   Anytown AFB, F-24 Beddown). Include on the title page the T/TSNS proponent’s name and phone
   number.
   3.3.2. Operational Requirement/Justification: Briefly discuss what has changed. What MAJCOM
   specific requirement(s) are driving this action? Include unit and mission; other units concerned, if any,
   weapon systems characteristics and coordination accomplished to date.
   3.3.3. Concept: Briefly describe the concept and include maps that illustrate the current and future
   airspace/range structure, to include altitudes, legend, and a scale. The concept should detail who wants
   to do what, where, and why, including objectives of the action. How does the concept satisfy the need?
   Be sure to include: the boundary dimensions/description (**NM x **NM), the volume (10,000 feet
   MSL to FL 600), its attributes (use of chaff and flares, supersonic, threats, targets, frequency spec-
   trum, mountainous terrain, etc.), the frequency and periods of use (0800-2200 Monday-Friday) and its
38                            AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


     proximity to the installation. This concept should not be so detailed as to prematurely eliminate poten-
     tially reasonable alternatives.
     3.3.4. Alternatives: Briefly list several alternatives to the concept, including a “No Action” alterna-
     tive. Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from a common sense, techni-
     cal, and economic standpoint. In developing alternatives, consider alternatives that may be procedural
     or non-materiel in nature (e.g., renegotiation of LOAs with the Army, FAA, or Navy, or implementa-
     tion of seasonally based deconfliction procedures during peak use periods). “No Action” means the
     continuation of present management activities without implementing the concept. Impacts may
     include: quantifiable degradation to training, inability to meet mission objectives or higher headquar-
     ters direction, inefficiencies, costs, etc.
     3.3.5. Competing Interest Potential: T/TSNS actions have the potential to raise controversial issues,
     reaching to the national level, very early in the planning process. For this reason, it is important that
     USAF planning and review processes for airspace actions be as thorough as possible, with identifica-
     tion and involvement of concerned parties, public and private, early in the process. Understanding
     other stakeholder interests leads to “win-win” alternatives. Public involvement in, and notification of,
     airspace actions and proposals is not just a legal requirement, but a smart and efficient way to increase
     the chances of success for a concept. USAF proponents should develop a plan early in the process to
     involve groups with competing interests in the process to achieve the desired results. Use all available
     resources (subject matter expertise, previous environmental actions, etc.) to assess any possible com-
     peting interests from stakeholders that may be impacted by your action. Briefly state in bullet format
     whether the concept or any of the alternatives may impact any of the following or other areas: recre-
     ational areas (parks: federal, state, and local); Native American reservations, lands, or areas of special
     interest; grazing or farming; endangered species; wildlife refuges; consultation with other state/fed-
     eral agencies; archaeological sites; hunting and fishing areas; population centers, communities, previ-
     ously identified or potential noise sensitive areas; ongoing litigation which may be impacted; other
     training space actions that may be impacted; and regional actions by other MAJCOMs or military
     departments. Identify if there are any outside agencies that have requested or, in your opinion, would
     support the concept (federal, state, local, and/or stakeholder groups) and if any coordination has been
     completed to date.

3.4. Processing an NSA Request. The NSA proposal should clearly state the rationale for the NSA
requirement and the proposed boundaries of the NSA (include a map). All NSA proposals should be coor-
dinated through the installation airspace and ATC offices. If local ATC service is not provided by the
requesting unit or host installation, coordinate the initiative with the ATC facility providing this service
before being forwarded to the wing/installation commander for approval and subsequent submission to
the MAJCOM.
     3.4.1. Following wing/installation commander approval, all NSA proposals will be forwarded to the
     MAJCOM airspace management office for appropriate HHQ coordination, with an information copy
     to the AFREP. AFREPs will not take action on NSA proposals until formal coordination has been
     requested by HQ AF/A3O-A.
     3.4.2. MAJCOM airspace management offices shall coordinate with respective ATC and security
     forces offices. Once approved by the MAJCOM, forward the NSA proposal to AF/A3O-AR.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                        39


       3.4.2.1. AF/A3O-AR will coordinate the proposal with SAF/GCN and other air staff agencies as
       appropriate. Once approved, AF/A3O-AR will forward the proposal to the AFREP for coordina-
       tion with the FAA.
       3.4.2.2. The USAF recognizes the potential vulnerability of certain facilities to threats from the
       air. However, concerns about the effect of flight-restricted airspace on the NAS have traditionally
       outweighed the potential security benefits provided by such a designation. Despite the numerous
       sites that might logically be expected to qualify for prohibited airspace, at this time fewer than ten
       such prohibited areas exist across the United States. Based on historic FAA responses to restricted
       flight over USAF installations/activities, units should not plan to permanently establish flight
       avoidance areas over installations/activities to satisfy local security requirements. Should a spe-
       cific and credible threat to an installation be identified, a TFR is the preferred alternative.

3.5. Post T/TSNS Environmental Analysis. Airspace and range actions are subject to environmental
analysis in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as promulgated
in AFI 32-7061. AFI 32-7061 incorporates by reference Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 989,
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), current edition, which is the controlling document on the
Air Force EIAP. Develop concepts that concern airspace under FAA jurisdiction according to the proce-
dures outlined in FAAO 7400.2 and FAAO 7610.4. Overseas units will work with host nation and/or liai-
son officers regarding proposed airspace actions. Submit USAF airspace actions to the FAA through the
AFREP. The AFREP will notify AF/A3O-AR when they receive the DOPAA. Airspace proposals for
temporary exercise airspace, provisions for short-term special missions outside of established airspace, or
similar actions should be reviewed by the MAJCOM with an information copy routed through the AFREP
to AF/A3O-AR.
   3.5.1. The proponent uses AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, Section I, Pro-
   ponent Information, to initiate the required environmental analysis process. The DOPAA is important
   for the successful initiation and completion of the process. To ensure proponents remain actively
   involved on the development of proposals and alternatives, it is recommended that units do not use
   contractors for this purpose. If contractors are used, proponent airspace managers must work closely
   with the contractor to ensure operational mission requirements are identified, airspace elements are
   specifically addressed, and potential impacts are adequately assessed.
       3.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) The Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA) should
       include all new/additional flying activities proposed. These activities should be described in suffi-
       cient detail to allow someone reviewing the document to understand the nature and extent of the
       proposal. At a minimum, it should include all proposed flying activities, including type and num-
       ber of airframes, use rates by day (0700-2200L) and night (2200-0700L), sorties/sortie-operations
       per month, and planned profiles (airspeeds and altitudes) to be flown. It should also include air-
       space utilization (MOAs and MTRs) where training and proposed flight activities are to be consid-
       ered.
       3.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) The DOPAA should address alternatives to the proposal. NEPA requires
       that the environmental analysis include a no-action alternative along with reasonable alternatives
       to the proposal. Reasonable alternatives are those that meet mission objectives. The DOPAA
       should include all reasonable alternatives. Questions on preparation and content of AF Form 813
       should be directed to the local environmental coordinator.

     3.5.2. Restricted Area proposals requesting designation from the surface will indicate that the propo-
     nent owns, leases, or by agreement controls the underlying surface. Failure to do so prior to submis-
     sion of the proposal may delay processing.

3.6. Letters of Agreement (LOA). Develop actions that concern airspace under FAA jurisdiction
according to the procedures outlined in FAAOs 7400.2 and 7610.4. Additional information on creating
LOAs with the FAA is found in FAAO 7210.3 and AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control.
     3.6.1. FAAO 7610.4 provides guidance for the following airspace initiatives:
        3.6.1.1. ATC Services by the Military.
        3.6.1.2. Military Operations Requirements and Procedures [SUA/ATCAA].
        3.6.1.3. Central Altitude Reservation Function Responsibilities.
        3.6.1.4. FAA/North American Air Defense/Pacific Air Forces Procedures for Control of Air
        Defense Aircraft.
        3.6.1.5. Military Training Routes (MTR), IR.
        3.6.1.6. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft.

3.7. Supersonic Operations. Conduct planned supersonic operations only under the following condi-
tions, and with appropriate consideration/evaluation of environmental impacts:
3.7. (MOUNTAINHOME) Supersonic Operations. 366 OSS/OSOA is the 366 FW's OPR for the
wing's supersonic program. The program will be managed IAW AFI 13-201. Each flying squadron will
develop procedures that ensure aircrews report supersonic activity using Attachment 18 (Added), Air-
space Denial/Supersonic Activity Worksheet. CAM is responsible for evaluating the nature and frequency
of supersonic activity and renewing application for continued supersonic activity as required (3-year
cycle).
     3.7.1. Over open water areas, above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 NM from any land area.
     3.7.2. Over land areas, above 30,000 feet MSL.
     3.7.3. Avoid areas of population concentration and “Avoidance Locations,” as well as HQ USAF
     specified critical areas listed in FLIP AP/1B.
        3.7.3.1. (Added-ACC) Supersonic operations above 30,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), or over
        water above 10,000 feet MSL and more than 15 nautical miles from land, may be conducted only
        after environmental review in accordance with Title 32, CFR, part 989 and approval by the Oper-
        ations Group Commander. Recurring supersonic operations above 30,000 feet MSL, or over water
        as described above, should be documented on an AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact
        Analysis.
     3.7.4. If units require supersonic flight operations outside the parameters in paragraphs 3.7.1. or
     3.7.2. above, submit a waiver request through MAJCOM A3 channels (include coordination with the
     MAJCOM and unit level EIAP program managers). Waiver requests shall include the appropriate
     level of environmental analysis (environmental assessment [EA] or unsigned finding of no significant
     impact [FONSI] or draft environmental impact statement [EIS]), and an airspace analysis document-
     ing existing and projected airspace utilization, availability, and deficiencies (see Attachment 5).
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                    41


  These materials must accompany the waiver request to AF/A3O-AR for Air Staff review, coordination
  (AF/A7CPB at a minimum) and approval. Send courtesy copies to the AFREP. Waivers will be valid
  for a period not to exceed 3-years.
     3.7.4.1. Submit requests for supersonic tests/exercises of short duration (30-days or less) through
     MAJCOM A3 channels to AF/A3O-AR for approval (with AF/A7CPB concurrence) at least
     60-days before the mission requirement start date. Accompany waiver requests with the appropri-
     ate level of environmental analysis (EA or unsigned FONSI, or draft EIS).
     3.7.4.2. For recurring tests/exercises or tests/exercises of duration greater than 30-days, submit
     requests IAW para 3.7.4. at a minimum of 60-days before the mission start date.
     3.7.4.3. (Added-ACC) Supersonic operations below 30,000 feet MSL require an environmental
     assessment (at a minimum) and Air Staff approval IAW AFI 13-201. This pertains not only to per-
     manent operations, but also to temporary test/exercises involving supersonic speeds. The DOPAA
     to establish/change supersonic flight areas/operations should arrive at HQ ACC/A3A as early as
     possible prior to its anticipated need. The process to obtain a permanent waiver for supersonic
     operations will take approximately 36 months. This will allow for HQ ACC/A3A review and Air
     Staff review and approval. Proposed changes in supersonic operations due to a change in unit
     assigned weapon system(s), or a change in tactics, must be environmentally assessed prior to
     implementing the proposed change.
  3.7.5. The MAJCOM A3 in coordination with the MAJCOM EIAP program manager will review
  existing approved supersonic flying waivers for renewal every 3-years. MAJCOM airspace manage-
  ment offices will provide a courtesy copy of the waiver renewal package to AF/A30-AR (who will
  notify AF/A7CPB in turn) prior to MAJCOM A3 approval. The review will be conducted to ensure
  the operations (sortie limits, aircraft types, minimum altitudes, etc.--see Attachment 6), affected
  environments, and resulting impacts are consistent with the environmentally assessed and approved
  actions. Evaluate all adopted mitigation measures and commitments made in initially approving the
  supersonic flying operations for compliance. Detail changes to land use underneath the area of super-
  sonic flight that have occurred since the original approval and include any updated environmental
  analysis. MAJCOM airspace management offices, EIAP, and other offices, as necessary, shall develop
  and maintain a management system for ensuring compliance and periodic monitoring. Promptly
  advise AF/A3O-AR of any environmental or operational condition warranting reconsideration of the
  decision approving supersonic flight operations (e.g., a different weapon system, environmental con-
  ditions, or a change in tactics). If the waiver renewal is not completed prior to the 3-year expiration
  date, the controlling MAJCOM A3 (with environmental planning function coordination) is authorized
  to approve temporary continuation of existing supersonic operations below 30,000 feet MSL until the
  waiver is renewed. All requirements imposed by the original approval decision remain in effect.
     3.7.5.1. (Added-ACC) Units will submit a request for renewal to the appropriate civil engineer-
     ing activity at least 6 months prior to expiration of the approved 3-year period. Forward a copy of
     the locally coordinated renewal request to HQ ACC/A3AA
  3.7.6. MAJCOM airspace management offices shall notify AF/A3O-AR of MAJCOM A3 waiver
  renewals within 30-days and maintain supporting documents for a minimum of 10-years.
  3.7.7. Sonic Boom Events. The characteristics of sonic booms are such that damage to property may
  result. The USAF adjudicates sonic boom claims caused by Air Force, AFRC, and NGB aircraft. The
  staff judge advocate nearest the incident location usually investigates such claims or complaints.
42                           AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


     Commanders of units operating aircraft capable of supersonic flight or units that manage airspace
     used by such aircraft will establish internal methods to document unplanned supersonic flight activi-
     ties over land or within 15 NM of a coast. The remarks section in Aircrew Resource Management Sys-
     tem may be used for this purpose. Training or scheduling/utilization tools are also acceptable for this
     purpose. This data is not required for supersonic activity that is part of combat or combat support mis-
     sions.
        3.7.7.1. Minimum information to be retained includes: callsign, type aircraft, unit, location of
        supersonic event, and route of flight.
            3.7.7.1.1. (Added-ACC) Units will document all supersonic flight activities over land or
            within 15 NM of a coast. Information to be collected for each event will include as a mini-
            mum: aircraft callsign, aircraft type, unit, airspace or location, time of event, altitude of event,
            and route of flight. Documentation will be maintained for two years IAW USAF Records Dis-
            position Schedule Table 13-4 rule 4, Table 13-4. Retain data pertaining to property damage
            claims investigation for 5 years.
        3.7.7.2. Acknowledgment of unauthorized supersonic activity will be made to the originating or
        scheduling activity of the airspace. Identifying DOD aircraft causing sonic booms permits the
        investigating judge advocate to confirm USAF involvement and obtain aircraft and flight data that
        are useful for computing the approximate magnitude of sonic booms.
        3.7.7.3. If flight data is classified, pilots should provide the minimum information needed to iden-
        tify the flight and home base. Prompt acknowledgment of supersonic activity enables the judge
        advocate to conduct an immediate investigation, helps to promptly resolve pending claims, and
        enables PA officials to respond promptly to community and news media inquiries.

3.8. SUA Review Teams. The FAA SUA Review Program provides for a continuing review of all air-
space allocations IAW FAAO 7400.2. To supplement routine airspace programs and the annual review
afforded by Restricted Area/MOA utilization reports, the FAA may use SUA review teams on an as
required basis to examine selected areas. These teams coordinate their visits to USAF units with the MAJ-
COM through the AFREP.
     3.8.1. These teams review selected areas, determine needed actions, and recommend a plan for effi-
     cient and safe use of airspace. They examine the current and planned use of SUA to minimize conflict
     with other airspace users. Based on the requirements of each user and actual use of airspace, they eval-
     uate the need to retain, change, revoke, or establish SUA. Consideration should be given to returning
     associated ATCAAs when returning MOAs to the NAS.
     3.8.2. MAJCOMs should be prepared to provide the teams detailed documentation about scheduling,
     utilization times, altitudes, geographical areas used, type of air activities conducted, and future use
     plans (for the NGB, units will provide this documentation). Address national security requirements at
     an unclassified level unless team member security clearance authorizations are appropriately verified
     prior to the team visit. Military participation will be on a case-by-case basis.
     3.8.3. After evaluating the team's recommendations, the FAA, with the military's concurrence, may
     initiate procedural changes or airspace modifications.
     3.8.4. (Added-ACC) Reviewing Special Use Airspace Assignments. Units will forward SUA
     Review reports to HQ ACC/A3AA NLT 15 Feb each year. Unit airspace managers will maintain cur-
     rent SUA/MTR review checklists. Maintain documentation for each piece of managed airspace, to
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                         43


   include any authorized changes in the original proposed usage, LOP/LOAs, and environmental docu-
   mentation in accordance with USAF RDS, Table 13-4.
NOTE: Complete SUA/MTR review checklists for Restricted Areas, Military Operating Area (MOAs),
Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), Instrument Routes (IRs), and Visual Routes (VRs) (AFI
13-201, Attachment 4).

3.9. Airspace Disposition Process. Responsible stewardship of airspace resources also involves identi-
fying those parcels of airspace no longer required by the USAF. However, the airspace may meet the
requirements of another user. Take the following steps, in order, for returning unneeded airspace to the
NAS:
   3.9.1. Originating activity notifies the MAJCOM of intention to return airspace.
       3.9.1.1. (Added-ACC) The unit Operations Group Commander will sign out the correspondence.
   3.9.2. MAJCOMs solicit input from other units within the MAJCOM to determine if there are other
   USAF units with a need for the airspace. If a requirement is identified, the MAJCOM will notify the
   AFREP of their intention to reassign the airspace. AFREPs will assist with the FAA process.
NOTE: Changes in use of airspace, other than administrative in nature, require environmental consider-
ation per the EIAP.
   3.9.3. If no requirement is identified within that MAJCOM, the MAJCOM will notify AF/A3O-AR,
   who will solicit input from other MAJCOMs.
   3.9.4. If AF/A3O-AR determines there is no USAF requirement, AF/A3O-AR will notify the Air-
   space Subgroup of the PBFA, to determine if there is any other DOD requirement. If another Service
   has a need for the airspace, that Service would assume the lead for transferring the airspace. If there is
   no requirement, AF/A3O-AR will initiate action through the FAA/AJR-01 to return the airspace to the
   NAS. FAA/AJR-01 will maintain a listing of airspace returned to the NAS. This timeline should not
   exceed 4-months.

3.10. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) Responsibilities. Disseminate time critical information regarding
changes impacting airspace (scheduling procedures, altitudes, etc.), either temporary or not sufficiently
known in advance, via NOTAM. A NOTAM may serve as notification of an alteration until permanent
publication on aeronautical charts or in other publications. It is the responsibility of the airspace-schedul-
ing agency to ensure that this information is revised and submitted in accordance with the FAA AIM.

                                                Chapter 4

                                               GENERAL

4.1. Importance of Effective Community Relations. It is important to the overall efficiency of the
USAF that the public be continually informed about the flying mission. Effective community relations
dictate mutual respect for and recognition of factors affecting or affected by USAF operations. The will-
ingness to define the purpose, mission and need for airspace and aircraft actions, enhances our credibility
and increases public understanding and support for our operations. Mitigating adverse impacts from
USAF operations is a matter of effective community relations. Coordinate all community relations issues
with the unit PA Office.
     4.1.1. Keeping the Public Informed. Commanders should highlight in their PA programs the need for
     operational readiness and actions that contribute to the state of readiness. Public affairs programs
     should fully explain all measures taken by the USAF to avoid or mitigate possible disturbances to
     civilian communities, especially those communities situated under or near military airspace. Present
     this information not only to those communities in the immediate vicinity of the facility but also when
     applicable to stakeholders such as the FAA, NPS, BLM, USFS, USFWS, BIA, State Aviation Offi-
     cials, and other bodies/groups focused on national aviation issues.
     4.1.1. (ACC) Participation in Public Meetings. Subordinate units will advise HQ ACC/A3AA of
     requests to participate in public meetings involving airspace/environmental issues. Airspace manage-
     ment representatives must ensure their personal comments are not construed as HQ ACC’s official
     position. The official HQ ACC position can only be determined after proper coordination with HQ
     ACC/A3A. All ACC Airspace Management representatives and operations personnel will accomplish
     risk communication training prior to actively participating in public meetings.
     4.1.1. (MOUNTAINHOME) Airspace Utilization Documentation. Accurate reporting of training
     airspace use is required to comply with FAA regulations, Headquarters Air Force instructions and is
     critical in supporting future requirements. CAM will work with or supply 366 OSS/OSOS: Wing
     Scheduling Office, the necessary spreadsheets or recommend internal actions necessary to ensure ade-
     quate tracking of airspace use is documented for all SUA and ASU airspace structures scheduled. This
     data will form the backbone for reports to MAJCOM on airspace utilization.
     4.1.2. Protection of the Civilian Population and Communities. The USAF has a responsibility to pro-
     tect the public to the maximum extent practicable from the hazards and effects associated with flight
     operations.
        4.1.2.1. Units must be sensitive to USAF environmental and safety responsibilities and to the
        concerns of affected communities and aviation interests. Evaluation of flight activities, at least
        annually, will be an agenda item for the airspace manager at the wing Airfield Operations Board
        (AOB). Minutes of the AOB will serve as a written record of the annual evaluation.
            4.1.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Units will forward meeting minutes to HQ ACC/A3AA if not
            included in the Airfield Operations Board minutes.
        4.1.2.2. Review the effects of mission changes. Changes to air operations are likely to cause pub-
        lic concern or comment regarding environmental impacts and require environmental analysis as
        prescribed in AFI 32-7061. Avoid noise-sensitive areas to the maximum extent possible. If opera-
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                      45


     tions at low altitude are mission essential and justified with a documented requirement, comply
     with minimum safe altitudes as prescribed in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
  4.1.3. Operations versus Readiness Impact. It is important for the USAF to recognize and communi-
  cate to the public the difference between an “operational impact” and a “readiness impact.” Although
  a particular public concern may have an impact on operations (routes, altitudes, turn points, etc.), the
  potential change to our operations may not impact our readiness. Conversely, a proposed restriction
  that would prohibit a bomber wing from dropping training ordnance could clearly affect the readiness
  of that unit. Recognizing the difference between these two concepts may create an opportunity for
  cooperation in negotiating or mitigating airspace issues.
     4.1.3.1. Readily available public information can be helpful in gaining support for USAF air
     operations. Units should:
         4.1.3.1.1. Establish a program to distribute information on military airspace and supersonic
         areas. Ensure coordination with the appropriate FAA facility (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska
         only).
         4.1.3.1.2. Develop an explanatory letter outlining the purpose, routes, areas, altitudes, inten-
         sity, day, and time of use of the areas or routes and location of existing operating areas or
         routes in the vicinity. Use aids such as charts, photographs, and film footage for visual clarifi-
         cation. Send the letter and appropriate visual materials through PA for release to appropriate
         community news media. Send this information to each interested stakeholder.
         4.1.3.1.3. Provide PA offices with information to be used in news releases for new areas and
         routes or major modifications to existing ones. Provide additional information for follow-up
         news releases as required.
         4.1.3.1.4. Ensure community and news media inquiries on changes to operational areas or
         routes are answered promptly.
  4.1.4. Congressional Interest. Because of increasing public and political sensitivities to military air-
  space, appropriate congressional offices should be informed of significant emerging mission require-
  ments at the earliest opportunity. This serves to promote better understanding of the USAF’s flying
  mission, and inform these congressional offices of future USAF airspace actions so that they may han-
  dle any public comments.
     4.1.4.1. Noise Complaints and Congressional Inquiries. When Congressional inquiries are
     received, timely and accurate response is paramount. MAJCOM-designated unit OPR/OCRs
     should include airspace and/or range management, stan-eval, PA, and airfield operations func-
     tions. AF/A3O-AR will be the A3/5 focal point for inquiries received at the Air Staff (typically
     from Congressional staffs, the Chief of Staff, or Secretary of the Defense/Air Force offices). AF/
     A3O-AR will coordinate through the MAJCOM airspace or range management function for
     inputs/responses to inquiries. MAJCOMs will establish their own procedures for internal research
     and response to these inquiries. Regardless of whom the MAJCOM designates for investigating
     these inquiries, the airspace or range management function needs to be an integral part of the pro-
     cess. Aside from possessing the expertise necessary in most cases to adequately respond, the air-
     space office needs to be sensitive to those areas or routes that are drawing public attention. Avoid
     referring callers to the other military departments, or government agencies without first attempting
     to answer questions concerning aircraft noise through all available means. AFREPs can provide
     considerable assistance regarding noise complaints.
46                           AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


NOTE: The intent of this paragraph is not to circumvent or supersede the MAJCOM or unit PA office
role in these issues. PA should be provided the opportunity to coordinate on responses to congressional
inquiries. If the MAJCOM does not directly task PA to respond, at the least responses need to be coordi-
nated with them, since in many cases, they may receive inquiries directly. For information on Military
Pilot Deviation processing or HATR, see AFI 91-202.
        4.1.4.1. (ACC) Noise complaints and Congressional inquiries originating from higher headquar-
        ters will be referred to the appropriate unit for investigation. ACC units will establish their own
        investigation procedures for handling these matters.
        4.1.4.2. (Added-ACC) Units will coordinate all responses to Congressional or other higher head-
        quarters inquiries dealing with military training airspace through ACC/A3AA.
     4.1.5. Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ). Operations personnel assist CE in establishing
     and maintaining (where applicable) an active AICUZ program by providing flying operations data
     required for developing noise contours. Support development of maximum feasible land use compat-
     ibility between air installations and neighboring communities according to policy and guidance issued
     by AF/A7CPB. For specific information on the AICUZ program, see AFI 32-7063, Air Installation
     Compatible Use Zone Program.
     4.1.6. Visits and Statements. Coordinate all official visits to HQ FAA through FAA/AJR-01. Coordi-
     nate all official visits to FAA service area offices through the applicable AFREP. Inform the AFREPs
     of all issues other than routine operational coordination between the USAF and applicable FAA
     offices. MAJCOMs or HQ USAF must approve comments, commitments (LOAs, Memorandums of
     Understandings, etc.), and opinions regarding airspace or other aeronautical matters covered by this
     instruction prior to going outside the USAF. (This does not prevent routine coordination between
     operating elements of the USAF, FAA, and host nation ATC agencies or officials.)
        4.1.6.1. (Added-ACC) FAA Airspace Review/Government Accounting Office (GAO)/Air
        Force Audit Agency (AFAA) Visits. HQ ACC/A3AA is the central point of contact for coordi-
        nating FAA/GAO/AFAA inquiries concerning airspace matters. Report unscheduled visits/inquir-
        ies from these agencies to HQ ACC/A3AA

4.2. Applicable Federal Aviation Requirements.
     4.2.1. Public Law 85-726, The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, created the FAA and
     charged the FAA Administrator with managing all national airspace under United States jurisdiction,
     including US Protectorates and designated Flight Information Regions. Because DOD airspace
     requirements often compete with those of commercial and general aviation and may impact public
     freedom to transit certain airspace, DOD military services have a special interest in presenting credi-
     ble requirements to the FAA and managing allocated airspace efficiently.
     4.2.2. Title 5 United States Code Sections 551–559, Administrative Procedure Act. Requires public
     notice before the FAA can carry out certain airspace management actions, including military actions.
     The FAA notifies the public of an airspace proposal through a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
     (NPRM) published in the Federal Register, or by distributing to known interested parties a non-rule-
     making circular that describes the proposal. Either of these methods sets forth the proposal and speci-
     fies a period of time in which the FAA will receive comments or suggestions. The FAA will publish
     its final decision, stating whether or not the proposal was modified as a result of the comments or sug-
     gestions received. If the FAA's final decision makes minor changes to the original proposal, a second
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                     47


   NPRM or circular is not usually required. In all cases, the FAA makes the final decision on SUA pro-
   posals.
   4.2.3. Waivers to 14 CFR, Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs). Send four copies of FAA Form
   7711-2, Application for Certificate of Waiver or Authorization, (available from FAA Service Area
   Offices) through military command channels to AFFSA/A3OF, who sends the original and two copies
   to the FAA.
NOTE: Waivers for airshow issues (speed, minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.) should be
submitted directly to the local Flight Standards District Office.
   4.2.4. Exemption to 14 CFR Part 91.117 (Speed Authorization). 14 CFR Part 91.117 states that no
   person may operate an aircraft below 10,000 feet MSL at an indicated airspeed of more than 250
   knots. Recognizing that some DOD aircraft performance requirements exceed 250 knots, the FAA
   issued an exemption to 14 CFR Part 91.117. However, it is not a blanket waiver. Conditions under
   which operations are authorized below 10,000 feet MSL can be found in FAAO 7610.4.
   4.2.5. Obtaining FAA Publications and Forms. Most of the FAA publications and forms referenced in
   this instruction are available through the unit publications manager. Units having difficulty obtaining
   publications or needing a publication on short notice or on a one-time basis (such as an Advisory Cir-
   cular) may contact the FAA field offices.

4.3. International, Foreign National Operations, and Combat Airspace. USAF procedures govern-
ing operations in international or foreign national airspace must recognize the right of a foreign govern-
ment to establish and enforce procedures for operations within its sovereign airspace. AF/A3O-AR
oversees international and foreign operations.
   4.3.1. Host nation laws, regulations, and procedures are usually stated in AIP, ICAO Rules and Prac-
   tices, or locally published directives. Non-conflicting USAF and DOD directives apply in foreign
   national airspace.
       4.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Flight Operations Into or Within Canadian Airspace. C o m p l i a n c e
       with the Canadian and United States governments’ agreement for overflight of Canadian territory
       by ACC aircraft is mandatory. All flights in Canadian airspace will be conducted IAW Foreign
       Clearance Guide and under instrument flight rules (IFR) according to FLIP and AFI 11-202V3
       unless VFR flight is approved by HQ ACC Canadian Forces Liaison Office. ACC training flights
       are approved annually between Canadian Forces and HQ ACC. Formation flights in Canadian air-
       space will be IAW FLIP AP/1.
   4.3.2. A designated US military operational command may manage combat or contingency airspace
   during times of tension, contingencies, or war. AF/A3O-AR is the OPR for combat airspace manage-
   ment procedures and development of related policy and doctrine.
   4.3.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Policy. ICAO documents specify standards
   and recommend practices for international flight operations and ATC. Govern USAF flight operations
   in international and foreign national airspace by these standards and practices, as supplemented by
   ICAO member nations AIP, non-conflicting applications of USAF or DOD directives, and special
   LOAs for strategic, tactical readiness, or training operations. See FLIP and DOD Foreign Clearance
   Guide.
48                          AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


4.4. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Certificate of Authorization (COA). To o b t a i n a C O A
through the FAA for UAS, units should consult FAAO 7610.4 and their AFREP for guidance on process-
ing COA applications through FAA ATO Service Area channels.
4.5. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Special Use Airspace (SUA) Denial Report. R C S :
HAF-XO(AR)8106. CAM will maintain a log of reported SUA/ASU airspace denials and ATC capping of
airspace. Aircrews are responsible to complete Attachment 18 (Added), after each flight if such activity
occurred. Flying squadrons shall forward the Airspace Denial/Supersonic Activity worksheet to 366 OSS/
OSOA daily. These reports of airspace permission denied are supplemented by reporting from Cowboy
Control and are supplied to CAM as part of the reporting process. Real-time reporting of FAA airspace
denials should be made to Region FAA AFREP on a daily basis with this information gathered. Denial
incidents will be reported to HQ ACC/A3AA, 205 Dodd Blvd, Langley AFB VA 23665-2789 monthly.
4.6. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Spill-Out Logs. CAM will insure the Cowboy Control Military
RADAR Unit (MRU) log of reported spill-outs of military aircraft operating in 366 FW airspace is
reported to 366 OG through established channels (366 OSS/DO (Director of Operations)) for the purpose
of monitoring the MHRC and to identify trends that could have an adverse impact on wing training oper-
ations or significant airspace actions.
4.7. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Restricted Area Violations. CAM will investigate reports by Cow-
boy Control, RCO, ATC or aircrews of civil aircraft restricted airspace incursion incidents. When suffi-
cient detail is available, incidents warranting FAA attention will be fronted through FAA AFREP for
investigation by the FAA Flight Standards District Office, 3113 Airport Way, Boise ID 83705-5000 for
action.
4.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) FAA Military Airspace Data Entry (MADE) System. CAM will
be 366 FW's focal point for implementation and administration for the MADE airspace program by the
FAA with Mountain Home sections requiring such access. MADE will be the de-facto standard for advis-
ing FAA National Airspace System agencies of daily scheduling of military airspace assigned to or con-
trolled by 366 FW.
4.9. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Reviewing SUA/ASU Assignments. 366 OSS/OSOA will maintain
an MTR/SUA review and analysis IAW checklist provided in AFI 13-201. This review will be docu-
mented, updated and forwarded to ACC/A3AA NLT 15 February each year. Current checklist is located
at: https://a3.acc.af.mil/dor/dora/DOCUMENTS/ATSEP-Airspace.htm.
4.10. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) MTR Scheduling. Normally, all MHAFB administered/controlled
MTR routes will be requested and scheduled through 366 OSS/OSOS. At those times when 366 OSS/
OSOS is not manned (after duty hours/weekends), those routes will be scheduled by 366 FW/CP. In the
case of all MTR routes, AP/1B, Section 1 guidance for a 2-hour notification will be strictly adhered to.
CAM will ensure a current letter is on file with respect to procedural closures of MTR routes (in continu-
ity file).
4.11. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Stereo Flight Plans. CAM is the primary wing POC for develop-
ing and maintaining wing stereo flight plans. Squadrons will forward requirements for new or changed
stereo flight plans to 366 OSS/OSOA. CAM coordinates the requested stereo flight plan with 366 OG/
OGV and Salt Lake City ARTCC. If approved, the new or revised stereo flight plan is then properly for-
matted and provided to Salt Lake City ARTCC for inclusion in their data base and for retrieval by Base
Operations (366 OSS/OSAA). Prior to the changes becoming effective, a new listing of wing stereo flight
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                             49


plans will be accomplished by 366 OSS/OSOA and disseminated to each flying squadron, 366 OG/OGV
and 366 OSS/OSA.
4.12. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Altitude Reservation (ALTRV). An ALTRV is used when a num-
ber of aircraft must be moved with less than standard ATC IFR separation criteria between them, or when
a number of aircraft must operate within prescribed altitudes, timing and/or areas. This is useful to 366
FW for long-range deployment of wing aircraft, especially when aerial refueling is required. Wing gener-
ated ALTRVs will be coordinated with FAA Central Altitude Reservation Facility by CAM. During this
coordination, actions such as the input of route of flight, departure procedures or any other special opera-
tions will be clarified by the project officer via the use of 366 OSS/OSOA supplied ALTRV project officer
coordination form (Attachment 19 (Added), ALTRV APREQ (Approval Request) Requirements Work-
sheet). To ensure the mission can be executed without delay, flying squadrons should appoint an ALTRV
POC responsible to provide appropriate information to CAM. For Class 1-4 ALTRVs, this information
should be provided as soon as possible; and for Class 5-8 ALTRVs, not less than 20 days prior to desired
launch date due to order of precedence requirements. Simply stated, an ALTRV is a pre-coordinated flight
plan, therefore, all items required on a flight plan; e.g., call signs, number and type aircraft, route of flight,
takeoff and en-route times, etc., are required for the ALTRV approval request. USAF requires a DD Form
175 to be filed with 366 OSS/OSAA for each flight of aircraft. Format for ALTRV flight plans is provided
in FLIP General Planning. A copy of ALTRV approval must be attached to the flight plans, and filed with
366 OSS/OSAA. It is the responsibility of the mission POC to ensure flight plans are filed appropriately.

                                               REPORTS

5.1. Need for Reports. Report data is of ever-increasing value to airspace managers at all levels. Accu-
rate reporting is critical in many decisions affecting military airspace: BRAC data collection, environ-
mental impact analysis, and legal actions to name a few. See paragraphs 5.3. and 5.4. for reports that the
FAA requires. USAF scheduling agencies may need to provide use data on military airspace on a
case-by-case basis; therefore, maintain data on all designated airspace (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska
only).

5.2. Airspace Denial Report. Each USAF using agency should submit denial reports via the report in
Attachment 7. Airspace proposals initiated because of inadequate airspace due to FAA restrictions (cap-
ping, time limitations, etc.) have a much better chance of success when accompanied by denial reports.
The report should include denials or restrictions in availability of military airspace. Forward the report
through appropriate channels to MAJCOM Airspace Management office and the AFREP as required.
Reports are submitted as required by event, although MAJCOMs may stipulate other reporting require-
ments. This report is designated emergency status code D. Discontinue reporting during emergency con-
ditions. Do not report during MINIMIZE.
     5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Airspace Denial Report. Units must document, via a brief narrative, each air-
     space denial. If an unsatisfactory trend develops, inform HQ ACC/A3AA. HQ ACC/A3A will work
     with AFREPs and ACC FAA Liaison to resolve the issue. If this fails to resolve the issue, HQ ACC/
     A3A will forward the report to HQ USAF/A3O-A for resolution. NOTE: Altitude restrictions are
     considered airspace denials.

5.3. Annual Restricted Area Utilization Report. Each USAF scheduling agency must submit a
restricted area use report by 1 December every year (covering the period of 1 October through 30 Septem-
ber, or for any part of the preceding 12-month period ending 30 September). Prepare reports according to
FAAO 7400.2. Submit these reports for all US (including territories and possessions) restricted areas:
     5.3.1. Send the restricted area use report through the MAJCOM to the AFREP. Assign the Inter-
     agency Report Control Number (IRCN) 1412-DOT-AN.
     5.3.2. NGB units report directly through their State Adjutant General to the regional AFREP and send
     an info copy to NGB/A3A.
     5.3.3. The AFREP will send one copy to the Director of Operations in the FAA service area having
     jurisdiction over the airspace being reported; one copy to the Director of System Operations Airspace
     and AIM, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Room 400E, Washington,
     DC 20591; and one copy to AF/A3O-AR, 1621 North Kent Street, Rosslyn Plaza E Suite 320, Arling-
     ton, VA 22209.
     5.3.4. (Added-ACC) Reports are due at HQ ACC/A3AA via electronic transmission NLT 15 Nov.

5.4. Annual Military Operations Area (MOA) Utilization Report. Each USAF scheduling agency
must submit a MOA utilization report by 1 January every year (covering the period of 1 October through
30 September, or for any part of the preceding 12 month period ending 30 September). Prepare reports
according to FAAO 7400.2. Submit these reports for all US (including territories and possessions) MOAs.

   5.4.1. Send this report through MAJCOM to the AFREP. Assign the IRCN 1412-DOT-AN.
   5.4.2. NGB units must report directly through their State Adjutant General to the regional AFREP
   and send an info copy to NGB/A3A.
   5.4.3. The AFREP will send one copy to the Director of Operations in the FAA service area having
   jurisdiction over the airspace being reported; one copy to the Director of System Operations Airspace
   and AIM, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Room 400E, Washington,
   DC 20591; and one copy to AF/A3O-AR, 1621 North Kent Street, Rosslyn Plaza E Suite 320, Arling-
   ton, VA 22209.
   5.4.4. (Added-ACC) Reports are due at HQ ACC/A3AA via electronic transmission NLT 15 Dec.

5.5. Release of SUA/ASU Utilization Data. Although USAF does not release detailed information to
the public, generic data (i.e., we flew XX sorties on XX route, MOA, etc., during the month of _______)
is an acceptable response to inquiries requesting information on SUA/ASU utilization. More detailed data
should be considered as For Official Use Only.
5.6. (Added-ACC) Spill-Out Reports. Units will maintain documentation of alleged DoD spill-outs
from SUA including date, time, type of aircraft, call sign, number of aircraft, airspace designation, and
reason (if known) in a brief narrative. Inform HQ ACC/A3AA of alleged spill-outs that may attract public
attention.
5.7. (Added-ACC) Airspace Intrusions Reports. Report alleged civil aircraft violations of military
SUA to the FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). FSDO requires nature of the incident, time of
occurrence, and tail number (if known) of the alleged violating aircraft. NOTE: This report is not a sub-
stitute for the USAF Hazardous Air Traffic Report.
5.8. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Investigation Reporting. Records of complaints or investigations
against the wing's flying program will be collected and divided into four categories: (1) noise or
over-flight, (2) sonic booms, (3) congressional complaints and (4) pilot deviations. This report will be for-
warded to 366 OSS/DO at the end of each calendar year, or as requested. CAM will brief report data at the
next scheduled quarterly meeting of the AOB.

           OBSTRUCTION EVALUATION/AIRPORT AIRSPACE ANALYSIS (OE/AAA)

6.1. General. Responsibility for policy and procedures for the USAF OE/AAA Program is located
within AF/A3O-AD. The OE/AAA system is designed to identify obstacles that affect military airfields
and military airspace (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
     6.1.1. OE/AAA Program Manager Responsibilities. Management of the OE/AAA Program resides in
     the AFREP Eastern Service Area office. The program manager is responsible for providing policy
     oversight, training, daily operations, and interface with other DOD services and FAA Obstruction
     Evaluation Service (OES) personnel. The program manager will test all system modifications and
     enhancements to DOD modules prior to implementation.
     6.1.2. OE/AAA Specialist Responsibilities. The specialist is responsible for ensuring the program is
     executed daily. The specialist will distribute Obstruction Evaluations/Landing Area proposals affect-
     ing military airspace to the airspace manger according to program capabilities
     6.1.3. Airspace Manager Responsibilities. Units are responsible for evaluating detrimental effects on
     military airspace in accordance with FAAO 7400.2. When responding to proposed construction or a
     landing area proposal, the unit shall identify the detrimental effects in detail to the appropriate OE cell
     specialist via email within 10 working days. The unit shall contact the appropriate OE cell specialist
     to request additional time if needed. A response to OE’s and non-rulemaking airports (NRAs) is
     required. If no response is received from the unit, the OE/AAA cell specialist will contact the MAJ-
     COM for action.
     6.1.4. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs will notify the USAF OE/AAA Program Manager in
     the event of a new airspace manager being assigned. They shall respond on behalf of the unit in the
     event the unit airspace manager cannot respond to OE cases.

6.2. Obstacle Evaluation Processing.
     6.2.1. OE cases in the vicinity of an existing structure: If the structure is located on an “antenna farm”
     (multiple antennas in a localized area) and is not higher than the other structures, the case can be
     closed out. If the structure is of greater height or more than 1 NM from another structure, the case
     shall be sent to the airspace manager using the “For Your Information” (FYI) letter (see Attachment
     8) and closed out with the military statement. The military statement can be found in para 6.1.4.3.1.
     6.2.2. OE cases involving proposed construction: The case will be sent for comment using the SUA
     Letter (see Attachment 9) if the structure is located in an area where it is the only structure. If the
     structure is located on an “antenna farm” and is not higher than the other structures, the case can be
     closed out.
     6.2.3. Structures that penetrate the floor of military airspace will comply with the instruction for fil-
     ing an aeronautical objection in para 6.1.5. For structures within 100 feet of the floor of military oper-
     ations, cases will be addressed using the FYI letter and the military statement and closed out. If the
     structure is more than 100 feet from the floor, the case can be closed out.
     6.2.4. Slow Routes: If the structure is located in an area with other structures of the same height, the
     case can be closed out. If the structure is higher, then the case can be closed out with the military state-
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                       53


   ment. If the structure is of greater height and more than 1NM from another structure, it will be sent to
   the airspace manager using the FYI letter.

6.3. Non-Rulemaking Airports (NRA).
   6.3.1. For proposed landing areas or expansion of existing fields that underlie SUA or ASU, cases
   will be sent to airspace manager for comment using the NRA Letter (see Attachment 10).
   6.3.2. For proposed construction on civil airports that underlie special use airspace, cases will be sent
   to airspace manager for comment.
   6.3.3. For proposed construction on civil airports or proposed landing areas under SRs, cases will be
   sent an NRA FYI Letter (see Attachment 11) including the military statement.

6.4. OE Case Response Statements.
   6.4.1. The following is an example of a military statement for an OE case where there is no hazard:
   “While the structure does not constitute a hazard to air navigation, it would be located within or near
   a military training area and/or route.”
   6.4.2. The following is an example of a statement for an OE case where there is no hazard for NRA
   case: “Please advise the proponent that the airfield will be located within the confines or near a mili-
   tary training route or military training area.”

6.5. Contents of an Aeronautical Objection. The USAF may object to the development of an obstruc-
tion, airport, etc., which interferes with operations. The airspace manager must forward all objections to
the OE/AAA specialist. The objection may contain the following: definition of the problem, detailed list
of the assumptions, discussion of all the facts relevant to the problem, discussion of all practicable solu-
tions and justification of the selected solutions, and description of any economic aspect in detail to show
the effect on USAF operations. The objection must include as a minimum (as applicable):
   6.5.1. Compromise of existing or proposed ATC procedures (i.e., airport traffic patterns, routings to
   and from MTRs, future area navigation/global positioning system procedures, etc.).
   6.5.2. Conflict with existing or proposed operations in SUA or on MTRs.
   6.5.3. Interference with established communication and/or radar frequencies (information only, part
   of FAA determination but could impact the USAF).
   6.5.4. Conflict with either existing or proposed navigational aid (NAVAID) operations or use (infor-
   mation only, part of the FAA determination but could impact USAF).
   6.5.5. As an alternative, use the following statement to negotiate with the proponent through the FAA
   OES specialist: “The proposed structure constitutes a hazard to air navigation because it penetrates the
   floor of the military training route/military training area by ____ number of feet. Request it be low-
   ered by ____ feet or relocated ____ NM (North, South, East, West) to avoid a hazard to military oper-
   ations.”
   6.5.6. (Added-ACC) Aeronautical objections are forwarded through HQ ACC/A3AA to the appro-
   priate AFREP and OE/AAA office.

6.6. Wind Generated Energy Facilities (WGEF).
54                            AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


     6.6.1. The USAF must sustain a safe flying environment while accomplishing its missions. This sec-
     tion provides methods for evaluating the siting of wind generated energy facilities (WGEF) on or near
     installations, communications/radar facilities, lands, airfields, assault/drop zones, ranges and airspace,
     etc; hereafter referred to as “air operations.”
     6.6.2. The USAF views the development and use of renewable energy as a national priority and is a
     partner in cooperation with federal and state agencies, and communities in promoting alternative
     energy resources. The USAF will work with these and other related parties to minimize the impact
     WGEF may have on air operations.
     6.6.3. There is currently no single source or method of identifying all WGEF proposals. WGEF
     project proposals may be received from many sources including the FAA, DOI, city/county/state plan-
     ning and zoning agencies, community leaders, and other organizations including wind energy devel-
     opers/associations. The wind generation developer, hereafter referred to as the “proponent,” may not
     be aware of the potential impacts a proposal may have on USAF air operations. Therefore, it is critical
     to actively inform all WGEF stakeholders of USAF interest in any effort.
     6.6.4. USAF personnel must ensure proposals are quickly relayed to potentially affected units. Units
     are responsible for determining the potential impact on current and planned/future operations and will
     assess the proposed site for flight safety hazards, electromagnetic frequency interference, operational
     security, and other encroachment factors (see Attachment 12 for guidelines) (CONUS, Hawaii, and
     Alaska only).
     6.6.5. Active community outreach programs provide the best means of identifying proposals that may
     encroach on air operations. Outreach should include, but is not limited to, those with land manage-
     ment authority, BLM and USFS. It should also include agencies responsible for energy development,
     such as state energy agencies and commissions, energy associations and local offices of the Depart-
     ment of Energy DOE. Early analysis and identification of potential impacts may prevent unnecessary
     effort and expenditure on behalf of the proponent. The siting of a wind anemometer or meteorological
     data collection tower(s) is the first and most critical step for the proponent in assessing the potential of
     wind energy development. It is imperative that the USAF becomes involved no later than this point.
     Since the OE/AAA process does not evaluate all construction of facilities/equipment less than 200
     feet AGL, these facilities/equipment may not undergo automatic obstacle evaluation unless close to an
     airfield. If WGEF proposals are on USAF lands, the unit will ensure these proposals are submitted for
     review under the OE/AAA program requirements (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
        6.6.5.1. WGEF proposals may be received by one unit, yet impact others. The following proce-
        dures are to be used for obstacles that do not fall under the provisions of the OE/AAA process. The
        receiving unit will identify the owner of the affected airspace within 24 hours of receipt; the
        impacted owner will then be the OPR to coordinate the USAF response. The OPR should coordi-
        nate with affected units and the proponent to establish an estimated response time. Normally, pro-
        ponents expect a response within two weeks, but several factors may determine the ultimate
        response time (e.g., number of units, MAJCOMs and other services affected). A single response
        should be provided addressing the most restrictive requirement (i.e., if one unit is affected, than
        the response should reflect that impact). Responses should be short and concise (a memo, via
        e-mail or fax); state if the proposal will or will not impact operations; how that conclusion was
        reached; if the proposal is proceeding as planned or is being modified, whether or not further
        negotiations are necessary, etc. Include a POC for each affected unit; these unit POCs will also be
        provided to the proponent. The OPR will provide courtesy response to higher headquarters (MAJ-
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                    55


     COM and AF/A3O-AR), the AFREP (see Figure 1.1.) and the regional Air Force Center for Envi-
     ronmental Excellence (AFCEE) office (see Attachment 13). AF/A3O-AR will be responsible for
     forwarding the proposal to other Air Staff offices as required. If issues cannot be resolved at the
     local level, the OPR should contact the MAJCOM Airspace Management Office as soon as possi-
     ble for further guidance. (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).
  6.6.6. When drafting a response, the POC should work closely with range operations, airfield opera-
  tions, airspace managers, ATC, CE community planners, or AICUZ Program Manager and environ-
  mental representatives to develop a strategy for analyzing areas within which WGEF would be
  compatible, conditionally compatible, or incompatible. One methodology is the use of a simple “Stop-
  light” chart (see Attachment 14). In the vicinity of airfields, any analysis should take into consider-
  ation the airfield criteria found in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design. Once
  developed, this analysis should be shared with the AFREP, AFCEE Regional Office, MAJCOM, AF/
  A3O-AR, land use planning organizations (city, county, regional and state), federal land management
  agencies and any state energy associations (CONUS, Hawaii, and Alaska only).

   7.3.1. (Added-ACC) All units will forward their LOAs/LOPs to HQ ACC/A3AA for review/
   approval prior to signature.
       7.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) The NAF/Wing Commander is the authority to sign LOAs for MARSA
       procedures for assigned aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. (Added-ACC) For LOAs negotiated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
       use format guidance in FAAH 7210.3.
       7.3.1.3. (Added-ACC) The unit commander will ensure copies of the LOA are distributed to
       appropriate units.
   7.3.2. (Added-ACC) A LOP is required when a Restricted Area is designated as joint-use. The for-
   mat for the LOP is in FAAO 7400.2, Part 7. A LOP should be accomplished with the controlling
   agency to outline operating procedures within the Restricted Area. LOPs are processed using the same
   procedures as LOAs.
7.4. (Added-ACC) Waivers. Due to unique local situations, units may request waivers to this supple-
ment. Forward requests by letter, or message, through the chain of command to HQ ACC/A3AA.
Describe the specific factors, which resulted in the request for waiver. If approved, the waiver stays in
effect indefinitely, unless HQ ACC/A3AA specifies otherwise, cancels it in writing, or issues a change
that alters the basis for the waiver. The unit OPR must coordinate with the base publications manager to
include the waiver in the applicable base publication.
7.5. (Added-ACC) Alleged Airspace Violations. Document alleged violations of airspace at the time of
occurrence. The unit airspace manager is the point of contact for processing alleged airspace violations.
HQ ACC/A3AA will forward alleged violations to the appropriate unit commander. The unit will investi-
gate the incident and return the results of their investigation to HQ ACC/A3AA. HQ ACC/A3AA will
review and validate the report and forward a response to the appropriate Air Force Representative
(AFREP).
   7.5.1. (Added-ACC) Airspace/Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Violations. Alleged airspace/
   FAR violations and noncompliance with ATC instructions require formal investigation and documen-
   tation. HQ ACC/A3AA coordinates responses for HQ ACC.
       7.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) Operations Group Commander (OG/CC). Upon receipt of an alleged
       FAR violation, the OG/CC will review and sign each investigation report before forwarding to HQ
       ACC/A3AA.

       TDY overseas to HQ ACC/A3AA.
       7.5.1.3. (Added-ACC) Final Disposition. Forward all reports of investigation, action taken, and
       attachments to HQ ACC/A3AA.
   7.5.2. (Added-ACC) Gross Navigation Errors. Units notified of FAA/International Civil Aviation
   Organization flight deviations will investigate according to the provisions of AFI 13-201, Chapter 1
   (Military Pilot Deviation). Review of the unit’s over water navigation training program and crew
   cross-check procedures employed during the flight will be included as part of the report.
7.6. (Added-ACC) Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA). W h e n
missions and tactics require aircraft to fly in closer proximity than normal air traffic control (ATC)
approved separation standards, military authorities must accept responsibility for separation of participat-
58                           AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


ing aircraft and ensure implementation with the appropriate ATC facility. A LOA is required. For air refu-
eling operations, MARSA applies between the tanker and the receivers. An aircrew does not have the
authority to invoke MARSA at any time. Authority to exercise MARSA is retained by HQ ACC except as
follows:
     7.6.1. (Added-ACC) NAF/DRU/wing/group/sector commanders may grant authorization for
     MARSA for separation of their unit owned aircraft. MARSA is accomplished through proper mission
     planning, adequate aircrew briefings, insistence on proper aircrew technique, and crew discipline
     according to the appropriate directive.
     7.6.2. (Added-ACC) Civilian contract flight operations including remote ground or air controlled
     Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), may be authorized to use MARSA by HQ ACC/A3 or NAF/
     DRU/wing/group/sector commanders in conjunction with ACC supported or authorized flight activ-
     ity. Units shall brief participating pilots on appropriate air safety and LOA airspace procedures before
     conducting flight operations.
     7.6.3. (Added-ACC) Separation Requirements. Specify the provisions for the use of MARSA in a
     Letter of Agreement/Letter of Procedure (LOA/LOP) with the appropriate controlling agency/ATC
     facility or other appropriate governing document and use MARSA only for Instrument Flight Rule
     (IFR) operations. MARSA applies at all times during air refueling, cell/en route formation, altitude
     reservation, air intercept training, and formation takeoffs. It is accomplished through strict adherence
     to specified procedures. Aircrews not familiar with the MARSA separation will be provided with a
     pre-mission brief on the specified separation criteria by the scheduling unit.

      include, PME, education and professional courses taken.
7.8. (Added-ACC) Military Training Route and Slow Route Planning Criteria :
   7.8.1. (Added-ACC) Minimum Altitudes. All MTRs will be designed to place the aircraft at the
   lowest altitude necessary to meet mission requirements consistent with flight safety, whether at IFR or
   TA/TF altitude. (NOTE: In no case will the floor of a new MTR be established below 100 feet AGL.)
   Lateral separation from obstructions will be preferred to higher altitudes over obstructions. Every
   effort will be made to design route segments for TFR operations so as to avoid man-made obstruc-
   tions. In certain cases, minimum operating altitudes will be dictated by environmental constraints.
   7.8.2. (Added-ACC) Top of Block Altitudes. IFR altitudes will be established for each IR segment
   to provide a minimum clearance of 1000 ft above the highest obstruction/terrain within the designated
   route width and a minimum clearance of 500 ft above the highest obstruction/terrain within 5 miles
   beyond the route width on each side.
   7.8.3. (Added-ACC) TA/TF Clearance Plane Setting (Bombers Only). Individual units will be
   responsible for establishing clearance plane settings for training routes/MOAs and restricted areas for
   all applicable airspace used by their unit. TA/TF altitudes will be established for each MTR with every
   effort to establish the lowest altitude consistent with flight safety. TA/TF clearance plane setting
   (CPS) will provide at least 200 feet clearance above known man-made obstructions within the route
   corridor. Aircrews are advised that CPSs provide no buffer outside the route limits; obstructions
   higher than the approved TA/TF altitudes could be present immediately adjacent to the route perime-
   ter. Aircrews are advised that not all known vertical obstructions are depicted on standard National
   Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Tactical Pilotage Charts (TPC) due to cartographic limita-
   tions. The number of CPSs will be minimized to balance safety and training benefits.
   7.8.4. (Added-ACC) Route Width. MTR corridor widths shall be of sufficient size to contain all
   planned activities. Unless specifically approved by HQ ACC/A3AA the total corridor width will not
   exceed 20 nautical miles.
60                            AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


        7.8.4.1. (Added-ACC) Route Width (Corridor)-- The MTR boundary limits within which air-
        craft are restricted to conduct operations. Route width will normally be defined in FLIP AP/1B as
        a distance right and left of route centerline. In some cases, when approved by HQ ACC/A3A, the
        route corridor may be defined as a series of coordinates. Outside turns causing gaps in the route
        corridor, when not defined otherwise, will be closed using the following method:


             1. Draw a line perpendicular to the inbound course line from the turn-point towards the
             outside of the corner and mark the spot where it intersects its route width corridor
             (temporarily label as point #1).
             2. Draw a line perpendicular to the outbound course line from the turn-point towards the
             outside of the corner and mark the spot where it intersects its route width corridor
             (temporarily label as point #3).
             3. Draw a line outward from the turn-point that bisects the angle formed by the two lines
             defined in steps 1 and 2 above.
             4. Calculate the average route width for the two segments, and mark that distance on the
             line created in step 3 (temporarily label as point #2).
             5. Connect the three points.

     7.8.5. (Added-ACC) MTR Closure. The originating activity, scheduling unit, or controlling agency
     may close a route to all aircraft whenever hazardous conditions, accidents, conflicting traffic condi-
     tions, or environmental concerns warrant. Notify the controlling agency and all scheduled users of the
     closure. Aircrews will not enter a low level route after being advised it is closed. When a MTR has not
     been closed by one of the above agencies, it is the responsibility of the using unit to evaluate flight
     conditions and determine whether or not conditions warrant low altitude flight. The final decision on
     whether or not to enter or abort a low level route rests with the aircrew and will be based on evaluation
     of forecast or existing conditions. Establish procedures for closing routes.
7.9. (Added-ACC) Low Level Bird Strike Hazards and Aircrew Reporting Procedures. Bird strikes
are a year round hazard and unit planners must consider the bird threat when scheduling low-level opera-
tions. The large number of different bird species with varying flight habits results in bird activity at all
times of day or night. The most hazardous time is sunset to 0100 local during waterfowl migration season.
However, the primary year-around threat is soaring raptors. Aircrews that observe hazardous low level
bird activity must report the bird sighting to their local safety office and MTR scheduling agency. When
possible, the hazardous bird sighting report should include, as a minimum, the following information:
Location, altitude, size of flock, and type (i.e., small bird, large bird).
NOTE: The Chief of Airspace Management should notify the wing/unit safety office of planned route
surveys and dates. This notification will provide the safety office the opportunity to accomplish their bird
hazard survey in conjunction with the required route survey(s).
7.10. (Added-ACC) Weather Information. Weather support for aircrews flying MTRs will be provided
by the using unit weather shop unless otherwise specified in a letter of agreement or route SOP. Bomber
aircrews will pre-brief Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) contact in advance. Prior to penetration to the low
altitude route/airspace, bomber aircrews will attempt to contact one of the weather flight PMSV stations
designated during the pre-takeoff briefing for the latest information of significant en route weather.

7.11. (Added-ACC) VFR Traffic Avoidance (See and Avoid). Federal Aviation Administration Regu-
lation (FAR) Part 91 permits VFR operation in areas outside controlled airspace with flight visibility
down to one mile. This is less restrictive than the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Therefore, the respon-
sibility to observe and avoid other traffic is an integral part of flying MTRs in weather conditions equal to
or better than one mile visibility.
7.12. (Added-ACC) Review of Environmental Decision Documents. Each ACC unit will conduct a
review of all applicable environmental decision documents by 15 Mar each year to ensure that training
operations are in strict compliance with and within the scope of all relevant environmental analyses,
including any existing management actions or mitigations. In addition ensure similar strict compliance by
others using ACC training airspace and assets. This review should be coordinated through the unit’s
installation environmental planning function. Report compliance to HQ ACC/A3AA.
7.13. (Added-MOUNTAINHOME) Forms Adopted:

Terms
Aeronautical Objection—A written objection to proposed construction, to an airspace proposal, or to a
proposed facility that infringes (or is believed to infringe) on the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air
traffic.
Aeronautical Proposal—A written proposal of (but not limited to) construction of any new airport, any
manmade obstruction that would extend into the navigable airspace, the establishment or change of SUA
(including any special or unusual air traffic control procedures) and the establishment of or change to any
new or existing NAVAID. Accomplish the preliminary review process (T/TSNS) IAW Chapter 3 prior to
initiating any aeronautical proposal action associated with establishment or change of SUA.
Aerial Refueling (AR) Airspace—Airspace developed according to the provisions of FAAO 7610.4 to
conduct air refueling.
Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA)—Defined airspace normally within the Class A
airspace (above 18,000 feet MSL) and established in accordance with FAAO 7610.4 by a LOA with the
ATC facility having responsibility for the airspace.
Airspace Action—The procedural act of designation, redesignation, modification, or revocation of a
parcel of airspace.
Airspace Concept—For identification purposes, the informal initial requests for additional military
airspace are referred to as ‘concepts’ and generally a concept is part of the T/TSNS process.
Airspace for Special Use (ASU)—Used to collectively identify non-SUA assets. ASU is airspace of
defined dimensions wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, and/ or wherein
limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities.
Airspace for Special Use (ASU) Designations—These designations are in FAAO 7610.4 or military
documents. None are rulemaking actions and some (contained solely in military documents) do not
require coordination with the FAA for establishment.
Airspace Proposal—Having been through the T/TSNS process, an airspace proposal is the formal
portion of requests for airspace through the FAA. There must be a clearly defined need and justification
for obtaining or revising airspace.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                     67


Alert Area—Airspace designated to inform pilots of a high level of training activity or any unusual
activity where prior knowledge would significantly enhance air safety.
Controlled Firing Area (CFA)—CFAs contain civilian and military activities that could be hazardous to
non-participating aircraft.
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)—The codification of the general and permanent rules published in
the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. It is divided
into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each volume of the CFR is updated
once each calendar year and is issued on a quarterly basis. 14 CFR represents Title 14 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, which contains the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) parts.
Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP)—The formal process, as outlined in the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), used to assess environmental impacts resulting from a proposed
action.
Federal Register—An official publication that provides a uniform system for making available to the
public regulations and legal notices issued by Federal agencies. These include Presidential proclamations
and executive orders, Federal agency documents having general applicability and legal effect, documents
required to be published by an Act of Congress, and other Federal agency documents of public interest.
All rulemaking actions are published in the Federal Register.
Low-Altitude Tactical Navigation (LATN) Area—Usually large geographic areas established for
random VFR, low altitude navigation training.
Maneuver Area—A designated segment of an IR or VR where aircraft may perform various maneuvers
dictated by operational requirements. The entire MTR is considered a Corridor/Maneuver Area except
where stated otherwise in FLIP. Aircraft vary their route of flight and altitudes in the corridor to avoid
obstacles, reduce noise impacts, and achieve IFR or VFR point-to-point navigation and tactical training.
Maneuver areas are not substitutes for MOAs. Do not develop maneuver areas in lieu of MOAs. Include
details of maneuver area operations in the IR/VR proposal.
Military Airspace—A collective term used to indicate both Special Use Airspace (SUA) and Airspace
for Special Use (ASU).
Military Briefing Guides—Unit maintained briefing guides for each MTR that include route
deconfliction procedures, special operating procedures, and/or constraints not listed in current FLIP AP/
1B.
Military Operations Area (MOA)—Airspace designated for nonhazardous military activity, established
outside the Class A airspace (below 18,000 feet MSL) and within US territorial airspace.
National Security Area (NSA)—Designated area where there is a requirement for increased security and
safety of ground facilities.
Nonrulemaking Actions—Cases relating to FAA decisions or activities affecting airspace for which
FAA does not generally issue a rule, regulation, or order. These actions include establishing (or
eliminating) FAA or military NAVAIDs as well as designating controlled firing areas, alert areas, MOAs,
warning areas, and airports provided the action of one of these items does not impact on a mandatory
rulemaking action.
Prohibited Area—Areas where over flight of a surface area is prohibited in the interest of national
security or environmental protection.
68                          AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008


Restricted Area—Designated areas established by appropriate authority over which the flight of aircraft
is restricted.
Rulemaking Actions—Procedures where FAA assigns, changes, or rescinds airspace and manages its
use by rule, regulation, or order. These actions include establishing (or eliminating) jet routes, airways,
restricted areas, prohibited areas, and various classes of airspace (A, B, C, etc).
Slow Speed Low Altitude Training Routes (SR)—Low-level training routes used for military air
operations conducted at or below 1,500 feet AGL and at an airspeed of 250 knots or less.
Special Use Airspace (SUA)—Airspace that is of a defined vertical and lateral dimension that alerts
users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those activities from other airspace users to enhance
safety. Certain limitations or restrictions may be placed on non-participating aircraft.
Warning Area—Airspace of defined dimensions extending from 3 or 12 nautical miles (NM) outward
from the coast of the United States that contains activity that may be hazardous to non-participating
aircraft.

(ACC) Terms
(Added) ACC Units—Any ACC organization, including DRUs below the NAF level.
(Added) Bomber Route—A low altitude military training route which has been evaluated for bomber
operations. Bombers may conduct operations on other routes provided a unit assessment of environmental
concerns, BASH, obstruction hazards, turn radius requirements, necessary climb/descent gradients
between route segment altitudes, and minimum clearance plane settings for TA/TF operations has been
accomplished. Bomber schedulers must ensure the safe separation of aircraft by coordinating
deconfliction procedures with the appropriate route scheduling activity listed in FLIP. Coordination
should include at a minimum the airspeeds to be flown, entry and exit times, deviation allowed from the
coordinated times (i.e. +/- 5 minutes) and separation to be provided from other flights. Weather support
provided by the using unit unless otherwise specified.
(Added) Exclusive Use of Airspace—Only participating aircraft engaged in the same mission or activity
are authorized to operate simultaneously within a specified airspace area. This does not prohibit the
scheduling activity/airspace manager from segregating separate missions and/or activities through
airspace subdivisions/altitude blocks to use airspace and support mission requirements efficiently.
(Added) Man-Made Obstructions—Structures which present a hazard to flight. Structure height is
measured from the terrain surface.
(Added) Mountainous Terrain—Terrain that varies more than 1000 feet in elevation in 10 NM along
published track (MTR). When the track crosses a narrow gorge in such a way that the aircraft will not
descend into the gorge, the low point of the gorge will not be considered. The approving authority may
consider the route mountainous if certain terrain features present a hazard to operations.
(Added) Mutual/Concurrent Use of Airspace—Participating aircraft can expect to encounter other
military aircraft scheduled to operate within the same airspace boundaries and/or at the same altitude.
When scheduled for mutual use of airspace, pilots must operate their aircraft in visual meteorological
conditions (VMC) and maintain a "see and avoid" posture for other aircraft. ACC units will ensure that
aircrews scheduled into mutual/concurrent use airspace are briefed accordingly.
AFI13-201_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 3 MARCH 2008                                                          69


(Added) Real Time Airspace Use—The time airspace is actually used as opposed to scheduled for use.
When aircraft enter the respective airspace real time or actual use begins. When the aircraft exit the air
space, real time use ends. Real time (or actual use time) tracking is critical to the effective and efficient
evaluation of airspace utilization. Every effort must be made to accurately report real time airspace use.
(Added) Sortie—A single flight, by one aircraft, from takeoff to landing.
(Added) Sortie-Operation—A sortie-operation is the use of one airspace area (MOA, MTR, aerial
refueling area, restricted area, etc.) by one aircraft. The number of sortie-operations is used to quantify the

                                 WGEF EVALUATION GUIDELINES

A12.1. The OPR shall evaluate proposed applications for wind energy site testing and monitoring activi-
ties and for commercial wind energy development when proposed on or near lands or airspace managed
by the USAF (including the ANG, and the USAFR). The development of wind turbines has increased dra-
matically worldwide and USAF operators will frequently encounter their presence in real world opera-
tions. WGEF evaluation will contain the potential impact assessment of temporary site testing placement
and monitoring activities, permanent wind energy development, and recommendations on how to mini-
mize the impacts to the USAF mission, as required.

A12.2. The OPR shall examine the issues below when evaluating the impacts of possible placement of
wind anemometers and other permanent energy development facilities:
     A12.2.1. Safety. Although the height of anemometers may not pose an immediate hazard, the site of
     the anemometer may eventually lead to the placement of wind turbines at the site that may exceed 750
     feet AGL. When evaluating an anemometer proposal, the OPR should look at the future height of a
     wind turbine tower and associated impacts (e.g., power lines and related equipment for the operation
     of wind turbines). The OPR will verify with the proponent that the maximum height is to the tip of the
     blade as opposed to the hub. The placement of qualifying turbines shall be addressed through the FAA
     OE/AAA system at the time they propose the anemometer siting. The wind anemometers/turbines
     should be viewed in a manner similar to other obstructions, such as cell towers, oil/natural gas plat-
     forms, and water towers, encountered in normal air operations. When a unit receives an anemometer
     proposal, the OE/AAA process should be executed at that time. For those proposed in the vicinity of
     airfields, UFC 3-260-01, and the OE/AAA section of this AFI consulted.
     A12.2.2. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Radar Signatures. The EMI and radar signatures of
     wind turbines can impact current and future air operations. The OPR should contact the Air Force
     Research Lab at Kirtland AFB, NM (AFRL/DEHE) at DSN 263-6083 for further analysis. Provide the
     lab information on manufacturer(s) specifications (e.g., height of wind structure, blade construction
     material, average blade revolutions per minute (RPM), etc.) and possible affected electronic sites.
     A12.2.3. Operational Security. Sites should be evaluated for potential impact on national security.

                                           STOPLIGHT CHART

A14.1. Units should assess their airspace for compatibility with wind energy development. A success-
fully implemented method of illustrating land use compatibility is the “Stoplight” chart (see Figure
A14.1.). The compatibility will depend greatly on the type of mission being conducted.
     A14.1.1. Red identifies land use that is incompatible for the development of wind turbines. An exam-
     ple of a red area would be when a turbine penetrates a vertical and/or lateral airspace boundary,
     adversely impacts radar system performance, Terminal Instrument Procedures, landing zone opera-
     tions, or interferes with operations.
     A14.1.2. Yellow identifies land use that may or may not be compatible for wind turbine development.
     An example of a yellow area is an area where the unit is proposing to expand an existing piece of air-
     space for a future mission or where a turbine would leave minimum separation from existing flight
     tracks or paths. The yellow area is where the unit and proponent may need to perform careful evalua-
     tion and negotiation in the placement of wind turbines. Applying this to the airfield environment, the
     criteria for yellow will be based on specific conditions and mission needs.
     A14.1.3. Green identifies land use that is compatible for the development of wind turbines. An exam-
     ple of a green area is if the floor of a section of airspace is at least 1,000 feet above the proposed max-
     imum height of a turbine. Green areas do not depict areas not required by the unit; rather, they specify
     areas where mission impact is minimal below a specified altitude. It should not be inferred that the
     area is not required as airspace or is not critical to airfield operations.

Figure A14.1. Stoplight Chart




Discussion. 1. Red indicates airspace with a base altitude of surface or 100 feet AGL. Any obstacle at any
height would have detrimental impact to air operations. 2. Yellow area is proposed extension of existing
airspace. An obstacle proposed in this area would need to be carefully evaluated for impact on future air-
space operations. 3. Green indicates airspace with a base altitude of 2,500 feet AGL. Obstacles up to
2,000 feet AGL will have little to no impact on air operations (NOTE: In the unusual circumstance of an

obstacle being higher than 2,000 feet AGL but less than 2,500 feet AGL, it could be considered in a yel-
low’ zone). 4. The Grid pattern, (Yellow/Green combination) indicates transitional airspace. Green is up
to 750 feet AGL, but yellow between 750 and 2,500 feet AGL. This chart is designed as a planning feature
to assist in surface evaluation of obstacles affecting airspace. It is not part of the FAA’s OE/AAA process
and does not necessarily depict the actual airspace vertical altitude dimensions (NOTE: this example
assumes no obstacle will be higher than 4,000 feet AGL). Note that to apply this type of assessment strat-
egy to the airfield environment, the altitudes and considerations will be different than those described
here.

A14.2. The Stoplight chart can represent a 3-D depiction of your airspace by defining the altitudes. A
selected area can contain two or more colors. For example, an area could be green up to 750 feet AGL,
yellow between 750 feet and 1000 feet AGL, and red above 1000 feet AGL.
