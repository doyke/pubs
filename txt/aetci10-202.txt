                                          Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction establishes, defines and describes the responsibilities, manning
and operational procedures used to activate, operate and deactivate HQ AETC Crisis Action
Team (CAT). In addition, this instruction:
     1.1.1. Details the Command relationships between the HQ AETC CAT and higher
     headquarters as well as AETC installations.
     1.1.2. Details the HQ AETC CAT Training and Certification Program for meeting HQ
     AETC CAT operational needs.
1.2. General. The mission of the HQ AETC CAT is to maintain situational awareness of global
events in order to provide continuous and timely response to HQ USAF and combatant command
taskings. The HQ AETC CAT provides the AETC/CC with a corporate approach to managing
time-sensitive contingency and humanitarian operations by integrating a flexible support staff
tailored to meet worldwide personnel and materiel support requirements.
     1.2.1. AETC/CC/CV/DS, the Director of Intelligence, Operations and Nuclear Integration
     (HQ AETC/A2/3/10), either Deputy Director of Intelligence, Operations and Nuclear
     Integration (A/2/3/10-FT or A2/3/10-TT) or designated representative can convene the HQ
     AETC CAT to provide a venue for targeted members of the HQ AETC Staff to perform crisis
     action planning and contingency/ humanitarian operations execution.
     1.2.2. The HQ AETC CAT, through its support staff and Action Officers, ensures 24-hour-a-
     day availability of designated functional expertise. During a contingency, the HQ AETC
     CAT's functional and action officer staff may be reduced and placed on stand-by as
     operations dictate at the direction of HQ AETC/A3O and/or the on-duty CAT Director.
     1.2.3. To speed coordination and ensure responsiveness to taskers, responses prepared by
     Directorate, or Special Staff Agency (SSA) and Action Officer (AO) representatives in the
     HQ AETC CAT are considered to be the official Directorate or SSA position. Directorates
     and AOs must ensure their processes during contingency operations account for this pre-
     coordination requirement.

                                           Chapter 2

                                            POLICY

2.1. General. Circumstances which may require HQ AETC CAT activation include, but are not
limited to:
   2.1.1. Operations Plan (OPLAN) and Concept Plan (CONPLAN) implementation.
   2.1.2. Natural or man-made disasters.
   2.1.3. Major peacetime accidents.
   2.1.4. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercises.
   2.1.5. Homeland Defense responses.
   2.1.6. Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).
2.2. Structure.
   2.2.1. The HQ AETC CAT consists of designated representatives from each headquarters
   functional area. As directed by the CAT Director, this group works time-sensitive issues
   required to support AETC operations.
   2.2.2. The CAT Director manages the CAT Core Team and CAT AOs on behalf of
   AETC/CC. The CAT Director oversees functional integration and expedites staff work
   required to support the contingency or crisis.
2.3. HQ AETC CAT Composition and Functions.
   2.3.1. The three levels of HQ AETC CAT membership are:
       2.3.1.1. CAT Core Team. The CAT Core Team consists of CAT Director, CAT Duty
       Director, CAT Manager, CAT Executive Officer, CAT Admin Support, CAT Command
       and Control (C2) Liason and CAT Technical Support. AETC/A3O provides a core cadre
       of personnel qualified to perform HQ AETC CAT Core Team duties when the HQ AETC
       CAT is activated. Additional personnel should be trained and used as the length of the
       contingency/crisis dictates. Once a person is trained for a CAT Core Team position, this
       individual remains in the HQ AETC CAT duty “pool” for a minimum of one year or until
       a replacement is fully trained. Only fully trained personnel will serve on the HQ AETC
       CAT. Establishing the necessary accounts requires specific security paperwork that
       cannot be accomplished on short notice.
       2.3.1.2. CAT Level I. This level consists of AETC/CC/CV/DS, HQ AETC Directors and
       Chiefs of SSAs or their deputies.
       2.3.1.3. CAT Level II. Each two-letter directorate or SSA will identify and train
       personnel as CAT AOs (recommend a minimum of one primary and two alternate
       personnel to sustain 24/7 operations for an extended period). These individuals represent
       their Directorate or SSA and must have direct access at all times to their Director or SSA.
       At least one year retainability is required to provide continuity within the HQ AETC
       CAT.
   2.3.2. All HQ AETC CAT personnel must possess at least a SECRET clearance.
 6                                                                  AETCI10-202 3 JUNE 2014


        2.3.2.1. All HQ AETC CAT personnel must have a valid HQ AETC CAT badge issued
        by AETC/A3OS.
     2.3.3. While in the HQ AETC CAT work area, CAT members will:
        2.3.3.1. Secure phones during classified briefings as directed by the CAT Executive
        Officer.
        2.3.3.2. Protect classified material and computer account information.
        2.3.3.3. Ensure the HQ AETC CAT area is always occupied by qualified CAT members
        due to designation as an open storage area.
        2.3.3.4. Remove all classified material from the area when HQ AETC CAT operations
        are terminated.
        2.3.3.5. Ensure all classified materials are destroyed or secured in an approved classified
        storage container.
     2.3.4. Those personnel selected and trained as members of the HQ AETC CAT will be battle
     rostered to the HQ AETC CAT. In the event they deploy, their Directorate or SSA will
     provide a trained replacement prior to their departure.
     2.3.5. The CAT Core Team and CAT AOs will:
        2.3.5.1. Have a thorough working knowledge of their Directorate or SSA functional
        responsibilities during a contingency.
        2.3.5.2. Have the knowledge and capability to act as the liaison between their Directorate
        or SSA and other CATs within AETC supporting the contingency.
        2.3.5.3. Have an understanding of contingency operations.
        2.3.5.4. Perform primary duties as members of the HQ AETC CAT upon activation.
        2.3.5.5. Coordinate with CAT Manager to log into HQ AETC CAT NIPRNET and
        SIPRNET systems monthly to ensure permissions remain current.
        2.3.5.6. Update the Logbook sign-in/out log with HQ AETC CAT recall information at
        each shift changeover.
        2.3.5.7. In addition to supporting crisis operations, participate in HQ AETC CAT
        exercises and local training events.

       CAT telephone notification system. Emergency voice announcements and computer
       screen pop-ups may also be used.
       4.1.1.2. After normal duty hours, the AETC Command Center utilizes the AtHoc
       telephone notification system. Response time will be determined by the situation and set
       by the directing official (AETC/CC/CV/DS or HQ AETC/A2/3/10).
   4.1.2. After activation, the composition of the HQ AETC CAT is determined by the CAT
   Director based on the size and scope of the crisis. The CAT Director will then coordinate
   with the CAT Manager to notify the CAT AOs required for duty.
   4.1.3. Once notified, members assigned to HQ AETC CAT duty must report for duty
   as soon as possible, but NLT 1 hour after notification.

messages to and from HQ AETC staff on matters relating to the crisis, contingency, war or
exercise. All outgoing messages created by HQ AETC staff agencies relating to such situations
should be released by the CAT Director. These messages are retained locally accordingly to Air
Force RDS (https:// www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm). Messages received
during exercises will be retained locally for a period of two years and then deleted from the
message database.

                          AETC WING’S CAT REQUIREMENTS

6.1. AETC Wing’s CAT capability. All AETC wings will maintain a CAT capability. Recall
of the wing CAT and/or some or all wing personnel will be at the direction of the Wing
Commander or Vice Wing Commander if the Wing Commander is unavailable. Wing CAT
composition will ensure timely and appropriate response to all wing tasking in support of real-
world contingencies and exercise scenarios.
6.2. Tailored CAT. When a full CAT activation is not required, the wing commander may use
a tailored CAT, consisting of only those functional areas appropriate to the current situation
(nonessential CAT representatives are released) to respond to a given situation. Wings will
establish manning requirements to successfully meet contingency operations.
6.3. Wing CAT Guidance and Checklists. Wings will develop and maintain written guidance
for CAT operations. Written CAT guidance should include Roles and Responsibilities, Battle
Rhythms, Computer Procedures and Evacuation Procedures. In host/tenant situations, an
addendum to host wing guidance satisfies this requirement. As a minimum, guidance will
consist of unit-specific checklists to effectively conduct contingency operations. Checklists will
be created to support applicable installation plans (i.e., Anti-terrorism Force Protection, Anti-
Hijacking, and Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan).
6.4. Notifying HQ AETC CAT. Wing Command Posts must immediately notify the HQ
AETC Command Center when the wing CAT is locally activated for a real-world situation. In
turn, the HQ AETC Command Center duty controller will immediately notify the HQ AETC
CAT Manager and appropriate AETC senior leadership. The HQ AETC CAT Manager will
brief HQ AETC/A2/3/10 to determine if HQ AETC CAT activation is necessary. Wing
Command Posts will notify the AETC Command Center when wing CAT operations are
terminated.
6.5. Wing CAT members will complete the Air Force Emergency Response Operations (AERO)
Command and Control (C2) Web Based Training Course with specific local CAT operations
training.
