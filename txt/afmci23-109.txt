                                                 Chapter 1

                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose.
    1.1.1. This instruction outlines Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) policy for maintaining
    data that relate Air Force aircraft and equipment to lower indentured assemblies, subassemblies, and
    components. It also establishes policy for maintaining past and projected operational, inventory, and
    maintenance programs for Air Force weapon systems and equipment. DOD 4140.1-R, Chapter 3,
    DOD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation paragraph 3B3h directs each military service to
    use item indenture and application structures to support calculation of secondary item requirements.
    1.1.2. The D200F Applications, Programs, and Indentures (API) system is a subsystem of the Air
    Force Requirements Management System (RMS) and is the approved Air Force tool for maintaining
    hardware indentures and relating program data to secondary items. The purpose of D200F is to sup-
    port the D200A Secondary Item Requirements System (SIRS) processes by insuring operational and
    maintenance program assigned to end items and assemblies is distributed to lower level components
    and subassemblies. The system does this by maintaining complete indenture structures for all end
    items, including aerospace vehicles, equipment, engines, and ground vehicles.
    1.1.3. While D200F was specifically designed to support D200A SIRS, the indenture portion sup-
    ports other processes throughout the Department of Defense (DoD). These include the Defense Logis-
    tics Agency (DLA) Weapon System Support Program, the Air Force Diminishing Manufacturing
    Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) program, and Air Force depot maintenance activities.

1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) personnel who
maintain indentures and program data that support AFMC requirements determination processes.

1.3. Terms and Abbreviations. Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information,
includes is a list of terms used in this instruction and their definitions, and a lists abbreviations/acronyms
and their meaning.

1.4. Responsibility.
    1.4.1. HQ AFMC/LGY will implement the policies and procedures established in this instruction.
    1.4.2. The HQ AFMC Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) will:
       1.4.2.1. Advise senior AFMC management, HQ USAF, other services and Department of Defense
       (DOD) agencies of developments in D200F that affect support of AFMC customers throughout
       the DOD and the Air Force mission.
       1.4.2.2. Provide guidance to ALC OPRs on matters relating to management of indenture and pro-
       gram data.
       1.4.2.3. Generate Process Change Requests (PCRs) and Computer System Requirements Docu-
       ments (CSRDs) to implement system changes and enhancements.
       1.4.2.4. Submit deficiency reports to correct processing and system problems.
       1.4.2.5. Develop and support process and system improvements.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                               7


  1.4.3. Air Logistics Centers Directors of Logistics (ALC/LG) will:
     1.4.3.1. Appoint personnel to act as Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for indentures and
     programs.
     1.4.3.2. Provide written requests for permission from the HQ AFMC API OPR to approve
     waiver(s) for deviating from the HQ AFMC/LGYR API Instruction.
     1.4.3.3. ALC LG will ensure that ALC/LG Applications, Programs and Indenture (API) OPRs are
     assigned and that ALC D200F Program Monitors are assigned.
  1.4.4. ALC LG Applications, Programs and Indentures OPRs will develop/enforce policy for ALC/
  LG personnel and have the responsibility for adding, changing or deleting local system program des-
  ignators and the redesignation of local system program designators in a subparagraph.
     1.4.4.1. Act as the single point of contact for all indenture information pertinent to the D200F sys-
     tem and disseminate indenture information or correspondence to the ES organizations at their
     ALCs.
         1.4.4.1.1. Oversee the input of data files containing indenture data, and of production and con-
         sumption history from the maintenance function, contractors and interfacing systems.
         [NOTE: OO-ALC may choose to assign this responsibility to the ALC/IT API OPR].
         1.4.4.1.2. Provide guidance to equipment specialists (ES) and other personnel who maintain
         indenture structures and associated data, and to ALC managers who generate maintenance
         programs.
     1.4.4.2. Ensure that ESs are maintaining the indenture structure and making corrections to all
     inaccurate indenture structures in the D200F system. In order to monitor progress of the indenture
     clean up effort and indenture maintenance, the ALC Indentures OPR will report once every quar-
     ter to the HQ AFMC/LGYR API OPR on all indenture file maintenance progress and outstanding
     issues in the D200F system.
     1.4.4.3. Ensure that all ESs at their respective Center have attended and completed the Applica-
     tion and Indentures Training Course. See your local training monitor/office for details on class
     times and locations.
     1.4.4.4. Ensure that all Inventory Management Specialists (IMS) who manage recoverable or AF
     managed consumable items have attended the Application and Indentures Training Course. IMS
     must be trained to use D200F to review and to identify excess higher-level assemblies that can be
     used to satisfy lower-level component buy and repair requirements.
     1.4.4.5. Advise single managers on the effects that changes in indenture or program data may
     have on their systems.

       1.4.5.5. Supplement this instruction when necessary to deal with unique situations at their ALCs
    1.4.6. Equipment specialists will:
       1.4.6.1. Insure that the D200F database reflects accurate indenture structures and related data for
       all systems, equipment, and assemblies for which they are responsible.
       1.4.6.2. Insure that changes to indenture structures that result from modifications, reliability
       changes, or changes to the maintenance concept are reflected in the D200F database.
       1.4.6.3. Perform the following program selection tasks (see Chapter 4):
           1.4.6.3.1. Identify secondary components resident in the D200A Secondary Item Require-
           ments System (SIRS) to the higher assembly applications, and determine the proper program
           activity to apply from the application to the components.
           1.4.6.3.2. Determine the amount of program that should apply to a component at any given
           point in the future, using the time-phasing technique described in Chapter 4.
           1.4.6.3.3. Coordinate with ESs within and outside of their organizations on matters that affect
           indenture relationships of their assigned systems.
           1.4.6.3.4. Ensure each application, program select code, application mission essentiality code,
           program begin date, quantity per assembly, application percent are accurately file maintained
           and in the correct format.
       1.4.6.4. ESs must continually maintain the indenture structure of assigned items and application
       data and make corrections to all inaccurate indenture structures and application data in the D200F
       system.
       1.4.6.5. ESs are required to correct all inaccurate D200F indenture data and application data and
       maintain the updates to the D200F indenture structure and application data on their assigned
       items.
       1.4.6.6. ESs must attend and complete the Application and Indentures Training Course. See your
       local training monitor/office for details on class times and locations.
       1.4.6.7. The ES should refer to the Indentures Quality Review Checklist in Table 9.2. as a guide-
       line for reviewing Indentures.
    1.4.7. End article item managers (EAIMs) (D200C IMS) will:
       1.4.7.1. Ensure that their items reflect timely in-use inventory in the D200C Equipment Process
       subsystem before each semi-annual update. EAIMs (D200C IMS) must ensure the data in the
       source systems (D200C and D075) are timely maintained so the data will successfully pass to
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                9


       D200F. If the D200C and D075 systems data does not support what is file maintained in D200F,
       then the D200F data will be erroneous.
       1.4.7.2. The EAIMs responsibility is to review, analyze, and correct the requirements data in
       D200C and D075 in a timely manner, thus ensuring the data passed to D200F is complete and
       accurate.
   1.4.8. Inventory management specialists (IMSs) who manage recoverable or Air Force managed con-
   sumable secondary components will refer questions regarding inventory programs generated in the
   1.4.9 D200C systems to the applicable EAIM.
       1.4.8.1. IMS must attend and complete the Application and Indentures Training Course. See your
       local training monitor/office for details on class times and locations.
       1.4.8.2. IMS must use D200F indenture data to identify higher-level assemblies that could be used
       to satisfy buy and repair requirements of lower-level components. IMS must document that they
       have reviewed the D200F indenture data and retain this documentation with the item file for audit
       purposes.
   1.4.9. Production Management Specialists (PMS). The Seller PMS is responsible for supporting con-
   tract repair with Government Furnished Materiel (GFM). D200F produces a Purchase Request Sup-
   port List (PRSL) to identify GFM candidates. See API Users Manual instructions on generating a
   PRSL. The users manual is available on line through a link at https://www.msg.wpafb.af.mil/sxr/.
   1.4.10. The HQ AFMC Reclamation OPR and the ALC Reclamation Program Control Officer. CSRD
   02-0212 changed the way the Reclamation process works. API no longer provides an on-line screen
   for the Reclamation officers to enter items to be reclaimed. Instead API now receives an interface
   from D035G that gives us the requests to process. Consequently, we have removed that screen from
   API. See Chapter 5 for product descriptions.
   1.4.11. System Program Directors will insure that equipment specialists review and maintain accurate
   indenture structures and relationships and application data for vehicles and equipment they manage.

1.5. Policy.
   1.5.1. The API process directly supports the requirements determination process for secondary items
   and maintenance production. Therefore, accurate indenture data and application data are necessary to
   distribute program data to the component level and assure calculation of accurate maintenance and
   failure rates and requirements. Indentures should reflect the illustrated parts breakdowns in the –4
   series of technical orders.
   1.5.2. The D200F Applications, Programs, and Indentures (API) subsystem is the approved tool for
   managing application indentures and program data. D200F serves as a database for component and
   end item indenture relationships and for weapon system level program data.
   1.5.3. ESs shall periodically review indenture relationships of components, assemblies, equipment,
   and end items for which they are responsible. An assembly or end item may have lower indentured
   assemblies that are assigned to another ES. Therefore, it will occasionally be necessary to consult with
   other ES to verify the indentures.
   1.5.4. Indenture review involves ES verification that each assigned assembly’s components on the
   next lower indenture are properly identified and that each component’s quantity per assembly (see
10                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     Chapter 2), application percent, mission item essentiality code (MIEC – see Chapter 4), and the
     source, maintenance, recoverability (SMR – see Chapter 4) code are accurate. The ES enters a review
     date in YYYYDDD format after review. The review date causes the D200F system to count the
     assembly as reviewed for reporting purposes. Review dates expire after 18 months. Assemblies with
     expired review date need to be revalidated.
     1.5.5. The ES will review the NHA data (navigation: FOE FM AI NHA.) screen in API at least once
     each 18 months. The ES reviews the indenture and either accepts the change by adding a date in the
     “INDENTURE REVIEWED DATE” (yyyy/ddd) field or adds the correct indenture information. If the
     ES determines that the indenture data is incorrect, the ES must take action to correct the indentures
     data in API.
     1.5.6. The illustrated parts breakdowns in the –4 technical order series are the authoritative sources
     for indenture information. Consider automated means of review using scanner technology with hard
     copies of the tech orders, or automated methods for tech orders that are available in electronic format.
     The HQ AFMC and ALC indenture OPRs have a PC-based software package that formats indenture
     information derived from technical orders and prepares the data for input to the D200F database.
     1.5.7. Only the HQ AFMC API OPR can change operational program data that are derived from the
     USAF Program Aerospace Vehicle and Flying Hours (PA) documents, and HQ USAF/XOO must
     have specifically authorized these changes. ALC managers may create and change overhaul programs
     that generate at their ALCs.

1.6. Process.
     1.6.1. D200F Overview. The D200F API is part of the relational, interactive D200 Requirements
     Management System (RMS) database maintained at Wright-Patterson AFB OH. To support RMS
     materiel and budget requirements, D200F performs several computations, including engine programs,
     tailored modification programs, and application percents. For detailed descriptions of each system
     process see the D200F Process Functional Description. The link to the PFD is at URL https://
     www.msg.wpafb.af.mil/sxr/.
     1.6.2. D200F provides information to assist users in functions related to Integrated Weapon System
     Management (IWSM). It produces output products for management of configured items and weapon
     systems. This includes identification of higher and lower assemblies, quantity per application (QPA)
     and application percent.
     1.6.3. D200F includes the following categories of data: applications, programs and indentures.
     1.6.4. The indenture portion identifies relationships of components to their higher assemblies and end
     items.
     1.6.5. The indenture portion is a conceptual tree that breaks an end item down to its components one
     level of indenture at a time. The system builds end item indentures top down by relating each assem-
     bly to its components on the next lower indenture level.
     1.6.6. Each indenture relationship involves a single NHA and a single component. Any given NHA
     can have more than one direct component, but will have a separate indenture relationship with each
     component.
     1.6.7. Each set of NHA-component relationship records appears only once in D200F no matter how
     many assemblies or end items are involved. When a user requests a product that displays all levels of
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                              11


   indenture of an assembly or end item, D200F builds that NHA’s entire indenture structure according
   to the relationship data in the system at each indenture level.
   1.6.8. The application portion relates aerospace vehicles, equipment, engines, and other end items to
   operational, inventory, and maintenance program data. This portion also defines the relationship of
   end items to their component items with the following time-phased data that may actually override the
   data derived from the physical (indenture) relationships indenture data: quantity per application
   (QPAPPL), quantity per assembly (QPA), replacement percent (REPL%) and application percent
   (APPL%). The application portion allows relationships to be established between items and various
   end items (frequently weapon systems) for which program will be computed for SIRS. If it is neces-
   sary to override the QPAPPL, REPL %, and APPL% that would be derived from the physical relation-
   ships, they are overridden via time-phased entries in the application portion of API.
   1.6.9. The program portion identifies provides past and projected program data and computes pro-
   grams for engines and for modification programs.
   1.6.10. D200F is integrated with the D200E Requirements Item Identification (RIID) function in the
   RMS system. RIID provides cataloging data and stock list changes received from the D043 Master
   Item Identification Control System (MIICS). RIID receives initial indenture and catalog data from the
   D220 Air Force Provisioning System and updates from the D043A Master Item Identification Control
   System, and edits all cataloging data for stock listed items. RIID also accepts non-stock listed items
   from D220 and posts them in the D200 database.

1.7. Function.
   1.7.1. Users can view and update D200F data through the RMS on-line system. This system features
   menu-driven navigation in each of the following functions:
      1.7.1.1. The display function, which allows most users to view application, indenture and pro-
      gram data.
      1.7.1.2. The file maintenance function, which allows authorized users to update data that fall into
      their areas of responsibility.
      1.7.1.3. The output products function, which allows users to submit product and report requests
      and to review the status of requests already submitted (see the description of CA DISPATCH
      below, paragraph 1.8.3.).
   1.7.2. Throughout this instruction are references to navigation paths that refer to certain system
   screens or their processes or products. Table 9.1. in Chapter 9 displays the screens associated with
   these paths.
   1.7.3. For example, path FOE DIS PRGM SPDL points to the Standard Program.
   1.7.4. Designator (SPDL) screen, in the program path (PRGM), under the Display function (DIS). All
   D200F screens are reached through the Final Operating Environment (FOE) high-level option.

1.8. The RMS Administrative and Support subsystem (D200.1).
   1.8.1. Provides a notification function that advises ESs of changes or additions to the database that
   affect their workload. This includes any catalog changes, file maintenance errors, inputs from the
   interfacing systems that affect indenture structures, errors in input data from these systems, and user
12                                                                        AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     requested reports that have not processed in CA Dispatch for viewing. Users should establish a regular
     routine of reading notifications. Errors should be promptly corrected to prevent transactions from
     accumulating in suspense files. Notification messages are deleted after three days.
     1.8.2. The query function uses a commercial software package, ADR DATAQUERY, which allows
     the user to select, retrieve, and order data from the RMS databases. D200F produces “push” and
     “pull” products. The system automatically creates push products on a regular basis e.g., weekly,
     monthly etc., and creates interface products as they process. The system creates pull products only
     when users specifically request them. Pull products are processed on request only during the cycle in
     which the request is received at the processing center. Chapter 5 describes each output product. The
     API User’s Manual has a sample of each product.
     1.8.3. CA DISPATCH is a commercial software package that processes and generates reports for all
     RMS subsystems. The D200F system was designed to be a paperless data system. Although printed
     products are available, CA DISPATCH initially processes both system generated (“push”) and user
     requested (“pull”) products for on-line viewing. If printed copies are desired the user must execute a
     print command. CA DISPATCH retains system-generated reports for three calendar days. The system
     assigns a job number to each report using the user’s next number sequence. Users may interrogate CA
     DISPATCH for availability of reports that they and other users have generated. See Chapter 5 for
     instructions on viewing system generated reports. The API push/pull products print according to how
     the ES has the printer set up under their D200 ID. If it’s set up for a particular printer, then the product
     will automatically print at that printer instead of CA DISPATCH. If it’s set up for DISP, then it will go
     to CA DISPATCH for on-line viewing. The printer setting can be viewed/changed by going to the fol-
     lowing screen in API: MAIN, UDV, FM, UVFK.

1.9. Security.
     1.9.1. D200F is an unclassified database. Classified data are not authorized.
     1.9.2. System Use. The RMS uses internal edits for system access, control and data processing.
     1.9.3. System Access. All D200F users must have an approved RMS user identification and pass-
     word. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) controls access to all DoD data systems.
     ALC users request system access by submitting DD Form 2875 System Authorization Access Request
     (SAAR) to the ALC OPR. All other requesters, including contractors, submit DD Form 2875 which
     can be found at the following website: https://www.ripit.wpafb.af.mil/LGIR/documents/
     DD2875.pdf , to the HQ AFMC API OPR at HQ AFMC/LGYR, 4375 Chidlaw Road, Room N145,
     Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006. All requests must be reviewed by the user’s security manager
     and approved by the first line supervisor and the appropriate OPR before forwarding to DISA. Con-
     tract task managers may approve requests for contractor personnel in lieu of the supervisor.
     1.9.4. In compliance with DoD standards, RMS suspends the password of any user who has not
     signed on to the system within the previous 90 days.
     1.9.5. Suspended users must request a new password from the RMS data administrator. If a user does
     not log on to the system for 180 days the system revokes the user identification and the user must
     resubmit the DD Form 2875.

1.10. System Control.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                            13


   1.10.1. Users can gain access to indenture data in D200F by entering a combination of a vendor’s part
   number and a Commercial and Government Entity Code (CAGE, formerly FSCM) code, a Standard
   Reporting Designator (SRD), or a National Item Identification Number (NIIN). These are the primary
   controls the system uses to identify parts to their NHA and component item relationships. Users can
   gain access to program data by entering the Standard Program Designator in the proper format (see
   Chapter 4, Table 4.2.)

1.11. Interfaces.
   1.11.1. The D200F system receives data primarily through interfaces from other systems and through
   user file maintenance. Chapter 5 describes the system output products. Chapter 6 describes the input
   and output interfaces.
   1.11.2. System Users and Profiles. Each of the following D200F users is assigned separate profiles.
   Each profile allows a distinct “read” and “write” capability that enables the user to view and update
   records. See Chapter 8 for access and responsibilities:
       1.11.2.1. Equipment Specialists (ES).
       1.11.2.2. ALC Indenture Monitors.
       1.11.2.3. HQ AFMC API OPR (also the HQ AFMC Policy OPR).
       1.11.2.4. ALC Programs Monitor.
       1.11.2.5. System Program Manager (SPM) or System Program Director (SPD).
       1.11.2.6. Production Management Specialist (PMS).
       1.11.2.7. HQ AFMC Reclamation OPR.
       1.11.2.8. ALC Reclamation Program Control Officer (RPCO).
       1.11.2.9. All RMS (API) Users can view and request general information related to API.

1.12. Training.
   1.12.1. ESs, PMSs, ALC Indentures OPRs and IMS managing recoverable and AF managed consum-
   able items should complete Course MHPCIM0003500SU. This course is available through each ALC
   training function.
14                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


                                                 Chapter 2

                                              INDENTURES

2.1. Record Establishment.
     2.1.1. Indenture records are established in D200F through automated interface with other systems,
     and through manual input. Generally, equipment specialists (ES), ALC OPRs, and HQ AFMC ana-
     lysts may update indenture records. Only the responsible ES may add, change, or delete data specific
     to a particular component or assembly.

2.2. Data Sources.
     2.2.1. Data from several sources establish and change indenture records. The choice depends on
     availability of data and which source, in the ES's judgment, provides the best information. However,
     the first two sources described below are preferred: contractor data and provisioning.

2.3. Contractor data.
     2.3.1. The Air Force acquires indenture records from manufacturers of new end items and aircraft
     using DOD Data List Data Item Description (DID) DI-ILSS-81220A and DI-ILSS-81221A, Applica-
     tions, Programs and Indenture Data. Chapter 7 has the DIDs formats and procedures for establishing
     records from data submitted by contractors.
     2.3.2. The decision to buy records is part of the acquisition process. These data should be an integral
     part of any solicitation and procurement package (see Chapter 7). The records are complete indenture
     files in electronic form in the specified format. Some older systems did not include these data in their
     procurement packages; therefore, the Air Force should acquire or build these data, whichever is the
     most economical.

2.4. Provisioning.
     2.4.1. This method creates indenture records through interface with the D220 Air Force Provisioning
     System during the provisioning process. D220 produces an indenture file that reflects the provisioning
     parts list. If the provisioning file does not include a particular assembly’s indenture, the ES should
     manually add it and its components after the cataloging screening process.
     2.4.2. Interim supply support (ISS) is a program in which a contractor performs materiel management
     functions, including provisioning tasks, during the period when a new system or end item is being
     fielded and demand patterns stabilize. When a contractor performs materiel management functions
     under ISS arrangements, HQ AFMC API OPR strongly recommends considering acquiring data
     through the DIDs, since the traditional provisioning may not be used and no D220 file may be avail-
     able. ISS is performed under the oversight of a supply support integrated product team (SSIPT). Each
     SSIPT includes ESs as core members, and they provide the same level of assistance and expertise as
     they would on a traditional provisioning team.
     2.4.3. Regardless of how a new system will be supported (ISS or traditional provisioning), the ES on
     the SSIPT or the organic provisioning team must notify ESs who are responsible for stock listed com-
     ponents that will be used in the new system or end item. This information allows the component ES to
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                              15


   include program data for the new systems on the component’s program selection record (see Chapter
   4).

2.5. Manual method.
   2.5.1. The responsible ES can establish indenture records using the on-line system and referring to
   primary sources of indenture data. Sources of indenture data include drawings, Illustrated Parts
   Breakdowns in the –4 technical orders, technical manuals, and provisioning documents. Two screens
   are available in the file maintenance feature of the on line system to establish indentures.
   2.5.2. The indenture screen (Navigation FOE FM AI IND) allows the ES to identify a NHA and add
   components one at a time.
   2.5.3. The “Copy/Add” feature is a time saving tool that allows the ES to copy component indenture
   records from a similar older NHA to a newer NHA (Navigation FOE FM IND CAI). If 80% of the old
   NHA’s components are also part of the new NHA, the Copy/Add feature can reduce the workload
   involved with establishing indentures for the new NHA by 80%.
   2.5.4. The system does not allow indentures to be copied if the NHA has an exempt code. Also, the
   NHA being added must be assigned to the ES performing the copy/add action.

2.6. Other Sources.
   2.6.1. Sometimes a component is replaced in a NHA during repair or overhaul of the NHA, and
   D200F does not have an indenture relationship between the two. In those cases D200F automatically
   establishes indenture records at the first level as the component’s replacement (consumption) is
   reported against the NHA’s repair or overhaul (production). D200F produces a product New Compo-
   nents for Existing NHA that advises the ES of this condition. The ES will review this product and will
   use it to build or change indenture records.

2.7. Equipment specialist indenture tasks and responsibilities.
   2.7.1. The ES, as an integral part of the provisioning process, insures accuracy of indentures before
   passing them to D200F. All first level components, regardless of the Expendability, Recoverability,
   Repairability, Category (ERRC) code and prime ALC, shall be identified to a higher assembly. Incor-
   rect or missing component-NHA relationships could cause inaccurate buy and repair projections.
   Inaccurate indenture reporting could cause the maintenance activity to order the wrong parts.
   2.7.2. When building an indenture record include any special support equipment, bulk materials, and
   technical data references necessary to support maintenance of the item or weapon system, using the
   appropriate Special Identification Designator (SID) code.
   2.7.3. Changes to indentures result from configuration changes -- Engineering Change Proposal,
   Design Change Notices, and major modifications -- should pass to D200F through the provisioning
   process. Therefore, once the indenture for a weapon system or item is entered correctly, only minimal
   intervention should be needed to maintain the indenture.

2.8. Format.
The ES will file maintain the indenture data in the proper format in accordance with system edits. See the
API Users Manual for input instructions and edits. This document and all D200F related documentation is
16                                                                       AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


available on the Internet at https://www.msg.wpafb.af.mil/sxr/rdb.htm and on the D200F webpage:
https://www.ripit.wpafb.af.mil/LGIR/D200F.asp.

2.9. Exemption Code.
     2.9.1. Sometimes a NHA may be exempt from having its components identified. In such cases, the
     exempt codes below apply. Manual input is the only source for these codes. The types of Exemption
     Codes are as follows:
        2.9.1.1. A – No components needed for depot repair
        2.9.1.2. B – Sole source contract repair that includes repair parts as well as labor
        2.9.1.3. D – End item is exclusively repaired by another service, and no Air Force furnished com-
        ponents are involved
        2.9.1.4. E – End item is modified during repair and a different NSN is assigned
        2.9.1.5. J – Classified item; the ES assigns this code only when indenture establishment would
        compromise classified information
        2.9.1.6. N - New NHA with production history but no consumption history
        2.9.1.7. T – Technical data are not available. Do not use this code if the CAGE (formerly FSCM),
        SMR code, MIEC, QPA, and application percent are known
     2.9.2. Be cautious when assigning exemption codes. They prevent the system from assigning compo-
     nent records to the NHA. If assigned to a NHA that is already indentured, the system deletes all com-
     ponent relationships. Also, the system neither computes component requirements nor accepts
     consumption history when an exempt code is present. Lower indentured assemblies of a NHA with an
     exemption code still retain their component-NHA relationships.

2.10. Special Identification Codes (SID).
     2.10.1. This code identifies a special condition or additional information pertaining to a component in
     an indenture chain. In some cases the SID identifies components that are not part of an end item’s
     hardware indenture or configuration, but are used under special circumstances. In others they indicate
     components that are part of an end item only under certain conditions. The ES enters this code on the
     indentures file maintenance screen in the on line system. The codes and their meanings are:
        2.10.1.1. Code D, Special Tool Field and Depot, indicates that the component is a special tool
        needed for field and depot-level repair, but is peculiar to the particular end item and not normally
        available in a repair shop.
        2.10.1.2. Code E, Special Tool Depot Only, indicates that the component is a special tool needed
        for depot-level repair, but is useful only with a particular end item and is not normally available in
        a repair shop.
        2.10.1.3. Code F, Test Equipment Field and Depot Only, indicates that the component is an article
        of test equipment required for both field and depot repair, is peculiar to the particular end item, and
        not normally available in a repair shop.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                17


       2.10.1.4. Code G, Test Equipment Depot Only, indicates that the component is an article of test
       equipment required only for depot repair, is peculiar to the particular end item, and not normally
       available in a repair shop.
       2.10.1.5. Code H, Variable Tolerance Item, indicates a component that is installed only when
       needed to meet certain specifications such as tolerance, size, thickness, etc. Examples are shims,
       gaskets, or bushing.
       2.10.1.6. Code L, Bulk Material, indicates an article of bulk material (paint, adhesives, grease,
       etc.) needed to repair or overhaul the end item.
       2.10.1.7. Code M, Shop Manufacture Item, indicates that the component is manufactured, but
       requires no machining and normally can be made in the shop with standard shop equipment.
       Examples are gaskets, lengths of wire, or shims.
       2.10.1.8. Code N, Specific Series or Configuration Application Item, indicates that the compo-
       nent applies to a specific series or configuration of the end item. The end item mission design
       series (MDS) or the component’s serial number determines the usage.
       2.10.1.9. Code P, Serial Number Controlled Item, indicates that each piece of material bearing this
       identity is controlled by an assigned serial number.
       2.10.1.10. Code R, Test Equipment Field Only, indicates that the component is an article of test
       equipment needed only at the field activities.
       2.10.1.11. Code S, Repair/Parts Kit, indicates that the component is a repair parts kit.
       2.10.1.12. Code T, Technical Order/Drawing, indicates that the component is a technical order or
       a drawing.
       2.10.1.13. Code U, Selective Fit, indicates that the component requires selective fit or selection of
       one component from a number of choices.
       2.10.1.14. Code V, Review, indicates that the component was input by the system and requires
       review and update by the ES. D200F adds this code to the record when a depot maintenance activ-
       ity orders a component that is not part of the indenture of an assembly undergoing overhaul or
       repair. The indenture is updated to include the component in the assembly’s indenture. The word
       “REVIEW” appears in the breakdown sequence number (BSN) field. The ES reviews the inden-
       ture and either accepts the change by adding a date in the “REVIEW DATE” field or adds the cor-
       rect indenture information.
       2.10.1.15. Code W, Embedded End Item Not Repaired Separately, indicates a recoverable compo-
       nent that will never be repaired separately; therefore, all of its components should be included in
       this indenture.

2.11. Acquisition Process Responsibilities.
   2.11.1. AFMCI 23-104, Functions and Responsibilities of the Equipment Specialist During Provi-
   sioning directs the ES to ensure that each part of an end item is established in the indenture record.
   The following guidance defines the tasks involved with establishing indentures:
       2.11.1.1. Request for Proposal (RFP).
18                                                                    AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


            2.11.1.1.1. During Request for Proposal (RFP) development the ES will request contracting
            actions that direct the contractor to deliver indenture data. As part of the Logistic Support
            Analysis (LSA) request package the ES will identify the indenture requirement using the DOD
            Data List Data Item Description (DID) DI-ILSS-81221A, which calls for LSA records as
            source data. This DID will be used on all acquisitions and modifications, including system
            acquisitions planned for contractor support under Initial Supply Support or Contractor Logis-
            tics Support arrangements.
        2.11.1.2. Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD).
            2.11.1.2.1. During the Support Equipment Recommendation Data (SERD) review the ES will
            consider the indenture requirements. When applicable, indicate on the SERD that a provision-
            ing parts list (PPL) is required.

2.12. Provisioning Interface.
     2.12.1. Automated interface with the D220 provisioning system establishes an indenture relationship
     when identified on a Provisioning Parts List (PPL).
     2.12.2. The ES must review all indentures established during the acquisition process to insure their
     accuracy. The ES will correct any discrepancies through the on-line system. In addition, if the above
     procedures were not followed during acquisition, the ES shall manually build the indentures.
     2.12.3. If D220 does not provide an APPL % or QPA for an indenture relationship, D200F assigns
     defaults of 0% and 0, a Special Identification Designator (SID) code of “W” (embedded end item) and
     a Breakdown Sequence Number (BSN) containing the word “REVIEW” to the indenture relationship.
     The ES should review the relationship and consult the provisioning data or the technical order for the
     correct QPA.
     2.12.4. A replacement percent source reference code (SRC) indicates how the value of the replace-
     ment percent was acquired. The SRC codes used and their definitions are:
        2.12.4.1. A – “Actual;” derived from a system interface.
        2.12.4.2. C – “Computed;” derived from reporting from a maintenance activity.
        2.12.4.3. E – “Estimated” or “entered;” derived through ES manual update.
        2.12.4.4. F – Value was not entered when the indenture was established and the system assigns a
        default value of 0%.

2.13. Indenture Data Sustainment.
     2.13.1. The ES maintains indenture data within D200F for the life of a weapon system or end item.
     The ES must keep abreast of changes that affect an item’s or a system’s indenture structures, and
     incorporates these changes into the D200F system. After finishing an indenture review process, the
     ES must file maintain a review date onto the NHA screen. Some processes that may change indentures
     include: notifications, design changes, cataloging actions, system interfaces, component replacement
     usage, T.O. actions, SMR Codes, repair programs.

2.14. Notifications.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                             19


   2.14.1. The RMS on line system includes a notification feature that provides users with information
   relevant to their particular workloads. The ES should establish a routine of periodically checking the
   RMS Notifications function for any information requiring ES action on indentures or applications.
   Notifications remain in the system for three days before they are deleted.

2.15. Design Changes.
   2.15.1. Change or add indentures to agree with the Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO). This
   includes deleting or adding all parts that were deleted or added by the TCTO. Also review replace-
   ment percentages since TCTO changes often result in improved reliability.

2.16. Cataloging Actions.
   2.16.1. Review all system-generated notices that result from cataloging changes and determine how
   they affect the indentures. Update the D200F system as required.

2.17. System Interfaces.
   2.17.1. Review all system-generated notices and reports (see Chapter 6) that result from data system
   interfaces and determine how they affect indentures, production schedules, and consumption rates.
   Update the D200F system as required.

2.18. Component Replacement Usage.
   2.18.1. Review replacement percentages when external events may affect component replacement
   rates, e.g., changes to repair authorizations or environmental conditions.

2.19. Technical Order (TO) Actions.
   2.19.1. Change indenture data elements to reflect TO changes that affect indentures or indenture data.
   If indentures were built before the TOs were received, the indenture should be verified at the same
   time the TO is verified.

2.20. Source, Maintenance, Recoverability (SMR) Code.
   2.20.1. Change indenture data elements to reflect SMR code changes. Changes in level of repair will
   likely affect the replacement percent.

2.21. Repair Programs.
   2.21.1. The ES should review indenture data of assemblies and end items that are projected for repair
   in the most recent D200A requirements computation. Focus first on critical items, not mission capable
   supply (NMCS) items on backorder, and items that will support programmed depot maintenance
   (PDM) schedules. The review shall be completed before starting a new repair project or prototype
   (AFMC IMT 206, Temporary Work Request).
   2.21.2. The following products aid in identifying need for review. See Chapter 6 for a description of
   each product:
      2.21.2.1. New NHAs and Related Components.
      2.21.2.2. New Components for Existing NHAs.
20                                                               AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     2.21.2.3. Component Items for Review.
     2.21.2.4. Selected Items for Review.
     2.21.2.5. Incomplete Indenture Chains.
     2.21.2.6. Indenture guidelines. Consider the following rules when creating or changing inden-
     tures:
        2.21.2.6.1. Secondary items --those with ERRC T, C, N, or P -- cannot be end items. Every
        secondary item must have a NHA.
        2.21.2.6.2. A component with ERRC C or T cannot be a component of a NHA with ERRC N
        or P.
        2.21.2.6.3. Since the part number-CAGE combination is the primary record identifier in
        D200F, a part number-CAGE combination must be entered to establish a new indenture. If
        only a NIIN is entered the system returns a message, “Cannot add by NIIN.”
        2.21.2.6.4. The indentures include non-stock listed components and NHAs; i.e., they are iden-
        tified by part number/CAGE combination only. Only non-stock listed line replaceable units
        (LRUs) should have stock listed components. Generally, non-stock listed components of sec-
        ondary items should not have stock listed components. ESs should review these types of
        indenture chains for validity.
        2.21.2.6.5. A NHA can have production history with no corresponding component consump-
        tion history. However, all component consumption history must be accompanied by NHA pro-
        duction history. Recorded consumption history indicates the component was removed from
        some higher assembly.
        2.21.2.6.6. Components that are insurance items (Acquisition Advice Code Z in the catalog
        system) should not have consumption history. If the maintenance system reports consumption
        against an insurance item the ES should review the NHA and the component and consider one
        of the following actions:
            2.21.2.6.6.1. Delete the consumption history.
            2.21.2.6.6.2. Change the component’s SMR code and Acquisition Advice Code.
            2.21.2.6.6.3. NHAs that are insurance items should not have components with replace-
            ment percents greater than 0.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                  21


                                                Chapter 3

                                              PROGRAMS

3.1. Concepts.
   3.1.1. A “Program” is any activity that creates the need for spare parts.
   3.1.2. An “application” is any assembly in an indenture chain, including the end item, which gener-
   ates measurable program activity. An assembly becomes an application when the ES determines that
   it requires spare part support as part of its normal maintenance. Applications are expressed as Stan-
   dard Program Designators (SPD) in D200F (see Chapter 4).

3.2. Program Displays.
   3.2.1. D200F receives historical program data and authorized future programs and displays them in
   quarterly increments in the on-line system.
   3.2.2. When a user requests a Display, File maintenance, or Trend Analysis screen, the system auto-
   matically displays the program data that are current at the end of the most recent calendar quarter,
   which is represented as the “asset cut-off date” D200A uses for spare part requirements projections.
   The system displays a Programs Calendar Quarter, expressed in YYYY/MM format. The Programs
   Calendar Quarter begins on the day after the asset cut-off date, and therefore is the first quarter of pro-
   gram projection.
   3.2.3. In the Display and File Maintenance functions users can view program projections from past
   quarters by entering a Programs Calendar Quarter in the above format that corresponds to any calen-
   dar quarter during the two years before the asset cut-off date. The month portion of the date must be
   03, 06, 09, or 12.
   3.2.4. In the Trend Analysis TAC function (see section 3.13. Trend Analysis) users can compare cur-
   rent projected programs for 8 future quarters to what was projected for each of those quarters during
   the previous 8 cycles. The first of the 8 future quarters to be displayed can be specified by entering in
   the “Start Qtr” field a date that occurs during the ten years after the asset cut-off date. The month por-
   tion of the date must be 03, 06, 09, or 12. The Start-Qtr field must be equal to or greater than the Pro-
   gram-Cal-Qtr.
   3.2.5. In the Trend Analysis TAP function (see section 3.13. Trend Analysis) users can compare
   actual program activity during the two years before the asset cut-off date with what was projected in
   previous cycles. The month portion of the date must be 03, 06, 09, or 12.

3.3. Program Categories.
   3.3.1. D200F recognizes three categories of programs; each is identified by one of several program
   types. D200F includes past and projected programs for each category. The three categories of pro-
   grams are:
      3.3.1.1. Organizational and Intermediate Maintenance (OIM) Programs, which indicate levels of
      activity at the operational user’s (usually base) level.
      3.3.1.2. Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) programs, which indicate levels of maintenance activ-
      ity during end item overhaul or higher assembly depot level repair.
22                                                                       AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


        3.3.1.3. Inventory Programs, which indicate authorized active and inactive inventories for end
        items. At the item level an inventory program is a statement of the number of components that are
        installed in the end item population.

3.4. Program Types.
     3.4.1. The Air Force uses nine types of program for most applications. D200F makes the following
     programs available to the D200A system, which uses them to compute secondary item replenishment
     requirements (see also Table 3.2.). D200F computes program data for engines for the program type
     corresponding to the first position of the Program Select Code as defined in the aircraft to engine
     application relationship. D200F also computes program data for PECs for the program types corre-
     sponding to a non-zero first and second position of the Program Selection Code as defined in the air-
     craft to PEC application relationship. The program types are as follows:
        3.4.1.1. Type 1, Operating Hours. Also known as flying hours, is the number of hours an applica-
        tion has flown or is authorized to fly in a given quarter. This type of program applies to aircraft and
        drones. This does not include warm-up or taxi time.
        3.4.1.2. Type 2, Squadron Months. This is the average number of squadrons using the application
        each month.
        3.4.1.3. Type 3,Equipment Months. This is the average monthly inventory population of the appli-
        cation.
        3.4.1.4. Type 4, Program Depot Maintenance. This is the number of scheduled depot level over-
        hauls of an application. This type of program applies to aircraft, missiles and drones applications.
        3.4.1.5. Type 5, Sorties. This is the number of take-offs and landings. This type of program
        applies exclusively to aircraft.
        3.4.1.6. Type 6, Engine Overhauls. This is the number of scheduled depot level engine overhauls
        of an engine. This type of program applies exclusively to engines.
        3.4.1.7. Type 7, Drone Recoveries. This is the number of times that unmanned vehicles are suc-
        cessfully retrieved.
        3.4.1.8. Type 8, Ammunition Expenditures. The number of rounds expended or projected to be
        expended. This type of program primarily applies to gun applications.
        3.4.1.9. Type 9, Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) Overhauls. The numbers of
        higher assemblies that are scheduled to be inducted into depot level repair, or have undergone
        depot repair. This type of program applies to applications identified with a national stock number
        (NSN) or Program Element Code.
        3.4.1.10. D200F also receives and displays the following programs that are related to the active
        inventory of the end item. D200F uses these programs to determine the squadron months and
        inventory months programs cited above. D200A does not use these programs:
            3.4.1.10.1. Type E, unaveraged PAI.
            3.4.1.10.2. Type S, unaveraged total active inventory (TAI).
            3.4.1.10.3. Type T, averaged TAI.

       3.4.1.11. D200F also develops modification programs for SIRS. Chapter 4, Section 4.9 describes
       this process.

3.5. Data Sources.
   3.5.1. Generally, the source of program data depends on the program type and whether it is past or
   future program.

3.6. Projected Program Data.
   3.6.1. HQ USAF Program Authorizations. Most projected OIM and inventory programs enter the sys-
   tem through a data file received from HQ USAF. This file is issued approximately once every
   three-calendar quarters electronically and is input directly to D200F. The file includes up to nine years
   of peacetime program authorizations for each major command. D200F processes this file and derives
   the aggregate Air Force authorizations and the total authorizations for each fiscal year, and computes
   a retention authorization. The retention authorization is the total of the last three fiscal years of pro-
   jected program. Wartime program authorization for the aggregate Air Force must be manually file
   maintained into D200F.
   3.6.2. The Program Authority (PA) file provides data for D200F to develop Type 1 (flying hour),
   Type 2 (squadron month), and Type 5 (sortie) programs. The file does not explicitly list sorties as a
   program type. The file includes average sorties duration for each MDS. D200F divides the number of
   flying hours by the average sortie duration to derive the number of sorties. HQ USAF publishes pro-
   gram documents and updates the HQ USAF Program data base for up to four budget positions: the
   Program Objective Memorandum (POM), the Budget Estimate Submission (BES), the President’s
   Budget (PB) and, when applicable, the Amended President’s Budget (APB). After each mass update
   of the database, HQ USAF/XPP send the PA file to the HQ AFMC D200F OPR. The HQ AFMC OPR
   forwards the file to the surveillance programmer, who loads the file into the RMS API database. Per
   AFI 16-501,the MAJCOMS submit Program Change Requests (PCR) to HQ USAF to request force
   structure or flying hour changes within the execution and budget year(s). If the PCR is approved, HQ
   USAF/XOOT sends a message to the MAJCOMs and to HQ AFMC/LGY. The HQ AFMC API OPR
   manually enters the flying hour adjustments into the database under the appropriate command code.
   3.6.3. The PA file also includes data that D200F uses to develop several types of inventory program
   (see paragraph 3.4.). Of these, only Type 3 (inventory months) has any application in the require-
   ments determination process. D200F computes program Type 3 by calculating the quarterly average
   of the Type E program (unaveraged end of quarter inventory). Because the Type 3 program represents
   an average monthly program multiplied by three, it should always be divisible by 3.

3.7. Processing the PA File.
   3.7.1. Per a Memorandum of Agreement between HQ AFMC/LGY and HQ USAF/XPPE, the HQ
   AFMC API OPR receives the file immediately after it is produced in digital format, usually via an
   email attachment in a text file (.txt format). The HQ AFMC API OPR forwards the file to the D200F
   surveillance programmer in the AFMC Materiel Systems Group (MSG). The surveillance program-
   mer formats the file to allow the system to process the data and post them to the D200F database. The
   HQ AFMC API OPR may find it advisable to retain a copy of the file and store it off-line on a high
   capacity medium such as a Zip disk. This will allow review of the raw data should any questions arise
   about the data.
24                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     3.7.2. Table 3.1. is the record format for the PA file. For processing purposes the relevant data ele-
     ments are: the Aerospace Vehicle (AV) Indicator (MDS), the Data Type, the Cycle Indicator, the Com-
     mand Code, the Program Element, and program quantities in each position of the execution year and
     each following program year. See the D200F Functional Description, hierarchy 3.1.2.5 and related
     sub-hierarchies for a description of how D200F processes the PA file. D200F summarizes the program
     quantity in each Program Element to program type, to MAJCOM, and to MDS.
     3.7.3. The execution year fields have the quarterly program authorizations for the fiscal year (FY) in
     which the file is issued. If a PA file is issued around the start of a new FY (i.e., during the months of
     September or October) the HQ AFMC API OPR should review the raw data to insure that the execu-
     tion year is applied to the next full FY. For example, if a file is issued in October 2002, the execution
     year should be FY 2003 and not FY 2002. The HQ AFMC API OPR should contact HQ USAF/XOOT
     for clarification if there are any questions concerning the program projections.
     3.7.4. The D200C equipment subsystem develops Type 3 (inventory months) programs for equipment
     end items (SPD Type Q) and vehicles (SPD Type V) and makes them available to D200F. These pro-
     grams are based on projected assets in D200C, which projects on hand assets, excluding WRM and
     replacement assets, through 38 future quarters.
        3.7.4.1. D200C multiplies each quarterly program quantity by 3, therefore each quarterly program
        quantity in D200F should be divisible by 3. Questions regarding program data for a particular SPD
        should be addressed to the end article item manager.
        3.7.4.2. D200C also computes a retention quantity, which is the gross requirement, minus replace-
        ment requirements, at the last program position in D200C.
     3.7.5. A carryover indicator determines if program quantities will continue from one quarter to the
     next. The ALC Program OPR or HQ AFMC API OPR can assign the carryover indicator or the sys-
     tem assigns one to certain SPD types.
        3.7.5.1. The default value for the carryover indicator is P. This allows the system to replace the
        program quantity values when new data are received, primarily from a new PA file.
        3.7.5.2. A blank carryover indicator applies to programs that automatically carry over from one
        quarter to the next regardless of any updates. This applies to manually added programs, such as
        overfly authorizations that the HQ AFMC API OPR inputs.
        3.7.5.3. The system assigns carryover indicator “E” to support equipment (SPD Type Q) and vehi-
        cle (SPD Type V) end items. This allows the program to carryover on the two semi-annual update
        cycles in the D200C Equipment subsystem (March and September).

3.8. Past Program Data.
     3.8.1. The G099 Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) provides past flying
     program data in monthly increments, using data gathered at the unit level. The latest quarterly pro-
     gram is not always available from G099; often the last month’s data will be missing. In these cases
     D200F will estimate the programs for the months that have no data by dividing the program projection
     for that quarter by three. The updated data normally reach D200F by the next quarter and users will
     notice a change in program.
     3.8.2. Past DLM program data are derived from the maintenance systems’ reporting of actual repair
     or overhaul data through the Q302 AFMC Data Depot system. PDMSS/G097, the aircraft scheduling
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                              25


   system used at the depots, houses the aircraft data and aircraft PDM schedules which are provided to
   Q302, the data base for PDMSS. These aircraft PDM schedules are used by D200F to compute flying
   hour and inventory programs for Modifications. D363 Maintenance Planning & Execution System
   (MP&E) gives D200F mod schedules, which are used to compute flying hour and inventory programs
   for Mods.

3.9. ALC and Contractor Developed Programs.
   3.9.1. The ALCs input Type 4 Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) programs to reflect aircraft,
   trainer and missile overhaul schedules.
   3.9.2. ALC engine managers develop and enter the Type 6 Engine Overhaul programs.
   3.9.3. Type 9 MISTR programs are computed from recoverable and equipment item repair data that
   reside in the RMS database. The Secondary Item Requirement System (SIRS) process develops the
   MISTR program from the recoverable item repair output.
   3.9.4. Type 4, Type 6 and Type 9 data are received into D200F from an interface with D375 (CSWS).
   This is contractor-provided program data.

3.10. Program Maintenance.
   3.10.1. D200F provides profiles that allow selected users to add, change, or delete program data in the
   on-line system. Authorized system users can view program data, but only the HQ AFMC API OPR
   and ALC Programs Monitors have authority to change the data in the system. The ability for a certain
   user to file maintain program data is determined by the Ownership Code, which all users can view for
   a given SPD on the Standard Program Designator display screen (Navigation FOE DIS PRGM SPDL
   – see Chapter 9). The API Users Manual (UM) lists all users and their system capabilities in Attach-
   ment 2. The API UM is available at the following web site: https://www.msg.wpafb.af.mil/sxr/
   rdb.htm.
   3.10.2. Only the HQ AFMC API OPR can change program data with ownership code N. This is gen-
   erally the systems authorized inventory and operational programs in the PA file that passes from the
   Air Staff. The HQ AFMC API OPR will change program authorizations to reflect out-of-cycle adjust-
   ments for overfly or mission changes, but will not do so without specific authorization from HQ
   USAF/XOO.
   3.10.3. ALC Program Monitors can add, delete, and change program data generated at their respec-
   tive centers. The Ownership Codes match the single position ALC codes found in the catalog system
   (G – OO-ALC, H – OC-ALC, L – WR-ALC, P – SA-ALC CPSG). The ALC Program OPRs will
   manage locally generated Depot Level Maintenance programs. They will also control the application
   percents applicable to PEC to aircraft relationships that determine the aggregate flying hours and
   other program related to PECs.
   3.10.4. See the API Users Manual for instructions on using the file maintenance screens.

3.11. Command Codes.
   3.11.1. Although the D200A SIRS process uses only the aggregate service level program data, the PA
   file and G099 include data broken down to each major command’s authorization. Because of the
   needs of the Spares Requirements Review Board (SRRB), D200F also passes command level data to
26                                                                         AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     D200A. Users can view Command Level Data via the display screens or file maintenance screens.
     The following command codes appear in the files and on the screens:
     ABC - Out-of-cycle program changes entered by the HQ AFMC API OPR. Only the HQ AFMC API
     OPR can change program data that are derived from the PA file. The OPR changes these after HQ
     USAF/XOO specifically authorizes the change, usually to accommodate approved overfly requests.
     ACC - Air Combat Command
     AET - Aerospace Education and Training Command
     AFA - Air Force Academy
     AFE - United States Air Forces in Europe
     AFR - Air Force Reserve
     AMC - Air Mobility Command
     ANG - Air National Guard
     MTC - Air Force Materiel Command
     PAF - Pacific Air Forces
     SOC - Special Operations Command
     SPC - Air Force Space Command

3.12. Program Reports.
     3.12.1. The Output product function allows users to request the AFMC Program Report and to tailor
     the request to certain program types or SPDs. Reports are processed and generated through CA Dis-
     patch. Users can request global reports that include all program types for all SPDs, which show past
     and projected programs (WARNING: this is a very large report). Users can limit the size of the report
     by specifying certain parameters. For example they can request only past or projected program, SPDs
     of a certain type (e. g., all aircraft), a specific SPD (e. g., F15C), a MD (all series of F15), a mission (F
     for Fighters only), or only program types 1, 2, 3 and 5, which are the most commonly used OIM pro-
     grams. See the API Users Manual for instruction on submitting requests for output products. Chapter
     6 has descriptions of output products.
NOTE: CA Dispatch reports print according to how the ES’s printer is set up under the D200 User ID
profile.

3.13. Trend Analysis.
     3.13.1. The trend analysis feature allows users to view a history of program projections and program
     experience. It compares past projections with program data that actually occurred in each quarter, (e.
     g., the number of flying hours authorized in a previous quarter versus how many were actually flown
     during that quarter). Trend Analysis includes two screens:, “TAC - Current Proj To Past Proj” which
     displays projections for up to eight previous quarters as well as the most current quarter, and “TAP -
     Past Project To Past Actual” which compares the actual program data with what was projected.
     3.13.2. The TAC option provides a display of the current program projection in a comparison to the
     past projections.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                    27


  3.13.3. The TAC option displays two years of program data, starting in a quarter specified by the user,
  for the System Program Designator (SPD) and MAJCOM that the user enters. If the user does not
  specify a starting quarter the system defaults to the quarter that starts on the day after the last asset cut-
  off date. If the Asset Cutoff Date is 31 Dec 03, the starting quarter, specified in the line labeled
  “PGMS CAL YR/QTR,” is the quarter that ends on 31 Mar 2004. The line labeled “CUR” displays the
  current program projections from the user specified starting quarter (or the default). The line labeled
  “-1” is the program that was projected in the previous quarter, “-2” displays what was projected two
  quarters ago, etc.
  3.13.4. With the TAC option users can also view data that applies to specific major command by plac-
  ing an entry after “COMMAND.” See paragraph 3.11.1. for command codes. The user must specify
  a valid program type.
  3.13.5. The TAP option provides a display of the past program projections to the past actual program.
  It allows users to compare actual program activity of a given MDS with what was authorized.
  3.13.6. It displays the eight most recent quarters up to the end of the latest asset cut-off date In the line
  labeled “CUR” the screen displays eight quarters of past program. In the line labeled “-1” the screen
  displays seven quarters of past program (up to the asset cutoff date), plus one quarter of future pro-
  gram that was projected in that quarter. The line labeled “-2” displays six quarters of past program and
  two quarters of projected program. Each line displays one less quarter of past program and one more
  quarter of projected program than the line above it, until the line labeled “-7” displays only one quarter
  of past program and seven quarters of projected program. Finally, the line labeled “-8” displays eight
  quarters of projected program. The projected quarters are highlighted so users can distinguish between
  past and projected programs on any line.

                                               Chapter 4

                                           APPLICATIONS

4.1. Description.
   4.1.1. The applications portion of D200F is where programs are distributed to secondary components.
   The information in the applications portion defines the relationship between components and the
   higher assemblies that generate programs. Program data are directly assigned to each application and
   the application relationships identify the components that will potentially be assigned program from
   those applications. Data elements peculiar to each application determine how much of the program to
   assign to each component.
   4.1.2. A Standard Program Designator (SPD) is an end item or assembly that generates programs. A
   SPD may also be referred to as an “application program designator” or a “standard reporting designa-
   tor.” An SPD becomes an “application” when one or more components have been selected to receive
   program data from that SPD. Table 4.2 at the end of this chapter lists the types of SPDs used in RMS
   and their formats. An SPD can be up to 25 characters long. A standard designator or an aircraft or mis-
   sile MDS can be part of the 25-character SPD.
   4.1.3. IAW AFMCMAN 23-1 Chapter 18, paragraph 18.4, Requirements For Secondary Items
   (D200A, D200N) the Equipment Specialist file maintains all needed applications into API for each
   D200A SIRS item. SIRS items should have at least one application file maintained to identify the
   "major end item", the weapon system, support system, communication-electronic network or equip-
   ment that the item is used on. In addition, each SIRS item should be linked by its program selection
   record in API, to all applications (major end items and next higher assemblies) that require the use of
   this component for continued operation. The ES file maintains each item's Program Selection record
   containing each application with the Program Select Code, mission item essentiality code, the appli-
   cation's program begin date(s), quantity per application(s) and application percent(s). Application per-
   cents include Engine percents.
       4.1.3.1. Engine percents are supplied to the HQ AFMC API OPR from OC-ALC/LPRI and are
       then tasked to the ALC API OPR and ALC ES OPR to have the System ESs file maintain the data
       into the API system under the PS Screen.

4.2. D200F SPD Table. D200F maintains a table of valid SPDs. The SPDs in this table are sorted by
broad categories known as SPD Types. Table 4.2 lists the SPD types and their formats.
   4.2.1. D200F maintains an on-line list of SPDs to which users can assign program on the SPD Table.
   Users can add, delete, or change SPD data by updating the SPD Table in the on-line system (naviga-
   tion FOE FM PRGM SPD). ALC Program Monitors with ownership codes that match the ALC code
   and the HQ AFMC API OPR can update records.
       4.2.1.1. The following paragraphs contain essential information on some SPD Types:
          4.2.1.1.1. An aircraft , drone, or missile MDS (SPD Type A, R or M) is seven characters long
          and includes the following components:
              4.2.1.1.1.1. Mission indicator for aircraft and drones in position 3. Type for missiles in
              position 3. This is always alphabetic.
32                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


                4.2.1.1.1.2. Series indicator in positions 4 through 6. This is always numeric.
                4.2.1.1.1.3. Series indicator in position 7. This is always alphabetic.
                4.2.1.1.1.4. Modified mission for aircraft and drones in position 2. Mission indicator for
                missiles in position 2. This is always alphabetic.
                4.2.1.1.1.5. Status prefix for aircraft in position 1. Launch environment for drones and
                missiles in position 1. This is always alphabetic.
            4.2.1.1.2. D200F automatically adds Type Q (support equipment) and Type V (vehicle) to the
            SPD Table based on information received from the D200E subsystem.
            4.2.1.1.3. If the ERRC code in D200E is “S” or “U,” D200F adds the SPD NSN to the SPD
            Table with SPD Type Q (support equipment) except when budget code is “V”.
            4.2.1.1.4. If the ERRC code in D200E is “S” or “U,” and the budget code is “V,” D200F adds
            the SPD NSN to the SPD Table with SPD Type V (vehicle).
            4.2.1.1.5. A standard designator has 12 positions and can accommodate MDSs, TMSs
            (engines), guns, Communications Electronic (CE) Network designators, trainer systems, and
            Communication/Electronic/Meteorological (CEM) system designators. A standard designator
            is one type of SPD.
            4.2.1.1.6. The 25-position SPD format accommodates all SPD and MDS applications with
            notations indicating FMS customers, obsolescence, or reclamation uses. It also accommodates
            modification SPDs (see Table 4.1.). The modification indicator (R or I) is in position 13, and
            the modification serial number is in positions 14 through 25.

4.3. Equipment Specialist Application Responsibilities.
     4.3.1. The ES insures that indentures and the application programs are complete and accurate.

4.4. Program Selection.
     4.4.1. Program selection is the process that assigns program data from an application to a component.
     D200F’s program selection feature allows automated and manual linkage of components to their
     applications. Each component must have at least one application in order to compute requirements.
     An application passes Operational and Maintenance Programs to a component, either directly or
     through one or more intermediate links in the program selection chain.

4.5. Indentures and Linkage Data.
     4.5.1. If no application linkage data exists, D200F assigns programs from applications to components
     through the indenture structure, and modifies the program data by applying certain linkage data that
     define the relationship of each component with its higher assembly. The linkage data elements are:
     quantity per assembly (QPA), application percent (APPL%), and the maintenance replacement per-
     cent (REPL%). Figure 4.1. is an illustration of a notional indenture chain that includes a component,
     Card A, and its next higher assembly, the radio transmitter that are common to the F15C and the F16A
     aircraft.
        4.5.1.1. Quantity per Application (QPAPPL) should not be confused with Quantity per Assembly
        (QPA). QPA is the number of components that are installed in that component’s next higher
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                33


      assembly in the indenture structure. QPAPPL is the number of components that are installed in a
      higher assembly that is also the component’s application (note that the application and the next
      higher assembly may or may not be the same assembly). If this QPAPPL is developed from the
      physical relationships found in the indenture structure, it is known as a derived QPAPPL. The
      example in Figure 4.2. has an aircraft application with components, Card A and Card B, on the
      second level of indenture below the aircraft end item. The system computes the derived QPAPPL
      for the two cards by multiplying the QPA of the card to the computer by the QPA of the computer
      to the F15C. The QPA for Card A to the computer is 1, for Card B to the computer is 2. The QPA
      for the computer to the F15C is 2. Therefore, the derived QPAPPL is 2 for Card A (1 X 2) and 4
      for Card B (2 X 2).
      4.5.1.2. The equipment specialist can change the QPAPPL in D200F’s Program Selection func-
      tion. If the ES overrides the derived QPAPPL value, D200F displays the changed value as the
      “Override QPAPPL.”
   4.5.2. The system will not allow deletion of a SPD that has any program data. Users must delete the
   program quantities on the past program screen (navigation FOE FM PRGM FPAP), the peacetime
   future program screen (FOE FM PRGM FPRP), or the projected wartime program screen (FOE FM
   PRGM FFWD) before deleting a SPD.
   4.5.3. Many indenture relationships in D200F are established as the result of an interface. If the inter-
   face does not supply an application percent or a QPA, D200F establishes both the QPA and Applica-
   tion percent on the indenture relationship with zero as the default. When deriving an application
   percent, 100 percent is substituted for an application percent of zero on the indenture. Likewise, when
   deriving a QPAPPL from the indenture relationships, a QPA of 1 is substituted for a QPA of zero on
   the indenture.
   4.5.4. A source reference code (SRC) indicates how the value of the field was acquired. This code is
   applicable to the system essentiality code for the application, the subsystem essentiality code, and the
   item essentiality code that are a part of the application relationship. The SRC codes used for these 3
   fields and their definitions are:
      4.5.4.1. A – “Actual;” received from a system interface.
      4.5.4.2. C – “Computed;” derived from reporting from a maintenance activity.
      4.5.4.3. E – “Estimated” or “entered;” derived through ES manual update.
      4.5.4.4. S – “Standard;” default value.

4.6. Application Percent.
   4.6.1. The Application Percent (APPL%) is the percentage of the population of higher assemblies that
   has a given component installed in it. The system assigns a default value of 100% to each compo-
   nent-application relationship, (i.e., the D200F assumes that the component is installed in 100% of its
   next higher assembly’s population). The equipment specialist can change the APPL% in D200F’s Pro-
   gram Selection function. The most common reason to change APPL% is to reflect a modification pro-
   gram’s installation and removal schedule.
   4.6.2. If the ES changes the default value, D200F displays the changed value as the “Override Appli-
   cation Percent.”
34                                                                     AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


4.7. Replacement Percent.
     4.7.1. The Replacement Percent (REPL%) applies to items that receive depot level maintenance pro-
     grams from an application. It indicates the percentage of components installed in the application that
     are removed and replaced as the application undergoes overhaul or repair. D200F computes the
     replacement percent according to the consumption and production history the maintenance systems
     report. The replacement percent is the number of components removed from a higher assembly during
     overhaul, divided by the number of components installed in those assemblies while they undergo
     overhaul.
     4.7.2. D200F computes a “Derived Replacement Percent,” which is the replacement percent that is
     part of the relationship between the component and the application. The derived replacement percent
     considers all levels of indenture between the component and the application.
     4.7.3. The percentage of the population of a component’s NHA that has the component installed is
     displayed as the “Indenture Replacement Percent.” If the NHA and the application are the same
     assembly, the indenture replacement percent and the derived replacement percent are equal.
     4.7.4. The ES can estimate the replacement percent and enter it into the system as an “Override
     Replacement Percent.” Override replacement percents can only be assigned to components with
     ERRC N, P, C or T. An override replacement percent will influence the component requirements dis-
     played on the Materiel Requirements List and the Purchase Request Support List (see Chapter 5).

4.8. Program Distribution.
     4.8.1. D200F distributes program from the SPD to components through a series of calculations that
     consider the program quantity, the APPL%, and the QPAPPL. The notional examples in Figure 4.3.
     and Figure 4.4 illustrate the program distribution process.
     4.8.2. The two aircraft applications in Figure 4.3., as SPD applications, receive program authoriza-
     tion from HQ USAF in the PA file. That program will flow through the radio transmitter to Card A.
     The program that applies to Card A may not match the program that applies to the aircraft. That is
     because D200F will consider the QPA and the APPL% for Card A and for the transmitter and calcu-
     late the program for both components. Figure 4.2. illustrates how the program is distributed to the
     component.
        4.8.2.1. Using the data in Figure 4.3. the system can calculate the total item program for use in the
        D200A SIRS requirements computation.
        4.8.2.2. The quarterly flying hour program is 500 for the F15C and 700 for the F16A. Card A
        (lower right corner) has a QPA of 2 for the Card A to Radio Transmitter relationship; and a QPA
        of 1 for the Radio Transmitter to F15C relationship and for the Radio Transmitter to F16A rela-
        tionship. The QPAPPL for Card A to the F15C is 2 and the QPAPPL for Card A to the F16A is 2.
        Card A has an APPL % of 90. The system computes an item application program for Card A to
        F15C of 500 x 0.90 x 2 = 900. The system also computes an item application program for Card A
        to F16A of 700 x 0.90 x 2 = 1260. The system adds the two item application programs for Card A
        of 900 + 1260 to obtain an item program for Card A of 2160.

Figure 4.1. Distribution of Operational Program.




   4.8.3. The equipment specialist completes the program selection tasks using the Program Selection
   screen in the online system. Currently this is a “bottom up” process in which the ES responsible for a
   component specifies which SPD will pass program to components of that SPD, and how much.
   4.8.4. A significant change from the former D041 program selection process is the two-position
   application program select code (PSC), rather than the four-position code in D041. Since an SPD can
   have only one OIM and one overhaul program, only two positions are necessary. Each position corre-
36                                                                             AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     sponds to the program types described above. Note that the four-position code is still displayed on the
     display screens for the program selection relationships.
     4.8.5. All users can view program selection data through the display function. The SPD program
     selection screen (navigation FOE DIS AI PDPS) displays all components of an SPD that the user has
     entered. The component program selection screen (navigation FOE DIS AI CPS) is the “bottom up”
     version of program selection; it displays all SPD applications of a given component.

4.9. Programs Tailored to Modification Schedules.
     4.9.1. When a component is installed during modification, its requirements must correspond with the
     anticipated program increase. If the component being installed replaces another component, the com-
     ponent being replaced must have a corresponding decreasing program to phase out its requirements.
     D200F determines the application percent that will apply to all components’ scheduled removal from
     and installation in an end item during the modification computation process. Those application per-
     cents are neither stored in D200F nor passed to D200A. The system computes percents in quarterly
     increments for up to 8 past quarters and up to 38 future quarters.
     4.9.2. Modification schedules for Class IV and V aircraft and missile modifications automatically
     pass to D200F from the D363 system. D200F uses these modification schedules and the application
     percents it derives from the aircraft and missile program data to develop modification programs for
     flying hours (program type 1) and inventory (program type 3). These modification programs are
     applied to the D200F tables and passed to D200A.
     4.9.3. Modification standard program designators (SPD) include the end item identification in normal
     format (Table 4.1.), a suffix indicator in position 13, and a modification serial number in positions 14
     through 25. The modification serial number is the same in both modification SPDs, but the suffix indi-
     cators are different. Suffix “R” applies to the Removal Program and suffix “I” applies to the Installa-
     tion Program. Modification Programs appear in D200F as SPD Type Z. Following is an example of
     the modification SPDs for a single modification program:

Table 4.1. Modification SPD Format.
                  MDS                         SUFFIX                 SERIAL NO.
Position          1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22

Remove                    A 0 1 0 A                                  R    F 1 0 3 3 6 A
Install                   A 0 1 0 A                                  I    F 1 0 3 3 6 A

     4.9.4. Each program involves time phasing, a decreasing or an increasing program, in each quarter of
     the modification period. The installation program projects an installation of the new item into the SPD
     and the removal program projects removals of the old item from the SPD. Each increase should
     accompany a corresponding decrease and the total program application percents of the two SPDs in
     any given quarter should be 100. Figure 4.5 illustrates distribution of the application percents over the
     modification period.

4.10. Mission Item Essentiality Code (MIEC).
   4.10.1. The MIEC is a three-position alphanumeric code that indicates an item’s relative importance
   to weapon system support. The first position is the System Essentiality Code (SEC), the second posi-
   tion is the Sub-System Essentiality Code (SSEC), and the third position is the Item Essentiality Code
   (IEC). The MIEC has limited application in RMS processes. Its original intent was to help allocate
   resources by weapon system, and to establish funding and repair priorities. The following paragraphs
   explain the values for each position and their meanings.
   4.10.2. HQ USAF assigns the SEC. The valid values and their meanings are:
      4.10.2.1. SECs 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicate applications that may have more than a peacetime operating
      program. SEC 4 can also apply to new applications and to applications that cannot be related to
      aircraft
      4.10.2.2. SEC = 5 for applications that only have a peacetime operating program.
      4.10.2.3. SEC = 6 for applications being phased out of the Air Force inventory and applications
      being held for reclamation projects.
      4.10.2.4. SEC = 7 for FMS only applications.
38                                                                    AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


        4.10.2.5. MIEC 7MM indicates FMS usage at the application level. It applies to applications with
        a FMS country code in positions 14 and 15 in the SPD field.
        4.10.2.6. MIEC 7PP applies to applications identified by a stock number or a program element
        code (PEC). It is the item MIEC for components that have stock number and PEC applications
        only.
        4.10.2.7. MIEC 7ZZ applies to new components entering the inventory.
        4.10.2.8. SEC = 8 applied to certain non-airborne system applications in the former D062 system
        that are subsystems of other applications.
        4.10.2.9. MIEC 8CC refers to communications-electronics meteorological (CEM) applications. A
        new CEM application can apply only to a standard C-E network or MDS.
        4.10.2.10. MIEC 8DD refers to engine modules. An engine module application can apply only to
        a standard type-model-series (TMS).
        4.10.2.11. MIEC 8GG refers to guns. A gun application can only apply to a standard MDS.
        4.10.2.12. MIEC 8SS refers to electronic subsystems systems. A system application can apply
        only to a standard C-E network or MDS application.
     4.10.3. The second position is the Subsystem Essentiality Code (SSEC), and indicates the relative
     importance of the subsystem immediately indentured to the end item. The ES assigns the SEC. The
     valid values and their meanings are:
        4.10.3.1. A - Not Mission Capable; lack of subsystem prevents the system from performing any
        wartime or peacetime mission. Whole engines, as subsystems, are assigned SSEC A.
        4.10.3.2. B - Not Wartime Mission Capable; lack of subsystem impairs the performance of war-
        time and assigned missions.
        4.10.3.3. C -Not Fully Mission Capable; lack of subsystem impairs the performance of wartime
        and assigned missions, but the system can perform at least 1 assigned mission.
        4.10.3.4. D - Not Peacetime or Training Capable; lack of subsystem prevents the system from per-
        forming its peacetime/training mission.
     4.10.4. The third position of the MIEC is the item essentiality code (IEC) and indicates the compo-
     nent's importance to the subsystem. The ES file maintains this position for the item. The valid codes
     and their meanings are:
        4.10.4.1. E - critical for operation.
        4.10.4.2. F - impairs operation.
        4.10.4.3. G - not critical for operation.
        4.10.4.4. M – FMS; can only be used with SEC 7 and SSEC M.
     4.10.5. Each application has an MIEC that D200F derives from the indenture relationships and/or
     program selection relationships. The following paragraphs explain the derivation processes.
        4.10.5.1. D200F maintains a MIEC Priority Table that lists and establishes priorities for all MIEC
        combination. Only the HQ AFMC API OPR can change this table. See Table 4.3. for MIEC prior-
        ities.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                            39


     4.10.5.2. In its simplest form the component MIEC has the same SEC as its application and the
     same SSEC as its next higher assembly. Many components have several applications and some
     components are present in several indenture chains under the same end item. In these cases D200F
     builds an application MIEC for each application by deriving the highest priority MIEC from
     among the components in the program selection records and assigning it to the application.
     4.10.5.3. Figure 4.3. is a notional example of a component, “Card A,” that has two applications,
     the F16A and the F15C. It also has three NHAs, the radio transmitter, and the fire control and the
     computer. These NHAs have respective SSECs C, B, and A. Card A has IEC of either F or E
     depending on the NHA, and four indenture chains up to the applications and therefore can have up
     to four MIECs (one for each chain).
     4.10.5.4. Based on the assigned SECs, SSECs, and IECs, Card A as a component has, depending
     on its NHA and application, one of four MIECs: 2AF, 2CE, 2BF, and 3AF. Among these, the high-
     est priority MIEC on the MIEC Priority Table in Table 4.3. is MIEC 2CE (priority 6).
     4.10.5.5. The applications retain their SEC (2 and 3) but derive the SSEC -IEC combination from
     the highest ranked MIEC in the chain between the application and the component. The MIEC for
     the F16A Application is 2CE, based on the highest MIEC among those developed on three inden-
     ture chains between Card A and the application. The MIEC for the F15C application is 3AF, based
     on only one indenture chain between the component and the application.
     4.10.5.6. Some applications do not have SECs -- recoverable items identified by NIIN, for exam-
     ple. The SECs for these applications are the same as the highest SEC of the end item on which the
     application is installed.
     4.10.5.7. The ES can change the application MIEC on the Program Selection screen in the on-line
     system. However, if the SEC or the SSEC were derived, D200F will not allow them to change. If
     the SEC and SSEC are not blank, the IEC cannot be blank.
     4.10.5.8. If a user changes an application SEC or a NHA SSEC, and the change increases its pri-
     ority above the item MIEC, the Item MIEC increases to the new value. For example, a user
     changes a SEC from 3 to 2 and a component’s MIEC is 3BF, the component MIEC changes to
     2BF.
     4.10.5.9. If the application is an SPD used only by FMS customers, SEC 7 applies and the appli-
     cation MIEC is 7MM. These SPDs have a country code in positions 14 and 15 or “FMS” in posi-
     tions 14 through 16.
     4.10.5.10. D200F considers only valid MIEC codes when deriving application MIECs. The codes
     must have the valid values described above in each position, and all three positions must be filled
     (no blanks).

4.11. Program Application.
     4.11.1. Each application record includes at least the following elements:
        4.11.1.1. The Standard Program Designator.
        4.11.1.2. The Program Select Code (PSC). The PSC is a two-position numeric code assigned to
        each component that is expected to be removed from a higher assembly and replaced. A compo-
        nent can be assigned OIM and DLM programs at the same time.
            4.11.1.2.1. The first position identifies the organizational intermediate maintenance (OIM)
            program. The OIM program indicates activities performed by the user of the end item. Aircraft
            operating (flying) hours are the most frequently used programs. Other OIM programs are
            squadron months, equipment months, and sorties. Only one OIM program can apply to a com-
            ponent.
            4.11.1.2.2. The second position identifies the depot level maintenance (DLM) program. The
            DLM program indicates the number of times a component’s higher assembly – either an
            engine, an aircraft, equipment, or higher level component – will undergo overhaul or depot
            level repair, during which the component is subject to removal and replacement. DLM pro-
            grams include aircraft programmed depot maintenance (PDM), engine overhauls (EOH), and
            higher assembly repair. Higher assembly repair is commonly referred to as “Management of
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                            41


         Items Subject to Repair (MISTR).” A component can carry different DLM programs on differ-
         ent applications.
     4.11.1.3. The PSC allows the ES to select programs applicable to a particular relationship. The
     PSC must be consistent with a SPD Type code. For example, equipment SPDs normally should
     not select flying hours as their OIM program or aircraft PDM as their DLM program. This field
     must be accurate for the system to select the correct application program. If the ES does not enter
     the proper PSC, the system may develop too much or too little program.
     4.11.1.4. D200F builds an Item Program Select Code for each component in the program select
     records for use on the Program Select display screens only. The item PSC is derived from the
     PSCs assigned to all of a component’s applications. The item PSC is a four-position field.
         4.11.1.4.1. The first position indicates the OIM program and corresponds to the program type
         code (see Chapter 3, paragraph 3.3.)
         4.11.1.4.2. Positions two through four identify the depot level maintenance program to apply
         to the component. “X” in any of these positions indicates the type of DLM program the com-
         ponent receives from its applications. The second position identifies program depot mainte-
         nance (PDM) program, the third position identifies engine overhaul program, and the fourth
         position identifies Management of Item Subject to Repair (MISTR) program.
     4.11.1.5. The Program Begin Date (PBD). This is a calendar quarter expressed in YYYY/MM
     format, and is assigned to each application. The PBD is the starting point for computing an Item
     Program from the Application Program identified by the SPD and the Program Select Code. This
     field should always reflect the quarter when the component was first installed in the application
     SPD.
     4.11.1.6. Some SPDs are not end items or assemblies in themselves and therefore do not have
     indenture relationships. Examples are program element codes (PECs), which involve unique com-
     binations of several end items, Modification Designators, and FMS Designators. Because no link-
     age data can be derived from indenture relationships, the ES must assign an Override Application
     Percent and an Override Quantity Per Application (QPAPPL) to these applications.
  4.11.2. Application Record.
     4.11.2.1. The Application record includes a component and its application (SPD), the OIM and
     DLM application programs, the MIEC, and any time-phased linkage data needed to determine
     component programs.
     4.11.2.2. Standard Program Designator (SPD).
         4.11.2.2.1. The SPD specifically identifies any assembly that requires spare part support for
         continued operation. This can include an aircraft or missile MDS, an engine, a vehicle, a piece
         of equipment, a trainer, a program element code, or a modification designator. An SPD can be
         a component of another SPD. For example, an aircraft MDS can be a higher assembly of an
         engine TMS. The program selection table must reflect this relationship.
         4.11.2.2.2. Each SPD is assigned a code (SPD Type Code) that identifies the type of SPD. For
         SPD type codes See Table 4.2..
     4.11.2.3. The Program Development code (PDC).
42                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


            4.11.2.3.1. The PDC defaults to a blank. With justification and documentation, the ES may
            insert values of "P" or "F." “P” allows only past programs to pass to SIRS, and “F” allows only
            future programs to pass to SIRS.
     4.11.3. Auxiliary Power Unit Factor (APU).
        4.11.3.1. APUs are special purpose engines used to start aircraft engines, ground electrical units,
        or pneumatic power units. The APU factor is a percentage used if the component is part of an
        engine TMS with SPD type "X". D200F uses the APU factor to adjust the application program
        according to a ratio of APU operating hours to the TMS or MDS operating hours. The default
        value is 100%.
     4.11.4. Time Phased Date.
        4.11.4.1. D200F uses a Time Phased Date to identify the phases in a modification program. This
        element is expressed as a future calendar quarter in YYMM format. The most common use for the
        time-phased date is when performing program selection for the engine computation or the item
        program computation for the D200A Snapshot process.

4.12. Application Guidelines.
     4.12.1. Consider the following rules when establishing or maintaining application and program selec-
     tion records:
        4.12.1.1. Each program selection record must include, at a minimum, a program select code and a
        program begin date.
        4.12.1.2. A component must be indentured to an SPD to select program from that SPD. However,
        the component need not be in next lower level of indenture. In the example in Figure 4.3. any of
        the five components can receive flying hour program from the SPDs even though they are two lev-
        els of indenture below them and they are immediately indentured to the radio transmitter.
        4.12.1.3. The program must be consistent with the application. For example, an engine TMS can-
        not generate PDM program, nor can a piece of support equipment generate flying hour program.
        Secondary items should not be assigned operational programs. D200F includes an internal table of
        valid programs that apply to each SPD type. The HQ AFMC API OPR maintains this table.
        4.12.1.4. Consider the type of activity that best suits the component. For example, brakes and
        struts may have aircraft applications, but flying hours usually are not their most suitable programs.
        Since the take-offs and landings create the stress on these components and cause them to fail, sor-
        ties would be a more logical program.
        4.12.1.5. “00” is a valid program select code. This PSC can identify a reference SPD, one that
        indicates an end item or system that a component supports but does not include the component in
        its indenture. An example is a circuit card in the computer test station of the F15 Avionics Inter-
        mediate Shop. The circuit card is an indentured component of the test station, which supports
        maintenance of the F15 aircraft. The ES may choose to create application record for any or all
        series of the F15, with the circuit card as the component and the aircraft and the test stations as
        applications. The PSC for the aircraft is 00 since it is entered only as information. The test station
        passes operational program, probably inventory months, to the circuit card.

                       DEVELOPMENT OF DATA FOR D200A PROCESSING

5.1. General.
     5.1.1. D200F prepares data each calendar quarter to support each of the D200A Secondary Item
     Requirement System (SIRS) computations. SIRS needs data from the program tables and program
     selection relationships to be frozen to insure consistent data throughout each computation cycle. This
     requires D200F to extract program selection data, to compute Item Program and Item Application
     data, and to store the data on the Requirements Management System (RMS) database for SIRS to use.
     D200F processes a snapshot for each recoverable computation cycle: initial, final, and summary.
     5.1.2. RMS retains only the last cycle processed in each quarter, and that is normally the summary
     cycle. SIRS archives and retains eight quarters of history of the data developed for the snapshot.
     5.1.3. D200F builds Snapshot tables for D200A before the initial, final , and summary computation
     cycles. These Snapshot tables include the Application Program table (containing MDS flying hour
     and inventory program data), Recoverable Program Select table (containing Program Select data from
     D200F tables plus converted Program Select data), Item Application Factor table (containing Over-
     ride Time Phased data from D200F plus converted Override Time Phased data), Item Application Pro-
     gram data (containing program data for each Recoverable item to its application), and Item Program
     data (contains program data for each Recoverable item across all its applications). D200F computes
     the programs according to the methodology described in Chapter 4. The system builds the applica-
     tion tables after processing end-of-quarter stock list changes in order to coincide with the D200E
     snapshot. Users can view the item program data on the SIRS item program data screen (navigation
     FOE DIS RCVS SND IPD – see Chapter 9). D200F prepares the SIRS snapshot by computing the
     following sets of data in sequence:
        5.1.3.1. Mission-Design-Series (MDS) future peace program.
        5.1.3.2. MDS war program.
        5.1.3.3. Item program select and application data.
        5.1.3.4. Time phased factors.
        5.1.3.5. Item application programs.
        5.1.3.6. SPD conversion for the Aircraft Availability Model (AAM).
        5.1.3.7. Item programs.

5.2. MDS Future Program.
     5.2.1. D200F extracts projected flying hour (Type 1) and primary inventory months (Type 3) data for
     aircraft MDSs from the program data (See Chapter3).
     5.2.2. The system selects records with Standard Program Designator Type ‘A’ and Standard Program
     Designator Subtype blank. This selection includes aircraft in the active Air Force inventory, but
     excludes FMS aircraft, reclamation aircraft, and aircraft modification Programs.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                47


   5.2.3. D200F converts primary inventory months to average primary active inventory (Type A) pro-
   grams by dividing the Type 3 program by three within each projected quarter (Avg PAI = Inventory
   Mos/3).
   5.2.4. If the Program Development Code on the program select record is blank or F the system builds
   and maintains thirty-eight quarters of future peace program, beginning with the current Program Cal-
   endar Quarter. The Program Calendar Year Quarter is the first quarter of projected program and
   changes with each SIRS computation cycle. The Program Calendar Year Quarter is expressed in the
   YYYY/MM (where MM can contain ‘03’, ‘06’, ‘09’, or ‘12’ only) format and is the last month of the
   calendar quarter that begins on the day after the SIRS asset cut off date.
   5.2.5. D200F maintains program data internally by calendar year. For the SIRS snapshot, D200F con-
   verts the data to Fiscal Year, Fiscal Year Quarter, and Position Indicator. The position indicator is a
   number between 1 and 39 that indicates where a particular quarter falls among the 38 quarters of pro-
   gram projection. The indicator for the first quarter, the quarter indicated by the Program Calendar
   Year Quarter, varies from 1 to 4 depending on the calendar quarter. D200F shifts the Program Data
   before the Initial API Snapshot each quarter.
   5.2.6. The retention quantity is the sum of the last three years of program data and is the 39th Position
   Indicator. D200F appends the retention quantity at the end of the program data. The retention quantity
   is visible only at the service (aggregate) level. Screens that display command level data do not display
   a retention quantity.

5.3. MDS War Program.
   5.3.1. Each war program record has Program Indicator ‘W’. If the Program Development Code on the
   program select record is blank or W, the system builds war data for SIRS. Although D200F has 60
   months of war program, only the 12 months that correspond to the extended year in SIRS are
   extracted for the AAM MDS data.
   5.3.2. D200F maintains program records by calendar year. The war months apply to the extended year
   (EY) in the D200N Recoverable Item Stratification. The EY is determined by the Program Calendar
   Quarter (see paragraph 5.2.4.) as explained in the examples below.
      5.3.2.1. If the Program Calendar Quarter is September 2000 or December 2000, the AY is FY
      2001, the Budget year is FY 2002, and the EY is FY 2003. The war program applies to FY 2003.
      5.3.2.2. If the Program Calendar Quarter is March 2001 or 30 Jun 2001, the Current Year is fiscal
      year (FY) 2001, the apportionment year is FY 2002, the Budget year is FY 2003, and the EY is FY
      2004. The war program applies to FY 2004.
   5.3.3. Only flying hours (Program Type “1") and primary inventory months (Program Type ‘3)’ are
   extracted for the MDS war program. The inventory months convert to averaged primary inventory
   (Program Type ‘A’). Only service level programs for Air Force (SVC CD ‘A’) are used, (i.e., the pro-
   grams do not break down to the command level). The service level programs have blank Command
   Codes.
   5.3.4. The war program records contain Program Indicator ‘W’ and apply to applications with Stan-
   dard Program Designator Type ‘A’ and blank in the Standard Program Designator Subtype field.

5.4. Aircraft Availability Model (AAM).
48                                                                     AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     5.4.1. The AAM in SIRS requires recoverable components to relate to aircraft mission-design-series
     (MDS) applications. Many components are part of aircraft end items but have SPD applications that
     are expressed as engines type-model-series (TMS), program element codes (PECs), or other SPD
     types. D200F converts Standard Program Designators that are TMSs or PECs to aircraft MDS appli-
     cations based on relationships that exist in the D200F Program Select table. If a PEC is not related to
     an aircraft on the Program Select table, no further attempt at creating a converted record takes place.
     D200F converts Standard Program Designators that are not in MDS configuration and TMSs that are
     not related to aircraft MDS via a Program Select relationship to MDSs using a SPD to MDS table. The
     HQ AFMC API OPR maintains this table. All users can view it through the on-line display feature.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                 49

                                               OUTPUTS

6.1. Scope.
   6.1.1. D200F includes three categories of output products: user requested (“pull”), system generated
   (“push”), and batch processes that create file for processing by other RMS processes. Users can view
   push and pull products through CA DISPATCH, and can request paper copies by executing the print-
   ing process.

6.2. CA Dispatch.
   6.2.1. System generated reports are available in CA Dispatch for three calendar days. This system
   assigns a job number to each report using the user's next job number sequence. Users can check the
   status of reports they requested through the On-Line Viewing screen. Enter “SYSDATA” after
   “REPORT NAME:”, and “DBP***” after “JOB NUMBER:”, where “***” is the last three digits of
   the User ID. For example if the User ID is “JONESABC” the Job Number is “DBPABC.” The screen
   displays all job numbers and places the cursor at the user's lowest job number that corresponds to a
   User ID.
   6.2.2. A recent change to the RMS system allows users the option to specify reports to be sent to a
   network printer or to CA Dispatch. Whether or not the pull or push products will go to CA Dispatch
   again depends on how the ESs have their printer set up in D200. If their printer is set to a particular
   printer, then the products will automatically print on that printer. If they have it set to DISP, then the
   products will go to CA Dispatch. This is why it important for ESs to watch what they print and make
   sure they have the printer set to DISP if they are going to request a product that could potentially be
   very large.
   6.2.3. In order to change the printer setting select: MAIN, UDV, FM, UVFK. Enter DISP for CA Dis-
   patch or a Printer ID for a particular printer and press Enter key. The message “Update Successful”
   should appear, indicating this change was successful.

6.3. Management Products.
   6.3.1. Management products are system generated (push) reports that help control and track applica-
   tion, programs, and indenture information. The reports include management control products and
   products associated with production management data. For more specific information on the follow-
   ing products, see the API Users Manual.
   6.3.2. Copy Add Quarterly Report (AD200.F11FQ8A4). This report is updated quarterly and is avail-
   able to the ALC Indenture Monitor through CA Dispatch. It notifies the ALC indenture monitor of
   NHAs that had indentures established using the “Copy/Add” feature but the ES has not assigned
   review dates to them.
   6.3.3. Indentures Establishment (AD200.FG0FM8A0). This report is updated monthly and is pushed
   to the ALC Indenture Monitor and HQ AFMC API OPR through CA Dispatch. It reports and summa-
   rizes selected NHA characteristics within each ALC pseudo-division. Pseudo division is a one-posi-
   tion element that identifies an organization within an ALC. The data pulled for this report is taken
   from the NHA and Indenture tables in D200F. ALC management assigns this code.
50                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     6.3.4. Indentures Establishment - AFMC Summary (AD200.FG0FM8AA). This report is updated
     monthly and is pushed to the HQ AFMC API OPR through CA Dispatch. It is a summary of the afore-
     mentioned Indentures Establishment report.
     6.3.5. Selected Items for Review - Summary (AD200.FS1FQ8D3). This report is automatically pro-
     duced after the quarterly file from the repair management system is processed. It is available to the
     HQ AFMC API OPR and ALC Indenture Monitor through CA Dispatch. It summarizes assemblies in
     each ALC Division that have not been reviewed over the past twelve months.
     6.3.6. NHA Management Report (AD200.FI0FW8A2). This report is produced weekly and available
     through CA Dispatch to the HQ AFMC Indenture OPR and ALC Indenture Monitor. It lists transac-
     tion activity at each ALC, describing user activity in maintaining physical relationship data.
     6.3.7. D220 Error Report (AD200.FK0FA8C0). D200F produces this report after it processes the
     D220 interface and makes it available to the Equipment Specialist (ES) through CA Dispatch. This
     report identifies inconsistencies within the D220 input. D200F rejects the entire file if the data rejec-
     tion percent set by the RMS Administration and Support subsystem is exceeded. The ES must review
     this report and correct any discrepancies.
     6.3.8. DID 81221A INPUT RECAP (AD200.F88FA861) -- This 5-part report is generated upon pro-
     cessing of Next Higher Assembly and component data from the 81221A system. The first page of the
     report provides a summary of statistics collected during processing of the data. The second part of the
     report contains the input record image of each error record on the left and up to 6 errors found in that
     error record on the right. The second part of the report lists the new valid Next Higher Assemblies that
     were added to the Next Higher Assembly database during processing. The third part of the report lists
     NHA part number/cages on the input. The fourth part of the report lists NHA part number/cages on the
     input and the more preferred part number/cage each was converted to before being added to the Next
     Higher Assembly and/or Indenture databases. The fifth part of the report lists the disposition of all the
     input records including those in error, and those that were added to or modified on the Next Higher
     Assembly and Indenture databases. This fifth part of the report contains the input record image on the
     left and up to 6 error messages, if applicable, describing the disposition of the input record on the
     right. Records with no disposition messages were processed as valid data.
     6.3.9. DID 81220A INPUT RECAP (AD200.F88FA860) -- This 5-part report is generated upon pro-
     cessing of repair experience history data from the 81220A system. The first page of the report pro-
     vides a summary of statistics collected during processing of the data. The second part of the report
     contains the input record image of each error record on the left and up to 6 errors found in that error
     record on the right. The third part of the report lists NHA part number/cages on the input and the more
     preferred part number/cage each was converted to before being added to the Next Higher Assembly
     and/or Indenture databases. The fourth part of the report lists component part number/cages on the
     input and the more preferred part number/cage each was converted to before being added to the Next
     Higher Assembly and/or Indenture databases. The fifth part of the report lists the disposition of all the
     input records including those in error, those that were summarized due to duplicate keys, and those
     that were posted to the Production History, Consumption History, NHA, and Indenture data bases.
     This fifth part of the report contains the input record image on the left and up to 8 messages describing
     the disposition of the input record on the right.
     6.3.10. Repair Requirements Error Report (AD200.FR2FQ8E0). D200F produces this report when it
     identifies errors in the quarterly D075 input files from the pilot ALC. It is available to the HQ AFMC
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                  51


  API OPR and ALC Indenture Monitor through CA Dispatch. This report displays any item that is not
  identified as a NHA in D200F during D075 processing. The applicable OPR should contact the sub-
  mitting activity for corrections of errors and discrepancies. D200F rejects the entire file if the data
  rejection percent set by the RMS Administration and Support subsystem is exceeded.
  6.3.11. ESD Interface Error Report (AD200.FR0FY8E0). D200F produces this quarterly report off of
  an interface file from the Standard Automated Materiel Management System (SAMMS) This report is
  available to the HQ AFMC API OPR through CA Dispatch. The process accepts Electrostatic-Elec-
  tromagnetic Sensitive Devices (ESD) data and determines if the National Codification Bureau Code
  and Serial Number of the input matches an Item Identification Number (IIN) in the RMS database.
  The applicable OPR should contact the submitting activity for corrections of errors and discrepancies.
  D200F rejects the entire file if the data rejection percent set by the RMS Administration and Support
  subsystem is exceeded.
  6.3.12. Incomplete Indenture Chain Report (AD200.FJ0FA8B9). D200F produces this quarterly
  report after the final quarterly D200A recoverable item computation. This report is available to the
  ALC Indenture Monitor through CA Dispatch who then forwards it on to the ES in accordance with
  the API User’s Manual. This report compares physical relationships to program selection relation-
  ships and helps identify inconsistencies. The applicable ES should review these inconsistencies and
  adjust the indenture or program selection records. If the report indicates that an SPD is not identified
  as a NHA, the ES should take action to establish a new SPD or change the program selection record.
  6.3.13. Selected Items for Review (AD200.FS0FQ8D3). This product generates quarterly from the
  ALC repair schedule and is available through CA Dispatch to the Equipment Specialist (ES). It dis-
  plays all recoverable items that compute a repair requirement but have no NHA review within the pre-
  vious twelve months. The ES should review the NHA and insure that all component relationships are
  current, and the QPA and application percent for each relationship. The ES updates the Review Date
  element on the indenture maintenance screen.
  6.3.14. Review Update Suspense Notice (AD200.F20FA8A2). This product generates weekly from
  the Q302 Bill of Material (BOM) requests and is available through CA Dispatch to the ES (See para
  6.2.2. and 6.2.3. for printer information). This product notifies the ES of a request for a list of the com-
  ponents needed to repair a NHA. Components appear on this report because the specified NHA was in
  the database, but the components were not. This results in the generation of an incomplete relation-
  ship. This report is provided to advise the ES managing the NHA that the components appearing on
  the report have been added to the database. The ES will review and update D200F with correct com-
  ponent data, or delete the components. The components remain in the system until the ES either
  deletes them, or adds or changes the information to complete the relationship in the system. This
  notice continues to generate weekly until the ES completes review by entering a date in Review Date
  field on the indentures maintenance screen (navigation: FOE FM AI IND – see Chapter 9). The sys-
  tem also produces a Full Range List (FRL) and Repair Experience Analysis (REA) unless the NHA
  has an exempt code, or the assembly is not identified as a NHA.
  6.3.15. New NHAs and Related Components (AD200.F30FA8A3). This product generates quarterly
  when production of a NHA that is not identified as a NHA in D200F is reported. It is available through
  CA Dispatch to the ES. The report includes the NHA that was produced and a list of components that
  were consumed. The ES must review this report and take necessary actions to add the indentures or
  reconcile the existing indentures with the production reporting. Manual indenture establishment is
  required because the RMS database does not retain the report information.
52                                                                       AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     6.3.16. New Components for Existing NHAs Report (AD200.F40FA8A4). This product generates
     quarterly when maintenance systems report component consumption during the repair of a NHA, and
     there is no relationship of that component to the NHA in D200F. This report is available through CA
     Dispatch to the ES. The purpose of this report is to advise the managing ES of the NHA that the com-
     ponents appearing on the report have been added to the indenture record. The ES should review this
     report and verify that new indentures are valid, or reconcile the existing indentures with the produc-
     tion reporting. The ES must either manually complete the record or delete it. The ES may need to
     coordinate with the maintenance activity to verify indenture data and to prevent re-establishment of
     deleted component records.
     6.3.17. Component Items for Review - Action (AD200.F50FQ8A3). This product generates quarterly
     and is available through CA Dispatch to the ES. It contains all "incomplete relationships" as of the
     date that the report is generated. All components in this report have previously appeared on the New
     Components for Existing NHA's report (see above). This report reminds the ES of an invalid condi-
     tion that must be either verified or deleted. The ES must complete the actions identified in the preced-
     ing paragraph, if they have not already been accomplished.
     6.3.18. Full Range List (FRL) (AD200.F70FA8A7). The report includes all components indentured to
     a NHA, including component parts, tools and test equipment, bulk materials and technical orders
     established by the ES responsible for the NHA. The sequence of the report is indenture level, by part
     number sequence. The FRL is also available as a pull product.
     6.3.19. FRL Reason Codes. Each FRL displays one of the following codes that indicate what caused
     it to be generated:
        6.3.19.1. A – Q302 generated an input file requesting a Bill of Material for the NHA listed on the
        report. When a FRL is produced for this reason the ES should review FRL and REA to insure that
        indentures are valid. Inaccurate indenture reporting could cause the maintenance activity to order
        the wrong parts.
        6.3.19.2. B - the NHA identity has been deleted. This usually indicates a configuration change
        and the ES should verify that the indentures reflect the change.
        6.3.19.3. C - Item management responsibility for the assembly has transferred to another activity.
        The ES should validate the indentures since some or all stock listed components of the assembly
        may also transfer.
        6.3.19.4. D - The report pertains to a component or assembly that is always repaired concurrently
        with its NHA. The ES should verify the components associated data to insure that the repair pro-
        gram properly flows from the NHA to the components.
        6.3.19.5. If the FRL generates from a BOM request from Q302, the report reflects all levels of
        indenture. If the report is generated for any other reason, the report contains only the first level of
        indentured components.
     6.3.20. Repair Experience Analysis (REA) (AD200.F60FA8A6). The system produces an REA in
     response to an interactive user request, or as a result of processing the Q302 interface request for Bill
     of Material (BOM). The report indicates the reason for producing the output. If the reason was a user
     interactive request, the product shows REA Reason Code A. If the reason was a Bill of Material
     request from the Q302 database, the product shows REA Reason Code B. The report displays a repair
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                               53


  item, its production history, and all components with consumption history under that production item.
  It lists the same components as the Indenture Structure – Top-Down (see paragraph 6.4.6.).
  6.3.21. NHA Review Reports. D200F produces these reports on the first day of each month for distri-
  bution to the HQ AFMC API OPR and ALC Indenture OPRs. It provides review statistics of several
  categories of Next Higher Assemblies (NHAs). These categories include stock listed NHAs,
  non-stock-listed NHAs, NHAs with and without exemption codes, NHAs that are also standard desig-
  nators, and breakout by ERRC code. An assembly is considered “reviewed” if the Review Date field
  on the Indenture screen is populated with a valid date. The review statistics include the number of
  assemblies reviewed and the percentage reviewed within each category. The report has three parts:
     6.3.21.1. NHA Review Report, AFMC Summary (AD200.FR2FM8G1) reports review statistics
     by ALC and provides a command summary.
     6.3.21.2. NHA Review Report, ALC Summary (AD200.FR1FM8G1) reports review statistics by
     psuedo-division within each ALC and provides an ALC summary.
     6.3.21.3. NHA Review Report, Division Summary (AD200.FR0FM8G1) reports review statistics
     by ES code within each ALC pseudo-division and provides a division summary. The ES can also
     receive this report.
  6.3.22. Q302 Repair History Error Report (AD200.F12FA8D#). This 2-part error report is generated
  upon processing of repair experience history data from the Q302 system. Q302 data is generated at
  each ALC. The “#” sign shown here in the last position of the product number is replaced on the actual
  hard copy report with the respective ALC code (1 = OC-ALC, 2 = OO-ALC, 5 = WR-ALC.) whose
  data is being reported. The first page of the report provides reference information on the various
  RECORD FORMATS (Columns, Field Name, Field Type, and Field Length) to be edited on the
  report. The second part of the report lists the actual records in error. The error report is routed to CA
  Dispatch where it can be viewed and/or printed by the ALC Indenture Monitor. Records in error are
  listed on this report when NHAs and Components do not match existing Standard Designator, Item, or
  Reference Designator/IIN Cross Reference data base files, Production or Consumption history quan-
  tities are zero, or Unit of issue codes cannot be converted. When standard designators (NHA’s) are
  rejected, the Reference Designator table should be updated via menu selection FOE FM PRGM DESC
  and the transactions reprocessed. The Surveillance Programmer must then be contacted to run the
  Q302 recycle process. When the number of errors in the input file exceeds the specified error limit, the
  file is rejected and this error report is produced. When the number of errors is within the specified
  error limit, records having valid data are posted to the database. Records in error are printed on this
  report.
  6.3.23. Recycle Q302 Repair History (AD200.F12FA8L@). This 2-part error report is generated
  upon processing the recycled transaction repair experience history data from the Q302 system. The
  “@” sign shown here in the last position of the product number is replaced on the actual hard copy
  report with the respective ALC code (H = OC-ALC, G = OO-ALC, L = WR – ALC) whose data is
  being reported. The first page of the report provides reference information on the various RECORD
  FORMATS (Columns, Field Name, Field Type, and Field Length) to be edited on the report. The sec-
  ond part of the report lists the actual records in error. The error report is routed to CA Dispatch where
  it can be viewed and/or printed by the ALC Indenture Monitor. Records in error are listed on this

     zero, or Unit of issue codes cannot be converted. When standard designators (NHA’s) are rejected, the
     Reference Designator table should be updated via menu selection FOE FM PRGM DESC and the
     transactions reprocessed. The Surveillance Programmer must then be contacted to run the Q302 recy-
     cle process. This cycle of running the data through to determine errors, correcting the errors, and
     reprocessing the corrected data continues until no more errors are detected. When the number of
     errors in the input file exceeds the specified error limit, the file is rejected and this error report is pro-
     duced. When the number of errors is within the specified error limit, records having valid data are
     posted to the database. Records in error are printed on this report.
     6.3.24. G009 Repair History Error Report (AD200.F12FA8F#). This 2-part error report is generated
     upon processing of repair experience history data from the G009 system. G009 data is generated at
     each ALC. The “#” sign shown here in the last position of the product number is replaced on the actual
     hard copy report with the respective ALC code (1 = OC-ALC, 2 = OO-ALC, 5 = WR-ALC.) whose
     data is being reported. The first page of the report provides reference information on the various
     RECORD FORMATS (Columns, Field Name, Field Type, and Field Length) to be edited on the
     report. The second part of the report lists the actual records in error. The error report is routed to CA
     Dispatch where it can be viewed and/or printed by the ALC Indenture Monitor. Records in error are
     listed on this report when NHAs and Components do not match existing Standard Designator, Item, or
     Reference Designator/IIN Cross Reference data base files, Production or Consumption history quan-
     tities are zero, or Unit of issue codes cannot be converted. When standard designators (NHA’s) are
     rejected, the Reference Designator table should be updated via menu selection FOE FM PRGM DESC
     and the transactions reprocessed. The Surveillance Programmer must then be contacted to then run the
     G009 recycle process. When the number of errors in the input file exceeds the specified error limit, the
     file is rejected and this error report is produced. When the number of errors is within the specified
     error limit, records having valid data are posted to the database. Records in error are printed on this
     report.
     6.3.25. Recycle G009 Repair History (AD200.F12FA8N@). This 2-part error report is generated
     upon processing the recycled transaction repair experience history data from the G009 system. The
     “@” sign shown here in the last position of the product number is replaced on the actual hard copy
     report with the respective ALC code (H = OC-ALC, G = OO-ALC, L = WR – ALC) whose data is
     being reported. The first page of the report provides reference information on the various RECORD
     FORMATS (Columns, Field Name, Field Type, and Field Length) to be edited on the report. The sec-
     ond part of the report lists the actual records in error. The error report is routed to CA Dispatch where
     it can be viewed and/or printed by the ALC Indenture Monitor. Records in error are listed on this
     report when NHAs and Components do not match existing Standard Designator, Item, or Reference
     Designator/IIN Cross Reference data base files, Production or Consumption history quantities are
     zero, or Unit of issue codes cannot be converted. When standard designators (NHA’s) are rejected, the
     Reference Designator table should be updated via menu selection FOE FM PRGM DESC and the
     transactions reprocessed. The Surveillance Programmer must then be contacted to run the G009 recy-
     cle process. This cycle of running the data through to determine errors, correcting the errors, and
     reprocessing the corrected data continues until no more errors are detected. When the number of
     errors in the input file exceeds the specified error limit, the file is rejected and this error report is pro-

     6.3.26. Selected Items for Review Summary (AD200.FS1FQ8D3). This report is automatically gen-
     erated as a result of the processing of the D075 consolidated file received quarterly from the pilot
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                  55


  ALC. It summarizes item level information for each ALC/Division that has not been reviewed within
  the last twelve months from the beginning date. It is a summary of the information in the report
  described above in paragraph 6.3.13.
  6.3.27. NHAs with Indenture Suppress Indicator On (AD200.F84FM8M@). The HQ API OPR
  receives this report on a monthly basis for all NHAs belonging to Headquarters. Each ALC Indenture
  Monitor receives this report for the NHAs belonging to that ALC. The @ identifies the ALC (H =
  OC-ALC, G = OO-ALC, L = WR – ALC) for the report. NHAs appear on this report when they meet
  the following conditions:
     6.3.27.1. The Indenture Suppress Indicator equals ‘Y’.
     6.3.27.2. The Review Date is older than 1 year ago.
     6.3.27.3. Those NHAs having a Review Date older than 18 months ago will have their Indenture
     Suppress Indicator reset to space during the extraction for this report. The report will indicate that
     the indicator has been reset. The report will also indicate that the Suppress Indicators of those
     NHAs having a Review Date between 17 and 18 months ago are about to expire.
  6.3.28. The following 4 reports are created as a result of installing the Program Authority (PA) data,
  which contains a majority of the Aircraft Organizational Intermediate Maintenance Projected Peace
  Program data for D200. These reports are provided for the HQ AFMC PROGRAMS OPR.
     6.3.28.1. Missing USAF AF-MDS Program Report (AD200.FN0FA8A4). This report lists PA
     records that fail one of four edits. The four edits are 1) PA records missing data for the Flying
     Hour Retention Computation (identified on the report as “Missing Utilization Rate” records), 2)
     PA records containing an SPD that was not validated by the standard index or the actual to stan-
     dard table (identified on the report as “Invalid SPD” records), 3) PA records identified as duplicate
     records when attempting to add them to the data base (identified on the report by the “Duplicate
     Record” message), and 4) If there is no match to the SPD being processed, the record is printed on
     the report with the message, “Missing STD-DESIG-RCD”.
     6.3.28.2. USAF AF-MDS Program Report (AD200.FO0FA8A5). This report contains all valid
     SPDs that were found on the standard index or were converted from the actual to standard table. It
     is produced in two parts and contains nine years, by quarter, of program data. Only program types
     1, 2, 3, 5, E, S, T, V, and Z records are provided on this report. Part one of the report is summarized
     by MDS, Program Type, Command Code, and Assignment Code. All aircraft with the same MD
     must appear together. Part two, entitled “Overall Totals of Edited Flying Hour Records”, is sum-
     marized to the Program type, command and assignment code. A grand total is also produced for all
     MDs by command code and assignment code.
     6.3.28.3. Program Authority Tape Error Report (AD200.FR0FA8E1). This report is comprised of
     all records from the PA file that fail to meet the system’s editing criteria. The data is rejected if the
     rejection percent exceeds the specified percent.
     6.3.28.4. Program Authority Variance Report (AD200.FP0FA8A6). This report compares two
     types of programs, peacetime flying hours (FH) and average total active inventory (TAI), from one
     Program Authority (PA) document to the next. The report compares the TAI data in the fourth
     quarter of each fiscal year (FY XXXX/09) in the latest PA document with the data in the corre-
     sponding quarter of the most recent previous PA file. It also compares each entire fiscal year’s FH
     data in the latest PA document with the corresponding fiscal year’s FH in the most recent previous
56                                                                       AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


        report. The report displays the differences in program units and percents between the data in the
        latest and most recent previous PA files. The data includes the current fiscal year and ten years of
        projected data. The program data is displayed separately and broken out by Air Force component
        within each aircraft Mission-Design-Series (MDS) or modified MDS, if applicable. Summaries of
        all MDSs to Mission-Design (MD), all MDs to mission), and all aircraft to a global summary are
        provided. Each summary is broken out by Air Force Component. There is no summary of modi-
        fied MDS designators to MDS.
     6.3.29. G099 Error Report (AD200.FR1FA8E1) -- This report is generated automatically as a result
     of the monthly processing of the G099 interface and is received by the HQ AFMC API OPR. The
     G099 interface contains past program data of aircraft flying hours, inventory, and sorties and trainer
     past actual programs for trainer flying hours and inventory. The data is rejected if the rejection percent
     exceeds the specified percent. This error report shows the reason rejected, record rejected, total
     records read, and total records rejected.
     6.3.30. Mod Schedule reports (D363). The following 3 reports are created on a monthly basis as the
     result of installing Mod Schedule data from D363 and are provided for the HQ AFMC PROGRAMS
     OPR. The first report includes the results of the editing of the D363 input data. The last 2 are produced
     as a result of installing the Mod Schedule data on the Mod Schedule database.
        6.3.30.1. Mod Schedule Data Exception Report (AD200.FR0FA8E0). When all input files from
        the ALCs have been received, the fields are validated against the Data Element Dictionary.
        Records, which do not pass the validation criteria, are listed on this error report. If the ratio of the
        number of records in error to the total number of records on the input files exceeds the specified
        error limitation, the files are rejected. In this case, no data is retained for further processing.
        6.3.30.2. Unmatched Tailored Application Master Report (AD200.FU0FA8D8). This report is
        produced as a result of a user request for the INSTALL MOD SCHED process. Information on this
        report includes the Modification SPDs that do not have a corresponding SPD on the SPD file, SPD
        MOD file, or Reference Designator file. It also lists those Modification SPDs that cannot be added
        to the database, i.e., the Modification data that is entered by Mission/Design without a Series (the
        7th position of the MDS is a blank).
        6.3.30.3. Tailored Application Master Report (AD200.FU1FA8D8). This report is produced as a
        result of a user request for the INSTALL MOD SCHED process. The process uses the valid SPD/
        MOD (MDS, Remove/Install indicator, Mod Number) in each Modification record to update the
        SPD MOD file. The data on the report includes all modification information from the MOD
        SCHED file.

6.4. User Requested Products.
     6.4.1. User requested (pull) products help users control and track data in the D200F applications, pro-
     grams, and indentures. Users select these products through the Output Products, Application/Inden-
     tures screen or the Output Products, Programs screen. The system does not reject duplicate requests
     for the same product, therefore, requesters should track their request to preclude generating several
     copies of the same report. All output products are available to the user through CA Dispatch (See
     paragraph 6.2.2. and 6.2.3. for printer information). Be cautious when requesting printed products
     since some, especially full range lists (paragraph 6.3.18. above) can be very large.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                              57


  6.4.2. Component Item Review List (CIRL) (AD200.FB0FA8B1). This report lists all next level
  higher assembly (NHA) identities for a specified component. It is useful in locating NHAs affected by
  defective component item reports (e.g., GIDEP Alert) or by diminishing manufacturing sources. This
  product is available by component NIIN or by part number-FSCM combination and is sorted in NHA
  NIIN sequence.
  6.4.3. Full Range List Report (FRL) (AD200.F70FA8A7). See paragraph 6.3.18.
  6.4.4. Indenture Chains (IC) - All (AD200.FE0FA8B4). This report is a list of all indenture chains
  that exist for a specified component. The bottom of the chain is the specified component; the top of the
  chain is the highest indentured assembly. Requesters specify the NIIN, Part Number-FSCM combina-
  tion, or engine Type, Model, Series (TMS). If a component item is a link in multiple chains, each
  chain is listed on a separate page.
  6.4.5. Incomplete Indenture Chain (IIC) (AD200.FJ0FA8B9). This report lists Standard Program
  Designator (SPD) applications that have component NIINs or TMSs. This report is used to compare
  physical relationships with the program selection relationships and to help identify inconsistencies.
  Only the HQ AFMC API OPR can request this report.
  6.4.6. Indenture Structure Top-Down (IS) (AD200.FD0FA8B3). This report lists the specified NHA
  and its components from top to bottom. It is similar to the Full Range List Report (see paragraph
  6.3.18. above), except components with Special Identification Designator (SID) "D", "E", "F", "G",
  "L", "R", "S", or "T"(see Chapter 2) do not appear. User may choose to view all components or limit
  the request to components with ERRC Code "C", "P', "S" and "T". To request this report, specify a
  NHA by entering a NIIN, Standard Program Designator, or part number-FSCM combination.
  6.4.7. Material Requirements List (MRL) (AD200.F90FA8A9). The MRL lists all the components of
  a NHA and the quantity needed to repair that NHA. The last section of this report displays investment
  and expense cost information. The user may include all components or limit the request to recoverable
  items only. This report is required to support contract maintenance. The user may also request a Bulk
  Material List (BML) with this report if desired (see paragraph 6.4.8.). To be included in this report,
  components must meet all the following criteria:
     6.4.7.1. A component must have a NIIN, or have a source code (the first two positions of the
     Source, Maintenance, Recoverability code) of AD or MD.
     6.4.7.2. Items must have a computed replacement percent greater than zero.
     6.4.7.3. Items must have Special Identification Designator (SID) other than D, E, F, G, L, R or T.
     Blank is valid.
  6.4.8. Bulk Materials List (BML) (AD200.F80FA8A8). Users request this report with the Material
  Requirements List (MRL) (see 6.4.7.). It is not available as a separate report. It contains all the com-
  ponents of a specified NHA with a Special Identification Designator (SID) "L", which identifies an
  item as bulk material.
  6.4.9. Next Higher Assembly By ES (NBES) (AD200.FF0FA8B5). This report provides a list of
  every NHA in D200F that is assigned to a given ES code within each ALC pseudo division. It includes
  exemption codes and review dates. This provides an overview of all review dates and exempt coded
  items for each ES. This report may be sorted by NIIN or by part number.
58                                                                      AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


     6.4.10. Purchase Request Support List (PRSL) (AD200.FC0FA8B2). This product displays physical
     relationship information for NHAs identified on repair Purchase Requests (PR) or Military Interser-
     vice Purchase Requests (MIPR) that the requesting Production Management Specialist (PMS) is
     reviewing. This product helps the PMS identify components needed to support contract maintenance,
     and that may be candidates for Government Furnished Material (GFM). Although the D034A inter-
     face was removed from D200F, the PRSL report can still be requested via the online screen. The
     PRSL allows the user to screen multi-item repair PRs or MIPRs on a single report. The user may
     choose to view all components or limit the request to recoverable items.
        6.4.10.1. The PRSL has three parts:
            6.4.10.1.1. Part I lists the items to be included in the PR or MIPR (exempt items are noted)
            6.4.10.1.2. Part II lists the required component parts and their required quantities for repair
            6.4.10.1.3. Part III sums repair costs for the components
        6.4.10.2. Components for this report must meet all the following criteria:
            6.4.10.2.1. Items must have an NIIN assigned, or have a source code (the first two positions
            of the Source, Maintenance, Recoverability code) of ‘AD’ or ‘MD’.
            6.4.10.2.2. Items must have a computed replacement percent greater than zero.
            6.4.10.2.3. Items must have Special Identification Designator (SID) other than ‘D’, ‘E’, ‘F’,
            ‘G’, ‘L’, ‘R’ or ‘T’. Blank is valid.
     6.4.11. Repair Experience Analysis (REA) (AD200.F60FA8A6). This report lists an item with its pro-
     duction history and all components that have consumption history for that item. It lists the same com-
     ponents as the Indenture Structure – Top-Down (see paragraph 6.4.6.). This report also automatically
     generates when a Q302 Bill of Material is requested. Reason code A or B appears at the top of the
     screen indicating whether report was user requested (A) or system generated (B). Users can request
     REAs for all next higher assemblies assigned to a specific equipment specialist in a single request.
     This option should not be used indiscriminately, however, since the output can involve a large volume
     of paper. This output is a hard copy product for the equipment specialist of the next higher assembly
     identity.
     6.4.12. ESD Identification (RESD) (AD200.FQ0FA8D2). This report displays all components that
     have an Electromagnetic-Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD) designator. This report is available to
     the ALC Indenture Monitor/OPR.
     6.4.13. Indenture Chain Specified NHA (RICS) (AD200.FT0FA8D7). This report lists all indenture
     chains between the user-specified NHA and the component. It provides the user with a starting and
     ending point within the indenture chain. Multiple chains are listed on separate pages.
     6.4.14. Special Identification Designator (RSID) (AD200.FQ2FA8D6). This report includes all com-
     ponents of a specified end item or NHA that are assigned a specific SID. The report includes all levels
     of components below the NHA. Users may use this report, for example, to identify all incomplete
     indenture relationships (SID "V") of a NHA. The list is sorted by part number and may be requested
     by NIIN, STD DES or part number-FSCM combination, specifying the desired SID code. (See Chap-
     ter 2 for SID code definitions).
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                                 59


  6.4.15. Exempt Code (RXMT) (AD200.FQ1A8D5). This report displays all NHAs that have a given
  exempt code within an ALC, Division, or ES. See Chapter 2 for Exempt code definitions.
  6.4.16. Tools and Test Equipment (TTE) (AD200.FA0FA8B0). This report identifies and describes
  tools and test equipment used to repair a NHA. The user may choose to view all levels of components
  by leaving the "RECOVERABLES ONLY" field blank. Entering a "Y" in this field produces all levels
  of components to the point in each chain where a reparable component (ERRC Code C, T, S, U or
  standard designator, i.e., MDS or TMS) is noted.
  6.4.17. The Request Reclamation Data (RECL) report is no longer available in the format that was
  used in the past. The Request for Reclamation Data is now available via a flat file containing error
  records and another file containing reclamation data. No report is produced.
  6.4.18. AFMC Program Report (RFPL) (AD200.FL0FA8A2 for future, AD200.FK0FA8A1 for past).
  This report displays in quarterly increments all program data. Data are broken down to MDS and com-
  mand levels. Users must specify whether the request is for past or future data. Users can request a
  report that includes all program data , specify a single program type, or select an option that includes
  only the program types used in AFMC requirements processes (types 1, 2, 3, and 5).
  6.4.19. Past Program Change Report (RPCR) (AD200.FP0FA8D1). This report lists all current cycle
  past programs that have been changed since setting the change indicators to blank. The most recent
  past quarter is always included regardless of change status. Current quarter past actual data is not used
  for this report. The most recent quarter of past actual data is summed to quarter data for this report. All
  3 monthly quantities are included regardless of the value of their change indicators. Program data may
  not have been complete in the previous quarter due to incomplete reporting at the end of the quarter
  (see Chapter 3).
  6.4.20. Tailored Mod Report (RTMR) (AD200.FU2FA8D8). This report displays time-phased data
  for each modification SPD. It includes 8 past quarters, 25 future peace quarters, 1 retention quantity,
  and 4 future war quantities of the EY (WAR) year of modification schedules as stored on the Mod
  Schedules database table. Standard Program Designator (SPDL) (AD200.F00FA8A1). This report
  lists all valid SPDs in the SPD Table. Users can limit the report to a single SPD type.
  6.4.21. NHAS WITH INDENTURE SUPPRESS INDICATOR ON (AD200.F84FM8Q0). This report
  is output as a result of a user request. NHAs appear on this report when they meet the following con-
  ditions:
     6.4.21.1. The Indenture Suppress Indicator equals ‘Y’.
     6.4.21.2. The Review Date is within the requested range or within the default range.
     6.4.21.3. The ALC matches the ALC in the selection criteria.
     6.4.21.4. If specified, the DIV and Es match those selected by the requestor.
     The report will indicate that the Indenture Suppress Indicator of those NHAs having a Review
     Date older than 18 months ago will be reset to space during the execution of the next monthly
     report. The report will also identify those NHAs having a Review Date between 17 and 18 months
     ago. The sequence of this report is ALC, DIV, ES, Review Year, Review Day, and Item Type. The
     report is further sequenced by Part Number/Cage within the type ‘NSL’, by NIIN within the type
     ‘NSN’ and by Standard Designator within the type ‘SPD’. A blank line occurs between each
     group of NHAs for an ES code. There are page breaks for each Division within the ALC and a
60                                                                   AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


        summary page at the end of the records for each ALC. The ALC summary page lists the number
        of records for each division within the ALC and a total for the ALC.

6.5. Batch Jobs.
     6.5.1. Authorized users can launch through Output Products function the batch jobs in the following
     paragraphs that provide data to other systems or to other RMS processes.
     6.5.2. Install Modification Schedule (IMOD). This screen allows the user to initiate the monthly
     install process of updated data to the Modification Schedule Table. The process also produces two
     monthly reports (see paragraphs 6.3.30.2. and 6.3.30.3.).
     6.5.3. Past Engine and PEC Computation (RPEC). This process performs the computation of past
     engine and PEC programs whenever a user requests one. The job computes engine flying hour or sor-
     tie programs considering the engines' TMS applications, the QPAs, and application percents. The job
     computes PEC programs considering the application percent of PEC to aircraft and the aircraft pro-
     gram data. These engine and PEC programs are passed to D200A during the Snapshot Process.
     6.5.4. Projected Engine and PEC Computation (RPRC). This process performs the computation of
     projected engine and PEC programs whenever a user requests one. The job computes engine flying
     hour or sortie programs considering the engines' TMS applications, the QPAs, and application per-
     cents. The job computes PEC programs considering the application percent of PEC to aircraft and the
     aircraft program data. These engine and PEC programs are passed to D200A during the Snapshot Pro-
     cess.
     6.5.5. Mod Program Computation (RMPC). This job builds Mod Programs for the modifications hav-
     ing schedules on the Mod Schedule table. It computes averaged running totals from the schedules and,
     using the Total Active Inventory (TAI) program (type “T”) for the MDS being modified from the
     D200F program time-phased tables and these averaged running totals, develops application percents.
     These application percents are then applied to the flying hour and inventory programs for the MDS

                                    CONTRACTOR SUBMISSION

7.1. Background.
   7.1.1. Contracting actions are important sources of indenture data in D200F. In the early phases of
   weapon system deployment, contractors may perform maintenance and materiel management func-
   tions, including provisioning tasks and preparation of technical data.
   7.1.2. Two Data Item Descriptions (DID) are available for contractors to use to populate the D200F
   system with indenture data. DID DI-ILSS-81221A, Applications, Programs, and Indenture (API) Data
   provides initial indenture data in the initial procurement package or in a follow-on contract action.
   Since some systems did not include initial indenture data with the initial procurement packages, it is
   necessary to either acquire or build these data, whichever is the most economical.
   7.1.3. Repair history data may be acquired in the initial procurement package or in a follow-on con-
   tract action by tasking the contractor to submit production and consumption history data using DID
   DI-ILSS-81220A, End Item (EI) Production and Component Item (CI) Consumption History Data.

7.2. Data Submission.
   7.2.1. The contractor will submit data in an electronic medium (disk or tape using ASCII-64 character
   set, or file transfer protocol), as specified in the DID, and a hard copy of the contents. The repair his-
   tory will be updated at least once during the contract period and at the completion of the contract, but
   not more frequently than once a quarter.

7.3. Acquisition Process Responsibilities.
   7.3.1. Acquisition programs can range from a small modification to a major weapon system. The
   equipment specialist (ES) responsibilities during the acquisition process vary with the size of the pro-
   gram. AFMC Instruction 23-104, Functions and Responsibilities of the Equipment Specialist During
   Provisioning details these responsibilities.

7.4. Data Review Responsibilities.
   7.4.1. The program manager, production management specialist, or equipment specialist for the end
   item:
       7.4.1.1. Reviews data received from contractors for proper format, accuracy, and validity.
       7.4.1.2. Forwards the data to the ALC Indenture Monitor, who inputs them to the D200F system.
       7.4.1.3. Returns unacceptable data to the contractor through appropriate channels for corrective
       action.
   7.4.2. If the data requires only minor corrections, the PM, PMS, ES may decide to correct the input
   themselves rather than returning it to the contractor. The decision to return data to the contractor
   depends on the volume of missing or incorrect data.
   7.4.3. Data will not be input to D200F until they have been reviewed and corrected.

7.5. Procuring Activity Responsibilities.
     7.5.1. The procuring activity that uses a DID to acquire indenture data will supply the following
     information so the contractor can prepare data for the DID:
        7.5.1.1. The alpha/numeric single digit ALC code. See the formats in Table 7.1. or Table 7.3. for
        valid values.
        7.5.1.2. An alpha/numeric single digit division/pseudo division code. The ALC assigns this code.
        7.5.1.3. An alpha/numeric two digit ES code. The ALC assigns this code.

7.6. Contractor Material Management Support.
     7.6.1. In some cases a support contractor performs materiel management tasks on behalf of the gov-
     ernment. There are two types of contractual arrangements of this kind: Interim Supply Support (ISS)
     and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). Under ISS a contractor performs acts as an inventory control
     point (ICP) for peculiar items that support a new system or subsystem. Under ICS arrangements the
     contractor performs ICP functions for a mature system. These support functions include repair pro-
     duction management and technical management. In these cases the program office must insure that
     the data are included as part of the transition package when the government assumes the materiel man-
     agement functions.

7.7. Initial Indentures.
     7.7.1. Indenture records are procured from the manufacturer of new end items or weapon systems
     using DID DI-ILSS-81221A. The decision to buy records is part of the acquisition process. These data
     should be an integral part of any solicitation or procurement package. The records will be provided as
     complete indenture files in the specified format.

7.8. Request For Proposal (RFP).
     7.8.1. During RFP development, the ES will request the contract actions to insure indenture data
     delivery by the contractor. As part of the Logistic Support Analysis (LSA) request package, the ES
     will identify the D200F indenture requirement using the DID DI-ILSS-81221A, calling for LSA
     records as source data. This DID will be used on all acquisitions and modifications, as applicable.

7.9. Contractor Indenture Submittal.
     7.9.1. The contractor's response to the DID, appended to the contract, will be in the form of an initial
     indenture using the format specified in DID DI-ILSS-81221A. Each contractor submittal will include
     a hard copy of the tape contents, which the procuring agency will use to review and validate the data.

7.10. Initial Indenture Preparation Instructions.
     7.10.1. DID DI-ILSS-81221A includes preparation instructions for an initial indenture. Each con-
     tracted item requires the following data elements in the positions specified when the contractor is pre-
     paring an initial indenture. Every component item record must follow a related NHA record. This
     format will not be modified. However the procuring activity may specify default values for mandatory
     fields in the contract.

7.12. Repair History Reporting.
     7.12.1. When the indenture is already established, end item production and component item con-
     sumption repair history records are procured from the contractor who repairs the end items, following
     the formats in DID DI-ILSS-81220A. These data should be an integral part of any maintenance con-
     tract package. The records will be provided on magnetic tape in the specified format.

7.13. Reporting Schedule.
     7.13.1. The repair history is updated at least once during the negotiated contract and when the con-
     tract is complete, but not more frequently than once a quarter. The contractor responds according to
     the DID instructions.

7.14. Production and Consumption.
     7.14.1. For repair history to be complete and usable in the D200F system, both end item production
     and component item consumption must be reported. Every component item consumption record must
     have a valid, related NHA record. Also, the NHA must report production history so D200F can com-
     pute replacement percents.

7.15. Repair History Preparation Instructions.
     7.15.1. DID DI-ILSS-81220A includes preparation instructions. Each contracted item requires the
     data elements in the positions specified in Table 7.3. and Table 7.4. when the contractor is preparing
     repair history. Every component item record must follow a related NHA record. This specified format
     may not be modified.

7.16. Next Higher Assembly (NHA) Content.
     7.16.1. Each NHA record must be accompanied by a component item record. See Table 7.3. for the
     data elements that are mandatory for each NHA item in the positions specified.

7.17. Component Item (CI) Content.
     7.17.1. Each component item record must be preceded by a related NHA record. When Type of
     Action (TOA) code ”9” for end item production reporting appears in position 2, IAW Table 7.4. each
     component item record requires the following data elements in the positions where MANDATORY
     ENTRY is specified.

                                         SYSTEM INTERFACES

8.1. Input Interfaces.
     8.1.1. Data Depot (Q302). This file was formerly provided by the G005M Maintenance Material Sup-
     port System. The input from the Q302 Data Depot includes two interfaces:
        8.1.1.1. The first is a request from the ALC maintenance organization’s planning function. This
        interface provides indenture information needed to establish the maintenance material standards
        that support the depot level repair of the item identified in the request. This interface must include
        the following information:
                Requesting Organization Symbol
                NHA Identity (NSN or Mission Design Series) or NHA Part Nr/CAGE
                Job Number
                Requesting ALC
        8.1.1.2. The second input is a file with information that portrays the results of a single quarter’s
        repair experience at the ALC. The extract identifies the end items and quantity repaired (produc-
        tion), and the component items and quantity used (consumption). Extract criteria and file data con-
        tent are:
                Next Higher Assembly Identity or NHA Part Nr/CAGE
                Component Identity or Component Part Nr/CAGE
                Source of Repair
                Production Quantity
                Consumption Quantity
                Item Code (NHA only)
                Unit of Issue (Component item only)
     8.1.2. Government Furnished Material Transaction Reporting System (G009). This input includes
     data that portrays the results of a quarter’s repair experience at contract repair facilities. The extract
     identifies the NHA and quantities repaired (production), and the component items and quantity used
     (consumption). The file includes two records: one is for the NHA and component items identified by
     a National Stock Number; the second is for components identified by part number. These records con-
     tain the following information:
                Component Identity (NSN)
                Next Higher Assembly Identity (NSN)
                History Data
                Reversal Indicator (- for minus)
                Production Quantity or Consumption Quantity

             Next Higher Assembly Identity (NSN)
             History Data
             Reversal (- for minus)
             Consumption History
             Component Reference Number Log (PN)
  8.1.3. AFMC Provisioning System (D220). This system is an automated source of Master Material
  Support Record Data, which identifies component items subject to repair. The system identifies an
  assembly (NHA) and its related descriptive elements, and all components with their descriptive ele-
  ments. The equipment specialist requests the provisioning function at the responsible ALC for an
  interface with the D220 system. D220 then generates a hard copy output that identifies the recoverable
  items in D220 of interest to the requesting ES. The ES codes the product to indicate the components
  to be reported, and returns it to the provisioning function. D220 then generates an interface file that
  D200F can use to establish the initial relationships represented by the NHA and related components
  on the file.
     8.1.3.1. Information required for input of the NHA file is:
     NHA Reference Number Log (part number)
             NHA FSCM (now CAGE)
             Item Name
             SMR Code
             Item Code (Constant -E-)
             AF Manager ALC Code
             Equipment Specialist Cd
             Division Designator ES
             Submitting ALC Code
     8.1.3.2. Information required for the Component Item is:
             Component Reference Number Log
             Component FSCM
             Item Name
             Source Maintenance Recover Code
             Quantity Per Assembly
             Overhaul Replacement Percent
  8.1.4. Reutilization/Disposition System (RDS) D035G. The input from Reutilization Disposition Sys-
  tem (D035G) includes 3 interfaces.
72                                                                     AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


        8.1.4.1. Two of these interfaces contain the stock numbered items for which D035G is requesting
        all direct components and all direct next higher assemblies (NHAs) as stored in the physical rela-
        tionships in D200F. One of these interfaces is received on a quarterly basis; the other is received
        on an as required basis.
            8.1.4.1.1. The input for these two interfaces contains the following element:
                NIIN
        8.1.4.2. The third interface comes to D200F on an as required basis and contains a request from
        D035G for reclamation information. This interface contains the following data elements:
                Application Program Designator
                Reclamation Project Code
                Reclamation Project Quantity
     8.1.5. Standard Automated Materiel Management System (SAMMS). The interface file from
     SAMMS identifies Electromagnetic and Electrostatic Sensitive Devices (ESD). D200F uses this
     information to produce a report that identifies next higher assemblies of ESD items that reside in the
     database. Input data elements are:
                National Stock Number, Consisting of:
                   Federal Supply Class
                   National Codification Bureau Code
                   Serial Number
     8.1.6. Reliability Engineering Management Information System (REMIS) (G099). HQ AFMC/EN
     provides this monthly interface. It contains the most recent months past program for aircraft. The
     interface includes Organizational Intermediate Maintenance (OIM) program. The OIM programs are
     Types 1 (flying hours), 5 (sorties), and 3 (equipment inventory months). The interface can also contain
     inventory (Type 3) or flying hour data (Type 1) for simulator trainers.
        8.1.6.1. The elements sent to D200F for aircraft are:

9.1. General.
   9.1.1. This chapter provides information that users need to use the automated interactive system. It
   includes procedures to gain access to the on-line system, navigate through the system, and use the
   embedded software packages that produce reports and queries.

9.2. Capabilities.
   9.2.1. Users can perform the following functions on line:
       9.2.1.1. Add, delete, and change data in the File Maintenance function.
       9.2.1.2. View data in the Display function.
       9.2.1.3. Request hard copy reports or sections of reports in the Output Products function.
       9.2.1.4. Receive automatically generated reports.
       9.2.1.5. Interrogate the database with ad hoc and library queries built in CA/DATAQUERY.

9.3. User Profiles.
   9.3.1. D200F assigns separate profiles to each of the following users and allows them to perform the
   tasks specified:
       9.3.1.1. HQ AFMC API OPR: This user maintains surveillance, policy, and command level mon-
       itoring of indentures adequacy, accuracy, and completeness. Establishes and modifies locally
       established programs, and monitors all program-related matters for requirements determination
       purposes. Also serves as the HQ AFMC API Policy OPR. This user is the command policy and
       direction focal point for matters related to API.
       9.3.1.2. HQ AFMC Policy OPR: This user is the command policy and direction focal point for
       matters related to the Requirements Management System.
       9.3.1.3. HQ AFMC Reclamation OPR: This user is the command focal point for reclamation pro-
       cesses and policy, and can initiate the Request Reclamation Data job.
       9.3.1.4. ALC Program Monitor: This user establishes and modifies locally established programs,
       and monitors all program-related matters for requirements determination purposes.
       9.3.1.5. ALC Indenture Monitor: This user establishes and maintains surveillance, policy, and
       ALC-level monitoring of the indentures adequacy, accuracy, and completeness. Ensures that the
       ESs follow HQ AFMC and ALC policy and procedures as it pertains to API.
       9.3.1.6. System Program Manager (SPM), Single Manager (SM), System Support Manager
       (SSM), System Program Director (SPD), Materiel Group Manager (MGM): These users have
       overall responsibility for management and support of assigned weapon systems.
       9.3.1.7. Production Management Specialist (PMS): These users provide Government Furnished
       Material (GFM) support for contract repair.

        9.3.1.8. Reclamation Program Control Officer (RPCO): These ALC users initiate reclamation
        projects against excess NSNs, aircraft, missiles, or aircraft engines in coordination with the
        assigned System Program Manager (SPM) or Inventory Management Specialist (IMS). When HQ
        USAF/PES or the SPM determines that an item is excess and available for reclamation, the RPCO
        advises his/her counterparts at the other ALCs of the project by obtaining the project control num-
        ber.
        9.3.1.9. The ES establishes and maintains a single indenture concept of NHA to component item
        (parent/child) relationship.
     9.3.2. See the D200F User Manual at https://www.msg.wpafb.af.mil/sxr/ for a list of products and
     screens that each of the above users may view and update.

9.4. Navigation.
     9.4.1. Navigation through the D200F on line system is menu-driven. The user signs in through the
     Requirements Management System sign-on screen by entering a valid User ID and password. The
     system takes the user to the RMS Main Menu. If using RMS TN3270, the user can select from the
     menus in one of two ways: tab to the blank space to the left of the desired screen selection, enter “X,”
     and press ENTER, or tab to the command line in the lower left corner (“CMD”), enter the screen code
     for the desired selection, press ENTER. The screen code appears at the menu selection, immediately
     to the right of the blank space where the user enters “X.” D200F is also available through the GUI
     interface.
        9.4.1.1. Table 9.1. lists each screen in the system, its title, and the navigation address.

Terms
AFMCProvisioning System—The automated source of Master Material Support Record Data, which
identifies component items subject to repair.
Application—Any assembly in an indenture chain, including the end item that generates measurable
program activity. An assembly becomes an application when the ES determines that it requires spare part
98                                                                   AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


support as part of its normal maintenance.
Application Percent—The percentage of the population of higher assemblies that has a given component
installed in it.
Assembly—A part or item that has been built from two or more components.
CA DISPATCH—A commercial software package that processes and generates reports for all RMS
subsystems.
Component—A part of an assembly. A component loses its identity when installed in a higher-level
assembly.
Consumption—Removal and replacement of component parts during repair or overhaul of a higher
assembly
D200F Applications, Programs, and Indentures (API) System—A s u b s y s te m o f t h e A i r Fo r c e
Requirements Management System (RMS) and is the approved Air Force tool for maintaining hardware
indentures and relating program data to secondary items.
Derived Data—Indenture data (QPA QPAPPL, APPL%) that were developed in other systems and
passed to D200F through system interfaces.
End Item—A complete assembly; an assembly that has no next higher assembly.
Exemption Code—A code that precludes D200F from reporting indentured components for a given
assembly
Indenture—The breakdown of an assembly to its constituent components, and the data that defines the
relationship of the assembly to its components.
Indenture Chain—The “bottom up” linkage of a component to its end item through an upward
progression of higher assemblies.
Indenture Structure—A conceptual tree that breaks an assembly down to its components, and in turn
breaks each component down to its parts until the bottom level is reached.
Integrated Weapon System Management (IWSM)—A management concept directed by the Secretary
of Defense in 1985 to consolidate responsibility for managing all facets of the development, production,
modification, support, and retirement of a weapon system under a single manager.
Interim Supply Support (ISS)—A program in which a contractor performs materiel management
functions, including provisioning tasks, during the period when a new system or end item is being fielded
and demand patterns stabilize.
Inventory Program—The population of end item applications that are in use by field activities.
Linkage Data—Information that defines the relationship of a component with its next higher assembly;
includes Quantity per Assembly and Application Percent.
Materiel Group Manager (MGM)—The single manager who is charged with all cost, schedule, and
performance aspects of a materiel group that includes end items and components that do not require a
standing development capability
Mission Item Essentiality Code (MIEC)—is a three position alphanumeric code that indicates an item’s
relative importance to weapon system support.
AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005                                                                              99


Next Higher Assembly—The assembly in which a given component is directly installed.
Operational program—Activity performed by users of an end item when carrying out their missions. In
the Air Force operational programs are expressed as flying hours or sorties.
Override Data—Values that the ES assigned to indenture relationships that supersede the derived or
default data.
Production—The number of assemblies or end items output by a depot level repair or overhaul activity.
Program—Any activity that creates the need for spare parts.
Program Begin Date—The starting point for computing an Item Program from the Application Program
identified by the SPD and the Program Select Code.
Program Selection—The process that assigns program data from an application to a component.
Quantity per Application—The number of components that are installed in a higher assembly that is
also the component’s application. The application and the next higher assembly may or may not be the
same assembly.
Quantity per Assembly—The number of components that are installed in that component’s next higher
assembly.
Recoverable Component—A component that can be removed from its next higher assembly, repaired,
and returned to inventory.
Replacement Percent—The percentage of components installed in the application that are removed and
replaced as the application undergoes overhaul or repair.
Retention Program—The sum of the last three years’ of authorized program; used by SIRS to determine
the quantities of components that are in excess of inventory needs.
Retention Quantity—The sum of the last three years of program data and is the 39th Position Indicator.
Source Reference Code—A code that indicates how the value of a field was acquired.
Special Identification Designator—A code identifies a special condition or additional information
pertaining to a component in an indenture chain.
Standard Program Designator—Any end item or assembly that requires spare part support for
continued operation.
System Program Director (SPD.)—The single individual, under the integrated weapon system
management architecture, responsible for the life-cycle management of a system or commodity. The SPD
is the program manager vested with full authority, responsibility, and resources to execute an approved
acquisition program on behalf of the Air Force. For acquisition related matters, the SPD is accountable to
the program executive officer or the designated acquisition commander.
Time Phasing—Manipulation of the application percent in a way that allows an application’s projected
program to increase or decrease in quarterly increments. The primary use for time phasing is in support of
tailored modification programs that involved phasing out of an obsolete component and phasing in a
replacing component.
Trend Analysis—A feature of the RMS on-line system that allows users to view and compare SPD’s
most current program authorization with previous authorizations, and to compare past authorized
100                                                                 AFMCI23-109 29 MARCH 2005


programs with program that actually generated.
Weapon System—An instrument of combat, together with all related equipment (airborne, seaborne, and
ground based), the skills necessary to operate the equipment; and the supporting facilities and services
required to enable the instrument to be a single unit of striking power in its operational environment
