                             GENERAL PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Quality Assurance Program (QAP) is to provide leadership at
all levels with an assessment of the unit’s ability to perform key supply chain management
(SCM) processes ensuring standardized, repeatable, technically compliant process execution,
while promoting a culture of professional excellence and personal responsibility. It is the
Commander’s single point of contact for ―health of the organization‖ issues and therefore must
be staffed with the most professional, technically compliant technicians. The overall program
intent is to instill vigor and rigor into our SCM processes and personnel. The QAP provides an
objective sampling of both the quality of processes and the proficiencies of personnel. The
program is designed to provide Commanders with a method of evaluating compliance with Air
Force, MAJCOM, and local directives and policies.
1.2. Scope. The policy and procedures prescribed in this document apply to all personnel
performing duties across the full spectrum of SCM functions involving planning, execution,
operations, strategy and integration. All units must be in compliance no later than 90 days from
the date of this instruction. The combined efforts of QA personnel, leaders, and technicians are
necessary to ensure high quality SCM processes, strict compliance to established policy and
procedures, and equipment reliability. The QA section evaluates the quality of SCM processes
accomplished and performs necessary functions to ensure compliance. The QA section serves as
the primary technical advisory agency in the organization, helping supervisors and commanders
resolve quality problems. The assessment and analysis of deficiencies and problem areas are key
functions of QA that highlight and identify underlying cause of poor quality in SCM. QA
personnel are not an extension of the workforce; their purpose is to observe, assess, and evaluate
SCM processes ensuring quality process execution and personnel proficiency.
1.3. Philosophy. The primary focus of Quality Management is defect prevention, achievement
of stable and capable processes, and continuous improvement. AFMC is committed to providing
superior quality weapon systems, end-items, supplies and services to our customers. AFMC
program offices, buying offices, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and all Air Logistics
Centers (ALC) must maintain acquisition and/or sustainment quality assurance processes
consistent with Air Force and DoD policy. The core concepts of which are: (1) Process
documentation and control, (2) Utilization of metrics, and (3) Continuous improvement as
integral functions throughout Integrated Life Cycle Management, SCM, and Depot Maintenance
activities. Quality is defined as conformance to established requirements and standards. QA is a
process that provides adequate confidence that controls are in place to create products and
services that conform to established requirements/standards. QA is an integral part of all life
cycle management, SCM, and depot maintenance activities. All acquisition and sustainment
personnel will be responsible for performing quality functions involved in their assigned duties.
Program documentation will describe the quality management system and how it will contribute
to minimizing cost, schedule and performance risks throughout the product life cycle.

                ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS AND METHODOLOGY

3.1. Program Guidance. The QA Sections will perform analysis and trend identification of
SCM processes through personnel evaluations on all assigned personnel and inspections of
processes. Commanders/Directors must ensure oversight is provided for all SCM processes.
The QA Section is focused on centralized oversight of critical squadron programs, most of which
are executed at the flight level. The QA evaluators have authority to assess, observe, and
document SCM activities.
   3.1.1. The QA Section will be aligned under the CM. The QA Section will serve as the
   primary technical advisory agency, assisting supervision at all levels to resolve quality
   problems, may assist in developing corrective action strategies and enhance the overall
   quality of SCM processes. The QA Section will coordinate with the Functional OPRs to
   assist with enterprise requirements processes.
3.2. Personnel Requirements. Selecting the right personnel to fill the QA section is critical to
a successful QA program and ultimately the success of a unit’s mission. Assigned personnel
must reflect the highest standards of professionalism, be impartial, objective, and consistent in all
assessments. Leadership should only select qualified personnel that are considered established
functional experts, clearly adhere to and understand policy and guidance, and are able to
communicate clearly (verbally and written).
   3.2.1. Evaluators can be military, civilian, or service providers.          The commander or
   designator must appoint evaluators in writing.
       3.2.1.1. Military QA evaluators must be a TSgt or higher and possess at least a 7-skill
       level. If no qualified candidates meet this requirement, SSgts who have completed 7-
       level upgrade actions may be appointed by group commander/director waiver. Waiver
       letter must be attached to the appointment letter.
       3.2.1.2. Military QA evaluators must hold the same AFSC of those being evaluated on
       technical tasks contained in the applicable Career Field Evaluation and Training Plan
       (CFETP). For TSgt and below, an evaluator-specific Air Force Form 797, Job
       Qualification Standard Continuation Command (JQS) must be created and maintained in
       Training Business Area (TBA).
       3.2.1.3. Areas authorized to evaluate will be identified in the evaluator's Specialty
       Training Standard (STS). Exception: If the evaluator is a SNCO with an awarded 7-
       skill level, the evaluator appointment letter will serve as the STS qualification document.
       NOTE: Evaluators are also required to maintain any/all specialty training as applicable,
       i.e., Hazardous Materials, Joint Inspections, etc.
       3.2.1.4. Civilian and service providers QA evaluator must have 3 to 5 years experience
       in the functional discipline they are responsible for evaluating. If no qualified candidates
       meet this requirement, the CM may appoint by commander waiver. Evaluator duties
       must be included in the position description. Waiver Letter must be attached to the
       appointment letter.

        3.3.1.3. Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Fundamentals Course or
        equivalent as prescribed by AFI 20-110, if evaluating NWRM specific tasks. Found on
        the Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS) website.
        3.3.1.4. Specific courses required to qualify individuals for those tasks being evaluated
        (i.e., HAZMAT training, environmental compliance, safety, etc.).
     3.3.2. To become fully qualified, evaluators must accomplish mandatory training and pass
     three Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPEs) within 90 days of appointment conducted by
     a qualified evaluator. Each QA evaluator, permanent or augmentee, must pass the EPEs
     prior to performing unsupervised assessments. At a minimum, a qualified evaluator must
     ensure that the inspector can execute the proper steps to conduct an assessment.
     3.3.3. For all tasks, inspectors must be familiar with the requirements/procedures of tasks
     they evaluate.
3.4. Quality Assurance Augmentation. If a functional area does not warrant a full-time
position in QA, but specialized expertise is required, select qualified technicians that are
recommended by their Flight Chief/Superintendent to be augmentee(s). Each QA must maintain
a listing of current augmentees. The CM establishes augmentee duties.
     3.4.1. QA augmentees require an annual EPE on either a PE or technical inspection to
     remain qualified.
3.5. Rotation of Quality Assurance Personnel. The CM is responsible for developing and
executing a plan to rotate QA personnel. Personnel shall be assigned to QA for a minimum of 36
months and a maximum of 48 months. Air Force Reserve, civilian, and service provider
employees do not have any time requirements.
3.6. Assessment Methodology. Assessments are the formal avenue to ensure the effectiveness
of SCM processes and identify areas for improvement. They provide leadership with factual
information about the health and effectiveness of the unit and training. Accurate assessments of
personnel proficiency and processes are critical to gauging unit effectiveness. This program is
AFMCI20-211 14 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                      9


intended to enhance cross-tell and facilitate benchmarking, while allowing latitude to adapt it for
local needs. QA assessments will be conducted through the use of evaluations, inspections, and
observations.
   3.6.1. Evaluations. Represent the direct evaluation of a SCM action, inspection, or training
   conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used to evaluate job
   proficiency, degree of training, and compliance with technical data or instructions. Any
   individual performing, supervising, or evaluating SCM tasks are subject to a direct
   evaluation. Evaluations are rated as ―Pass‖ or ―Fail‖. A ―Fail‖ assessment is defined as
   failing any major question/process or exceeding the AQL on the assessment checklist.
       3.6.1.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is the over-the-shoulder (direct) evaluation of
       an individual or team conducting/performing a SCM action. Use PEs to evaluate job
       proficiency, degree of training and compliance with technical orders (TOs) and other
       directives, determine the accuracy and efficiency of technical procedures assess
       compliance with TOs and other directives, accurately document results of evaluations.
       3.6.1.2. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE). An EPE is the direct evaluation of a
       QA individual or any individual performing a quality/compliance or quality assurance
       function in a unit.
       3.6.1.3. Trainer Proficiency Evaluations (TPE). A TPE is the direct evaluation of a unit
       instructor/trainer to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs also
       assess weapon system, equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods and
       techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training
       programs. Any individual training personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE.
   3.6.2. Inspections. Represent inspections of equipment and processes, often through the use
   of functional checklists and other applicable checklists, to ensure compliance with
   established standards. Inspections are rated as ―Pass‖ or ―Fail‖. A ―Fail‖ assessment is
   defined as failing any major question/process or exceeding the AQL on the assessment
   checklist.
       3.6.2.1. Quality Verification Inspection (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
       condition or a process after an inspection, repair action, or process has been completed by
       a technician or supervisor to assess if it was properly completed. The QVI finding should
       reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific
       discrepancies.
       3.6.2.2. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or evaluations
       and may include, but are not limited to, inspections of: equipment forms, doc ument
       control procedures and file plans, consolidated tool kits, inventory controls, TO files,
       vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, and other interest items identified by
       Headquarters Air Force and MAJCOMs. SIs may be compliance or proficiency oriented.
   3.6.3. Observations. Observations will encompass safety, security, tool usage, general
   maintenance practices, TO usage, nuclear surety, etc. Represents observed events or
   conditions with safety implications or technical violations not related to an evaluation or
   inspection that are considered unsafe, not in accordance with established procedures, or in
   the case of equipment, unfit to operate.

         3.6.3.1. Detected Safety Violation (DSV). A DSV is an observed unsafe act by an
         individual. The QA evaluator must stop the unsafe act immediately. Do not document a
         separate DSV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since the unsafe act
         automatically results in a ―Fail‖ rating. Annotate the failure with ―Safety‖ when a safety
         violation is committed during an evaluation.
         3.6.3.2. Technical Data Violation (TDV). A TDV is an observation of any person
         performing maintenance or another SCM process without the required technical data
         present at the job site and in use. The technician must have knowledge of all general
         directives associated with the job prior to performing the task. Do not document a
         separate TDV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since failure to use
         technical data automatically results i n a ―Fail‖ rating. Annotate the failure with ―Tech
         Data‖ when a TDV is committed during an evaluation.
         3.6.3.3. Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR). A UCR is an unsafe or unsatisfactory
         condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to the work center supervisor. UCRs will be
         documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the condition.
      3.6.4. Technical Orders Discrepancy Categories.
         3.6.4.1. Category I (CAT I). A required inspection/TO procedural item missed or
         improperly completed. This category is a specific work card item or TO step, note,
         caution, or warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major or
         minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
         3.6.4.2. Category II (CAT II). An obvious defect, which could have been readily
         detected by a technician or supervisor, but is not a specific work card item or TO step,
         note, caution, or warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major
         or minor to indicate the discrepancy’s relative severity.
3.7. QA Assessment Focus Areas. Assessments will concentrate on the following areas:
Compliance with Nuclear Surety Standards (if applicable); Qualified and Proficient Workforce;
Compliance with TO, Instructions, Manuals, and Directives; Compliance and Management of
Safety Programs; Facilities and Equipment Condition; and Asset Accountability. The QA Unit
Report will group unit deficiencies in these focus areas.
      3.7.1. Compliance with Nuclear Surety Standards (if applicable). Personnel at all levels are
      responsible for ensuring nuclear weapon systems, NWRM, Master Nuclear Certification
      Listing (MNCL), and Nuclear Certified Equipment (NCE) are safe, secure, and reliable.
      Ensure weapon system safety rules, owner/user security, and reliability standards are strictly
      adhered to. Nuclear surety is outlined in AFI 91-101 Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety
      Program and defined as materiel, personnel, and procedures which contribute to the
      security, safety, and reliability of nuclear weapons and to the assurance that there will be no
      nuclear weapon accidents, incidents, unauthorized weapon detonations, or degradation in
      performance at the target.
      3.7.2. Qualified and Proficient Workforce. Ensure a properly trained and qualified
      workforce is maintained to accomplish the mission. Commanders are responsible for
      ensuring unit personnel receive the proper training to accomplish the mission. Factors that
      impede the unit’s ability to adequately achieve or maintain a qualified workforce should be
      identified to higher headquarters.
AFMCI20-211 14 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  11


   3.7.3. Compliance with TO, Instructions, Manuals, and Directives. Personnel at all levels
   are responsible and accountable for enforcing mandatory standards. Ensure all applicable
   TOs, instructions, manuals, and directives are complete, current, and used. This includes
   ensuring required forms and records are properly completed and maintained in accordance
   with applicable directives for any logistics-related activity. The following three sub-
   categories will be used to assess performance in this focus area and to facilitate trend
   analysis:
      3.7.3.1. Human Factors: Internal/External situational elements that result in incorrect
      decision making processes (i.e. stress, time, distractions, complacency, etc…).
      3.7.3.2. Inadequate Guidance: The governing guidance is incorrect or poorly stated
      leading to improper processes or actions (i.e. TOs, AFIs, Supplements, Operating
      Instructions (OI), Policy Letters, etc…).
      3.7.3.3. Documentation: This category indicates a failure to properly document an
      action, process or task (i.e. removing/replacing component, appointment letters, training
      completion documentation, etc.)
   3.7.4. Compliance and Management of Safety Programs.            Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for minimizing risk to equipment and personnel.
   3.7.5. Facilities and Equipment Condition. Supervisors at all levels are required to ensure
   adequate facilities and equipment required to accomplish the mission are available and
   properly maintained. Commanders are responsible for identifying facility and equipment
   conditions and shortfalls that impact mission accomplishment to the appropriate
   agency/higher headquarters.
   3.7.6. Asset Accountability. Personnel at all levels are responsible for ensuring the
   accountability of tools, materiel, equipment, and weapons. This includes ensuring Positive
   Inventory Control (PIC) of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, NWR M, classified
   assets, Controlled Cryptographic Item/Communications Security (CCI/COMSEC),
   equipment, serialized control items, small arms, conventional munitions, and sensitive related
   materiel. It includes ensuring that accurate SCM data is reflected for the materiel in
   appropriate functional information management systems.
3.8. QA Assessment Procedures.
   3.8.1. The QA Section will notify the Commander and CM immediately of all major
   findings or failures related to safety, security, or nuclear surety. Additionally, the QA
   Section will suspense assessments receiving a ―Fail‖, ―DSV‖, ―TDV‖, or ―UCR‖ to the
   appropriate flight commander/superintendent for corrective action(s).
   3.8.2. Work centers will respond to all findings by stating the action taken to resolve the
   identified problem(s) to include an ―implementation date or estimated closure date.‖ Root
   cause analysis will be conducted for all major findings (identified by the CM to determine
   underlying causes and appropriate corrective action. The QA Section can assist, but not be
   part of the RCA team, with conducting root cause analysis. Work center responses will be
   routed through the superintendent and flight commander before reaching the QA Section.
   Unit commanders/directors will be briefed on open/closed items monthly. Confirmation of
 12                                                         AFMCI20-211 14 NOVEMBER 2011


      immediate corrections or planned corrective actions to resolve major findings or failures will
      be routed and returned to the CM within five duty days.
      3.8.3. Evaluators must review all individuals’ On-The-Job-Training (OJT) Records for
      evaluations receiving a ―Fail‖, ―DSV‖, or ―TDV‖ to verify training documentation (i.e. have
      individuals been trained, etc.). Identify discrepancies in documentation to the unit training
      manager for follow-up action. At no time will the evaluation ratings be changed based on
      OJT Record documentation discrepancies alone.
      3.8.4. Results of all assessments will be recorded in the QA database. NOTE: File
      maintenance can be done via hard copy or electronically in the QA database. If done
      electronically, ensure routine backups are accomplished.
      3.8.5. All assessment findings (i.e. ―Failed evaluation‖, ―inspection‖, or ―observations‖) will
      include a reference to the TO, Instruction, and/or command standard violated of each finding
      prior to the determination to include that finding in the QA database. Evaluators will review
      assessment results with the person(s) supervisor evaluated upon completion of each
      assessment.
      3.8.6. Assessment Findings will be categorized into one of the six Assessment Focus Areas
      used in the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP).
         3.8.6.1. Assessment Findings are validated deficiencies and will be tracked at the unit
         level until resolved.
             3.8.6.1.1. Major Finding. A deficiency that results or could result in widespread or
             significant mission impact or failure.
             3.8.6.1.2. Minor Finding. A deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has
             minor mission impact.
3.9. Assessment Frequency.
      3.9.1. All SCM personnel must be assessed at least once each year. The CM will ensure the
      number of assessments will be equally allocated, as appropriate given the complexity of the
      assessment, for each week within the monthly time period.
      3.9.2. Available personnel are those ―on station‖ performing tasks – including augmenting
      forces. Individuals who are off station will not be counted.
      3.9.3. Assessments must be conducted over all shifts, incl uding weekends as applicable to
      the individual duty sections.
      3.9.4. Assessments shall continue to be conducted during exercises, contingency operations,
      and file maintenance. Evaluators should make every effort to be unobtrusive.
3.10. Unit Annual Assessment.
      3.10.1. Procedures
         3.10.1.1. The QA Section must evaluate each element within the AFGLSC annually (at
         least once each twelve months). The assessment team will consist of QA team and
         functional subject matter experts for each functional area. At the ESC/HNC, each
         element with supply chain responsibilities must be evaluated each year. The Commander
         may require more frequent visits.
AFMCI20-211 14 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   13


     3.10.1.2. Revisit unit not earlier than 60 days and no more than 120 days after initial visit
     to check each major finding found during the annual assessment.
     3.10.1.3. Unit Annual Assessment Plan. The QA Section shall develop and maintain a
     schedule indicating the areas that will be visited and the proposed month of the visit. The
     QA Section will develop an assessment plan showing areas, types, and numbers of
     assessment that will be conducted and provide copies of the plan and schedule to all
     flights and Commanders.
     3.10.1.4. When developing the plan, the CM will:
        3.10.1.4.1. Address areas of concern identified by Commander(s) and unit
        leadership, Center QA, and CM.
        3.10.1.4.2. Tailor the plan for each squadron.
        3.10.1.4.3. Review, formalize and distribute the assessment plan.
     3.10.1.5. Assessment must be conducted within 60 days (plus or minus) of the date of the
     previous year's assessment.
     3.10.1.6. The Wing/Group CC has the option to waive the annual assessment for
     squadron scheduled the month before, during, and after a MAJCOM Logistics
     Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) or Compliance Inspection (CI). This will
     provide the Commander/Director the flexibility needed to meet last-minute taskings and
     eliminate the duplication of LCAP/CI reports without diluting the effectiveness of the
     annual assessment program.
     3.10.1.7. The Commander/Director shall have one or more qualified individuals from
     another flight perform annual assessment on the QA Section.
     3.10.1.8. Unit Assessment Criteria. The QA Section shall use the standard functional
     LCAP checklists published at the HQ AFMC/A4 EIM SharePoint:
     https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/HQAFMCA4/default.aspx (Click on Community Sites
     / Quality Assurance). Compliance Inspection checklists are published on the Air Force
     Inspection     Agency     web      page   https://webapps.afrc.af.mil/afia/home.aspx.
     Additionally, Lead Commands may develop supplemental functional checklists from AF
     and Lead Command directives for use at the unit level. For assessment of technician
     proficiency and equipment condition, applicable technical data is the assessment
     standard. Local directives, additional checklists, and other methods may be added to
     conduct the assessment.
     3.10.1.9. Prior to conducting the assessment, the QA evaluator shall discuss assessment
     areas, special items of concern and discrepancies from the last assessment with the
     element supervisor.
     3.10.1.10. Assessment Exit Briefing. At the end of the assessment visit, conduct an exit
     briefing with the squadron. Thoroughly discuss all deficiencies and resolve differences
     of opinion.
     3.10.1.11. Assessment Written Report. A detailed written report of the assessment shall
     be routed through the squadron within 10 workdays after the exit briefing. Include all
 14                                                        AFMCI20-211 14 NOVEMBER 2011


         identified deficiencies, their main causes, and recommended changes. Be sure to identify
         repeat discrepancies and list the source of the original discrepancy.
         3.10.1.12. Include training requirements in the report. Specify the type of training
         recommended. Provide the Training Section with a copy of all assessment reports that
         identify training requirements.
         3.10.1.13. Replies to Assessment Reports. Replies are due to the QA Section within 30
         workdays of the date of the report. Replies will contain all corrective and preventive
         actions taken and/or planned including the need for additional root cause analysis.
         Replies will indicate whether a discrepancy is closed (corrective action completed) or
         open. The writer of the reply should include the corrective action already taken and the
         estimated completion date (ECD). ECD should be actively monitored to ensure
         corrective action is completed in a timely manner.
         3.10.1.14. Review of Replies. The QA Section will review replies. Replies should be
         adequate and completely present corrective and preventive actions. Provide approval,
         disapproval, and comments to the CM or Commander/Director.
             3.10.1.14.1. The Chain of Command QA will review replies for corrective actions in
             non-collocated organizations.
         3.10.1.15. Return replies to the appropriate squadron or work center for further action, if
         they are unacceptable.
         3.10.1.16. File completed assessment reports and replies in the QA Section.
         3.10.1.17. Report Handling. Reports generated are privileged documents. As such, the
         Air Force controls distribution. All reports generated under this program should be
         classified, released and distributed consistent with AFI 20-111, Para 4.5., LCAP Report
         Handling.
3.11. Grading. Units will receive an overall grade based on a five-tier grading scale
(Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory). The CM shall publish a
final report of assessment findings, problem areas, and recommended improvements (as
required), from the assessment for distribution to senior leaders and all inspected organizations.
      3.11.1. The CM will assign ratings that accurately reflect observed performance and will use
      the described scoring methodology as the starting point for determining grades.
      3.11.2. The five-tier Grading Scale is:

Table 3.1. Grading Scale
                               Outstanding           95 – 100%
                               Excellent             90 – 94.99%
                               Satisfactory          80 – 89.99%
                               Marginal              70 – 79.99%

3.12. Scoring. The overall score will be determined by calculating a baseline score and then
deducting for penalties.
   3.12.1. Baseline Score. The baseline score is calculated by dividing the total number of pass
   events by the total of all events. Events are defined as evaluations (paragraph 3.6.1) and
   Inspections (paragraph 3.6.2.). Do not include observations in the baseline score.
   3.12.2. Deductions. Deductions are calculated by assessing a .5% penalty for each
   observation as defined in paragraph 3.6.3. and repeat QA findings. A repeat finding is
   defined as any identified ―Major‖ finding from the previous Unit Annual Assessment.

Assessment— inspection, evaluation, or observation.
Evaluations—-represent the direct evaluation of a SCM action, inspection, or training
conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used to evaluate job proficiency,
degree of training, and compliance with technical data or instructions. Any individual
performing, supervising, or evaluating SCM tasks is subject to a direct evaluation
Personnel Evaluation—-the direct evaluation of an individual or team conducting/performing a
SCM action. PEs may be conducted on task-oriented functions such as equipment maintenance
as well as process-oriented functions such as MICAP processing.
Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations—-the direct evaluation of a QA individual or any
individual performing a quality/compliance assurance function in a unit.
Trainer Proficiency Evaluations—-the direct evaluation of a unit instructor/trainer to
determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently. TPEs also assess weapon system,
equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods and techniques; the ability to operate
trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training programs. Any individual training personnel
on a task or process is subject to a TPE.
Inspections—-represent inspections of equipment and processes, often through the use of
functional checklists and other applicable checklists, to ensure compliance with established
standards. Inspections are rated as ―Pass‖ or ―Fail‖.

Routine Inspection List (RIL)—-is an Unit developed list of routine inspections that must be
performed.
Quality Verification Inspection—-an inspection of equipment condition or a process after an
inspection, repair action, or process has been completed by a technician or supervisor to assess if
it was properly completed. The QVI finding should reflect deficiencies by the individual who
accomplished the task and identify specific discrepancies.
Special Inspections—-inspections not covered by QVIs or Evaluations and may include, but are
not limited to, inspections of: equipment forms, document control procedures and file plans,
consolidated tool kits, inventory controls, TO files, vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety
practices, FOD program, and other interest items identified by Headquarters Air Force and
MAJCOMs. SIs may be compliance or proficiency oriented.
Observations—-represents observed events or conditions with safety implications or technical
violations not related to an evaluation or inspection that are considered unsafe, not in accordance
with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate.
Detected Safety Violation—-an observed unsafe act by an individual.
Technical Data Violation—-an observation of any person performing maintenance or another
SCM process without the required technical data present at the job site and in use.
Unsatisfactory Condition Report—-an unsafe or unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV,
chargeable to the work center supervisor.
Discrepancy Category I—-a required inspection/TO procedural item missed or improperly
completed. This category is a specific work card item or TO step, note, caution, or warning for
that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major or minor to indicate the
discrepancy’s relative severity.
Discrepancy Category II—-an obvious defect, which could have been readily detected by a
technician or supervisor, but is not a specific work card item or TO step, note, caution, or
warning for that specific evaluated task. Use sub-classification of major or minor to indicate the
discrepancy’s relative severity.
Major Finding—-A deficiency that results or could result in widespread or significant mission
impact or failure.
Minor Finding—-A deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has minor mission impact.
