SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include designation of unit responsibilities and updates to the Aircrew Support Critique Form.
Minor changes were made throughout and include reference updates and editing errors.
1. Overview.
   1.1. Prime Knight is an all-encompassing activity for all transient aircrews and is intended to
   maximize the mission readiness and effectiveness of any transient aircrew. The ultimate goal
   of this program is to provide transient aircrews with a service that will allow them to proceed
 2                                                          INCIRLIKABI10-207 6 JULY 2012


     directly from the aircraft to crew rest quarters, provide support during crew rest period, and
     provide movement from crew rest quarters to pre-mission activities without unnecessary
     stops or disruption. The consolidated efforts of aircrews and many unit service organizations
     are required to make this program a success. The organizations included in this important
     activity are by no means limited to 728th Air Mobility Squadron Air Mobility Control Center
     (728 AMS/AMCC), 39th Operations Squadron Airfield Management Operations (39
     OS/OSAB), 39th Logistics Readiness Squadron Transportation (39 LRS/LGRVO), 39th
     Force Support Squadron Lodging (39 FSS/FSVL) and 39th Force Support Squadron Food
     Services (39 FSS/FSVFF).
     1.2. Prime Knight is a mandatory service, upon request, provided to all transient aircrews
     remaining overnight at Incirlik Air Base. Aircrews not remaining overnight may still require
     assistance, upon request, for Turkish Passport Police in/out stamping, gate pass paperwork,
     and Turkish Customs requirements. These limited services will be provided as though the
     aircrew were remaining overnight. Incirlik’s supporting commanders’ involvement and
     attention are essential to a successful program guaranteeing transient aircrews the highest
     quality support available.
     1.3. The 39th Operations Squadron Airfield Operations Flight Commander (39 OS/OSA), is
     the overall Prime Knight Manager for the 39th Air Base Wing and the 728 AMS/AMCC
     Flight Commander is the Air Mobility Command's (AMC) Prime Knight Manager for the
     728 AMS. Coordination will be accomplished with the 39th Maintenance Squadron (39
     MXS),
     39th Mission Support Group (39 MSG), and 39th Operations Squadron (39 OS) as necessary
     to provide assistance for transient crews from arrival through departure. Each unit is also
     responsible for ensuring their staffs are trained and organized to perform Prime Knight
     Support.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Prime Knight Manager.
        2.1.1. The Prime Knight Manager is accountable for ensuring supporting agencies have
        all resources ready to provide support during each aircrew’s stay at Incirlik. At a
        minimum, the Prime Knight Manager will:
            2.1.1.1. Develop, maintain and execute the Prime Knight Program.
            2.1.1.2. Develop/coordinate base handling and support plans and policies to provide
            all transient aircrews with timely transportation, lodging, and access to hot meals.
            The intent of Prime Knight is to expedite transient aircrews into crew rest by
            providing services that allow them to proceed directly from the aircraft to crew rest
            quarters with no intervening stops (except to get orders stamped, store weapons, and
            accommodate crew requests), provide support during crew rest period, and provide
            services that enable them to proceed from crew rest quarters to the aircraft to begin
            preflight duties with only one intervening stop per crew position.
            2.1.1.3. Ensure the base information packet contains the following minimum items:
            Base map, information on meals (locations on and off base, operating hours, in-flight
            menu), lodging and transportation phone numbers, mission support information, and
            Prime Knight critique form.
