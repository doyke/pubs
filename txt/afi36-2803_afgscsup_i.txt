                                           Chapter 2

  WHEN TO RECOMMEND AN INDIVIDUAL FOR A US MILITARY DECORATION

2.1. Eligibility. All military personnel on active duty are eligible for consideration for a US
military decoration. Members of Reserve components, while participating in authorized periods
of training or while in inactive status, are eligible for consideration of a military decoration.
Recognize members assigned to DoD activities with either an Air Force or DoD award. Do not
use approval or disapproval of either the Air Force or DoD award as the basis for consideration
of the other award.
2.2. Submitting Recommendations:
   2.2.1. Do not submit recommendations in a token effort to "do something for your people."
   2.2.2. Restrict recommendations to recognizing meritorious service, outstanding
   achievement, or acts of heroism that clearly place individuals above his or her peers.
   2.2.3. Base recommendations on specific projects, plans, programs, or actions which are or
   will be beneficial to the Air Force.
   2.2.4. Superior duty performance, attainment of honors based solely on academic
   achievement (such as graduating with honors from a noncommissioned officer academy or
   other courses of instruction), or receipt of other forms of recognition (for example, selection
   as airman of the month or year or identification as a superior performer by the Inspector
   General) do not in themselves justify a recommendation for a military decoration.
   2.2.5. Each decoration prescribes standards which define the degree and magnitude of an act,
   achievement, or service considered worthy for awarding that particular decoration. (See
   Table 2.1) Do not base award of a spe-cific decoration upon an individual's grade, but on the
   level of responsibility and manner of performance.
       2.2.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Attachment 9 (Added) is the AFGSC DSM/LOM/AmnM
       processing guide.
   2.2.6. No individual is automatically entitled to an award upon completion of an operational
   TDY or departure for an assignment. Do not establish preconditions for an award. Do not
   use military decorations for incentives or as prizes in contests.
   2.2.7. Evaluate all related facts regarding the service of any person before recommending or
   awarding a decora-tion.
   2.2.8. The reassignment or retirement of a commander or supervisor is not a basis for
   recommending decorations to subordinates.
   2.2.9. Award only one decoration for the same act, achievement, or period of service.
   2.2.10. Do not award or present a decoration to any person whose entire service for the
   period covered by the decoration has not been honorable.
   2.2.11. (Added-AFGSC) Commanders must be judicious in examining the “whole person
   concept” when submitting an individual for a decoration. Although individuals with quality
   force indicators may be considered to have served honorably, it is often inconsistent to
 12                                                AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   recommend these individuals for a decoration. This may send a signal to other unit members
   that such behavior is condoned.
2.3. Recommendations Based on Meritorious Service. Recommendations are based upon a
completed period of service.
   2.3.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS). A move from one geographical area to another.
   If the recommendation is based on a single assignment, the closeout date will not be before
   the member’s final MPF out processing date. On rare occasions, i.e., base closure, unit
   deactivation, etc., consider a decoration for service involving assignments in two commands,
   providing the individual being reassigned did not receive an award from losing command.
   The losing command must provide input for the service at that command and must concur
   with the level of decoration recommended.
       2.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) For PCS decorations, the period of service is normally from
       the date arrived station to the projected departure date. However, the start date will not
       overlap a previous decoration for meritorious service. Members cannot be submitted for
       an extended tour decoration when they have a projected PCS assignment.
   2.3.2. Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). Reassignment from one unit to another on
   the same base or from one office or duty section to another located at the same organization.
   The new assignment must be markedly different from the previous duty to meet the intent of
   the completed period of service requirement.
   2.3.3. Extended Tour (EXT TOUR). Not a PCS or PCA, but clearly outstanding and
   unmistakably excep-tional service for an extended period of at least 3 years for award of the
   Bronze Star Medal (BSM) and lesser decorations or at least 4 years for award of the LOM:
       2.3.3.1. Consider all completed period of service awards regardless of the time period
       elapsed after receiving an award under the extended tour provision, if the
       accomplishments or service warrants a separate award.
       2.3.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Extended tour decorations allow commanders to provide
       immediate recognition to individuals who have performed at a sustained superior level
       for at least 3 years. These awards are not an automatic entitlement upon the completion
       of 3 years on station.
   2.3.4. Retirement. Review records and consider the individual's entire career to determine
   the appropriate level of decoration for retirement. Prepare the recommendation using the
   most recent period of service. NOTE: Decorations for retirement normally terminate on the
   last day of the month for Regular Air Force personnel. Process recommendations for
   retirement in time for a presentation ceremony and to permit processing and appropriate
   entries on retirement documents.
   2.3.4. (AFGSC) Provide statement in the nomination package that the individual’s entire
   career was reviewed and this level of decoration is appropriate for retirement.
2.4. Recommendations Based on Outstanding Achievement. Recognize a single, specific act
or accomplishment separate and distinct from regularly assigned duties, such as successfully
completing important projects or on reaching major milestones of a long-term project or
negotiations or accomplishments in a temporary duty (TDY) status. (A significant project
accomplished within regularly assigned duties may meet the criteria.):
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                              13


   2.4.1. An outstanding achievement award covers a short period of time with definite
   beginning and ending dates. Submit at any time within the prescribed time limits.
   2.4.2. Submit a recommendation only when you have no other way to recognize the
   achievement and waiting would diminish the significance of the accomplishment. Do not use
   outstanding achievement to justify decorations when the conditions for a completed period of
   service have not been met.
   2.4.3. You may recommend an award for meritorious service at the end of assignment even
   if the individual received an award for outstanding achievement during the time included in
   the recommendation; however, do not include previously recognized acts or achievements in
   the justification for the later award.
       2.4.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) When submitting a decoration based on meritorious service
       for a member who has received a decoration for outstanding achievement during the
       same period, attach a copy of the narrative or citation of the achievement decoration to
       verify dual recognition is not an issue.
2.5. Recommendations Based on Heroism. Clearly state the act characterizes courage,
intrepidity, or gallantry. When the act involved voluntary risk of life, you must clearly show that
the individual would not have been censured had he or she not voluntarily accomplished the act.
2.6. Recommendations Based on Aerial Achievements. Recognize aircrew members involved
with operating aircraft or other personnel performing aircrew member duties.            The
recommendations must clearly substantiate exceptional performance and outstanding airmanship
above that normally expected of professional airmen.
   2.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) Helicopter criteria:
       2.6.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Helicopter aircrew new to AFGSC will not be given credit
       for missions accomplished prior to being assigned to the command. Note: Missions
       completed while assigned to AFSPC units that transitioned to AFGSC are still eligible if
       there was no break in command service. Unit commanders are the signing authority for
       recommendations. See Attachment 10 (Added).
       2.6.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) There are five helicopter sortie categories eligible for award
       of the AAM: security response (real world or exercise), missile convoy, humanitarian
       relief, Search and Rescue (SAR) and MEDEVAC. Sorties from different categories will
       not be mixed unless requesting a 70 percent waiver (para 2.6.1.4.). More than one
       AAM can be awarded from different categories within a 2-year period; however, at no
       time will more than one AAM be awarded within the same category during the 2-year
       period. All aircrew members are equally considered and eligible for recognition. Criteria
       for award of the AAM for AFGSC helicopter units include:
           2.6.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Helicopter crewmembers who are duty familiarization
           complete, current and logging primary, secondary, instructor or evaluator time and
           Tactical Response Force (TRF) personnel who are duty familiarization complete,
           current, on active aeronautical orders and logging primary time may be awarded an
           AAM for completion of 20 real world response and/or wing-level and above
           generated exercise sorties in support of missile field security operations. Qualifying
           exercise sorties can be either scramble-launched or air-alerted with or without the
14                                              AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


         TRF. For a mission to qualify, the minimum sortie duration is 30 minutes, limited to
         one sortie per day. After initial award, limit to one AAM every 2 years.
         2.6.1.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Helicopter crewmembers who are duty familiarization
         complete, current and logging primary, secondary, instructor or evaluator time may
         be awarded an AAM for completion of 20 missile convoy support missions, limited to
         one sortie per day. After initial award, limit to one AAM every 2 years.
         2.6.1.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Crewmembers who are current and logging primary,
         secondary, instructor or evaluator time may be awarded an AAM for completion of
         20 humanitarian relief missions, limited to one sortie per day. After initial award,
         limit to one AAM every 2 years.
         2.6.1.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Crewmembers who are current and logging primary,
         secondary, instructor or evaluator time may be awarded an AAM for completion of
         20 SAR missions, limited to one sortie per day. After initial award, limit to one
         AAM every 2 years.
         2.6.1.2.5. (Added-AFGSC) Crewmembers who are current and logging primary,
         secondary, instructor or evaluator time and Medical Technician (MT) and Flight
         Surgeon (FS) personnel who are duty familiarization complete, current, on active
         aeronautical orders and logging primary time may be awarded an AAM for
         completion of 10 confirmed MEDEVAC rescues. Only those rescues confirmed by
         the Joint Rescue Coordination Center (JRCC) may be counted. After initial award,
         limit to one AAM every 2 years.
     2.6.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Recommendations for the AAM should be submitted to the
     approving official within 90 days after the last qualifying flight or within 90 days of
     return from deployment.
     2.6.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Individuals who have not completed sorties/mission
     requirements for the basic AAM may still be submitted for the award. Eligibility criteria
     for the first awarded AAM may be reduced if the member has completed 70 percent of
     the required missions (e.g., 14 out of 20 missions) and the individual's participation is
     terminated due to PCS, PCA to non-flying duties, retirement, or separation (under
     honorable conditions). All 70 percent waivers apply only to the basic award regardless of
     the type of mission flown. The 70 percent rule cannot be used on subsequent awards
     (oak leaf clusters), as subsequent awards must be based on 100 percent mission
     requirements. Forward all 70 percent waivers to the next higher award authority as listed
     in AFI 36-2803, Table 1.1. for approval.
  2.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Bomber Criteria: Bomber aircrew missions are defined as all
  sorties flown under a given mission number in one crew day. Subsequent days’ sorties will
  count as additional missions even if flown under the same mission number. The mission
  must be a combat mission (O1/O2, IAW AFI11-401 table A2.2) flown within the COCOM’s
  area of responsibility boundaries and must be logged as such on a valid AFTO Form 781 or
  equivalent. All aircrew members are equally considered and eligible for recognition.
  Aircraft must enter hostile airspace as defined by the Joint Force Air Component
  Commander (JFACC). Training missions/flights do not count towards an AM or AAM
  eligibility.
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               15


       2.6.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Basic criteria for AM: Missions flown as directed by the Air
       Tasking Order (ATO) or COCOM authority. Mission symbols logged as O1/O2 are
       combat missions. Each AM eligible mission may be applied towards an AM or AAM,
       but not both.
       2.6.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Basic criteria for AAM: Missions flown as directed by the
       ATO or COCOM authority. Mission symbols logged as O1/O2 are combat missions;
       AAM eligible missions cannot be applied towards AM credit.
   2.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Individuals who have not completed sortie requirements for the
   basic AM or AAM may request a waiver. Ensure the member has completed 70 percent of
   the required missions (i.e., 14 out of 20 missions) and individual's participation is terminated
   due to PCS or PCA to non-flying duties, retirement, or separation (under honorable
   conditions). All 70 percent waivers apply only to the basic award, not subsequent awards
   (oak leaf clusters). Subsequent awards must be based on 100 percent. If the 70 percent
   waiver was applied to the basic award, the first oak leaf cluster (1OLC) must include the
   remainder. For instance, if the basic AM award was for 15 missions, then the 1OLC requires
   a minimum of 25 missions.
   2.6.4. (Added-AFGSC) Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) Aircrews are required 50
   missions. If member are in a PCS status and have completed 35 ABNCP missions, unit can
   submit member for AAM.
2.7. Posthumous Recommendations. Base posthumous awards using the same criteria you use
for a living person.

NOTES:

1. Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for authorization, specific award requirements, and brief description
of these decorations.
2. While engaged in an action against an enemy of the US, or while engaged in military
operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 17


foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing force in which the US is not a
belligerent party.
3. Awarded for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call
of duty. See DoD 1348.33-M for courtesies and privileges. Award the Air Force design of the
MOH on or after 1 November 1965. (Refer to Attachment 2 for application enrollment forms.)
4. Awarded for extraordinary heroism, not justifying award of the MOH.
5. Awarded for exceptionally meritorious service to the US in a duty of great responsibility.
The basic award may be made for a completed period of outstanding service; however, restrict
subsequent awards prior to retirement to extraordinary, spe-cific achievements during one or
more periods of service. This is the highest peacetime Air Force decoration awarded.
6. Awarded for gallantry in action that does not warrant the MOH or AFC. Gallantry in action
means heroism of high de-grees including risk of life.
7. Awarded for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service to
the US. In peacetime, awards to US military personnel are limited to: Service in an extremely
difficult duty that is performed in a clearly exceptional manner, if such service is of marked
national or international significance to the Air Force or the DoD, or service that has aided the
US in furthering its national policies, or service which has furthered the interest or the security of
the US or service that has furthered the interests or the security of the US, or any nation allied or
associated with the US during a period of national emergency declared by the President or
Congress. Superior performance of normal duties will not alone justify award of this decoration.
8. There are four degrees awarded to foreign military personnel. (Degrees of Chief Commander,
Commander, Officer, and Legionnaire). Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for the specific award criteria
for each degree.
9. While participating in aerial flight. Heroism or achievement must be entirely distinctive,
involving operations that are not routine. Not awarded for sustained operational activities and
flights.
10. Involving voluntary risk of life under conditions other than those of conflict with an armed
enemy of the US. The saving of a life or the success of the voluntary heroic act is not essential.
Do not award for normal performance of duties.
11. Not involving participation in aerial flight. Award the "V" device for heroism (see
Attachment 3). Do not wear more than one "V" device.
12. Awarded for wounds received or death after being wounded. While serving in any capacity
with one of the US Armed Forces after 5 April 1917. Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for specific
conditions.
13. Any US civilian while serving under competent authority in any capacity with the Air Force.
14. Awarded for outstanding noncombat meritorious achievement or service to the US. Level of
achievement or service is less than that required for LOM.
15. Do not award to foreign military personnel in the grade of brigadier general or higher.
 18                                                  AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


16. Awarded for single acts of achievement while participating in aerial flight. Required
achievement is less than that re-quired for the DFC, but must be accomplished with distinction
above and beyond that expected of professional airmen. Not awarded for peace time sustained
operational activities and flights.
17. Awarded for sustained meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight.
MAJCOMs, FOAS, DRUs will identify the missions and positions to qualify for the award. Not
awarded for single event flights.
18. Awarded for outstanding achievement or meritorious service; or acts of courage that do not
meet the requirements for award of the AmnM or BSM, and sustained meritorious performance
by crew members.
19. Do not award to general or flag officer grade. Place emphasis on award to outstanding
company grade officers and jun-ior NCOs whose achievements and services meet the standards.
20. Awarded for outstanding achievement or meritorious service that do not meet the
requirements of the AFCM. Place emphasis on award to junior officers and airmen whose
achievements and service meet the standards. Do not award more than one AFAM during a 1-
year period except under extraordinary circumstances. Do not award for aerial achievement or
retirement.
21. Do not award to colonels (0-6) or above.
22. Award of the “V” device for a contingency deployment operation will be dependent upon
the AOR being declared a hostile environment by the JCS, or hostile acts identified by the
unified commander or higher authority. Award of the “V” device is based solely on the acts or
services of individuals who meet the basic creteria of the AFCM/AFAM, and who are exposed to
personal hazards due to direct hostile action during a contingency deployment operation. For a
single event, Air Force Component Commanders may authorize the “V” device when a single
event, i.e., terrorist act, isolated combat-type incident, etc., warrants the “V’ device distinction.
The “V” device will not be awarded for normal peacetime acts or services. Award of the “V”
device is authorized only for events or situations which occurred on or after 11 January 1996.

                                           Chapter 3

                       GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES

3.1. Initiating a Recommendation. Submit recommendations as soon as possible following the
act, achievement, or service. Enter each recommendation (except the Purple Heart) into official
channels within 2 years and award within 3 years of the act, achievement, or service performed.
NOTE: A recommendation is placed in official channels when the recommending official signs
the recommendation (DECOR6 and justification) and a higher official in the chain of command
endorses it.
   3.1.1. You may resubmit recommendations that were placed into official channels within the
   prescribed time limits, but no award was made because the recommendation was lost or was
   not processed or acted on due to administrative error. Reconsideration is contingent on the
   presentation of credible evidence that the recommendation was officially placed in military
   channels or was submitted, but not acted on through loss or inadvertence. Process the
   recommendation following the original channels. NOTE: When organizations no longer
   exist, process the recommendation through the replacement organizations.
   3.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Refer to Table 3.5. of this supplement for decoration suspenses and
   special processing procedures. A late submission or administrative oversight significantly
   increases the likelihood that a decoration will not be available for the presentation ceremony.
3.2. Preparing a Recommendation. Submit a Recommendation for Decoration Printout (RDP-
DECOR-6), descriptive justification, and citation for an individual recommendation. Submit an
RDP, descriptive justification, and citation for each person when more than one person is
recommended for the same decoration and for the same act, achievement, or service.
3.2. (AFGSC)Preparing a Recommendation. Primary flight crewmembers on the same flight
can submit the same descriptive justification for a decoration for the same
act/achievement/service.
   3.2.1. Content.  Classify recommendations according to content.           Consider a
   recommendation "for official use only" until the awarding authority announces its final
   decision.
   3.2.2. Classified. Do not include any classified, highly sensitive, or special category
   information requiring special handling procedures in regular recommendations for
   decorations.
       3.2.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Avoid classified decoration recommendations. Outline the
       performance, which justifies the award in unclassified terms, and do not refer to units,
       locations or operations, which in themselves cause the narrative to be classified. In those
       extremely rare cases when reference to classified material is absolutely necessary to
       justify a decoration, send the unclassified portion to HQ AFGSC/A1 with a cover letter
       identifying a point of contact on the AFGSC staff maintaining the classified portion of
       the decoration. Transmit the classified material to the point of contact who will verbally
       brief the appropriate award authority concerning the act or achievement.

   3.2.3. RDP-DECOR6. Prepare an individual recommendation on an RDP-DECOR 6. Sign
   RDP and attach the justification.
      3.2.3.1. Use a memorandum or letter for an individual recommendation for a foreign
      officer, separated member, or a member from another service. The memorandum or
      letter must contain same information as the RDP and must be signed.
   3.2.4. Descriptive Justification. Fully justify all award recommendations to avoid the
   perception that decorations are automatic. Avoid generalities, broad or vague terminology,
   superlative adjectives or a recapitulation of duties performed. The justification must provide
   concrete examples of exactly what the person did, how well he or she did it, what the impact
   or benefits were, and how that person significantly exceeded duty performance. Use the
   following formats:
      3.2.4.1. Prepare Air Force Achievement Medal (AFAM) justification on Air Force Form
      642, Air Force Achievement Medal and Air Force Commendation Medal
      Justification or on the AF Form 2274, Air Force Achievement Medal Certificate.
      3.2.4.2. Prepare Air Force Commendation Medal justification (AFCM) on AF Form 642
      or on bond paper when the description does not lend itself to the AF Form 642.
      Justification must be signed. Use appropriate signature block.
      3.2.4.3. You may use copies of EPR/OPRs, covering the award period, to justify the
      AFCM or the Meritorious Service Medal (MSM).
      3.2.4.4. Prepare other decoration justification as a narrative using a blocked,
      paragraphed, or talking paper format (bullet). Limit Distinguished Service Medal (DSM)
      justification to three pages. A narrative justification is optional for retirement conditions
      for all grades for Active Duty General Officers. Descriptive justification is required on
      all Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel for all grades and decoration
      conditions. Limit Legion of Merit and lesser decoration justification to one page.
      Justification must be signed. Use appropriate signature block.
      3.2.4.5. Prepare justification for decorations based on retirement as an endorsement
      memorandum or letter or using the above formats.
   3.2.5. Citations. To complete citations, see Attachment 4 and Attachment 5.
   3.2.6. Additional Attachments. A recommendation may include: supporting documentation,
   if the person initiating the recommendation does not have firsthand knowledge of the act or
   service performed or official supporting records. Attach a copy of the citation for
   outstanding achievement to the recommendation when a decoration based on outstanding
   achievement was awarded during the period of service being recognized by a meritorious
   service recommendation.
3.3. Processing a Recommendation. Forward all recommendations through the normal chain
of command of the person being recommended. The commander or vice commander at each
headquarters designated to review recommendations must personally review and sign the
forwarding endorsement for each. Each intermediate commander must recommend approval or
disapproval of the recommendation or recommend award of a higher or lesser decoration:
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 21


     3.3.1. Forward recommendations placed in official channels to the designated approval or
     disapproval authority for final action regardless of whether intermediate endorsing officials
     or commanders determine the award does not meet the criteria.
     3.3.1. (AFGSC) The chain of command for Official Channels is defined as Recommending
     Official (originator or first line supervisor), Squadron commander, Group commander, Wing
     commander, NAF CC/CV, AFGSC/A1KK. AFGSC/A1KK will process to AFGSC/CC/CV,
     AFPC, and SAFPC as necessary. Process recommendations to the level of authority as
     defined by Table 1.1. above.
        3.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Decorations recommended for downgrade by the commander
        will include citations for both awards (original and recommended).
     3.3.2. Process recommendations submitted on individuals or on a group of individuals from
     various organizations to recognize a single act or outstanding achievement through the
     project or operation commander's chain of command. Obtain concurrence from the
     recommendee's commander prior to submitting the recommendation.
        3.3.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) When more than one individual is recommended for a
        decoration based upon the same act or achievement, all recommendations will be
        submitted at one time. With exception to Primary flight crewmembers on the same flight,
        attach to each recommendation a list of the names of all individuals being submitted, as
        well as a separate narrative for each person outlining that person's contributions to the
        overall success. A group narrative is acceptable; however, a thorough explanation of
        each individual's accomplishments must be included. Commander concurrence must be
        with each individual recommendation.

Notes:
Recommendations for decorations received by HQ AFGSC/A1 61 days past the closeout date
require a letter of explanation for late submission signed by the wing/group/NAF commander
or director on the AFGSC Staff.
1. Notify HQ AFGSC/A1 as soon as the decision is made to submit a decoration requiring HQ
USAF approval.
2. Begin preparation as soon as retirement/separation/change of command date is known or
upon completion of the achievement or act. Official MPS notification is not required.
3. For retirement/separation, consider terminal leave requests when indicating the desired
presentation date.

  3.3.3. Forward recommendations requiring SAF approval through command channels to HQ
  AFPC/DPPPRA. Send original and one copy of the DECOR 6, narrative, endorsement
  correspondence, and original, and 6 copies of the citation, with social security number (SSN).
  Enter a personnel transaction (PERSTRAN HCS40) into the system. Verify the transaction
  was accepted prior to sending the decoration package to HQ AFPC/DPPPRA. If the
  recommendation is classified, send the unclassified portion to HQ AFPC/DPPPRA and send
  the classified portion under separate cover directly to HQ AFPC/DPPPRA. Forward
  recommendations for Air Force decorations from joint or unified commands to HQ 11th
  Wing.
  3.3.4. Forward recommendations for Air Force decorations to sister service personnel to the
  Air Force commander who exercises awarding authority as if the individual were an Air
  Force member. Obtain written concurrence through HQ AFPC/DPPPRA from the
  individual's parent service before final approval. Provide HQ AFPC/DPPPRA with two
  complete copies of the recommendation package.
  3.3.5. Process decorations for centrally managed reservists (those assigned to the Chaplain,
  Medical, Legal, AFOSI, or Intelligence career fields) to approval or disapproval authority at
  the local level (the same as active duty personnel) using the award approving authority of the
  unit of attachment. Decoration recommendations for individual reservists will be processed
  to the award authority for consideration as outlined in Table 3.3.
  3.3.6. Reviewing officials at any level may return recommendations for administrative
  correction or for more supporting data. Do not consider these recommendations as having
  been removed from official channels, but return them without delay to the reviewing or
  awarding authority.
  3.3.7. Recommending officials who wish to withdraw recommendations already in official
  channels must send a memorandum or letter through command channels to the awarding
  authority requesting disapproval, with reasons. Intermediate endorsing officials or
  commanders must forward these recommendations. Their endorsement must recommend
  either approval or disapproval to the awarding authority.
  3.3.8. Forward requests for reconsidering disapproved or downgraded recommendations
  through the same official channels as the original recommendation. The justification for
  reconsideration must be in memorandum or letter format, not to exceed one page. Attach a
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                                 23


   copy of the original recommendation with all endorsements and new citation. Submit request
   into official channels within 1 year of the date of the awarding authority's decision. A one-
   time reconsideration by the award authority is final.
3.4. Completing a Recommendation. Once an award has been approved, prepare a certificate
(Attachment 7), impress a seal on the citation and publish special orders. See Table 3.1 for
distribution of the elements. See Table 3.2 for actions on disapproved decorations:
   3.4.1. Reflect the oak leaf cluster or V device, if applicable, on the certificate and/or citation.
   A designated authority signs the certificates. Include the duty title below the signature.
   Place the word "Posthumous" below the decoration's title on the citation when the basis for
   the award is posthumous. Do not place Posthumous on the certificate.
   3.4.2. Publish the authority for awarding a decoration in the award authority's special order.
   The effective date of all decorations is the closing date of the service period recognized
   regardless of the order date:
       3.4.2.1. Special orders announcing approved decorations must include award authority
       and descriptive basis for the award; recipient's grade, name, social security number
       (SSN), personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, the date the recommendation for
       decoration printout (RDP) was computer generated, and the condition code. Identify
       members of the other branches of the Armed Forces and foreign military personnel
       accordingly. Include also the number of the oak leaf cluster or valor, if applicable;
       statement that decoration is posthumous, if applicable; date or period covered; effective
       date, when publishing order before closing date of the period covered; and the effective
       date of the period covered. See Table 3.1 and Attachment 6 for appropriate descriptive
       basis for the decorations and additional information for preparing orders.
       3.4.2.2. Publish special orders relating to foreign nationals and posthumous decorations
       and dispatch with other award elements.
       3.4.2.3. Award decorations in order of the service performed. However, you can base
       the decoration sequence on the order in which the decoration was approved when
       operational conditions prevented a chronological processing of the award.
3.5. Refused Decorations. A member may refuse to accept an approved decoration and may
elect not to wear that decoration. File documents which prove the indi-vidual did not accept the
award along with a copy of the citation and special order in his or her UPRG. Update the
decoration as an approved award. Do not revoke the special order.
3.6. Presenting Decorations. Timely presentation is essential.              Hold the presentation
ceremony at the earliest possible date after the award was approved:
3.6. (AFGSC)Presenting Decorations. AFGSC’s policy is to present decorations earned
within AFGSC prior to departure of recipient when possible. The objective of this policy is to
foster morale, incentive and esprit de corps by recognizing their contributions. Accordingly,
each approval authority should have procedures to ensure recommendations are processed and
award elements are available for presentation.
   3.6.1. When a second or later award of the same decoration is presented, except in awards to
   foreign nationals and those presented posthumously, the appropriate basic medal, with one or
   more oak leaf clusters (OLC) attached to the suspension ribbon, is used for presentation only
 24                                                 AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012


   (an OLC to a decoration does not indicate it is a higher award than the basic decoration).
   After the ceremony, take the presentation elements back and give the recipient the OLC.
   3.6.2. When presenting the OLC to a foreign national, attach it to the appropriate medal and
   ribbon bar. The recipient retains the complete decoration.
   3.6.3. Give the next of kin decorations which were not presented because of the recipient's
   death. The next of kin listed in order of precedence are: spouse, child/children, parents,
   brother, or sister. When presenting decorations to the primary next of kin, give, at no cost,
   duplicate elements of the decoration to the parents of the deceased. Present the duplicate
   elements during the ceremony held for the spouse, if everyone agrees, or deliver or mail
   them. Do not hold a separate ceremony for presenting duplicate elements. Present all
   decorations earned but not presented before the recipient's death at one ceremony. Hold
   presentation ceremonies according to the wishes of the next of kin.
3.7. Revoking Decorations. Revoke an award if facts, later determined, would have prevented
original approval of the award. Award authorities must seek legal advice from their base judge
advocate whenever there is doubt as to the propriety of an award action:
   3.7.1. The awarding authority revokes an award when the basis for the award no longer
   exists, for example cancellation of retirement or PCS.
   3.7.2. (Added-AFGSC) Prior to presentation, verification must be made that the basis for
   an award is valid and that no circumstances have occurred which make presentation
   inappropriate. When the basis for an award is no longer valid (e.g. canceled assignment,
   separation, etc.) return the award elements to the MPS, Awards and Decorations office, for
   appropriate disposition. If the award period is 3 years or more and the basis for the award is
   no longer valid (e.g. cancelled assignment, retirement or separation action), the commander
   may request reconsideration of the award based upon extended tour provisions (paragraph
   2.3.3.). If an award recommendation is pending approval and the basis for the award
   changes, notify the approving official. Notification will include the individual's name and
   grade, as well as the type of recommendation and the date it was mailed to the approval
   authority. If the decoration has been approved, also include the special order number.

3.8. Special Procedures for Decorations Arising from Combat Operations:
   3.8.1. To ensure consistency of decorations arising from combat operations, the NAF and
   JTF/CTF Air Force component commanders shall forward, in a timely manner, all
   recommendations for decorations arising out of combat operations not within their authority
   to approve, to the MAJCOM Commander serving as the air component commander to the
   supported CINC (or in the absence of such an officer, to a lieutenant general or general
   designated by CSAF for this purpose). To ensure timely recognition and accurate
   substantiation, nominating officials should submit award nominations within 45 days of the
   flight or event that supports the award. In the case of hostilities of limited duration, the NAF
   or JTF/CTF Air Force component commanders should have all recommendations submitted
   within 90 days after the cessation of hostilities. The MAJCOM commander, or CSAF
   designee, will consolidate decoration recommendations submitted by the NAF or Air Force
   component commanders. To the extent feasible, they should be evaluated only after they
   have been aggregated, but the benefits of aggregation (and associated delays) should be
   balanced against the goal of timely recognizing individuals’ accomplishments. If there is a
   singular, distinctive event, or other unusual factors that support expediting an award, that
   award should be processed without aggregation and the nomination package should include
   an explanation of the reason for expedited processing. After review, the MAJCOM
   commander, or CSAF designee, will forward those recommendations that he or she finds
   meet the criteria for awards to be approved above the MAJCOM level, to the Decoration
   Board of the Air Force Personnel Council.
      3.8.1.1. As long as submissions meet the timeliness requirements established by law or
      DOD guidance, proper and substantiated award recomendations will not be disapproved
      (or foregone) on the basis that they did not comply with the time goals discussed above.
   3.8.2. The Director, Secretary of the Air Foce Personnel Council (SAFPC), will approve or
   recommend approval of those awards he or she determines meet the award criteria and are
   fully substantiated.

     3.8.2.1. Resubmission and Reconsideration Procedures. If the Director, SAFPC, finds
     that a nomination package does not meet the award criteria, or does not adequately
     substantiate the proposed award, he/she will return the package to the proposing
     MAJCOM commander with a written explanation of the perceived deficiency. The
     Director, SAFPC, may also suggest other awards he/she finds appropriate. The
     MAJCOM commander may then seek review of the package by SAF/OS, through
     SAF/MI and then CSAF. In that event, the MAJCOM commander may submit any
     revised or additional substantiation to the SAFPC. If the Director, SAFPC, does not then
     change his view and grant the proposed award, he must forward the package to SAF/MI,
     with SAFPC’s comments and recommendations. SAF/MI may then approve the award, to
     the extent such award is within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, and notify
     the MAJCOM commander to that effect. If SAF/MI does not approve the award, he/she
     shall forward the package to SAF/OS, through CSAF, with recommendations for final
     decision. CSAF may provide recommendations to SAF/OS, or may disapprove the
     award.
     3.8.2.2. At any point in the reconsideration process, the proposing MAJCOM may agree
     to approval of a different award within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, or
     request the nomination package be withdrawn.

              UNITED STATES UNIT AND ORGANIZATIONAL AWARDS

4.1. Granting and Restricting Unit Awards. Grant unit awards to military units that
distinguish themselves during peacetime or in action against hostile forces or an armed enemy of
the US. Restrict awards to recognizing acts or services that place the unit's performance
significantly above that of other units of similar composition and mission responsibility. Only
grant one award for the same act, achievement, or service. Ensure only 10 percent of similar
units assigned to their command are recommended annually. For one-of-a-kind units, the awards
will be based on each unit's merits. Provide HQ AFPC/DPPPRA with a summary listing of all
approved units, with the inclusive dates, special order number, date, and conditions.
4.1. (AFGSC)Granting and Restricting Unit Awards. Nominations must be based on
“outstanding”
years, not merely good years. AFOUA/Meritorious Unit Award (MUA) submission will be
forwarded directly to HQ AFGSC/A1KK by 1 April each year. Nominations must be forwarded
through command channels. NOTE: Offsetting acts or incidents that have negatively reflected
on the unit should be taken into consideration when assessing the year overall. Consider all
factors for award submissions versus only positive accomplishments.
   4.1.1. A unit award based on an outstanding achievement does not preclude a second award
   based on meritorious service. Do not include the justification used to substantiate the
   outstanding achievement award in the recommendation for meritorious service. The unit's
   entire service must have been honorable during the distinguished act.
   4.1.1. (AFGSC) The outstanding achievement must cover a period less than 1 year and is
   characterized by definite beginning and ending dates. The specific achievement must be
   sufficiently outstanding to be readily distinguishable from meritorious service and must
   clearly warrant immediate recognition.
   4.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFOUA nominations must cover a period of at least one year and
   not to exceed two years. The closeout date will not be later than 31 December of the
   nominating year. NOTE: This is not a license for submission every 2 years. MUA
   nominations must cover a period of at least 90 continuous days during the period of military
   operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after 11 Sep 01.
4.2. Individual Entitlement. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a
period for which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly
contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit.
4.3. Specific Unit Awards. For authorization, eligibility requirements, and special provisions

  AIR FORCE ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS AND THE AIR FORCE GOOD CONDUCT
                            MEDAL

5.1. Air Force Achievement Awards. See Table 5.1 for a list of awards, specific eligibility
requirements and criteria:
   5.1.1. Make only one award of a specific Air Force achievement award to the same person.
   Award devices to denote additional awards.
   5.1.2. Air Force members may accept achievement awards awarded by a sister service. Refer
   to AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, Awards and
   Decorations Figure 4-1, for authorized awards and instructions on how to wear these awards.
5.2. Air Force Good Conduct Medal (AFGCM). Awarded to personnel in an enlisted status
for "exemplary conduct" (exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity), while in active military
service of the US. Individuals must demonstrate a positive attitude toward the Air Force and
their jobs:
   5.2.1. Service performed in a sister service is not creditable for awarding the AFGCM.
   5.2.2. Aviation cadet or officer candidate status is creditable toward award of the AFGCM.
   Service as a cadet in the Air Force Academy is not creditable.
   5.2.3. Award the AFGCM for periods of continuous service as outlined in Table 5.2.
   5.2.4. Award the Air Force Good Conduct Medal based upon specific recommendation of
   the unit commander.
   5.2.5. The MPF furnishes the AFGCM selection listing to non-PCIII units monthly to each
   member's unit commander reflecting those individuals awarded the AFGCM for the current
   month. For PCIII units, the AFGCM selection listing is produced monthly and can be found
   in end of month (EOM) in office automation at each unit. This roster reflects individuals
   awarded the AFGCM for the current month.
   5.2.6. The system automatically updates the award based on a 3-year period of continuous
   service from the AFGCM start date.
   5.2.7. The AFGCM is conspicuous by its absence. Failure to qualify for the award casts
   doubt on an individual's value as a member of the Air Force.
   5.2.8. Commanders:
       5.2.8.1. May deny the award in those cases where an individual's conduct has been less
       than exemplary.
       5.2.8.2. Will consider the immediate supervisor's recommendation in exercising their
       prerogative to deny the award.
       5.2.8.3. Prepare a memorandum or letter stating the period involved for denying or
       adjusting the award and the new start date. Commanders initiate the denial letter in
       conjunction with other action (i.e., UIF, control roster actions, or letter of reprimand)
       relating to the incident.

        5.2.8.4. Forward the letter to the MPF for update of the PDS, if you do not have PC-III
        capability, and filing in the individual's personnel records. If you have PCIII, update
        adjustment to creditable service dates and forward to Customer Service for filing in the
        individual’s personnel records.

1. If the break in combat or mission ready status exceeds 120 calendar days due to reassignment
to another combat or mis-sion duty that required upgrading in or retraining to a new system,
deduct only the enroute and retraining time from qualifying service.
2. A bronze oak leaf cluster denotes each past or subsequent award. The twelve members
selected as the Air Force Outstanding Airman of the Year wear the bronze service star. Wear the
bronze service star to the member's right of the oak leaf clusters.
3. Once credit is given for the overseas tour, PDS will automatically update. For personnel who
extend their original over-seas tour, award the ribbon when the member enters the extension.
Make only one award for the entire period unless the extension results in the individual being
credited with another tour.
4. The PDS screens the member's total active federal military service date (TAFMSD) and
updates the award based on completing 4 years military service. Service at the Uniformed
Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) is active duty service and creditable toward
award of the AFLSAR. Use Air Force Form 104, Service Medal Award Verification, to annotate
creditable awards of the AFLSAR to reflect combined periods of service.
5. Awarded for a period of 4 continuous years service computed from the date of assignment to
a training category A, B or D for individuals with a beginning date before 1 July 1972. For
individuals with a beginning date after 30 June 1972, the length of service requirement is 3
continuous years’ of service. Award individuals who accrue at least 1 year but less than 3 years
toward award of the medal and terminate their enlisted Reserve status as a commissioned or
warrant officer the medal regardless of the beginning eligibility date. Creditable service ends
when called to active duty. A period of more than 24 hours between reserve enlistments counts
as a break in service. Credit must begin anew after the break. An active duty period is not a
break in service. Do not credit service performed in the US Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or
Coast Guard Reserve components. When determining service computation, exclude service as a
commissioned officer.
6. Automatically updated when PME graduation certification data is entered in the PDS. Do not
award the ribbon to members who only complete the correspondence courses or similar training
conducted by other military services except for completion of the US Army Sergeant Major
Academy or the Navy Senior Enlisted Academy.
7. Award ribbon only once no matter how many times an individual scores "expert." Add
bronze service star to the ribbon for those personnel who, after 22 June 1972, meet the award
criteria with both the M16 rifle and issue handgun. Add only one star regardless of the number
of times a person qualifies with both weapons. Use AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons
Training Data or letter from the Small Arms Marksmanship Monitor as the source document for
this award.
8. May not be awarded for completing technical training, career development courses, and other
services" basic training. Completing later accession training (BMT, then commissioning through
a program, and so forth) will entitle a member to a subsequent award denoted by an oak leaf
cluster.

NOTES:
1. SAF approved delegation is outlined in table above. Do not delegate these authorities further.
2. SAF retains award authority for the AFC, DSM, SS, Legion of Merit, DFC, and Airman’s
Medal. The Director, Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council, acts on behalf of the SAF
and approves or disapproves the recommendations. Exception: refer to Paragraph 3.8 for
processing procedures for awards arising out of combat operations. SAF approves all awards to
US civilians and foreign military personnel or makes appropriate recommendations to the
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               83


Secretary of Defense. HQ AFPC/DPPPRA convenes the USAF Purple Heart Review Board to
finalize requests for the Purple Heart.

3.8. Special Procedures for Decorations Arising from Combat Operations:
3.8.1. To ensure consistency of decorations arising from combat operations, the NAF and
JTF/CTF Air Force component commanders shall forward, in a timely manner, all
recommendations for decorations arising out of combat operations not within their authority to
approve, to the MAJCOM Commander serving as the air component commander to the
supported CINC (or in the absence of such an officer, to a lieutenant general or general
designated by CSAF for this purpose). To ensure timely recognition and accurate substantiation,
nominating officials should submit award nominations within 45 days of the flight or event that
supports the award. In the case of hostilities of limited duration, the NAF or JTF/CTF Air Force
component commanders should have all recommendations submitted within 90 days after the
cessation of hostilities. The MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will consolidate
decoration recommendations submitted by the NAF or Air Force component commanders. To
the extent feasible, they should be evaluated only after they have been aggregated, but the
benefits of aggregation (and associated delays) should be balanced against the goal of timely
recognizing individuals’ accomplishments. If there is a singular, distinctive event, or other
unusual factors that support expediting an award, that award should be processed without
aggregation and the nomination package should include an explanation of the reason for
expedited processing. After review, the MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will forward
those recommendations that he or she finds meet the criteria for awards to be approved above the
MAJCOM level, to the Decoration Board of the Air Force Personnel Council.
3.8.1.1. As long as submissions meet the timeliness requirements established by law or DOD
gudiance, proper and substantiated award recommendations will not be disapproved (or
foregone) on the basis that they did not comply with the time goals discussed above.
3.8.2. The Director, Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (SAFPC), will or recommand
approval of those awards he or she determines meet the award criteria and are fully substantited.
3.8.2.1. Resubmission and Reconsideration Procedures. If the Director, SAFPC, finds that a
nomination package does not meet the award criteria, or does not adequately substantiate the
proposed award, he/she will return the package to the proposing MAJCOM commander with a
written explanation of the perceived deficiency. The Director, SAFPC, may also suggest other
awards he/she finds appropriate. The MAJCOM commander may then seek review of the
package by SAF/OS, through SAF/MI and then CSAF. In that event, the MAJCOM commander
may submit any revised or additional substantiation to the SAFPC. If the Director, SAFPC, does
not then change his view and grant the proposed award, he must forward the package to SAF/MI,
with SAFPC’s comments and recommendations. SAF/MI may then approve the award, to the
extent such award is within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, and notify the
MAJCOM commander to that effect. If SAF/MI does not approve the award, he/she shall
forward the package to SAF/OS, through CSAF, with recommendations for final decision.
CSAF may provide recommendations to SAF/OS, or may disapprove the award.
3.8.2.2. At any point in the reconsideration process, the proposing MAJCOM may agree to
approval of a different award within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, or request
the nomination package be withdrawn.

A9.4. (Added-AFGSC) LOM ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
  A9.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Awarded to service members for exceptionally meritorious
  conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the U.S. Normally, awards to USAF
  members are limited to service in an extremely difficult duty that is performed in a clearly
  exceptional manner, if such service is of marked national or international significance to the
  AF or DoD; or service which has aided the U.S. in furthering its national policies; or service
  which has furthered the interests of the security of the U.S. or any nation, allied or associated
  with the U.S., during a period of national emergency declared by the President or by
  Congress. It is long-standing AF policy to maintain prestige of the LOM by restricting
  approval authority, eligibility criteria and limiting the number of awards.
  A9.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Approval Authority:
     A9.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/CC - nominations which meet all criteria, when
     award is for PCS, PCA, extended tour, separation or posthumous and for retirement
     nominations which do not meet minimum criteria.
     A9.4.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) SAFPC - nominations which do not meet minimum criteria
     are exception-to-policy, when award is for PCS, PCA, or extended tour and for Chief
     Master Sergeants (CMSgts) not meeting position or criteria (refer 121758z May 09).
  A9.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Rank/Grade:
     A9.4.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Colonels or above
     A9.4.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) CMSgts in qualifying positions (refer to 121758z May 09).
     Either upon retirement from these positions or PCSing from these positions to fill the
     CMSAF position. Must also serve minimum time in qualifying positions.
  A9.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Time in Position:
     A9.4.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Minimum 18 months in qualifying position. Exception:
     Minimum 12 months for officers serving in qualifying positions at remote tour locations.
     A9.4.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Minimum four years in qualifying position for extended
     tour decoration.
     A9.4.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Time in position can be combined with previous
     assignment if it was a qualifying position and a decoration was not initiated.
  A9.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) Officer Qualifying Positions: Wing Commanders and Wing Vice
  Commanders; NAF Commanders and NAF Vice Commanders; Group Commanders of all
  types; HQ AFGSC Directors; HQ AFGSC Deputy Directors (when the Director is a General
  or Flag Officer). Note: List tailored to AFGSC positions, see AFPC message 121758Z May
  09 for full list.
  A9.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) CMSgt Qualifying Positions: AFGSC/CCC and NAF/CCC.
  Note: List tailored to AFGSC positions, see AFPC message 121758Z May 09 for full list.
  A9.4.7. (Added-AFGSC) Limit: Four LOMs per career (includes one at retirement).
  A9.4.8. (Added-AFGSC) PCA: The LOM is rarely approved for PCA without PCS. Will
  be considered if there is a change in MAJCOM and/or senior rater, provided all other criteria
  are met.
AFI36-2803_AFGSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2012                                                               87


  A9.4.9. (Added-AFGSC) Retirement: After a long and distinguished career, liberal
  interpretation of award criteria is appropriate for colonels and above, provided the officer's
  most recent performance warrant such consideration.
  A9.4.10. (Added-AFGSC) Exception-To-Policy (ETP): Anyone not meeting all of the
  minimum criteria is an ETP, except for the condition of Retirement (see above). By their
  very nature, these should be rare; nonetheless, each should be evaluated on its own merits
  and should not be discounted solely because of member’s grade or position. Consider the
  extent/degree a member’s accomplishments had towards lasting and/or far-reaching impact
  across the Air Force. ETP nominations must include full justification for the exception.
  AFGSC/CC may disapprove or downgrade nominations deemed inappropriate or not
  warranted.
  A9.4.11. (Added-AFGSC) Appeal Process: The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) is
  the appeal authority (may be delegated to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF)).
  Appeals are appropriate if the MAJCOM of submission determines that the disapproval was
  in error, the result of an oversight, or the member’s level of achievement and/or service was
  improperly interpreted. Decision of the CSAF (or VCSAF) will be considered final and not
  subject to further review.
A9.5. (Added-AFGSC) AmnM ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
  A9.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Awarded to any member of the Armed Forces of the United
  States or of a friendly nation who, while serving in any capacity with the United States Air
  Force after the date of the award's authorization, who have distinguished himself or herself
  by a heroic act, usually at the voluntary risk of his or her life but not involving actual combat.
  The saving of a life or the success of the voluntary heroic act is not essential. Do not award
  for normal performance of duties.
  A9.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Approval Authority: SAFPC
  A9.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) No restrictions on rank or time-in-service/time-in-position.
A9.6. (Added-AFGSC) NOMINATION PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS

     prior to the member’s departure from the current location.
     A9.6.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) If the decoration is being processed after the member’s PCS
     and the RDP-DECOR-6 is requested from the member’s new duty station, ensure the

     and location of assignment during the period of the decoration).

   Director/Deputy stating why the decoration recommendation did not meet the suspense. This
   may be included in the recommendation letter or sent as a separate letter.
   A9.7.3. (Added-AFGSC) It is imperative that units/directorates monitor forecasted

   A9.7.4. (Added-AFGSC) When insufficient time is allotted for processing an LOM
   package on an individual and their retirement effective date has passed, the submission must
   be processed through the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) for
   consideration. The package will be sent to HQ AFGSC POC to obtain AFGSC/CC
   recommendation and will be returned to the originator for the required processing. The
   Wing/CC, NAF/CC or HQ AFGSC/ Director/Dep Director must include a late statement on
   the recommendation letter stating why the recommendation was not submitted to allow for
   sufficient processing time prior to member’s effective retirement or departure date.

   Narrative (Descriptive Justification), Recommendation Letter, Late Letter (if applicable), and
   Duty History. Email citation in original Word format.
A9.9. (Added-AFGSC) COMMON ERRORS. We realize that the administrative actions
associated with processing decorations can be quite frustrating; however, decoration citations are
considered official documents and must be "letter perfect." Here is a list of the most common
errors identified:
   A9.9.1. (Added-AFGSC) Incorrect opening and closing sentences on citation, per AFI 36-
   2803, Attachment 4.
   A9.9.2. (Added-AFGSC) RDP-DECOR-6 not completed. Should be typed or neatly
   written, it must be personally signed and dated by the supervisor and commander.

  A9.9.3. (Added-AFGSC) RDP-DECOR-6 altered to transfer to letterhead.
  A9.9.4. (Added-AFGSC) Missing gaining base address or home address of member, if
  separating or retiring. This happens when the DECOR-6 is ordered prior to the assignment
  notification.
  A9.9.5. (Added-AFGSC) The use of acronyms/symbols on certificates is not authorized.
  Exceptions: Jr., Sr., III, %, $, “ ”, are acceptable. Note: If there is room in the citation, spell
  out percent and dollar.
  A9.9.6. (Added-AFGSC) Lengthy sentences within the citation.
  A9.9.7. (Added-AFGSC) Abbreviated award names in citation (Example: Use “2005
  General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr. and General Robert T. Herres Awards” instead of “2005
  General Moorman and General Herres Awards”). Must use the full name of the award.
  A9.9.8. (Added-AFGSC) Incorrect number of oak leaf clusters on the certificates and
  citation.
  A9.9.9. (Added-AFGSC) Misspellings in citation and narrative.
  A9.9.10. (Added-AFGSC) The correct closing date for awards for the purpose of
  retirement is the last day of the month, which is the member’s last active duty day, except for
  medical retirement. (Example: Member will retire on 1 Jul 10, so the decoration inclusive
  date ends on 30 Jun 10).
  A9.9.11. (Added-AFGSC) Incorrect reason for decoration on certificates, e.g. outstanding
  achievement instead of meritorious service (reason must match the RDP-DECOR-6).
  A9.9.12. (Added-AFGSC) Decoration start and closeout dates must match on citation and
  RDP-DECOR-6. Dates cannot overlap with previous decorations. Exception: Decorations
  for achievement
  A9.9.13. (Added-AFGSC) If member’s Effective Date of Duty differs (is later) than Date
  Arrived Station, use the Effective Date of Duty as the decoration start date.
  A9.9.14. (Added-AFGSC) Documents not dated.
