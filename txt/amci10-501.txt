This instruction implements AFPD 10-5, Basing, and covers policies and procedures for
preparing, reviewing, and approving AMC Programming Plans (PPLANs). It explains the
responsibilities, procedures, and format for developing and managing AMC PPLANs and applies
to all action officers who write them. This publication does not apply to Air National Guard or
United States Air Force Reserve units. This publication may not be supplemented. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Fixed Command and
Control Operations Branch (AMC/A3OC) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through Major Command (MAJCOM)
publications/forms managers.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be thoroughly reviewed. Major changes
include clarification to the responsibility for writing the Basic Plan. Further, this document now
defines the AMC Staff OPR and their role in the staffing process.

Section A—-General

1. References and Terms. See attachment 1.
 2                                                               AMCI10-501 26 JULY 2011


2. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). HQ AMC/A8P will determine the office of
primary responsibility (OPR) for HQ AMC PPLANs, and the OPR will appoint a program
manager. Each directorate will designate an office/branch as the single point of contact (POC)
for PPLANs and that POC appoints the annex manager. See Section B for program manager and
annex manager responsibilities.
     2.1. HQ AMC PPLAN Numbers. PPLANs are numbered sequentially within each fiscal
     year (i.e., 11-01, 11-02, etc.). HQ AMC/A8P assigns and controls AMC PPLAN numbers.
3. Types of PPLANs. The OPR will examine each program or project individually to determine
if a PPLAN is necessary. Normally, HQ AMC/A8P will not staff PPLANs for non-AMC tenant
units. The parent organization of the tenant unit is responsible for preparing the PPLAN, if
required.
     3.1. AMC PPLAN. When the desired objective of a program or project requires action by
     numerous agencies or organizations, e.g., bedding down a new weapon system, a PPLAN is
     appropriate. The PPLAN may detail all required actions or be general in nature and provide
     working guidelines.
     3.2. Inter-MAJCOM PPLAN. If a programming action involves two or more major
     commands (MAJCOMs) requiring actions from each MAJCOM to reach the objective, an
     inter-MAJCOM PPLAN may be appropriate. Examples of actions requiring an inter-
     MAJCOM PPLAN include, but are not limited to, MAJCOM base ownership transfer and/or
     transfer of a specific mission or resource from one MAJCOM to another. Affected
     MAJCOMs will develop a coordinated course of action. The gaining MAJCOM, or the
     MAJCOM preparing the majority of actions, will normally be the OPR for the document. An
     inter-MAJCOM PPLAN requires adequate lead time for coordination and signature by each
     MAJCOM prior to publication.
     3.3. Email PPLAN. An email PPLAN outlines the basic requirements. A PPLAN may be
     in email format when a short suspense dictates and/or there is no requirement for detailed
     documentation. The key to an email PPLAN is brevity. The Basic Plan format is similar to a
     normal PPLAN and may be an interMAJCOM email. See Figure A3.4.
     3.4. Implementation Plan (IPLAN). IPLANs are formal planning documents written and
     staffed below MAJCOM-level that delineates actions required for Wing agencies to complete
     a specific project and/or objective (base closure, reorganization, added mission, etc.).
     IPLANs are typically generated based on requirements outlined in a higher headquarters
     PPLAN.

Section B—- RESPONSIBILITIES

4. Program Managers. HQ AMC/A8P will designate the PPLAN OPR as the program
manager who is familiar with the objective of the PPLAN and has a working knowledge of the
functional areas which will participate in its development and execution. AMC division-level
program manager will provide name, grade, functional address symbol, and telephone extension
to HQ AMC/A8P. This program manager will be the unit’s voice and champion to the A-staff
and POC for all staffing requirements and inquiries. Program managers will not publish or
distribute PPLANs and changes without Director of Strategic Plans, Requirements, and
Program’s approval. The program manager's responsibilities are to:
AMCI10-501 26 JULY 2011                                                                       3


  4.1. Review AFI 10501, Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans
  (PPLAN); AFI 16403, Updating the USAF Program Installations, Units, and Priorities and
  Movement of Air Force Units; and AFI 329005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting
  for applicability. An action involving a unit move requires a movement directive according
  to AFI 16-403. An action affecting an installation (activation, inactivation, transfer, etc.)
  must comply with the provisions of AFI 32-9005.
  4.2. Promptly process an environmental evaluation for all proposed actions in conjunction
  with PPLAN development. AFI 327001, Environmental Budgeting, applies to both CONUS
  and overseas actions. All actions require submission of a completed, draft AF Form 813,
  Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, to the host command environmental planning
  office for review and final disposition. If the action is on a non-AMC base, the program
  manager must ask the host command to execute the Environmental Impact Assessment
  Process (EIAP). At AMC, the Integrated Planning Branch (A7PI) is in the Programs
  Division (HQ AMC/A7P). The program manager must state in the PPLAN that EIAP has
  begun and its status at the time of publication. The program manager will monitor EIAP
  progress and notify annex managers of its final disposition.
  4.3. Assist in scheduling and conducting site visits, site surveys, and Site Activation Task
  Force (SATAF) visits, as required. Reference HQ AMC/A8PB SATAF Guidebook located
  on Air Force Knowledge Now website at              https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/
  DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-XP-AM-08-2-1-3&Filter=OO-XP-AM-08
  4.4. Develop, coordinate, publish, and distribute PPLANs IAW Section C--Format and
  Procedures. Develop and publish changes or revisions as required.
     4.4.1. Concept of Operations. Annex ALPHA, Concept of Operations, explains the
     execution of the PPLAN, addresses the total intent of the document, and directs how and
     when to accomplish the objective. The decision to prepare Annex ALPHA rests with the
     PPLAN OPR and program manager. Explain in detail the scope and size of the program
     or project, the relative timeframe, and any other pertinent data that may be helpful in
     executing the objective. Explain any peculiar situations that may impact execution and
     how to handle these situations. Explain impacts on other programs or projects and how
     the execution of this objective relates to them. If Annex ALPHA is not used, the Basic
     Plan must state that Annex ALPHA is not necessary.
     4.4.2. Set up the initial annex managers’ meeting and notify all staff agencies, furnishing
     them applicable background information and a draft Basic Plan, if available.
     4.4.3. Identify annex managers and prepare a list for inclusion in the Basic Plan.
     4.4.4. Establish suspense dates for the various developmental and implementation
     phases.
     4.4.5. Assist annex managers, as required, in developing annexes, appendices, functional
     presentations, and display charts. Review and evaluate products.
     4.4.6. Prepare Appendix III (Reporting Procedures) and Annex XRAY (Distribution).
     4.4.7. Assemble final document for publication/distribution.
  4.5. Record and monitor program progress and present coordinated results of analyses and
  program status reports to top-level management, as required.
 4                                                                   AMCI10-501 26 JULY 2011


     4.6. Schedule and chair subsequent meetings of the annex managers, as necessary.
     4.7. Notify all addressees upon completion of the objective. See Figure A3.5.
5. Annex Managers. The program manager and all annex managers comprise a working group.
They are responsible for coordinating information and collectively developing the PPLAN. The
annex managers’ responsibilities are to:
     5.1. Attend all annex managers' meetings and serve as a single point of contact for their
     directorate or functional area on all matters related to the PPLAN. Notify the program
     manager if an annex manager changes.
     5.2. Develop appropriate annexes, appendices, and time-phased actions (milestones and
     activities) with the assistance of the program manager. Electronic templates with
     standardized formatting should be provided to all functional areas.
     5.3. Coordinate with all of the impacted functional areas within their directorate.
     5.4. Provide the program manager the names, office symbols, and email addresses of
     office/agencies to receive a final copy of the PPLAN.
     5.5. Review program or project progress on an ongoing basis in order to facilitate problem
     solutions. Advise the program manager of problem areas which may impact the annex or the
     overall objective of the PPLAN and assist action agencies in resolving identified problem
     areas.

Section C—- Format and Procedures

6. Format. A PPLAN normally consists of a cover page, special instructions, record of
changes, table of contents, Basic Plan, and annexes necessary to accomplish its objective. See
Attachments 3 for detailed PPLAN formats.
     6.1. Annex. An annex is a subdivision within a PPLAN, which applies to a specific
     directorate such as Logistics, Operations, Personnel, etc. Each annex has a standard
     alphabetical designator (see Attachment 2). There is no deviation from standard annex
     designations. If additional annexes are required, the PPLAN program manager will assign an
     annex designation, such as UNIFORM, VICTOR, or WHISKEY. The decision to prepare an
     annex rests with that directorate’s annex manager for PPLANs.
     6.2. Appendix. An appendix is a further subdivision of, or an addition to, an annex. Each
     appendix is identified by a Roman numeral designator. Most appendices list time-phased
     actions, showing milestones and activities with descriptions, action agencies, monitors, and
     start/completion dates. See Figure A3.3.
7. Classification. AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, establishes
procedures for safeguarding classified information. All PPLANs must include classification
guidance allowing users to identify specific classified information, the source of the
classification, and declassification instructions for the information. Unclassified PPLANs that
pertain to Air Force P-series documents are FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY in accordance with
DoD 5400.1-R AP 3.2, Information Security Program and AFI 31-401, Information Security
Program Management, 22 July 1999. PPLANs are not available to the public without prior
approval of the appropriate disclosure authority in accordance with AFSUPDODR 5400-7.
AMCI10-501 26 JULY 2011                                                                         5


Standard PPLANs include this guidance in the "Special Instructions" section. Before preparing a
classified PPLAN, review AFI 31501.
8. Procedures. The following procedures will ensure the development of a quality document:
   8.1. Basic Plan. The PPLAN program manager, in concert with unit subject matter experts,
   will develop the Basic Plan through their MAJCOM functional POC to gain a division-
   approved draft Basic Plan. The program manager will distribute to all AMC functional areas
   by the current electronic staff tool (i.e. TMT) for 3-digit and 2-digit coordination. The Basic
   Plan will include the objectives, authority and references, general situation, explanation of
   planned course of action, OPR, program management, and command and control. It will
   include statements on the disposition of the environmental evaluation and the PPLAN upon
   completion of the PPLAN's objective. It may also include any additional information as
   subsequent items.
   8.2. Coordination. Applicable coordination is required on all PPLANs prior to publication.
   Determining the adequacy of coordination is the responsibility of the program manager. The
   Basic Plan must have HQ AMC/A5/8 Director or Deputy Director authentication prior to
   publication and distribution.
   8.3. Distribution. The program manager will email the authenticated PPLAN to appropriate
   addressees including all organizations listed in Annex XRAY, Distribution.
   8.4. Changes. If units or functional areas need to change portions of the PPLAN, they will
   contact the program manager. The program manager will determine if a change is necessary.
   If changes are required, the updated PPLAN will be uploaded into the MAJCOM electronic
   staffing tool or emailed to the appropriate agencies.
   8.5. Public Release Requests. Release of PPLAN information to the public will be
   processed in accordance with DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 the Freedom of Information
   Act Program.
   8.6. Reporting. Appendix III to the Basic Plan contains reporting procedures for each
   PPLAN. Status reports will be handled via the MAJCOM electronic staffing tool. Time
   extensions to suspenses will only be granted by the Program Manager.
   8.7. Disposition. Upon completion of the PPLAN’s objective and last activity, the OPR for
   the PPLAN will notify all users that they may dispose of the plan via a closeout email (see
   Figure A3.5.). Dispose of the PPLAN according to Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
   (RDS) contained in AFRIMS (https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm).

Terms
Action Agency—-An action agency is the office responsible for accomplishing and reporting
time-phased actions. The action agency of the first activity of a particular milestone is the
highest ranking organization of those organizations responsible for activities within that
milestone. An action agency should include both unit and office symbol.
Activity—-Activities are a chronological sequence of the tasks necessary to accomplish the
milestone. Activity numbers also consist of three digits and are in increments of five beginning
with 000. List activities chronologically by start date.
Annex Manager—-The individual responsible for planning, coordinating, monitoring, and
reporting progress on all actions associated with an individual functional area is an annex
manager.
Appendix—-An appendix is a subdivision of, or an addition to an annex. Each appendix has a
Roman numeral designator. Most appendices list time-phased actions, showing milestones and
activities with descriptions, action agencies, monitors, start and complete dates. Figure A3.3.
contains an example of this type of appendix.
Basing—-Actions taken to position Air Force units worldwide include selecting sites and
resolving political, airspace, environmental, and beddown issues. Such actions may range from
AMCI10-501 26 JULY 2011                                                                             7


establishing and maintaining units in permanent facilities (beddown) to arranging access, transit,
and service agreements for contingencies, exercises and visits.
Dates—-Each milestone or activity has start and complete dates which are actual calendar dates.
Annex managers must ensure completion of the specified actions. This phase of development
requires close coordination among all functional areas.
Description—-The description briefly outlines each milestone and activity. The description of
the first activity (000) in a particular milestone is a general description of all the activities that
follow under that milestone.
Installation—-A grouping of facilities, located in the same vicinity, which support particular
functions. Installations may be elements of a base. Installations are Air Staff-controlled.
Milestone—-A milestone is a unique major occurrence of primary importance to the program's
objective. A milestone may stand alone or have subordinate activities further outlining required
tasks. The first digit is always alphabetical and refers to its particular annex or functional area (F
for FOXTROT) with a 3-digit number following. Generally, milestone numbers are in
increments of five beginning with 005. This numbering system allows for expansion or addition
at a later date should the need arise. If separate appendices within a functional annex are
necessary, the appendix milestones may use 100-series milestones to identify responsibilities
within each appendix (e.g., F005, F105, F205, F305, etc.).
Monitor—-A monitor is the office having the responsibility for providing guidance and general
supervision of a milestone and activity.
Programming Plans (PPLAN)—-PPLANs are formal planning documents which are written to
facilitate the accomplishment of major actions. They state objectives in terms of time-phased
resource requirements (forces, manpower, material quantities, and costs).
Program Manager—-The individual responsible for planning, coordinating, and monitoring
progress on actions associated with a PPLAN through the annex managers.
Site Activation Task Force (SATAF)—-A team of MAJCOM functional experts chartered to
travel to an installation to identify all the actions necessary to ensure a beddown at that
installation is successful. SATAFs are led by a MAJCOM, and provide periodic, on-scene
assistance to unit-level agencies to accomplish a program objective. It employs appropriate
members of the MAJCOM, staff and may include HAF functionals. The SATAF structure is
comprised of headquarters team members and representation from the affected unit(s), which are
organized into functional working groups. Each working group has an assigned chairperson, who
functions under the auspices of the SATAF Team Chief. A SATAF may be convened to support
bringing a program, system, equipment and/or site to operational readiness. SATAFs are also
conducted to facilitate unit activations, inactivations, relocations, and conversions from one
weapons system to another.
Site Survey—-An authorized visit by an individual or team to survey real property to determine
its feasibility for a unit or mission beddown. Site surveys may, in part, consist of preliminary
examinations, field investigations, etc.
Time-Phased Actions—-Actions and events which must be initiated and completed at a specific
time to ensure timely accomplishment of a PPLAN's objectives.
