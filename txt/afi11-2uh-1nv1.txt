1.1. General. This instruction implements AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and provides for
training management of UH-1N aircrew members. Training policy, guidance, and requirements
are set forth for each phase of aircrew training. Training is designed to progressively develop the
combat readiness of each aircrew member while maintaining previously acquired proficiency.
This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or other 11-series
instructions. Flight safety will be given prime consideration, and must take precedence over the
requirements and guidance of this publication.
   1.1.1. IAW HQ AF A3O guidance, the flight engineer (FE) and aerial gunner (AG) career
   fields have been combined into one Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) identified as special
   missions aviation (SMA). However, the aircrew position will be FE for UH-1Ns. Therefore,
   the aviation resource management system (ARMS) will use the term FE to build training
   profiles.
   1.1.2. Qualification Training (Chapter 2). Includes Initial Qualification Training (IQT),
   Requalification Training (RQ), Transition Training (TX), Difference Training, Multiple
   Qualification, and Specialty Training.
   1.1.3. Mission Qualification Training (Chapter 3). Qualifies aircrew members in an
   assigned aircrew position for a specific aircraft to perform the command or unit mission.
   Additional Local Mission Training (LMT) may be required following Mission Qualification
   Training (MQT).
   1.1.4. Continuation Training (Chapter 4). Provides the capability to reinforce and build
   upon previous training, and to conduct Universal Joint Task List (UJTL), Air Force
   Universal Task List (AFUTL), and Major Command Mission Essential Task List (METL)
   based combat-oriented aircrew training.
   1.1.5. Upgrade and Specialized Training (Chapter 5). Provides aircrew members the
   training required for upgrade and special mission event qualification or certification.
   1.1.6. Aircrew Training Records (Chapter 6). Contains instructions for creating and
   maintaining aircrew training records, and the disposition of these records.
1.2. Training Objectives. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of mission readiness, which facilitates immediate and effective
employment during exercises, contingencies, limited war, as well as general war operations.
   1.2.1. Training Program. The training program must train aircrew in the skills, knowledge,
   and attitudes (SKA) required to accomplish assigned missions. Regulatory/directive and
   authoritative sources of required information include, but may not be limited to: Mission
   design series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2 series instructions, Air Force Tactics, Techniques,
   and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1/2/3 MDS volumes, Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR),

      1.3.8.5. Each instructor aircrew member is responsible for the safe execution of the
      duties of their respective crew position. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or
      proficiency of the student should raise a question in the instructor’s mind as to the
      student’s ability to safely execute the duties of that aircrew position, the instructor will
      immediately assume those duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the
      proper method of executing those duties. Instructors must be highly knowledgeable in
      both H-1 AFTTPs and governing AFIs in order to provide immediate instruction to any
      aircrew position concerning weapon system employment and its regulatory and non-
      regulatory guidance.
      1.3.8.6. Instructor pilots (IP) are responsible at all times for the conduct of the flight and
      safety of the aircraft. Instructors will place special emphasis on the procedures for
      positive identification of emergency conditions before initiating corrective action. In
      addition, instructors will place high emphasis on, and thoroughly brief the procedures for,
      positive exchange of aircraft control.
      1.3.8.7. Any aircrew member who demonstrates instructional deficiencies in their ability
      to instruct may be used in their primary aircrew position provided the deficiency does not
      involve primary aircrew duties. Commanders will take the necessary action to either
      retrain or remove those individuals from instructor status IAW AF or MAJCOM
      directives.
      1.3.8.8. Individuals designated for instructor duty are authorized to instruct all levels of
      qualification, and are authorized to teach any event in which they are qualified and
      current unless specifically restricted.
   1.3.9. Individual Aircrew Member.
      1.3.9.1. Except during upgrade or recurrency training, will only participate in ground and
      flying activities for which qualified, current, and adequately prepared.
      1.3.9.2. Aircrew members must complete training requirements and currencies within the
      guidelines of this instruction.
      1.3.9.3. Aircrew members will follow ETCA required guidance when attending a formal
      school course.       The ETCA website is located at the following link:
      https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
1.4. Aircrew Training Policy.
   1.4.1. Formal Training. The primary method of formal training completion is at the FTU
   [58th Special Operations Wing (SOW), Kirtland AFB, NM].
      1.4.1.1. Squadrons will utilize AETC Form 6, Waiver Request, to request FTU course
      overages, FTU SOI waivers, FTU ETCA requirement waivers, or senior officer/key staff
      course (KSC) requests. Route FTU waiver requests per MAJCOM guidance to the
      MAJCOM A3 training branch chief. MAJCOM A3 training branch chiefs will submit
      the waiver request IAW HQ AETC/A3Z guidance. All waiver requests must be approved
      before the aircrew member departs for the FTU, or begins training via SMT. File a copy
      of all approved waivers in the trainee’s Aircrew Training Folder. Students will hand-
      carry a hard copy of any approved waiver to the FTU course.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                 11


     1.4.1.2. When formal course attendance is not practical, or quotas are not available,
     squadrons will submit SMT waiver requests. EXCEPTION: Any aircrew member who
     has been previously removed from a formal qualification course for substandard
     performance is ineligible for an SMT waiver.
  1.4.2. Secondary Method Training (SMT). SMT is training conducted by the squadron in
  lieu of the FTU using FTU SOI and courseware. The SMT waiver authority is the MAJCOM
  A3 training and stan/eval division chief. Submit SMT waiver requests to the MAJCOM A3
  training and stan/eval division chief, or as directed via MAJCOM supplement or RTM. Any
  changes to formal course requirements due to local conditions or limitations must be
  identified in the request, and approved by the MAJCOM A3 training and stan/eval division
  chief. Waiver authority to change the formal requirements and syllabus requisites of training
  conducted via SMT is IAW the appropriate SOI. All squadrons performing SMT will utilize
  the general waiver format in paragraph 1.8.3, and include the following additional
  information in the request:
     1.4.2.1. Summary of individual’s flying history report.
     1.4.2.2. Other MDS specific time (including instructor and evaluator time, if applicable).
     1.4.2.3. FTU quota availability.
     1.4.2.4. Requested exceptions to the FTU SOI (include rationale and mitigations).
     1.4.2.5. AETC Form 6 when required.
  1.4.3. In-unit Training Procedures.
     1.4.3.1. Utilize FTU or MAJCOM approved courseware. Squadrons are not required to
     use courseware material and examinations requiring resources available only at the FTU,
     or material unique to the FTU flying area. MAJCOMs may approve an alternate syllabus
     flow to compensate for the lack of simulators.
         1.4.3.1.1. The MAJCOM A3 training branch chief will coordinate for and ensure
         availability of appropriate courseware. Courseware includes, but is not limited to the
         course SOI, briefings, CBT modules, student and instructor guides, training guides, as
         well as grade sheets for the student’s training folder. The squadron training office
         will verify courseware is current.
             1.4.3.1.1.1. Portable document format (PDF) copies of FTU syllabi can be found
             on the “AETC Flying Training Special Publications” web site:
             https://trss3.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx.
         1.4.3.1.2. Squadrons may conduct MQT in-unit utilizing approved courseware
         tailored to the squadron’s specific mission requirements. Courseware should be
         developed, standardized, and parallel FTU courseware in format and content.
         1.4.3.1.3. When suitable course training products are not available, squadrons will
         submit locally-developed training materials to their MAJCOM A3 training and
         stan/eval division chief for approval.
         1.4.3.1.4. Complete all academic, ground, and flight training outlined in courseware
         with minimum interruption, and in the prescribed sequence. When FTU courseware
 12                                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


          is adapted for local use, modification will only be applied if the training is
          incompatible with local training conditions.
      1.4.3.2. Ensure successful completion of the ground and flying training requirements
      prescribed. Training sequence and prerequisites will follow the syllabus flow chart
      unless waived by the operations group commander (OG/CC) (or as directed by
      MAJCOM guidance). If waived, accomplish a sequence of training waiver (SOTW)
      IAW this instruction or MAJCOM guidance.
      1.4.3.3. Fly the syllabus flying time as closely as possible. This does not preclude a
      student from receiving less total syllabus time due to proficiency advancement (PA).
      Time allotted per sortie in FTU courseware is designed for the average student to achieve
      the required proficiency level (RPL) for each maneuver during that sortie. RPLs need to
      be met within allotted time as defined by the syllabus. If RPLs are not met during the
      allotted time, the student will be graded IAW syllabus guidelines. Once RPLs are met, if
      additional time is available, other training may be accomplished beyond that programmed
      for the sortie. The intent is to ensure sufficient time is allotted for the performance of a
      sufficient number of maneuvers or event accomplishments during the individual sortie to
      make certain the student has a chance for normal progression.
      1.4.3.4. Attempt to complete training via SMT within 240 days of the first ground
      training session, or within 150 days of the first training flight, whichever occurs first.
      Squadrons will notify their MAJCOM A3 training branch chief with a description of the
      difficulty and expected completion date when training exceeds 150 days. An extension
      past 240 days requires MAJCOM A3 training and stan/eval division chief approval.
   1.4.4. Inflight Supervision.
      1.4.4.1. Aircrew members that are noncurrent, unqualified, or in any training program
      (upgrade, certification, corrective action, etc.) must fly under the supervision of an
      instructor in their crew position who is current and qualified/certified in those events. An
      IP must be at a set of controls while instructing other pilots flying in the front seat.
      1.4.4.2. Any instructor-qualified aircrew member may instruct flight surgeons (FS) and
      operational support flyers (OSF). However, the preferred method of instruction is by an
      instructor-qualified FE one-on-one in the crew cabin.
   1.4.5. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Training. Unless otherwise required [e.g., AFI 11-
   301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program], ground training events may be taught by
   any instructor qualified/certified and current in that event to any other aircrew position.
1.5. Experience, Aircrew Member Utilization, and Sortie Allocation.
   1.5.1. Experience. HQ AF A3O-AI maintains approved MAJCOM experience level
   requirements for the purpose of maintaining appropriate squadron experience mix. Each
   MAJCOM provides HQ AF A3O-AI their experience requirements. See AFI 11-412 as
   supplemented, for guidance. For the purposes if this instruction, squadrons will use FTLs
   specified in Table 4.6 as minimum experience requirements for assigning currency tables.
   1.5.2. Aircrew Member Utilization.
      1.5.2.1. All API-1/A aircrew members up to squadron authorizations [not applicable
      (N/A) for AETC] will maintain CMR. Squadron commanders will train aircrew
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                               13


     members to meet capabilities specified in the squadron’s designed operational capability
     (DOC) statement.
     1.5.2.2. To the maximum extent possible, squadron commanders will avoid giving first
     operational assignment aircrew members additional duties until CMR status is attained.
     These aircrew members will use this time to focus purely on honing flying skills, and to
     train unit-specific weapons and tactics. The intent is to provide aircrew members an
     opportunity to gain experience in their primary AFSC before being tasked for other
     squadron duties.
        1.5.2.2.1. Supervisors may assign first assignment aircrew members to valid, short-
        term tasks (e.g., escort officer, Flying Evaluation Board (FEB)/mishap board
        member), but must continually weigh the factors involved such as level of aircrew
        member tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
        1.5.2.2.2. API-1/A aircrew members should not be attached or assigned to any WG
        staff position unless total WG API-1/A manning is over 100 percent (N/A for AETC).
        Commanders will ensure that WG/GP tactical aircrew members are properly
        designated, and only fill authorized positions IAW unit manning documents.
            1.5.2.2.2.1. WG API-6/B authorizations are allocated IAW manpower
            documents. Commanders will ensure WG staff API-6/B aircrew members
            perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards as documented in the
            squadron’s unit manpower document (UMD). WGs converting to a new primary
            aircraft inventory (PAI) are authorized one unit equivalent of additional API-6/Bs
            during the conversion period. However, total WG staff flying the new aircraft
            shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipage.
                1.5.2.2.2.1.1. Supervisory aircrew and staff members (API-6/B) assigned
                above the squadron level, which are in excess of the squadron’s mission
                requirements, will maintain CMR, BMC, or basic aircraft qualification (BAQ)
                status as directed by the MAJCOM. Note: To change from BMC to CMR
                status, aircrew will begin maintaining full CMR flying continuation training
                requirements. The squadron commander may assign additional training as
                desired. WG API-6/B continuation training requirements will be documented
                in the RTM, and may be less restrictive than FTL A or B continuation training
                requirements.
                1.5.2.2.2.1.2. Flight Training Unit (FTU) Wings. All API-6/B aircrew
                members will maintain instructor status (optional for WG/GP commander,
                WG vice commander (CV), GP deputy commander (CD), and functional
                check flight (FCF) aircrew members). These WGs will fly API-1/6 pilots as
                required by the PFT.
            1.5.2.2.2.2. API-8/D (above WG level) rated personnel flying authorizations will
            be allocated IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. API-8/D aircrew
            members will fly currency rates determined by the MAJCOM A3 training and
            stan/eval division chief. MAJCOM API-8/D continuation training requirements
            will be documented in the RTM, and may be less restrictive than FTL A or B
            continuation training requirements.
 14                                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


   1.5.3. Sortie Allocation.
       1.5.3.1. Inexperienced API-1/A aircrew members should receive sortie allocation priority
       over experienced aircrew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
           1.5.3.1.1. Operational Squadrons. CMR API-1/A, MQT API-1/A, CMR API-6/B,
           MQT API-6/B, BMC (all API positions), API-5 pilot physicians.
           1.5.3.1.2. Formal Training Unit. Formal syllabus training, instructor upgrades,
           instructor continuation training, authorized staff personnel not performing instructor
           duties to include non-instructor API-5 pilot physicians.
       1.5.3.2. Squadrons should provide assigned API-6/8/B/D aircrew members adequate
       resources to maintain minimum training requirements. API-6/8/B/D flyer support will
       not come at the expense of the squadron’s primary mission. If squadrons cannot meet
       attached flyer requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401 as supplemented.
       Squadrons requiring flying-hour adjustments for attached API-8/D and applicable API-
       6/B flyers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
1.6. Initial Cadre for Change of Aircraft, Equipment, or Capability. When possible,
qualified personnel from units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre. In some
instances, it may be necessary for squadrons converting from one design aircraft to another to
form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements
may be waived. Authorization to form initial cadre aircrews will be contained in the conversion
program action directive. Unless otherwise stated in the program action directive, the following
conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre aircrew qualification:
   1.6.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew conversion. Converting squadrons send proposed initial cadre list by name,
   rank, current aircrew position and MDS, total flying time, and requested aircrew qualification
   level through appropriate channels to the MAJCOM/A3 for approval.
   1.6.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in an aircrew position higher than that most
   recently held (i.e., aircraft commander to flight examiner). Enter appropriate comments in
   the remarks section of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, AF Form 1381,
   USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications
   explaining the aircrew member’s status as an initial cadre instructor or flight examiner.
   1.6.3. Following final approval, each converting squadron will publish a memorandum for
   record (MFR) identifying initial cadre instructors and flight examiners by MDS and aircrew
   qualification level. A copy of this MFR will be kept on file in each individual's Flight
   Evaluation Folder (FEF).
   1.6.4. Initial cadre aircrew are not required for minor aircraft modifications when required
   training for that modification is provided by a contractor, and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment, and log training on the letter of
   qualification/certification or MFR. Aircrew members will not operate new equipment until
   trained.
1.7. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Aircrew members whose status is “duty not involving
flying” (DNIF) may complete ground training events and log simulator flight-training time if the
member's physical condition allows it. Consult the FS initiating the AF Form 1042 action
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   15


(prescribed by AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards) to determine if the DNIF
status includes ground training limitations.
1.8. Waivers.

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the requirements and policies for initial qualification,
requalification, transition, difference, multiple qualification, and specialty training.
   2.1.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification. BAQ training (contact and instrument procedure
   qualification) provides the training necessary to initially qualify aircrew members in a basic
   aircrew position and flying duty without regard to the squadron’s mission, and is a
   prerequisite for MQT.
   2.1.2. Specialty Aircrew Training. Specialty aircrew member training is training necessary
   for FSs, UH-1N KSC attendees, Indoctrination (INDOC) flyers, and senior
   officers/supervisory aircrew.
2.2. General Requirements.
   2.2.1. The primary method of accomplishing initial BAQ training for pilots is to attend the
   UH-1N Mission Pilot Initial Qualification (UH1N-MP-IQ) course. The primary method of
   accomplishing BAQ training for FEs is to attend the UH-1N Mission Flight Engineer Initial
   Qualification (UH1N-MF-IQ) course.
   2.2.2. The primary method of transition/requalification (TX/RQ) BAQ training is the
   appropriate formal training TX course listed in the ETCA. Note: FSs and OSFs are
   universally qualified and do not require UH-1N specific qualification, transition, or
   requalification.
   2.2.3. The gaining MAJCOM/CC is the approval authority to conduct colonel-selectee and
   above BAQ training at the unit to which the officer is assigned. For all aircrew members
   below the rank of Colonel, the gaining MAJCOM/A3 is the approval authority for in-unit
   BAQ training. The MAJCOM/A3 will forward an information copy of the approved waiver
   to HQ AFGSC/A3T and HQ AETC/A3Z. If BAQ training is conducted in-unit, squadrons
   may supplement formal courseware to meet local requirements. The gaining MAJCOM/A3
   is the approval authority for changes to the BAQ portion of a formal course syllabus.
   Coordinate all syllabus changes through HQ AFGSC/A3T. Requests to conduct BAQ in-unit
   will include the following:
       2.2.3.1. Justification for in-unit training in lieu of FTU training.
       2.2.3.2. Summary of an individual's flying experience.
       2.2.3.3. Date training will begin, and expected completion date.
       2.2.3.4. Requested exceptions to the formal course syllabus, to include rationale.
   2.2.4. Duties not directly related to qualification training should be minimized.
   2.2.5. Failure to complete training within the specified time limit IAW paragraph 1.4.3
   requires notification through command channels to the MAJCOM A3 training branch chief
   with the individual’s name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion
   date. For students attending the FTU, AETC will notify the gaining MAJCOM A3 training
   branch chief of any training delays.

   2.2.6. Aircrew members classified as BAQ must complete BAQ continuation training
   requirements prescribed in this instruction.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate FTU SOI listed in
the ETCA and AFI 11-202V1. The FTU SOI designates the course prerequisite waiver
authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. As a minimum, aircrew members must complete the
ground training events listed in Table 2.1 prior to their first flight. Code of Conduct Training
(CoCT) requirements as discussed in Table 2.2 must be completed IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival,

     2.11.2.2. The primary method of course completion is at the FTU. If no FTU quota is
     available an SMT waiver must be requested. Squadrons should attempt to schedule FTU
     UH-1N KSC attendance prior to assumption of duties. Request the UH-1N KSC using an
     AETC Form 6.
     2.11.2.3. Completion of the UH-1N KSC does not assign a qualification or continuation
     training requirement; however, it allows senior officers to fly as often as necessary to
     gain familiarity with UH-1N operations and capabilities. Graduates of the UH-1N KSC
     will fly with an IP at a set of controls, shall not control the aircraft with passengers on
     board, and will not be designated aircraft commander.
  2.11.3. INDOC Flyers. Follow provisions of AFI 11-401. No recurring training is required
  for INDOC flyers. If an INDOC flyer will be at a set of controls, the following applies:

     but must comply with AFI 11-401 requirements and this instruction.
     2.11.4.3. Lt Col and Below, Below the MAJCOM Level. Individuals must complete the
     appropriate ground and flying requirements outlined in this instruction, and maintain
     either BAQ, BMC, or CMR status. UH-1N qualified squadron commanders and
     operations officers will maintain CMR status. The NAF functional manager for UH-1N
     operations will determine the qualification for aircrew members assigned at the NAF
     level. Aircrew members must meet or exceed all initial and recurring training
     requirements IAW the MAJCOM RTM for the squadron to which the individual is
     assigned.
     2.11.4.4. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA). CEAs in supervisory flying positions will

                         MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
initial mission qualification and requalification training. MQT is that training necessary to
qualify an aircrew member in a specific crew position to perform the command or squadron
operational mission. Specific certification training requirements are discussed in Chapter 5.
3.2. General Requirements.
   3.2.1. MQT requirements are normally identified in the applicable FTU syllabus, and are
   typically accomplished at the FTU. Upon completion of MQT, additional LMT may be
   necessary to train aircrew members on unit specific tasks.
   3.2.2. Aircrew arriving from the FTU following BAQ/MQT or TX/RQ training with MQT,
   or having conducted a permanent change of station (PCS) directly from a different
   MAJCOM, will maintain BMC status. Once complete with LMT, API-1/A aircrew members
   will be designated CMR. Intra-command PCSing aircrew members who are CMR/BMC will
   remain CMR/BMC upon arrival at their new duty station. For these aircrew, LMT will be
   used to train members in unit specific tasks, but will not affect CMR/BMC status unless the
   intent is to make a BMC aircrew member CMR.
   3.2.3. The primary method of accomplishing MQT for BMC is to complete the appropriate
   training course listed in the ETCA. If MQT is conducted in-unit, see the flying training
   requirements section of this chapter and paragraph 1.4.3 for guidance.
       3.2.3.1. There is no formal MQT course for FSs and OSFs. FSs and OSFs will complete
       appropriate LMT utilizing approved syllabi and courseware.
3.3. MQT Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate FTU syllabus listed in
the ETCA and AFI 11-202V1. Prospective students must meet requirements and qualifications
listed in the syllabus and ETCA, or comply with syllabus directed waiver procedures. This does
not preclude conducting MQT and LMT simultaneously.
   3.3.1. If there is not a separate mission requalification course, BAQ qualified aircrew
   members requalifying in the squadron’s mission will comply with formal MQT course
   prerequisites.
   3.3.2. Simultaneous/concurrent    multiple-MDS     qualification   upgrades   will   not   be
   accomplished.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Aircrew members must complete all ground training
requirements in Table 3.1 prior to BMC status. Completion of training will establish due dates
for recurring ground training required in Table 4.3 Credit any training accomplished at a formal
school.
   3.4.1. Academic Training. Complete all academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware following the syllabus flow.
   3.4.2. Written Examinations. Reference AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2UH-1NV2 for written
   examination requirements.

   3.5.1. Formal Training. Satisfactorily completing an appropriate ETCA formal course
   qualifies aircrew members as BMC. Table 4.5 identifies the minimum events required to
   certify members to BMC status. Approved training via SMT must be accomplished IAW
   applicable FTU courseware, AFI 11-202V1, paragraph 1.4.2 SMT guidance, and the
   following:
      3.5.1.1. Training conducted during operational missions must be conducted IAW AFI
      11-202V1 and AFI 11-2-UH-1NV3.
      3.5.1.2. After successful completion of the appropriate ETCA formal course, MAJCOMs
      will determine continuation training requirements IAW Chapter 4.
   3.5.2. Unit-Specific LMT. Unit-specific LMT will be conducted IAW paragraph 1.4.3
   aircrew training policy guidance. LMT includes MQT conducted in-unit, and may be
   accomplished simultaneously with in-unit MQT if approved by the MAJCOM IAW Chapter
   1.
      3.5.2.1. In-unit MQT is mission training taught at each squadron to complete the mission
      portion of FTU syllabi, complete mission training not provided at the FTU (e.g., NVG
      formation, aerial gunnery, etc.), complete mission training not required by a PCSing
      aircrew member’s previous MAJCOM, or complete mission training established as part
      of a larger FTU syllabus (e.g., hoist and NVG qualification). MAJCOMs direct all in-
      unit MQT programs via RTM and provide courseflow guidance. An SMT waiver is not
      required if the aircrew member is previously BAQ qualified prior to entering training
      upon arrival at the squadron.
      3.5.2.2. Training on operational missions must be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V1 and
      AFI 11-2-UH-1NV3.
3.6. Requalification Requirements. Follow requalification guidance in paragraph 2.7 When
BAQ training is not required, mission requalification training may be conducted via in-unit
training without an SMT waiver request. Follow in-unit training requirements.
3.7. Local Mission Training Requirements.
   3.7.1. Mission Training Scenarios. Squadrons should develop mission scenarios that
   emphasize procedures and operations based on the squadron’s mission. When developed,
   scenarios will be designed to achieve mission capability in squadron tasked roles, maintain
   proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety; as well as emphasize CMR
   basic skills that reflect procedures and operations based on location, current intelligence,
   opposition capabilities, and employment plans. Use of procedures and actions applicable to
   the squadron’s mission are desired (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   25


   procedures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, threat reactions, and
   intelligence briefing/debriefing).
   3.7.2. Local Mission Training. LMT is designed to familiarize aircrew with the local
   operating area (LFT), top off any training not completed during BAQ/MQT (includes in-unit
   MQT and certifications), and certify them on the unique aspects of that squadron’s mission
   [Local Mission Certification (LMC)]. LMT is required for all aircrew members upon PCS.
      3.7.2.1. Complete LMT within the time specified by the MAJCOM, but no-later-than
      (NLT) 180 calendar days after the aircrew member begins training at the gaining
      operational squadron. Unit-specific training will begin no later than 45 days after
      reporting to a new duty station or squadron, unless waived by the MAJCOM. Training is
      complete once the squadron commander certifies the aircrew member CMR. Failure to
      complete LMT within the specified time interval IAW paragraph 1.4.3 requires
      MAJCOM A3 training branch chief notification of the aircrew member’s name, rank,
      reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
      3.7.2.2. An instructor of the same aircrew position will conduct all LMT instruction
      unless otherwise noted. Conduct training IAW an approved LMT syllabi. The squadron
      may give credit for equivalent training completed during a previous assignment, or
      during BAQ/MQT. Squadrons are authorized to tailor portions of this program based on
      each individual’s qualification, experience, documented performance, and amount of
      formal training. The squadron operations officer will make an annotation in the aircrew
      member’s training folder detailing any modifications to the LMT program, and the
      justification for these changes. Complete flying training lessons in the sequence
      prescribed within the approved syllabus unless waived by the squadron operations
      officer. Syllabus flights may be combined as appropriate. Squadrons may add additional
      ground and flight training as desired.
      3.7.2.3. LMT Qualifications. Table 3.2 defines LMT training requirements for
      qualifications authorized in AFI 11-2UH-1NV2 for all aircrew members. Training will
      be conducted by an IP or IF as appropriate. Squadrons will qualify aircrew members in
      the minimum flight events IAW the MAJCOM RTM. Table notes define training code
      status (i.e., non-grounding or other restrictions). If an aircrew member is unqualified or
      was not previously qualified in a MAJCOM required mission event, and qualification is
      specified via MAJCOM RTM, follow the guidance within Table 3.2

                         of the FTU SOI, follow MAJCOM guidance.
       3.7.2.4. Local Familiarization Training (LFT). This training will consist of both Local
       Area Orientation/Theater INDOC and Local Flying Familiarization, which includes as a
       minimum one ground training session and one day flight in the local area. See Chapter
       4 for a description of LFT training requirements. Except when conducted IAW the
       intra/intercommand temporary duty (TDY) policy, aircrew will not fly unsupervised
       sorties in the local area without LFT complete.
       3.7.2.5. LMT Certifications. This is tactical top-off training for aircrew members
       arriving direct from the FTU or a different MAJCOM, which is designed to complete
       instruction on unit-specific tactical flying events either not adequately addressed at the
       FTU, or mission sets not required by previous MAJCOM. This training includes LMC,
       as well as other certifications. See Chapter 5 for certification requirements.
3.8. Intra/Intercommand TDY Aircrew Requirements. Aircrew members may perform
flying, to include flight instruction/qualification duties at UH-1 squadrons inside or outside their
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                    27


assigned command (with MAJCOM/A3 approval, OSFs may perform duties at other squadrons
within their same command). Request intercommand training through appropriate channels to
the MAJCOM 4-letter who will coordinate approval with the requested MAJCOM. At a
minimum, LFT must be conducted. Unless with an instructor, the visiting aircrew member’s
qualifications must be equivalent to the qualification requirements for the planned mission at the
TDY location in order to perform aircrew duties on operational/training missions. Squadron
commanders or operations officers may identify additional requirements before TDY aircrew
members act as primary aircrew members on operational or training missions. This provision
allows instructors to perform aircrew training, or students to receive flying training at squadrons
inside or outside their assigned MAJCOM. EXCEPTION: HHQ supervisory flyers, HHQ
stan/eval personnel, aircrew performing FCFs at depot-level maintenance (MX) locations, and
aircrew performing search and rescue (SAR) operations do not require local area
orientation/theater indoctrination, nor the orientation flight. This exemption does not relieve
these TDY aircrew members from the responsibility of familiarizing themselves, as much as
practical, with the local environment.

                                            Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Overview. The requirements in this chapter satisfy minimum flying and related ground
requirements established by HQ USAF to maintain continuation training requirements upon
completion of qualification, requalification, or certification training. Individual proficiency may
require a greater number of events to be completed. Commanders will ensure aircrew members
receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. General Requirements. Squadron operations officers must ensure flight training programs
consider local conditions and individual capabilities to maximize training continuity. Effective
training is founded on the aircrew member’s confidence in basic skills such as navigation,
systems operation, NVGs, formation, instruments, and low-level. Training programs must
include regular and recurring exposure to the fundamentals of the squadron mission. Lessons
learned from recent MDS-like mishaps should be integrated into training plans and programs
where feasible.
4.3. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). RAP is a continuation training program designed to
focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a squadron’s core-tasked missions. The UH-
1N RAP program emphasizes both quality of training over quantity of events (e.g., full
instrument approach procedure rather than vectors to final), and practicing tactical employment
which simulates conditions anticipated. Each MAJCOM will develop an RTM to direct and
monitor a RAP program.
   4.3.1. Developing the RTM. Except where specifically noted, the MAJCOM A3 training
   and stan/eval division chief may make changes, additions, or deletions to the required
   certifications and continuation training specified in this instruction to focus training on
   capabilities required to accomplish a squadron's tasked missions. MAJCOMs will identify
   required training, clarify training requirements directed in other instructions, identify training
   cycles, and delineate reporting instructions.
       4.3.1.1. This instruction identifies the majority of UH-1N aircrew member training
       requirements; however, some listed training doesn’t apply to every user MAJCOM. This
       instruction does not direct MAJCOM specific LMT courses/events, nor CMR required
       events established by other instructions (e.g., AFI 16-1301). Flying continuation training
       requirements identified in Table 4.5 are the minimum required for all user MAJCOM
       aircrew members.
       4.3.1.2. Squadrons will submit training reports as directed by RTM. When directed,
       reports should summarize squadron training status/unresolved issues, consist of
       significant shortfalls/limiting factors (LIMFAC) affecting training, and suggest possible
       solutions or specific assistance required.
4.4. In-Processing and Out-Processing. Squadrons will develop procedures to ensure flight
and training records screening is accomplished during squadron in-processing and out-
processing. This screening should be accomplished in sufficient time to ensure discrepancies are
corrected prior to an aircrew member’s first flight at their new duty station, or their PCS.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   29


   4.4.1. Losing Squadron Procedures. Losing squadrons will ensure aircrew members are
   current in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 for a period of at least two months following PCS to
   another UH-1N flying assignment. In addition, losing squadrons will ensure aircrew
   members are current in aerospace physiological training, brown-out/white-out training,
   CRM, simulator refresher, and all qualification evaluations for a period of at least six months
   following PCS. If unable to comply, the commander must coordinate with the gaining
   squadron. All personnel departing to short tour areas, to include indeterminate TDYs
   (ITDY), will be scheduled by the losing organization for simulator refresher, physiological
   training, and other training as appropriate to ensure they do not go non-current during short-
   tour assignments.
   4.4.2. Intra/Inter-Command Transfer. Intra-command and inter-command transferring
   aircrew member qualifications/certifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   squadron commander. The gaining squadron commander will determine what training, if
   any, is required for newly assigned personnel. At a minimum, LFT will be completed before
   the aircrew member is certified to perform aircrew duties.
   4.4.3. ARMS Tracking Procedures. Squadrons will develop local tracking procedures IAW
   AFI 11-202V1 to ensure aircrew ground and flying training listed on the MAJCOM RTM is
   properly documented and updated in ARMS. Each squadron will provide a printed copy of
   current ground and flying summaries to each individual prior to PCS. ARMS identifiers are
   annotated in this chapter for reference only.
      4.4.3.1. The squadron commander will review all incoming/upgrading UH-1N assigned
      API-1/A, 6/B, and 8/D flyer training records, and code them as experienced or
      inexperienced in ARMS. Accurate ARMS database experience levels will ensure all
      levels of the rated mangement tiers of the Air Force have the most accurate data on which
      to base decisions affecting the UH-1N crew force.
   4.4.4. Inbound Aircrew Members. User MAJCOMs must address Table 4.1 training
   requirements within their RTM for all non-flying to flying permanent change of assignment
   (PCA) and PCS inbound aircrew members. Mast Bump Training and LFT are required for
   each inbound PCA/PCS aircrew member prior to their first flight. Fire Extinguisher Training
   and the Marshalling Exam will be IAW the parent publication referenced in Table 4.1 FSs
   will accomplish all required ground training listed in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 prior to their
   first LMT flight. Other non-grounding LFT events may be accomplished during upgrade
   training, but must be completed prior to the corresponding training flight. Document training
   in the aircrew member’s LFT training folder.

   4.4.5. Removal From Active Flying. Refer to AFI 11-202V1 for recurring training
   requirements prior to removing an aircrew member from active flying status.
 30                                                       AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


4.5. Proration of End-of-Cycle Flying Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the
squadron commander may prorate training requirements when DNIF, emergency leaves, and
non-flying TDY/exercises or combat/contingency deployments preclude training for a portion of
the training period. Ordinary leave will not be considered as non-availability. Extended bad
weather (WX), which precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days, may be
considered as non-availability. Follow proration procedures in AFI 11-202V1 and guidance
discussed below:
   4.5.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-
   availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.
   4.5.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training
   cycle. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on cumulative
   calendar days of non-availability.
       4.5.2.1. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the
       next lower whole number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
   4.5.3. Example of a proration method: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave
   during January, and attended squadron officer school (SOS) in residence from March through
   April totaling 56 consecutive calendar days. Adding the 17 days for emergency leave and 56
   days for SOS, Capt Jones’ squadron commander was able to authorize 73 total days, or two
   months of proration to Capt Jones’ training cycle.
   4.5.4. Newly assigned/converted aircrew members and aircrew members achieving
   BMC/CMR after the 15th of the month are considered to be in continuation training on the
   first day of the following month for proration purposes. The prorated share of RAP sorties
   must be completed during continuation training.

Table 4.2. Conversion Table for Training Proration.

4.6. Ground Training.
   4.6.1. General Information. Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 define recurring ground training
   requirements for all aircrew members if qualified/certified in the event. Some events may
   include a flight portion in order to complete the ground training event [i.e., instrument
   evaluation (AA11), LFT (T002), mission evaluation (AB00), pyrotechnics initial/refresher
   (AC09), and qualification evaluation (AA01)].          Squadrons will complete training
   requirements as identified via MAJCOM RTM. Table notes define training code status (i.e.,
   grounding, non-grounding, or other restrictions). Squadron Commanders may add additional
   training to meet unit-specific mission requirements.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                     31


       4.6.1.1. Minimum OSF required ground training includes the following events IAW the
       event description in Table 4.3: LL04, AC04, LL03, T001, and T002. MT’s will receive
       additional training in LL01, LL06, and AC05.
   4.6.2. Loss of Currency. Unless posted differently in the training event’s parent document,
   do not exceed the end-of-month due date for all ground training events. If the end-of-month
   due date is exceeded, the new end-of-month due date will be established based off the date
   the event was completed. For training events that are grounding, aircrew members are not
   authorized to fly until the training event is completed, or a waiver is obtained from the
   appropriate approval authority. Events are considered current until the end of the month in
   which they are due.
   4.6.3. Block Training. When practical, block training (mass scheduling of personnel for a
   particular date and time) is the most efficient and preferred method of satisfying annual
   ground training requirements for both assigned and attached aircrew members.
   4.6.4. Ancillary Training. Aircrew will accomplish ancillary training as required by AFI 11-
   202V1, this instruction, MAJCOM guidance, and the squadron commander. Although this
   instruction does not include non-MDS specific ancillary training, this type training will be
   tracked per squadron commander guidance. Where discrepancies exist, the reference
   directive takes precedence.

   4.7.2. Flying Training Cycle. The flying training cycle is normally 12 months long from 1
   October to 30 September to coincide with the fiscal year. Squadrons will complete training
   requirements during this training cycle unless specifically noted otherwise via MAJCOM
   RTM. The flying training cycle will not exceed one year.
   4.7.3. Flight Training Levels (FTL).
      4.7.3.1. Aircrew members require a minimum number of flight-hours to be considered
      experienced in the UH-1N IAW AFI 11-412. Inexperienced aircrew must train at a
      higher rate to maintain currency/proficiency levels. Training tables in the MAJCOM
      RTM define requirements for each FTL.
      4.7.3.2. The use of experienced based FTLs allows the squadron commander the ability
      to prioritize training resources. Aircrew members must meet the minimum criteria
      established in Table 4.6 before assignment to the respective FTL. When these minima
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   39


         are met, awarding an FTL is at the sole discretion of the squadron commander or
         designated representative for both assigned and attached aircrew members. End-of-cycle
         training requirements will be based on the aircrew member's assigned FTL on the last day
         of the current training cycle. Assigning an aircrew member to an FTL does not preclude
         the squadron commander from scheduling an aircrew member for additional flying
         training.
         4.7.3.3. FTLs are based on both minimum PAA time and total rotary wing time IAW
         Table 4.6

             assignment flyers, and 1 year at his/her first
             flying assignment.
 NOTE:
 Regardless of experience level, continuation training requirements for aircrew assigned to
 API-6/8/B/D BMC positions will be directed via MAJCOM RTM.
   4.7.4. Crediting Continuation Training Events. Aircrew members qualified/certified may
   credit continuation training if they perform the required events/sub-events identified in
   MAJCOM RTMs required for that item/sortie. Flight currency may be credited in the
   following manner:
         4.7.4.1. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the requirements of this
         instruction are met. Two or more flying continuation training profiles and compatible
         events may be credited on a single flight. When more than one continuation training
         event is required, a proportionate share should be completed during the training period
         rather than finishing the total requirement on one sortie. Operations officers should
         ensure flying training accomplishments are spread evenly over the training period to
         ensure maximum aircrew proficiency.
40                                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


     4.7.4.2. If circumstances beyond the control of the aircrew prevent completion of all
     profile items or events on a single sortie, those items or events not completed may be
     accomplished on a subsequent sortie and logged for currency, provided the training is
     completed within 10 duty days. Squadrons must establish local tracking procedures.
     4.7.4.3. Aircrew members in an upgrade who are current and qualified in a specific event
     may credit events/sorties accomplished in the upgrade towards continuation training at
     the discretion of the instructor. Events completed on a satisfactory evaluation, or
     certification training completion, may be credited toward continuation training at the
     discretion of the evaluator.
     4.7.4.4. Pilots who are non-current for instrument events remain BAQ, but will fly under
     the supervision of an instructor until recurrent in instruments. Aircrew members who are
     non-current for night events remain BAQ, but cannot perform the specified event(s) until
     current. These aircrew members can still fly day events without an instructor. Aircrew
     members who are non-current/unqualified for NVG events remain mission qualified, but
     cannot perform the specified event(s) until current/qualified.
     4.7.4.5. Precision or non-precision approach dual credits an instrument approach. Night
     continuation training events dual credits similar day events (i.e., night transition sortie
     credits day transition sortie requirements). NVG continuation training events credit
     similar day and unaided currency events (i.e., NVG sortie credits both night sortie and
     basic sortie requirements).
     4.7.4.6. Aircrew members are authorized to log all events flown in the FTU WST IAW
     Note 1 of Table 4.7 The aircrew complement must be IAW AFI 11-2UH-1NV3.
     Civilian ATS instructors meet the aircrew complement requirement if previously
     qualified in the required helicopter aircrew position (e.g., IP, IF). For all other
     simulators, aircrew members are authorized to log only those events for which the
     simulator has been certified by HQ AFGSC. EP sorties, to include recurrency sorties,
     require an IP (active duty or qualified ATS instructor) either at a set of controls or
     running the instructor operator station. When logging continuation training in a simulator
     while non-current, aircrews are required to complete a full aircraft/systems run-up and a
     full aircraft/systems shutdown under the supervision of an instructor. Note: Logging
     more than one of the same currency event in the same day is not permitted in a simulator.
     4.7.4.7. FSs will accomplish specified training items IAW AFI 11-202V1, this
     instruction, and the MAJCOM RTM.
     4.7.4.8. MTs, and TRF/CRF personnel are not designated aircrew per AFI 11-402.
     However, due to their frequent exposure to the risks associated with military flying, they
     may be designated OSFs and have recurring training requirements. See paragraph
     4.6.1.1 and Table 4.3 for a description of recurring training requirements.
     Documentation will be maintained at the squadron to which they are attached for flying.
  4.7.5. Loss of Currency. Aircrew members delinquent in continuation training requirements
  must conduct training as directed by the squadron commander.
     4.7.5.1. Non-Current. Continuation training currency expires at the end of the Zulu time
     period in which the event was not accomplished. Events are delinquent on the first day
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                    41


      after the allotted time period (e.g., 45 and 60-day requirements are non-current at 0000
      Zulu on the 46th and 61st days following the last accomplished event, respectively).
          4.7.5.1.1. Loss of BAQ Currency. Except for night sortie (B410) and night transition
          sortie (B490), non-currency status in any BAQ event prohibits unsupervised flight in
          all areas.
          4.7.5.1.2. Loss of BMC/CMR Currency. Non-currency status in any BMC or CMR
          event prohibits unsupervised flight for the specific mission event.
          4.7.5.1.3. Non-Current up to Six Months. Aircrew members non-current in any
          event for up to six months must fly under the supervision of an instructor who is
          current and qualified/certified in those events. In order to demonstrate proficiency,
          aircrew must perform a sufficient number of repetitions in each delinquent item.
          These events may be credited toward annual continuation training requirements. The
          six month non-current date is calculated by identifying the next day, then adding six
          months. FSs follow continuation training requirements established in AFI 11-202V1,
          and may fly with any aircrew instructor to regain currency.
          4.7.5.1.4. Non-Current Greater than Six Months for Qualification Events. Aircrew
          members non-current in any qualification event greater than six months are
          considered unqualified in that event. FSs follow requirements established in AFI 11-
          202V1.
          4.7.5.1.5. Non-Current Greater than Six Months for Instructor Certified Events.
          Aircrew members non-current in any instructor certified event greater than six
          months must demonstrate proficiency with an instructor in all delinquent items.
   4.7.6. Requalification/Recertification Training. Comply with requalification requirements in
   paragraph 2.7 and paragraph 3.6, and recertification requirements in paragraph 5.9
   4.7.7. Multiple Qualification Continuation Training Requirements. Aircrew members
   authorized by their MAJCOM to maintain qualification in multiple aircraft must perform an
   equitable distribution of events in each aircraft. As a minimum, at least one EP sortie should
   be flown in their primary aircraft each quarter. MAJCOMs will determine continuation
   training requirements for additional aircraft.
   4.7.8. Consolidated Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Table 4.7 is a consolidated
   list of annual currency, proficiency, and experience requirements for aircrew flying training
   events. MAJCOMs may establish additional continuation training requirements via
   MAJCOM RTM.

 3. Non-currency in this event restricts unsupervised flight in night events.
 4. Aircrew members completing engine running crew changes need only complete the
 applicable portions of the sortie (i.e., run-up or shut-down procedures).

NOTES:
1. MAJCOMs requiring event certification will define additional requirements via MAJCOM
RTM.
2. All ACDE flights are required to be flown within autorotational distance of land.
3. The entire ACDE need not be worn. Normally wear only the mask, helmet, and NOMEX
gloves. The protective hood is not required. The 77 AESG/CC has recommended the M-45
Chemical-Biological Mask as safe-to-fly. User MAJCOMs will assume Operational Safety,
Suitability, and Effectiveness responsibility per AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering.
4. Aircrew members will perform primary crew duty tasks while wearing the ACDE. The
required components must be worn for a minimum of one hour; 30 minutes of which must be
while flying. The remaining portion may be comprised of ground tasks (e.g., preflight, engine
start/shutdown, taxi, etc.). At least one take-off and one landing will be performed. The
remainder of the time should be devoted to a cross-section of normal flight tasks.

                       UPGRADE AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This section outlines the prerequisites and training requirements for qualified
aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification and certification in specialized
flight events. This training includes all certifications associated with specialized equipment,
tactics, or events which are unit specific. AFI 11-2UH-1NV2 identifies authorized UH-1N
difference certification/instructor certified events; and this chapter identifies the training
requirements. Certifications do not require evaluations, but may be evaluated as part of a SPOT,
no-notice, or recurring evaluation. MAJCOMs direct all certification training requirements via
RTM.
5.2. Aircraft Commander Certification. This certification assesses the pilot’s ability to
perform pilot-in-command duties and responsibilities. Once certified, the pilot may be assigned
the pilot-in-command code on the flight authorization as outlined in AFI 11-401. Prerequisite
flying time levels for aircraft commander certification are based upon pilots gaining the
knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the squadron mission. Commanders
will ensure continuation training programs emphasize these core principles for their pilots.
   5.2.1. Mission Aircraft Commander Certification. This certification entitles pilots that have
   completed the formal MQT course, LMT, and have met the requisite hours in Table 5.1 to
   conduct aircraft commander duties for all squadron flying missions.

Table 5.1. Mission Aircraft Commander Certification Flying Time Requirements(1,2).

 NOTES:
 1. Total time requirements must be achieved prior to certification.
 2. For certification purposes, any type H-1 PAA time counts.
 3. Total Flying Time is a combination of "Total Time" + "Student Time" from the ARMS
 flying history report.
 4. Cross flow indicates an aircraft commander from another airframe who has transitioned to
 the UH-1N.
5.3. Mission Commander (MCC) Certification Program. MCC certification programs will
ensure an aircraft commander’s ability to conduct command and control of complex missions
that may involve multiple aircraft and forces/agencies. User MAJCOMs will determine when a
MAJCOM specific MCC certification program is required, and if applicable, are responsible for
developing and implementing a MAJCOM specific MCC certification program. MAJCOM
Training and Stan/Eval Division Chief will approve NAF/squadron developed training programs.
5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. A sound and practical aircrew instructor program is a
prerequisite for effective training, standardization, and aircraft mishap prevention. The aircrew
instructor program includes individuals required to perform duties as an instructor for any crew
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                     53


position. Individuals designated for instructor duty will be trained to instruct all levels of their
qualification.
   5.4.1. Instructor Upgrade Prerequisites. Squadrons will select instructors from aircrew
   members who are thoroughly qualified and skilled in the duties of their respective crew
   positions. All candidates must follow waiver guidance in the SOI if they don’t meet ETCA
   and MAJCOM (if applicable) listed pre-requisites. First time instructor candidates will
   attend the applicable upgrade course conducted at the FTU if a quota is available. If no quota
   is available, follow SMT waiver requirements. Squadron Commanders will personally
   review each instructor candidate's qualifications for the following minimum prerequisites:
       5.4.1.1. Instructional Ability. All prospective instructors must qualify under the
       principles of instruction as outlined in AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force
       Instructors.
       5.4.1.2. Judgment. The candidate must possess the judgment necessary to meet
       unexpected or induced emergencies through the mature realization of their own, their
       student’s, and the aircraft's limitations.
       5.4.1.3. Personal Qualities. The candidate must have patience, tact, understanding, and a
       desire to instruct others. Instructors must have a personality that inspires and wins the
       respect of each student.
       5.4.1.4. Technical Knowledge. The candidate must be thoroughly familiar with
       respective aircraft systems and equipment, normal and emergency operating procedures,
       as well as the prohibited maneuvers and aircraft performance limitations under all
       conditions of flight. Additionally, all instructors will be thoroughly familiar with the
       applicable portions of AFMAN 36-2236, AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-202V3, General Flight
       Rules, this instruction, and all associated supplements.
       5.4.1.5. Flying Proficiency. Unless approved to conduct the instructor upgrade in
       conjunction with a formal course, individuals selected must be current, qualified, and
       proficient.
       5.4.1.6. Flying Experience. Candidates must possess a reasonable background of flying
       experience in order to have developed the desired standards of knowledge, judgment, and
       proficiency. Normally, flying hours and flying experience qualities progress together;
       however, flying hours alone cannot be accepted as criteria for any one or all of the
       qualities required.
       5.4.1.7. Previous Instructor Experience. Instructor candidates who have previously
       completed a USAF formal flight instructor training program may be upgraded in-unit
       with OG/CC approval. No SMT waiver is required to conduct this training. However,
       squadron commanders may request an FTU course overage for previously qualified
       instructors at their discretion.
       5.4.1.8. Instructor Flying-Hour Requirements. See Table 5.2
           5.4.1.8.1. Aircraft Commander Flight-Time Documentation. Squadron training
           offices should track and document an IP candidate’s UH-1N specific flight-hours
           after aircraft commander certification to ensure they have obtained the minimum 50
           UH-1N specific flight-hours.

 NOTES:
 1. Total time requirements must be achieved prior to qualification.
 2. Instructor aircrew transitioning from another airframe may upgrade directly to the instructor
 level during qualification training with MAJCOM/A3 approval.
5.5. Aircrew Evaluator Program. Flight examiner certifications will be accomplished IAW
AFI 11-202V2 as supplemented.
5.6. Difference Certification Training (DCT). Training designed to allow aircrew maintaining
UH-1N series qualification to maintain certification in other H-1 series aircraft.
   5.6.1. Authorized Certifications.
       5.6.1.1. TH-1H Certification. Qualified UH-1N aircrew members required to fly the TH-
       1H will be certified and maintain TH-1H continuation training requirements IAW AFI
       11-2TH-1HV1, TH-1H Helicopter Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-2TH-1HV2, TH-1H
       Helicopter Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
   5.6.2. Training Methods. Qualified UH-1N aircrew members may obtain difference
   certification between H-1 series aircraft using the appropriate approved differences training
   syllabi. The primary method of training will be conducted in-unit.
   5.6.3. Training Requirements. Training will highlight differences between the series or
   variant. Ground training will include as a minimum: Hands-on egress training; a full
   discussion of the flight manual with emphasis on EPs, limitations, aircraft systems; and
   series-specific instrument procedures.
   5.6.4. Mission Requirements. Upon successful completion of the certification, existing
   mission qualifications and certifications (except FCF certification) transfer between H-1
   series aircraft.
5.7. Unit-Specific Certifications. This is tactical top-off certification training for aircrew
members arriving direct from the FTU or a different MAJCOM, which is designed to complete
instruction on squadron-specific tactical flying events either not adequately addressed at the
FTU, or mission sets not required by previous MAJCOM. This training includes LMC, as well
as other certifications listed in Table 5.3 that may or may not be required by the member’s new
flying unit to maintain CMR status.
5.8. Instructor Certified Event Training Requirements. Table 5.3 defines requirements for
certifications authorized in AFI 11-2UH-1NV2 (not including aircraft commander, evaluator,
and DCT) for all aircrew members. Training will be conducted by an IP or IF as appropriate.
Squadrons will certify aircrew members in the minimum flight events IAW the MAJCOM RTM.
Table notes define training code status (i.e., non-grounding or other restrictions).
   5.8.1. When NVG ACDE Flight Certification (LL08) is required for a user MAJCOM OSF,
   follow guidance under the appropriate course description within Table 5.3 Day ACDE

   AIRCREW TRAINING RECORDS AND REMEDIAL/PROGRESS REVIEW (PR)
                         PROCEDURES

6.1. General. Establish and maintain aircrew member training records IAW AFI 11-202
volumes, this instruction, AFI 11-401, and appropriate MAJCOM directives. This chapter
provides guidelines on documenting student training, and maintaining training records.
MAJCOMs are authorized to use PEX, graduate training integration management system
(GTIMS), or any other locally developed hard-copy/electronic training folder; however,
guidance (to include grading methods) that differ from those described within this chapter must
be provided. The UH-1N FTU is exempt from procedures within this Chapter.
6.2. Entry Into Upgrade. Initiate a training folder for ETCA formal training courses in whole
or in part (FTU or in-unit), LMT, difference training, specialty training,
certification/recertification training, and all corrective action or additional training. Each formal
training program must have documentation of entry into upgrade by squadron leadership. This
will normally consist of an entry on the first AETC Form 73, Aircrew Training Narrative, in the
trainee’s record. Squadrons may substitute an MFR in place of the AETC Form 73 entry. This
document will be signed by the squadron operations officer, or designated representative.
   6.2.1. Active Training Folder Storage. Active training folders must be maintained in a
   location readily accessible to instructors, trainers, supervisory personnel, and the individuals
   in training. This location will be at the squadron to which the student is assigned/attached for
   flying.
6.3. Training Folders.
   6.3.1. Training Folder Binder. When an electronic training folder is not used, a hard-sided
   binder will be used as the training folder. The binder cover sheet will be locally designed
   and placed on the front outside portion of the binder. The cover sheet should reflect the
   following minimum information: Name, Rank, Aircrew Position, Type of Training, Training
   Start Date, and Required Training Completion Date. If a waiver to the required training
   completion date has been granted, cross-out previous date and right in the new approved
   date.
       6.3.1.1. Binder Spine. The spine will reflect the following minimum information: The
       Rank and Last Name of the individual in training, and the type/name of training enrolled
       in. Note: If one binder is used for multiple personnel, the spine will reflect the category
       of personnel (i.e., TRF) and type/name of training.
   6.3.2. Training Folder Sections. The training folder will be composed of the following
   sections:
       6.3.2.1. Section 1--Checklist(s). This section contains locally developed checklists (e.g.,
       in-processing, upgrade, and requalification checklists).
       6.3.2.2. Section 2--Administrative. This section will contain general administrative type
       form(s) or letter(s). The administrative section should be organized in the following
       sequence: FTU upgrade course flow sheets (or locally developed course flow sheets
       derived from FTU upgrade course flow sheets), prerequisite worksheets (if applicable),
60                                                      AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


     ARMS ground training input worksheet (if applicable), mission scenarios (if applicable),
     completed ADSC form, MFRs, and other memorandums of significance.
     6.3.2.3. Section 3--AETC Form 75, Aircrew Training Record – Ground/Flying Training
     Summary. For circumstances in which a student has started his/her upgrade at the FTU,
     but was unable to complete it there, squadrons are authorized to continue the electronic
     format, use AETC Form 75 (applicable to specific upgrade), or use another MAJCOM
     approved method to track the individual’s training.
     6.3.2.4. Section 4--AETC Form 74, Aircrew Training Sortie Maneuver Grades, and
     AETC Form 73. This section contains all materials required by an individual to complete
     their specific LMT or upgrade. For circumstances in which a student has started his/her
     upgrade at the FTU, but was unable to complete it there, squadrons are authorized to
     continue the electronic format, use AETC Form 74 and AETC Form 73, or use another
     MAJCOM approved method for training documentation.
         6.3.2.4.1. If there is more than one training event, certification, or upgrade being
         accomplished during the individual’s training, then each upgrade/certification will be
         separated by divider(s).
     6.3.2.5. Section 5--SOIs. This section contains either an FTU, MAJCOM-approved, or
     unit developed SOI.
  6.3.3. AETC Form 75, Aircrew Training Record – Ground/Flying Training Summary. Page
  one of the AETC Form 75 provides a chronological record of ground training events. Entries
  are required for academic ground training, locally-developed/unit-specific ground training,
  remedial ground training (e.g., GT-3/R-1), and cockpit procedural training. All of these
  ground training events require an AETC Form 75 entry. Comply with the following
  instructions when documenting aircrew member training on the AETC Form 75, page one.
     6.3.3.1. NAME. Enter student’s rank and last name.
     6.3.3.2. DATE YR____. Self-explanatory.
     6.3.3.3. TNG. Enter the ground/academic training period identifier from either the
     course flow or prerequisite sheets in the “TNG” block. For remedial ground training,
     enter the respective designator (e.g., GT-3/R-1, 11/SYS-9/R-1, 11/MSN-10/A/R-1).
     6.3.3.4. GRADE. Instructors will annotate an overall grade for each ground/academic
     training period IAW the respective SOI grading criteria. When using Table 6.1, use a
     grade of “3” for ground training events which don’t require an actual grade to indicate
     training is complete.
     6.3.3.5. INSTRUCTOR NAME. Enter the last name of the instructor or evaluator who
     accomplished the training.
     6.3.3.6. TIME. Self-explanatory. Do not include time normally associated with
     prebriefing and debriefing training missions.
  6.3.4. AETC Form 75, Aircrew Training Record – Ground/Flying Training Summary. Page
  two of AETC Form 75 provides a chronological record of flying training events. Record
  flight training events on training sorties and operational missions. All events scheduled will
  be logged, even if canceled by external factors (e.g., WX, MX). Entries on the AETC Form
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                        61


   75 will also have an accompanying entry on the AETC Form 73. Comply with the following
   instructions when documenting aircrew member training on the AETC Form 75, pages two
   and three:
        6.3.4.1. DATE YR____. Self-explanatory.
        6.3.4.2. TNG. Enter the numbered flight training period designators (e.g., AC-2, AI-3,
        EV-1). When squadrons use FTU courseware, enter the lesson designators. Flights
        accomplished simultaneously will not be entered together on one line, but will be entered
        on two separate lines with the training times divided appropriately.
        6.3.4.3. GRADE. Instructors or evaluators will compute an overall grade for each ride
        (instructional or evaluation). Table 6.1 lists overall lesson grades. Table 6.2 lists overall
        status and incomplete descriptions when using GTIMS. Flight evaluation results will be
        annotated as Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3.

                           within that category/phase of training, the student may continue to
                           the next sortie/lesson, but must be brought back to RPL through
                           remedial instruction. Document the remedial instruction in the
                           narrative section of the student’s training folder to clear the

                      required RPL for the sortie.
                      Student Nonprogression (SNP)/X Sorties – An X sortie/lesson (or
                      student nonprogression) is used to document additional
                      sorties/lessons beyond syllabus requirements in order to provide
                      remedial training to bring student performance up to RPL.
                      X sorties are used under the following circumstances:
                         - Any sortie/lesson with a training task graded “D” or an
                              overall grade of “0.”
                         - Failure to meet RPL for a recommendation ride.

                              not required.
                          - If a second remedial lesson is required, the overall grade for
                              the first lesson would be “NG” (student remains in training
                              status), and the second lesson will be graded using normal
                              grading procedures.
                          - The first of multiple remedial lessons will be graded “0” only
                              if the student’s performance compromises safety, and further
                              flights are not recommended.
                          - If on the final authorized remedial lesson recommended by
                              the PR process, the student does not advance to the next
                              lesson, the student will be graded “0.”

                          - Direct Support – Direct support sorties are authorized to
                              support either operational missions or another student’s
                              syllabus-directed training requirement via single-ship or
                              formation. When flown under instructor supervision, students
                              may perform direct support aircrew stick shaker duties in
                              events or missions they have not been trained for, which
                              would otherwise require another qualified aircrew member.
                              When not under direct instructor supervision, students may
                              fly operational missions (e.g., ferry flights) in which they
                              have already been qualified in (e.g., BAQ). As these sorties
                              are not dedicated to training the supporting student to meet
                              syllabus CTS, do not include the direct support time in the
                              supporting student’s training folder. Enter 0.0 hours.
                          - Identify BIT and direct support sorties as ADD-1, ADD-2,
                              ADD-3, etc., in the student’s training folder. All ADD-#
                              sorties require a write-up to describe the mission in the
                              narrative record, and are numbered sequentially within the
                              course. For direct support sorties, include the student’s
                              primary, secondary, and total flight time in the narrative.
                              ADD-# sorties may never be used to augment a student’s
                              training after the student is entered into the commander’s
                              review (CR) process.
                      The overall grade will be an “I” if the student is not graded on all
                      lesson job elements, and any of the following conditions are met:
                          - The student has not previously attained the RPL of the missed
                              job element(s), and the RPL changes to a higher level on the
                              next training period.
                          - The student was graded “I” on the previous training period,
                              and the missed job element(s) could not be accomplished
 I       Incomplete           during the current training period.
                      Procedures:

  training profiles, task listings, scheduled training, and Maneuver Task Performance
  Standards/RPLs for each ground/flight-training task IAW the respective SOI. This form
  reflects RPLs required for training sortie completion, and is also used to document the
  student’s demonstrated task/sub-task performance and knowledge levels. An end of task
  RPL is annotated on the right side. This RPL must be maintained prior to the respective
  flight evaluation. Maintain AETC Form 74 in Section 4 of the training folder. Comply with
  the following instructions when documenting aircrew training sortie maneuver grades:
     6.3.5.1. TRAINEE NAME. Enter the student’s rank and last name.

         documents. When additional columns are required, enter the next training mission
         and number in the first blank column, and grade the applicable tasks in the “P”
         column. If a training flight is continued on another sortie due to an incomplete
         lesson, indicate the same lesson number at the top of the first available unnumbered
         column, and enter the grades of the maneuvers flown on that sortie in the appropriate
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   67


         “P” column boxes. The grades entered on reflown flights need not be slashed (/)
         through to indicate completion.
      6.3.5.5. PROGRAMMED HOURS. Annotate actual training time of the sortie (e.g., 1.2,
      1.9, 2.5). For FTU upgrades accomplished via SMT, training flight duration should be as
      close as possible to the FTU course profile flight time. The intent is to ensure sufficient
      time is allotted for the performance of a sufficient number of maneuvers or event
      accomplishment during the individual sortie to ensure the student has a chance for normal
      progression.
      6.3.5.6. DATE (DD MMM). Annotate day and month (e.g., 06 Mar, 29 Sep) training
      was accomplished.
      6.3.5.7. GRADE. Instructors or evaluators will compute an overall lesson grade for each
      ride (instructional or evaluation).
      6.3.5.8. TASK/TOPIC LISTING. Use the far left column to identify a general area (e.g.,
      Flight Preparation, Normal Operations, EPs). The FTU or MAJCOM will develop these
      listings from the appropriate master training task list (MTTL).
      6.3.5.9. MIN EVN. This column reflects the minimum number of times a student must
      perform, or be exposed to an event/task on any given mission, series of missions, or
      phase of training. These events cannot be PA’d, and are minimum requirements.
      6.3.5.10. Maneuver Task Performance Standards/RPLs. See Table 6.3 Instructors
      assign grades based on the student’s characteristic performance without regard to the
      student’s type and amount of training. Comply with the following instructions when
      assigning grades:

          6.3.5.10.1. When using the AETC Form 74, disregard the “K” (knowledge) column.
          A single grade will be used for both performance and knowledge and will be placed
          in the “P” (performance) column.
          6.3.5.10.2. If a situation arises where an upgrade does not use all aspects of the SOI

          not applicable)], line through the unused portions of the RPL columns on the AETC
          Form 74. Squadrons are not authorized to change RPLs on SOIs directed by a higher
          authority (e.g., MAJCOM RTM).
          6.3.5.10.3. For AETC Form 74s with preprinted RPL grades, make a diagonal (/)
          slash through the grade if the student meets the RPL. If a higher or lower RPL is met,
          write the new grade over the preprinted one. If the job element contains an RPL of
          "R" (review), and the student satisfactorily completes the reviewed item, then slash (/)
          through the "R". An RPL of "I" indicates a requirement for introduction of the
          maneuver. An instructor will demonstrate the task and place an "I" for introduction
          in the block. If there are no indicated RPLs for a particular event, the student need
          not demonstrate proficiency or knowledge; however, instructors may grade those
          events when time, student needs, and abilities permit during training sorties.
          Instructors may also use these blocks to allow exceptional students to PA, or tailor
          lessons to the needs of the student. If there is a situation where the AETC Form 74
          doesn’t have preprinted RPL grades, the instructor will indicate the grade attained by
          the student on each accomplished job element by writing the grade in the appropriate
          “P” column and row.
       6.3.5.11. End of Phase RPL Level. The “P” column indicates the end of phase/task
       performance standard required for each task and sub-task. Students will not be evaluated
       until required task performance standards are attained.
  6.3.6. AETC Form 73, Aircrew Training Narratives. This form is used to document
  narrative descriptions of training events, monthly director of training (DOT) reviews,
  operations officer reviews, and training PRs. Maintain AETC Form 73s in Section 4 of the
  training folder.
       6.3.6.1. In the absence of user MAJCOM specific guidance, the squadron commander,
       operations officer, or squadron training officer/non-commissioned officer in charge
       (NCOIC) will make an entry for a BIT of 10 duty days or more, and an explanation as to
       why the training was stopped (e.g., DNIF, emergency leave, TDY). Include the dates on
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                 69


     which the training was stopped and restarted.         Other remarks may be made as
     appropriate.
        6.3.6.1.1. Any change to the training sequence requires an SOTW IAW this
        instruction. Accomplish an SOTW to document waiver approval. An SOTW is
        defined as any change in the sequence of scheduled training to better match squadron
        scheduling, MX, operational, and WX needs. An SOTW does not allow training after
        the flight evaluation. Training altered by the SOTW will be accomplished prior to the
        evaluation for that phase. SOTWs will be annotated on the AETC Form 73, and will
        include as a minimum: Affected training, rationale/justification for changing the
        training sequence, and a consideration of the effects on RPLs due to out of sequence
        training as a result of the change.
        6.3.6.1.2. Notify the MAJCOM A3 training branch chief through appropriate
        channels of all upgrades that are placed on “Hold”, and MAJCOM/A3 for upgrades
        placed on “Termination” due to student performance. Possible reasons for placing an
        individual on “Hold” might be due to DNIFs, TDYs, personal problems, etc., while a
        cause for “Termination” would be due to medical disqualification or flying/academic
        deficiencies.
        6.3.6.1.3. Upon conclusion of training, a final DOT review will be accomplished to
        ensure all training has been completed. This entry also serves to close out the training
        folder.
     6.3.6.2. Instructors or flight examiners will write a narrative for all training and
     evaluation flights (see AF Form 8 for details for evaluation flights). The following are
     considered major topic areas of the narrative description, and will be annotated for every
     entry. Entries may be hand-written or typed. Comply with the following instructions for
     each narrative:
        6.3.6.2.1. TRAINEE NAME. Enter the student’s rank and last name.
        6.3.6.2.2. AIRCRAFT TYPE. UH-1N.
        6.3.6.2.3. CREW POSITION (upgrading to). For upgrades, enter the aircrew
        position being upgraded to (e.g., IP, MT). For all other training, enter the current
        aircrew position.
        6.3.6.2.4. YEAR____ DATE (DD MMM). Self-explanatory.
        6.3.6.2.5. SORTIE ID. Enter the appropriate training period designator numbered
        sequentially (e.g., DT-1, DT-2, R-3, NR-4).
        6.3.6.2.6. PROFILE / STRENGTHS / WEAKNESSES / RECOMENDATIONS.
        Describe the mission scenario/profile to accurately document each event (e.g., NVG,
        type/number of approaches, sites/LZs flown to). Narratives in this section should
        include an entry pertaining to general WX conditions (i.e., sky condition, visibility,
        winds, temperature), as well as other pertinent WX information. Narratives should
        also elaborate on a student’s strengths and weaknesses, identify problem areas, record
        unusual circumstances, and indicate student progress. Ensure weaknesses, applicable
        restrictions, and additional training required to clear the weaknesses/restrictions are
        clearly annotated and explained. Generalized narratives such as: “Student made
70                                                 AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


     several minor errors on preflight that were corrected by the instructor” are not
     acceptable. Specific errors must be documented. A narrative will be entered
     whenever the achieved performance level was below the printed RPL. Enter the
     authorization of recommended progression on PAs. For evaluations completed Q-1,
     enter: “Profile: See AF Form 8 for details.” For evaluations graded Q-2 or Q-3,
     evaluators will make an entry using the “PROFILE / STRENGTHS / WEAKNESSES
     / RECOMMENDATIONS” format. Make one entry for each training profile
     accomplished. The format for narratives is:
        6.3.6.2.6.1. PROFILE: The first entry after Profile will be: Complete. or
        Incomplete. This will be followed by the grade earned, or why the sortie was
        incomplete. If the sortie was not completed, list what items need to be
        accomplished. A brief description of weather and other related factors [i.e.,
        equivalent moon illumination (EMI) levels for an NVG sortie or sea state for a
        water operations (ops) sortie] should be the next item. The rest of the section
        should be a brief summary of training completed, to include specific events and
        the number of iterations when relevant. The description should be written so the
        next instructor has no doubt where to pick-up the training. Detailed comments
        will be entered whenever the performance level attained is below the printed RPL.
        6.3.6.2.6.2. STRENGTHS: This section should be a brief summary of the
        student’s strengths. Make every effort to identify usable and relevant strengths to
        further build a picture of student progression for the next instructor. There should
        always be some strength or strengths to emphasize; however, if the sortie does not
        lend itself to identifying any strengths, or no strengths are honestly noted, state:
        “None Noted”. When no strengths are noted, strong consideration should be
        given to awarding the student an unsatisfactory grade for the training period.
        6.3.6.2.6.3. WEAKNESSES: This section should be a brief summary of the
        student’s weaknesses. It should also contribute to the next instructor’s ability to
        understand the proficiency level the student has attained, and provide areas at
        which the student needs to strive for improvement. An honest assessment is
        critical; on the other hand, avoid being overly harsh or judgmental. There should
        always be some weakness or weaknesses to emphasize; however, if the sortie
        does not lend itself to identifying any weaknesses, or no weaknesses are honestly
        noted, state: “None Noted”. When no weaknesses are noted, strong consideration
        should be given to awarding the student the highest grade authorized for the
        training period.
        6.3.6.2.6.4. RECOMMENDATIONS: This section is written primarily for the
        next instructor, but should also include recommendations for the student when
        applicable. List items the next instructor should emphasize, or other suggestions
        which will maximize the student’s next training event. Enter the next
        recommended step for the student (i.e., continue with training, proceed to
        evaluation, PA, etc.).
        6.3.6.2.6.5. Evaluators, instructors, and instructor candidates will sign below
        entered narratives and print their Name, Rank, Branch of Service, and duty title
        below their signature.
AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013                                                                   71

       JOHN T. DOE, Capt, USAF
       Chief of Training
               6.3.6.2.6.6. Student Review. Students will initial all entries. They will initial
               each training period’s narrative prior to their next training period indicating
               awareness of training status. The student’s initials will be placed just above the
               instructor’s signature. The student does not have to agree with the narrative
               before initialing the form.
           6.3.6.2.7. Monthly/Quarterly Reviews. The monthly review is not required during
           the month in which the quarterly review is accomplished. Reviews will be
           documented on the AETC Form 73. The reviewer will insert "DOT Review" for
           monthly reviews in the “SORTIE ID” block. Squadron operations officers are
           required to review training folders on a quarterly basis. The operations officer will
           insert "DO Review" for the quarterly reviews, SOTW entries, and other entries as
           applicable in the "SORTIE ID" block. Narratives concerning the student’s progress,
           status, and recommendations will be written in the “PROFILE / STRENGTHS /
           WEAKNESSES / RECOMMENDATIONS” block. The reviewer will sign below
           their narrative in the same format discussed after Recommendations.
           6.3.6.2.8. Operations Reviews. This review is required after the recommendation for
           a flight evaluation. It must be conducted prior to the flight evaluation. The
           operations officer, or his designated representative, will review the applicable phase
           of training to ensure that all flight and ground training requisites have been
           accomplished to the appropriate RPL. The reviewer initials in the "OPS REVIEW"
           block of the AETC Form 75 to denote completion. The reviewer will also make an
           entry of "OPS Review" in the "SORTIE ID" block of the AETC Form 73 with
           accompanying narrative in the “PROFILE / STRENGTHS / WEAKNESSES /
           RECOMMENDATIONS” block. The "OPS Review" entry will only be used for
           flight evaluation recommendation entries.
6.4. Training Folder Disposition. Training folders (hardcopy or electronic) will remain active
until an aircrew member has officially completed an upgrade, certification, etc., and the training
folder is closed. Closed folders will be maintained in an inactive status by the squadron’s
training office. Inactive training folders require annual reviews to ensure the disposition
schedule is followed. File and dispose of training folders IAW guidance found in the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule, https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm., Table
36-44, Rule 5. A copy of the training folder may be obtained by the aircrew member upon
request.
6.5. Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications/Certifications. Squadrons must
accurately track all qualifications and certifications for each aircrew member. This is best
accomplished through a combination of the AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, and a locally
generated letter of qualifications/certifications (or equivalent).
   6.5.1. IAW the career field education and training plan (CFETP), personnel in AFSC
   1AXXX are exempt from maintaining on-the-job training (OJT) Training Folders (AF Form
   623).
72                                                        AFI11-2UH-1NV1 19 MARCH 2013


  6.5.2. AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348. The AF Form 1381 or 4348 will be used to
  document instructor certified ground/flying training events. If used, the AF Form 4348 will
  be maintained in the aircrew member’s FEF IAW AFI 11-202V2.
  6.5.3. AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet. This form is
  the source document used to update aircrew certification, assign training profiles, and update
  formal flying training dates in ARMS. The squadron stan/eval or training office will
  complete this form and submit it to the SARM personnel to assign training profiles when a
  new aircrew member in-processes the squadron. Complete a new form when training
  profiles are added, aircrew certification codes change, and when formal school courses are
  completed.
  6.5.4. Letter of Qualifications/Certifications. A letter of qualification/certification (normally
  referred to as a Letter of Xs) is a commander’s tool to track individual aircrew member
  certifications and qualifications.            Guidance for maintaining a letter of
  qualification/certification should be provided in stan/eval instructions. In the absence of such
  guidance, it is recommended squadrons maintain the following information: Aircrew
  member name, highest qualification, and specialized training or certifications currently held.
  Include those mission events aircrew members are qualified/certified in. Other information
  may be included at the discretion of the squadron commander. Squadrons will forward a
  current copy of the letter of qualification/certification to the MAJCOM A3 training branch
  chief monthly.

Terms
Academic Training— A course of instruction that includes, but is not limited to classroom
instruction related to aircraft systems and operation, flight characteristics and techniques,
performance, and abnormal/normal/emergency procedures. Academic courses are designed to
prepare students for WST/simulator/flight training, and are normally completed prior to
commencing that training.
Actual Airdrop— Aerial delivery of personnel, supplies, or equipment from an aircraft while in
flight.
Aircraft Commander (AC)— A pilot who has been certified to perform duties in command.
Aircrew Training Device (ATD)— Hands on training aids that include cockpit procedure
trainers (CPT), part task trainers (PTT), WST, operational flight trainer (OFT), or simulators.
Aircrew Training System (ATS)— An integrated qualification, upgrade, and continuation
training program for aircrew. Civilian contractors conduct most academic and ATD training; Air
Force conducts all flight training.
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)— Status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly squadron aircraft. The
member must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and
flight standards set for the weapons system. BAQ will only be carried by aircrew until the
completion of MQT. Except for General Officers above the WG level, and any other aircrew
members specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, BAQ is not a permanent qualification.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)— The status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed the FTU MQT, is qualified to perform the basic squadron operational missions, but
does not maintain CMR. Aircrew member accomplishes training required to remain familiarized
in all primary missions of their weapon system and squadron missions, but may only be
qualified/certified and proficient in some. These aircrew members may also maintain special
capabilities.
Certification— The process of certifying an aircrew member in tactical employment and special
weapons capabilities, procedures, and rules.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed MQT and LMT, is fully qualified to perform the squadron’s operational mission(s),
and maintains qualification/certification/proficiency in these missions.
Continuation Training— Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew capabilities
while performing squadron missions and aircrew proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabi
missions, tests, or evaluations. This training is applicable to BAQ, BMC, and CMR aircrew
members.
Crew Resource Management (CRM)— Training concept that emphasizes team effectiveness
by enhancing individual and aircrew performance in communication, situational awareness,
effective leadership and management, and crew coordination IAW AFI 11-290.

seats. For other aircrew positions, the instructor must be readily available to assume the primary
duties if required.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE)— An evaluation of aircrew knowledge and
responsiveness to critical/non-critical EPs conducted by an evaluator. A simulator, WST, or
other ATD may be used to administer an EPE. If none of these aids are available, the EPE is
administered verbally.

Formation— Two or more aircraft under the command of a designated Mission Commander
(MC) or flight lead operating in close proximity with each other. The aircraft commander
assumes responsibility for the aircraft’s position relative to others’ flying in the same formation.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)— A flight or flights performed to determine whether an
aircraft, and/or its various components, are functioning according to predetermined specifications
while subjected to the flight environment. FCFs are conducted when it is not feasible to
determine safe or required operation (aerodynamic reaction, air loading, signal propagation, etc.)
by means of ground or shop tests. Conditions requiring FCFs are specified in the –6 T.O. for
each type of aircraft. FCF checks or maneuvers can only be accomplished by current and
qualified aircrew members.
In-unit MQT— Mission training taught at each squadron to complete training not provided at
the FTU (e.g., NVG formation, aerial gunnery, etc.) or training not required by a PCSing aircrew
member’s previous MAJCOM. Includes training taught at each squadron to complete upgrades
established as part of a larger FTU syllabus (e.g., hoist and NVG qualification).
Low-Level Operations Training— For helicopters, this is flight training conducted below 300
feet AGL.
Mission Commander (MCC)— The AMC is responsible for planning, coordinating, and
executing the operation, and through the appropriate command and control system, directs
mission support forces as required within the limits of the designating commander’s authority.
The AMC is delegated command authority to exercise operational control over assigned
operational and mission support forces in order to attain specified mission objectives during
operations and exercises. The AMC is the designating commander's representative, and is
responsible for taking care of the details and the people involved in the mission.

Mission Qualification Training (MQT)— Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in the squadron’s primary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR
or BMC status.
Night Sortie— For helicopters to credit a night or NVG sortie, aircrew must log a minimum of
one hour of night time, of which ½ hour for pilots must be primary. When performing instructor
duties, ½ hour primary time is not required.
Night Time— Night time is defined as that portion of flight time between the end of evening
civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight as published in the American Air
Almanac.
Operational Mission— Any mission not designated as a unilateral training mission.
Operational Support Flyer (OSF)— An individual whose primary full-time duty does not
require flying, but may be required by the Air Force to fly on an infrequent or irregular basis in
order to perform a specific, essential inflight duty which a regularly assigned primary or mission
aircrew member cannot perform. Helicopter OSFs may include, but are not limited to MT and
security force personnel.
Primary Aircraft Assigned (PAA)— Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational
mission. The PAA forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include manpower,
support equipment, and flying-hour funds. The operating command determines the PAA
