This instruction aligns with AFPD 32-20, Fire Protection, and implements AFI 32-2001, Fire
Emergency Services Program. It establishes policies, practices, and procedures for a
comprehensive base fire protection program at Misawa. It applies to all personnel assigned or
attached to units at Misawa AB, to include all tenant organizations. It assigns responsibilities for
fire prevention and protection and establishes a recognized standard practice for safeguarding life
and property from the effects of fire. Failure to prevent fires could seriously hamper mission
accomplishment here and at other bases worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that all personnel,
military and civilian, maintain constant vigilance to prevent needless loss of life and property to
fire. This regulation is consistent with Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH)
standards, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, Unified Facilities Criteria
(UFC), Fire Protection for Facilities Engineering, Design and Construction Requirements,
Engineering Technical Letters, and the Uniform Building Code. Standards for unique conditions
for which no fire prevention criteria have been developed or published will be developed
according to the recommendation of the Misawa Fire Emergency Services Flight. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/.
Additionally, if the publication generates a report(s), alert readers in a statement and cite all
applicable Reports Control Numbers in accordance with AFI 33-324. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from
the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command.”

Figure 7.5. Corrosives and Oxidizers.




      7.5.1. For the purposes of this instruction, corrosive materials are defined as a liquid or
      solid that cause full thickness destruction of human skin at the site of contact within an
      exposure period of four hours, or a liquid that has a severe corrosion rate on steel or
      aluminum based on the criteria in 49 CFR 173.137(c) (2). Corrosives are divided into
      two groups, acids and bases. Acids refer to the end of the pH scale, which is from 6
      down to 0 and bases; have pHs which range from 8 to 15. Oxidizers are defined as
      materials other than a gas, which may, generally by yielding oxygen, cause or enhance
      the combustion of other materials. Organic peroxides are defined as any material, other
      than a gas, that contains Oxygen (O) in the bivalent -O-O- structure and which may be
      considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide, where one or more of the hydrogen atoms
      have been replaced by organic radicals.
      7.5.2. Corrosives and oxidizers shall be located, stored, utilized and transported IAW
      NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers, NFPA 45, Standard on
      Fire Protection for Laboratories Using Chemicals, 49 CFR, parts 171-180, 29 CFR
      1910.104, 105, AFOSH STD 91-68, Chemical Safety and this 35 FWI.
      7.5.3. Oxidizers are divided into two subclasses by the DOT. They are as follows:
          7.5.3.1. Division 5.1 - Oxidizers.
          7.5.3.2. Division 5.2 - Organic Peroxides.
          7.5.3.3. Corrosives are all included in the DOT hazard class of 8.0.
          7.5.3.4. For the purpose of this Misawa Air Base Instruction, oxidizers and organic
          peroxides shall be classified according to the system described in the following
          section.
             7.5.3.4.1. Class 1 - An oxidizer whose primary hazard is that it slightly increases
             the burning rate but does not cause spontaneous ignition when it comes in contact
             with combustible materials. (Generic Type G)
             7.5.3.4.2. Class 2 - An oxidizer that will cause a moderate increase in the burning
             rate or that causes a spontaneous ignition of combustible materials with which it
             comes in contact. (Generic Types E and F)
             7.5.3.4.3. Class 3 - An oxidizer that will cause a severe increase in the burning
             rate of a combustible material with which it comes in contact or that will undergo
             vigorous self-sustained decomposition due to contamination or exposure to heat.
             (Generic Types C and D)
             7.5.3.4.4. Class 4 - An oxidizer that can undergo an explosive reaction due to
             contamination or exposure to thermal or physical shock. In addition, the oxidizer
             will enhance the burning rate and can cause spontaneous ignition of combustibles.

     maintained by dikes, drains, or floor slopes to prevent flammable liquid leakage from
     encroaching on the separation.
     7.5.10. Where Class 2, Class 3, or Class 4 liquid oxidizers are stored, means shall be
     provided to prevent the liquid oxidizer from flowing out of a cutoff area into an area
     containing incompatible materials.
     7.5.11. All storage areas containing corrosives and/or oxidizers shall be conspicuously
