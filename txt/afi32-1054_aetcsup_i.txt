1. Objectives. The primary goals of the corrosion control program are to develop and maintain
dependable and long-lived structures, equipment, plants, and systems; conserve energy; reduce
costs due to corrosion, scale, and microbiological fouling; and ensure compliance with
Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, and other applicable regulations and guidance.
2. Scope. Corrosion control keeps the effects of electrochemical or chemical attack on materials
by the environment to a minimum. The program includes:
     2.1. Corrosion control by design and materials selection.
     2.2. Use of cathodic protection to eliminate electrochemical reactions (corrosion).
     2.3. Use of industrial water treatment to reduce corrosion, scale-forming deposits, and
     biological growths in heating and cooling systems.
     2.4. Use of protective coatings to reduce atmospheric corrosion or cathodic protection
     current requirements.
     2.5. Analysis of logs and records for failure prediction and selection of corrective actions.
     2.6. Incorporation of corrective actions in repair and construction projects when corrosion,
     scale, or material deterioration occur due to materials, design, construction, operation, or the
     environment.

    and Health Administration regulations; and local (including host country) requirements.
    Major command civil engineers, or designated representatives:
       3.2.1. Assign the office of primary responsibility for the program. Appoint command
       corrosion engineers to act as the overall focal point in all corrosion control related
       matters. Appoint staff engineers as required to work with the command corrosion
       engineers as technical consultants in the three major areas of corrosion control: cathodic
       protection, industrial water treatment, and protective coatings.
       3.2.2. Provide installations with technical assistance and guidance on corrosion control.
       Develop a major command training policy for corrosion control to support budget
       requests. Past experience indicates that some type of annual contact with others involved
       in corrosion control maintains interest, allows networking on day-to-day problems, and
       cross-feeds new approaches and solutions. This is significant as most corrosion control
       positions are one-deep.
       3.2.3. Regard corrosion control as a functional design requirement of all facilities
       exposed to the environment. Ensure data and justifications are part of each project. This
       applies to all phases, from planning, project definition, and programming through design
       and construction to final acceptance. Programming documents should include
       environmental and safety factors and associated costs. Ensure key corrosion control
       features of projects have separate design documentation, including drawings,
       specifications, and design analyses.
       3.2.4. Ensure accomplishment of designs, design reviews, and construction inspection by
       qualified individuals according to major command policy for Military Construction
       Program and Operations and Maintenance projects. Past experience indicates design
       qualifications should include recognition by professional organizations, such as NACE
       International or state registration authorities, or 5 years’ experience in design and
       maintenance of the corrosion control measures under review. Consult HQ AFCESA for
       review support when necessary.
    3.3. Design Agents (Air Force, Army, Navy, or Air National Guard). Design agents will:
       3.3.1. Ensure design according to publications referenced in attachment 1.
           3.3.1.1. Accomplish surveys and design before construction contract advertisement
           or before construction in design-build contracts.
           3.3.1.2. For design of corrosion control measures, ensure designer or design reviewer
           meets qualifications according to major command policy. For example, an
           experienced NACE International Accredited Corrosion Specialist, NACE
           International Certified Cathodic Protection Specialist, or a Registered Professional
           Corrosion Engineer accredited or registered in cathodic protection should perform
           contracted cathodic protection surveys and designs.
       3.3.2. Not delete corrosion control measures from any design without the specific
       approval of the command corrosion engineer.
       3.3.3. Coordinate with the command corrosion engineer and the base corrosion control
       engineer during preliminary design. This coordination will ensure compatibility of design
       with existing corrosion control systems and maintenance of successful techniques within
AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                         5


     craftspersons’ capability. Installation personnel will approve the updating of systems and
     equipment per designer’s recommendations.
     3.3.4. Perform failure analysis for replacement projects that did not achieve life
     expectancy. Ensure complete understanding of the failure and include procedures in the
     specifications to prevent recurrence. This analysis shall be part of the preliminary design
     submittals.
     3.3.5. Coordinate among design team members to ensure material selections and system
     designs are compatible with the corrosion control approach selected.
     3.3.6. Not allow the construction contractor to continue with any work until approval of
     the corrosion control system shop drawings. The technical reviewer, usually the
     contracting officer’s technical representative, shall be knowledgeable in the installation
     of the corrosion control systems.
     3.3.7. Ensure the contractor notifies the contracting officer a minimum of 24 hours prior
     to installation, testing, or final acceptance of corrosion control systems.
     3.3.8. Ensure the construction inspector understands the corrosion control system
     installation or will involve the base corrosion control engineer or craftsperson as
     technical advisor. This involvement includes construction surveillance during installation,
     testing, and final acceptance. If the construction agent cannot ensure the presence of an
     in-house inspector during cathodic protection work, the construction agent will use Title
     II Construction Inspection Services to obtain a full-time qualified inspector.
     3.3.9. Ensure the specifications contain acceptance testing to ensure achievement of
     design criteria and the contractor performs this acceptance testing with installation
     representatives in attendance.
     3.3.10. As-built drawings shall provide the location of corrosion control system
     equipment, testing points, sampling points, and items requiring periodic maintenance.
  3.4. Designers. Designers will:
     3.4.1. Use field surveys, field tests, and experience of installation personnel in the
     design.
     3.4.2. Specify the testing necessary for the final acceptance of the corrosion control
     system. Target values of system operating parameters will be part of this testing to ensure
     the facility will function within design limits. Ensure the acceptance testing protocol
     includes procedures if acceptance testing differs from target values. Consult operations
     personnel, equipment manufacturers, and the construction contractor to determine
     solutions and set new equipment operating points.
     3.4.3. Incorporate operability and maintainability into the overall design of the corrosion
     control systems. Designs will provide minimum life cycle cost over the facility life
     expectancy.
     3.4.4. Provide detailed calculations and one-line diagrams at the preliminary design stage
     to show the magnitude and layout of the corrosion control system. For example, validate
     the use of pre-engineered tanks with factory installed cathodic protection through
     appropriate calculations and field tests.

        3.5.1. Ensure appropriately qualified and trained personnel develop and execute a
        comprehensive corrosion control program, encompassing the three areas of corrosion
        control. Ensure compliance with applicable Federal, state, local, and host nation laws and
        regulations, particularly those related to public safety and environmental protection. The
        program will include applying and maintaining effective corrosion control methods in
        design, operations and maintenance, quality assurance, and acceptance testing.
        3.5.1. (AETC) The Base Civil Engineer will appoint, in writing, a staff engineer as the
        Base Corrosion Control Engineer (BCCE). Engineers and technicians assigned corrosion
        control responsibilities must be trained by professional organizations such as NACE
        International (National Association of Corrosion Engineers). Newly appointed/assigned
        personnel must receive initial training within the first year of assignment and refresher
        training annually.
        3.5.2. Publish a squadron operating instruction for the corrosion control program. Ensure
        civil engineer squadron craftspersons receive annual training on the requirements of the
        squadron operating instruction.
        3.5.3. The base corrosion control engineer must:
            3.5.3.1. Develop and manage the base corrosion control program.
            3.5.3.2. Assist programmers in narrative and cost estimates for corrosion control line
            items on DD Forms 1391.
            3.5.3.3. Participate in project design and design review related to corrosion control.

            3.5.3.6. Review corrosion control records and take action to correct deficiencies.
            3.5.3.7. Investigate leaks from corrosion, tuberculation, and scaling in heating and
            cooling systems, and premature failure of protective coatings. Take corrective action
            in each case, other than simple repair by replacement.
4. Requirements:
     4.1. Environmental. Consult AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, and associated Air Force
     Instructions (AFI) to understand the impact of corrosion and corrosion control activities on
     the environment.
AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          7


     4.1.1. The primary environmental impact of cathodic protection is in the prevention of
     petroleum, oil, and lubricants corrosion-induced leakage into the environment from
     underground and on-ground tanks and underground piping. Cathodic protection is already
     a requirement on new tank installations. The goal is to prevent all notices of violation due
     to corrosion. Ensure compliance with AFI 32-7044, Storage Tank Compliance; Title 40,
     Code of Federal Regulations, Part 280; and applicable state and local requirements.
     4.1.2. The primary environmental concern of industrial water treatment is the proper
     disposal of chemically treated water. Consult AFI 32-1067, Water Systems. Also consult
     environmental engineering and bioenvironmental engineering prior to selecting any
     industrial water treatment chemical.
     4.1.3. The following environmental laws apply to industrial water treatment. Consult
     with bioenvironmental engineering and environmental engineering to determine methods
     of compliance with laws and local practices.
        4.1.3.1. Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601) authorizes the U.S.
        Environmental Protection Agency to control existing and new chemical substances
        determined to cause unreasonable risk to the public health or environment.
        4.1.3.2. Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251) includes the Federal Water Pollution
        Control Act and amendments. This act establishes limits for the discharge of
        pollutants to navigable waters, regulations on specific toxic pollutants in wastewater
        discharges, and control of oil and hazardous substance discharges.
        4.1.3.3. Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300) provides for protection of
        underground sources of drinking water and establishes primary and secondary
        drinking water standards.
        4.1.3.4. Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136-136y)
        requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to register all pesticides.
        4.1.3.5. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 690) addresses the
        control of solid and hazardous waste. The act defines hazardous waste and controls it
        by a complex manifest system designed to track a waste from its generation to final
        disposal.
        4.1.3.6. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
        (42 U.S.C. 9601), also commonly referred to as "Superfund," defines procedures for
        responding to existing uncontrolled hazardous waste sites, establishes the National
        Priorities List and the National Contingency Plan, and requires the reporting of
        hazardous substance releases into the air, land, and water.
        4.1.3.7. Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C. 7401) regulates air emissions from stationary and
        mobile sources to protect public health and welfare. State and local governments have
        the primary responsibility to prevent and control air pollution.
     4.1.4. Do not use chromates in any industrial water treatment application.
     4.1.5. The environmental concerns of protective coatings center upon metal content in
     the dried paint and volatile organic compounds that evaporate from solvent-based paint.
8                                            AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010


           4.1.5.1. Lead-containing paint has a lead content of more than 0.06 percent lead by
           weight (calculated as lead metal) in the total nonvolatile content of liquid paint or in
           the dried film of the paint already applied. Do not use lead-containing paint on any
           Air Force facility. Note that nonlead-containing paint must still pass a Toxicity
           Characteristic Leaching Potential Test or be considered hazardous waste during
           disposal.
           4.1.5.2. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency restricted the use of mercury-
           containing fungicides in solvent-thinned, oil-based paint. Exterior water-thinned
           paints may contain a maximum of 0.2 percent mercury (calculated as metal) in the
           total weight of the paint. Clear markings indicating the mercury content must be on
           the container. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the use of mercury
           in interior paint applications.
           4.1.5.3. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified six major pollutants
           that may harm the public health and welfare. Ozone is one of these pollutants. Since
           the presence of organic materials in the air directly relates to the ozone concentration
           in the air, volatile organic compounds used in the drying and curing of coatings have
           environmental impact. Volatile organic compound limits vary by region of the
           country and the end-use surface coating operation.
    4.2. Safety. Consult AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs, and AFPD 91-3, Occupational Safety and
    Health, as well as their associated AFIs, for guidance to minimize the risk of corrosion and
    corrosion control activities on facility and worker safety.
       4.2.1. For cathodic protection, consult AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices. The
       Department of Transportation regulates flammable utilities. The Natural Gas Pipeline
       Safety Act of 1968, as amended, and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as
       amended, provide the minimum criteria to ensure safe operation.
       4.2.2. Many of the chemicals used to treat industrial water may be harmful to the health
       of the operator and other base personnel. They range from highly toxic to mildly irritating
       to the persons handling them. Handle water treatment and testing chemicals with care,
       following guidance in Occupational Safety and Health Administration directives,
       manufacturer’s recommendations, and the material safety data sheets. Install eye wash
       stations and safety showers according to ground safety requirements. Consult with wing
       safety, bioenvironmental engineering, and environmental engineering on potential safety
       issues and the use of less hazardous substitutes.
           4.2.2.1. A cross-connection is a physical connection between a potable water supply
           system and a non-potable system (such as an industrial water system) through which
           contaminated water can enter the potable water system. Consult AFI 32-1066,
           Plumbing Systems. Permit only Class III backflow prevention devices (air gap or
           reduced pressure principle) to provide makeup from a potable water system to an
           industrial water treatment system.
           4.2.2.2. Morpholine, cyclohexylamine, and similar chemicals added to protect
           condensate lines from corrosion make the steam and condensate unfit for
           consumption or other uses normally reserved for potable water. Do not use treated
AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           9


         steam in direct contact with food or for any direct steam humidification, such as in a
         gymnasium steam room or humidity control for electronic equipment.
     4.2.3. Most paint and protective coatings are hazardous to some degree. All, except
     water-thinned paints, are flammable; many are toxic; and others can irritate the skin. By
     following simple precautions, most paints are quite safe during application. Surface
     preparation also has intrinsic hazards. For example, sandblasting operations generate
     clouds of blasting media, paint, and substrate material. Dry sanding on lead-containing
     paint and on certain types of non-lead-containing paint can generate excessive amounts of
     airborne lead dust. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration controls the
     permissible exposure limit of these airborne particulates and the personal protective
     equipment required. Consult wing safety and bioenvironmental engineering for specific
     information.
  4.3. Design:
     4.3.1. Design, construction, and application of cathodic protection, industrial water
     treatment, and protective coatings are functional requirements for almost all projects.
     Designs shall achieve the minimum life cycle cost for the overall facility. Base personnel
     must be able to operate and maintain the final facility design, including the corrosion
     control systems, without extensive training or equipment investment, unless this is the
     best approach to achieve minimum life cycle cost.
     4.3.2. Corrosion resistance is not the only criterion for material selection. When selecting
     a material, investigate all aspects of its physical properties in the application
     environment, during both normal operation and typical system failure.
     4.3.3. Clearly and distinctly document corrosion experience for future reference. This
     experience should refer to design, material selection, selection of corrosion control
     technique, or decisions of no requirement for corrosion control. Document all design and
     selection decisions in project design analyses. Pass this information to the operations and
     maintenance elements to assist future decisions.
     4.3.4. Revisit the design and selection decisions when a system malfunctions or leaks
     due to corrosion, scaling, or premature failure of the corrosion control system. This is
     especially important for the rare case when a designer justified no corrosion control being
     needed.
     4.3.5. Ensure new or supplemental corrosion control systems are compatible with
     existing systems. The construction contractor shall not select the warranty period
     industrial water treatment.
     4.3.6. Construct pipelines in a manner that facilitates use of in-line inspection tools.
     4.3.7. Cathodic protection and coatings work together. Ensure these items are part of the
     design. Do not design submerged or buried coated metallic facilities without cathodic
     protection and do not design cathodic protection on bare metallic facilities. Recommend
     fiberglass-clad underground storage tanks be installed with galvanic anodes. This
     recommendation is made even though many such tanks are EPA-approved for installation
     without cathodic protection.
10                                          AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010


     4.3.8. Do not use unbonded coatings, such as loose polyethylene wraps. Use of
     unbonded coatings is a direct violation of Department of Transportation regulations and
     Air Force criteria for pipelines.
     4.3.9. Provide both cathodic protection and protective coatings for buried or submerged
     metallic facilities, regardless of soil or water corrosivity, when the facility:
        4.3.9.1. Carries flammable product.
        4.3.9.2. Is mission critical.
        4.3.9.3. Would be expensive to maintain.
        4.3.9.4. Would waste energy or impact the environment if corroded.
        4.3.9.5. Requires corrosion control as identified by major command.
     4.3.10. For other buried utilities, generally provide cathodic protection and protective
     coatings if the soil resistivity is below 10,000 ohm-centimeters. Follow the documented
     recommendations of a qualified corrosion engineer when the soil resistivity is above
     10,000 ohm-centimeters.
     4.3.11. Provide both cathodic protection and protective coatings for the following
     aboveground tanks based upon qualified analysis:
        4.3.11.1. All ferrous tanks in contact with the earth, unless built on an oil-filled sand
        pad with plastic liner underneath.
        4.3.11.2. Interiors of steel water distribution storage tanks.
     4.3.12. Consider the need for lightning and fault current protection at isolating devices
     (dielectrically insulated unions and flanges) when designing cathodic protection systems.
     Consult AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems.
     4.3.13. Installed cathodic protection systems shall provide protective potentials meeting
     criteria in NACE International Standard RP0169, Control of External Corrosion on
     Underground or Submerged Metallic Piping Systems, Section 6, Criteria and Other
     Considerations for Cathodic Protection. Structure-to-soil potentials are to be potential
     drop (current times resistance) free.
     4.3.14. Special conditions sometimes exist where cathodic protection is ineffective or
     only partially effective. Corrosion personnel may deviate from this instruction after
     documenting the achievement of objectives and receiving command corrosion engineer
     approval.
     4.3.15. Industrial water treatment designs or decisions begin with an analysis of the
     system makeup water. Consult bioenvironmental engineering and AFI 48-119, Medical
     Service Environmental Quality Programs, for sampling potable water sources that feed
     industrial systems. Use AF Form 2752A, Environmental Sampling Data, for complete
     analyses to identify the quantity and relationship of water constituents for industrial water
     treatment purposes.
     4.3.16. Acceptance testing of new heating and cooling systems will ensure the industrial
     water treatment system meets design and operation parameters. Boiler steam purity tests
     will determine total dissolved solids limits. Correlate the total dissolved solids level
AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          11


     selected for boiler operation to the conductivity reading of a typical sample. The Water or
     Wastewater Laboratory at associated plants or Base Supply’s Fuels Laboratory usually
     can measure total dissolved solids using American Society For Testing and Materials
     standard methods. Verify the selected condensate treatment meets design parameters by
     testing for copper, iron, and pH at near, medium, and far points from the boiler
     throughout the system.
     4.3.17. Indicate locations to install corrosion coupon racks following American Society
     For Testing and Materials Standard Test Methods for Corrosivity of Water in Absence of
     Heat Transfer (Weight Loss Methods), D26888-92, Test Method B. The coupons are the
     best confirmation of industrial water treatment effectiveness.
     4.3.18. Do not use nonchemical industrial water treatment devices on Air Force systems
     either regularly or on a test evaluation basis except as indicated below. This includes the
     Management and Equipment Evaluation Program.
        4.3.18.1. Basic research and application development of nonchemical industrial
        water treatment devices has been underway since before 1935. However, many
        variables affect performance, and no criteria and standards have been developed
        which may be incorporated into guide specifications or statements of work. Such
        criteria and standards are necessary for standard Air Force contracting methods to
        ensure devices will perform as advertised. Additionally, due to downsizing a n d
        outsourcing, the technical capability to perform installation-specific test evaluations is
        not available at installation level.
        4.3.18.2. Battelle Memorial Institute is researching applications of nonchemical
        industrial water treatment under the Department of Energy’s Federal Energy
        Management Program. Various Energy Services Companies (ESCO) are investigating
        use of these devices for energy and water conservation measures under Energy
        Savings Performance Contracting (ESPC). Under ESPC, the ESCO provides
        guaranteed savings that are validated each year to reconcile payments, using an
        agreed-upon measurement and verification methodology. As the ESCO has the
        responsibility for measuring and verifying performance, problems cited in
        paragraph.4.3.18.1 are overcome. Currently, HQ AFCESA/CESM is developing
        measurement and verification standards to allow nonchemical devices to be available
        for use under ESPC.
     4.3.19. Light reflective floor coatings include chemically resistant urethane for existing
     hangar floors and dry shake metallic floor topping applied to the top layer of freshly
     poured concrete for new floors. Ensure electrostatic discharge and slip resistance are part
     of the design. Include the daily cleaning requirements to cover equipment, supplies, and
     frequency as part of the maintenance instructions provided to the using agency.
     4.3.20. Avoid using chemical strippers. If specified, perform effectiveness tests prior to
     award of any contract. This is especially necessary for removing lead-based paint from
     wood. Also, specify procedures to confirm neutralization of alkaline paint stripper
     through chemical testing. Alkaline residue left on the substrate is a recurring paint failure
     mechanism.
  4.4. Maintenance:
 12                                          AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010


       4.4.1. Perform routine maintenance checks, surveys, and inspections of cathodic
       protection, industrial water treatment, and protective coating systems. Each installation
       must have the basic equipment and training to perform tests and measurements of
       installed corrosion control systems. Consult associated manuals and tables of allowances
       for the minimum required field inspection instruments.
       4.4.2. Investigate when corrosion control actions do not achieve results. This information
       provides the basis for selecting corrective actions and ensuring future projects do not
       continue the same problems.
       4.4.3. Select and apply methods for determining voltage drops during cathodic protection
       testing using sound engineering practices, such as contained in NACE International
       Technical Report 10A190, Measurement Techniques Related to Criteria for Cathodic
       Protection of Underground or Submerged Steel Piping Systems (see attachment 1).
       4.4.4. Cathodic protection situations involving stray currents and stray electrical
       gradients require special analysis. For additional information, see MIL-HDBK 1136,
       Maintenance and Operation of Cathodic Protection Systems, SECTION 7; and NACE
       International Standard RP0169, SECTION 9, Control of Interference Currents.
       4.4.5. Industrial water treatment requires testing at a frequency that ensures the
       prevention of scale, corrosion, and biological formation in the heating and cooling
       systems. The time between testing depends on system integrity and operations. A
       mechanically sound system will require less frequent testing as less chemical leaves the
       system over time.
       4.4.6. Develop and post, in appropriate locations, control charts for each boiler, cooling
       tower, and closed system showing the treatment chemicals used, the amount to add per
       operating parameter, the testing required, the limits to maintain in the system, what to do
       if the chemical levels are above or below the limits, and any other information peculiar to
       the system.
       4.4.7. Perform periodic surveys to ensure effective industrial water treatment.
          4.4.7.1. Annually check the capacity of ion exchangers. Do not rely on a timed
          regeneration cycle.
          4.4.7.2. Once at the start of heating season and once at the end of heating season, test
          the condensate throughout the return system to identify potable water leakage into the
          condensate return system at heat exchangers. This identifies leaks at the earliest
          stages.
          4.4.7.3. When adding or deleting buildings to a steam system or significantly
          changing industrial water treatment chemicals, perform the design acceptance tests
          for the boiler total dissolved solids limit and verify the total protection of the
          condensate return system.
5. Recordkeeping. Corrosion control logs and reports are valuable in any failure analysis when
problems arise. They provide the facts to make decisions. They also provide managers the status
of the systems and the ability to make incremental improvements to achieve the expected life
cycle of facilities, equipment, and piping. The goal is to solve the small problems at the
operational level before they become so large that a major project is the only solution.
AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                        13


  5.1. Cathodic protection recordkeeping, using prescribed forms as explained in MIL-HDBK
  1136, includes the following:
     5.1.1. Initial close interval, anode bed, and annual corrosion surveys of installed
     impressed current and sacrificial systems. Use AF Form 491, Cathodic Protection
     Operating Log for Impressed Current Systems; AF Form 1686, Cathodic Protection
     Operating Log for Sacrificial Anode System; and AF Form 1688, Annual Cathodic
     Protection Performance Survey, to record these tests.
     5.1.2. Impressed current system checks every 60 days. Use AF Form 491 to record these
     checks.
     5.1.3. Initial and annual water tank calibrations of installed systems. Use AF Form 1689,
     Water Tank Calibration, to record these tests.
     5.1.4. Annual update of the Cathodic Protection Annual Performance Booklet, sent to
     major command. For the ANG, booklets will be maintained at the installation and made
     available upon request.
     5.1.4. (AETC) The Cathodic Protection Annual Performance Booklet will be
     maintained in accordance with UFC 3-570-06 Appendix A part 7. An electronic copy of
     any updates will be sent annually to HQ AETC/A7COE by 1 February, to include
     updates to system inventory, manpower changes, and training updates. All testing reports
     and maintenance action requirements will be kept for a minimum of three years.
     5.1.5. Leak investigation using AF Form 1687, Leak/Failure Data Record. Use the
     information captured on AF Forms 1687 to provide justification for system repair or
     replacement, for installation of corrosion control measures, and for the project narrative
     on DD Forms 1391. Consult AFI32-1069, Gas Supply and Distribution; MIL-HDBK
     1164, Operation and Maintenance of Water Supply Systems; and MIL HDBK 1022,
     Petroleum Fuel Facilities, for leak detection and survey requirements on these systems.
  5.2. Industrial water treatment records should reflect the minimum entries needed to
  effectively manage the control of the industrial water treatment program and indicate the
  need for additional testing. A future publication will update treatment, testing and reporting
  procedures previously contained in rescinded AFP 91-41, Industrial Water Treatment
  Procedures (will be replaced by MIL HDBK 1149). The reverse of prescribed forms explains
  their use. Associated recordkeeping includes the following:
     5.2.1. Accomplish industrial water treatment operating logs based upon one log for each
     individually treated system (each boiler, each cooling tower bank, and each closed
     system).
     5.2.2. Use AF Form 1457, Water Treatment Operating Log for Cooling Tower
     Systems, as a minimum.
     5.2.3. Use AF Form 1459, Water Treatment Operating Log for Steam and Hot
     Water Boilers, as a minimum.
     5.2.4. Keep other industrial water system records on modifications of these forms or a
     log developed locally for the specific tests required.
 14                                         AFI32-1054_AETCSUP_I 2 SEPTEMBER 2010


       5.2.5. Keep the maintenance and history of industrial water treatment, other than that
       contained in the logs, in a historical record for each system. This book should contain a
       record (including dates) of occurrences of corrosion and scale, major maintenance and
       surveys performed on the system, replacements of piping and equipment, accidents,
       outages, changes in methods of operation and treatment used, and other pertinent data to
       assist troubleshooting and provide facts for management decisions on process
       improvement.
       5.2.6. Use AF Form 3222, Centrifugal/Reciprocating Operating Log, and AF Form
       3221, Absorption Operating Log, to evaluate the mechanical aspects of the equipment
       and determine the efficiency of the IWT program.
   5.3. Maintain records following MIL HDBK 1110/1, Paints and Protective Coatings.
   Perform evaluations using these records after any paint failure and before any protective
   coatings contract. These records replace undocumented hearsay experience and allow fact-
   based decisions with costs and verified life expectancies of completed work to determine the
   following:
       5.3.1. Effectiveness of a particular paint system on different surfaces or in varying
       environments.
       5.3.2. Comparison of different paint systems under similar conditions.
       5.3.3. Comparison of different equipment for surface preparation or application.
5.3.4. Frequency of spot painting and repainting.
