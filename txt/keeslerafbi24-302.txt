This instruction implements AFPD 24-3, Operation, Maintenance, and Use of Transportation
Vehicles. It establishes policies and procedures for managing the vehicle accident and abuse
program, addressing the following definitions: authority, dispositions, and reporting procedures
for military vehicle accidents and incidents of abuse. This instruction applies to all squadron
commanders, Vehicle Control Officers (VCO), Vehicle Control NCOs (VCNCO), and vehicle
operators assigned, attached or TDY to Keesler AFB, including Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard (ANG) units, except where noted otherwise. Ensure that all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)

organization to make direct payment to a local repair shop or funds transfer for repairs to the 81
LRS/LGRV.
1. Terms Explained.
     1.1. Motor Vehicle Accident: Any collision, impact, or abrasion against a fixed or moving
     object with a Government Owned Vehicle (GOV) which causes damage to either the GOV or
     the object, whether immediately noticeable or not.
     1.2. Vehicle Abuse: An act or omission that has caused or may cause damage that cannot be
     attributed to fair wear and tear under normal use. Vehicle abuse may result in safety hazards,
     early failure of components, or immediately detectable damage. For example, vehicle abuse
     may occur when an individual operator or organization:
        1.2.1. Fails to accomplish maintenance.
        1.2.2. Does not report malfunctions, defects or safety discrepancies affecting vehicle
        condition to vehicle maintenance. Safety items must be reported immediately; non-safety
        items will be reported by the next duty day.
        1.2.3. Overloads the vehicle or fails to tie down or otherwise secure cargo.
        1.2.4. Tampers with governors, speedometers, tachometers or pollution control devices.
        1.2.5. “Riding” or “slipping” the clutch, except when necessary to control while
        maneuvering a vehicle.
        1.2.6. Operating a vehicle in the wrong gear; going too slow in high gear; improper
        shifting, such as shifting into reverse when the vehicle is still moving forward.
        1.2.7. Excessive use of the engine while braking.
        1.2.8. Operates a vehicle with improperly inflated tires or tires with insufficient tread.
        1.2.9. Fails to protect the painted surface from oxidation and corrosion by infrequently
        washing, waxing, and polishing.
        1.2.10. Fails to bring a vehicle or piece of equipment in for scheduled maintenance.
        Fails to monitor and adjust fluid levels or services with incorrect fluids (e.g., diesel
        instead of mogas, 30W oil instead of hydraulic fluid).
        1.2.11. Incurs wind damage by not parking vehicles into the wind “when possible,”
        restraining doors when opening, or leaving doors open while the vehicle is unattended.
        1.2.12. Operates a vehicle in violation of the operator’s manual or accepted driving
        practices.
        1.2.13. Modifying a vehicle without proper authority.
     1.3. Vehicle Incident. When damage to a vehicle cannot be classified as an accident or
     abuse, and is beyond the control of the using organization, it will be categorized as a “vehicle
     incident.” Some examples of vehicle incidents are:
        1.3.1. Damage by vandals.
        1.3.2. Damage by windblown flying objects such as sand, rocks, tree limbs, and other
        materials.
KEESLERAFBI24-302 29 OCTOBER 2012                                                                3


       1.3.3. Damage due to acts of nature such as hurricanes, tornadoes, lightning, and hail.
2. General Policies.
   2.1. Repair of vehicles damaged by preventable accidents or confirmed abuse diverts limited
   resources from direct mission support and wastes government funds. Commanders at every
   level must take appropriate actions to minimize accident occurrences and avoid all vehicle
   abuse. In abuse cases attributed to organizational or personal negligence, the using
   organization or responsible individual will be held financially liable for the cost to repair
   damaged vehicles according to AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for AF Property.
   2.2. The 81 MSG/CC will administer this instruction with assistance from other base
   agencies, including Security Forces, Staff Judge Advocate, Safety, Civilian Personnel,
   Contracting, Comptroller, and organizational financial management personnel.
   2.3. Non-AETC units located on Keesler AFB or TDY units visiting and in need of vehicle
   management support from 81 LRS shall comply with this instruction as an understood
   condition of receipt of vehicle support.
3. Responsibilities. The vehicle operator has the primary responsibility to prevent vehicle
accidents/abuses. Operator should report all damage immediately to the unit’s VCO/VCNCO.
The secondary responsibility rests with the unit VCO/VCNCO, who should inspect unit vehicles
periodically for unreported damage and inspect each vehicle being turned in for damage repairs.
Unreported damage to an Air Force vehicle clearly indicates that the unit operator or
VCO/VCNCO is not inspecting vehicles properly.
   3.1. Unit commanders located within Keesler supported with assigned vehicles will:
       3.1.1. Personally review all vehicle accident and suspected abuse cases involving their
       vehicles.
       3.1.2. Ensure proper guidelines for investigating and processing vehicle accident and
       suspected abuse cases are followed and that timely and comprehensive investigations are
       conducted. (See AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, and AFMAN 23-220, Reports of
       Survey for Air Force Property.)
       3.1.3. Send a letter of release authorizing payment of damages and the release of
       damaged vehicles to be repaired to the Vehicle Management Flight (81 LRS/Vehicle
       Fleet Manager) upon completion of the unit’s investigation.
       3.1.4. Any vehicle damage not attributed to fair wear and tear will be funded by the
       using organization by direct payment or a funds transfer. Any deviation from this policy
       must be approved by the 81 MSG/CC.
       3.1.5. If gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use is
       determined to be the cause of the damage, ensure appropriate steps are taken to recover
       the USAF costs from the individual concerned (see AFMAN 23-220).
   3.2. 81 MSG/CC will:
       3.2.1. Resolve issues regarding organizational failure to provide direct payment or
       reimbursement of suspected accident or abuse cases that cannot be resolved by the 81
       LRS/CC.
 4                                                 KEESLERAFBI24-302 29 OCTOBER 2012


        3.2.2. Request that unit commander of the responsible organization allocate appropriate
        funds to the local repair shop or 81 LRS/LGRV in an amount equal to the cost of the
        repairs to the damaged vehicle.
     3.3. Vehicle Maintenance Management will:
        3.3.1. Determine if a suspected accident or abuse exists and request a unit investigation
        as appropriate. Prepare an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, or
        obtain a copy of the commercial repair invoice, which reflects the actual cost of vehicle
        repairs, for the unit commander of the responsible organization, in all cases being
        processed for monetary payment or reimbursement.
        3.3.2. Ensure documentary photographs are taken of all accidents and suspected abuses.
        3.3.3. Prepare correspondence to using organizations’ commanders advising them of the
        suspected accident/abuse cases, and request an investigation.
        3.3.4. Review all accident/abuse cases for adequacy of investigation and action taken and
        return inadequate case files to the investigating organizations with appropriate comments
        concerning the case.
        3.3.5. Ensure repair work does not begin until a release letter for the damaged vehicle is
        received from the unit commander of the using organization acknowledging the vehicle is
        no longer needed for investigative purposes and indicating payment method.
        3.3.6. Refer cases to 81 LRS/CC if differences cannot be resolved.
        3.3.7. Close cases when all actions have been completed and maintain a historical record
        of all abuse/accident cases for a period of 6 years and 3 months IAW T24-03, R13.00.
        Also, ensure a copy of pertinent work orders are maintained in the vehicle’s record jacket
        for a period of 1 year IAW T24-03, R02.00.
     3.4. The 81st Security Forces Squadron (81 SFS) will investigate vehicle accidents occurring
     on-base and forward reports to the responsible unit VCO/VCNCO and 81 LRS/LGRV. All
     other accident reports provided by outside agencies will be collected by the responsible
     VCO/VCNCO utilizing assistance from 81 SFS.
4. Processing Procedures.
     4.1. When an accident or suspected abuse occurs and the vehicle is operable, the user will
     bring the vehicle to 81 LRS/LGRV. If the vehicle is not operable, the unit VCO/VCNCO
     will contact Vehicle Operations (81 LRS/LGRDD) and request wrecker service:
     4.2. 81 LRS/LGRV Customer Service Center personnel will inspect damage and process a
     vehicle work order requesting initial repair cost estimate.
     4.3. 81 LRS/LGRV Vehicle Management & Analysis will send a letter including digital
     pictures and local contractor estimates for repair through 81 LRS/CC to the commander of
     the using organization requesting the damage be investigated IAW AFMAN 23-220.
     4.4. If the estimate for repair cost exceeds the vehicle’s “one-time repair limit”, the vehicle
     is considered uneconomically repairable and should not be repaired. Exceptions may be
     made to meet mission needs, with HQ AETC/AFRC/AFSPC approval.
KEESLERAFBI24-302 29 OCTOBER 2012                                                              5


   4.5. Prior to repairs, the unit commander of the damaged vehicle will be required to release
   the vehicle for repairs. This must be accomplished by submitting a vehicle release letter to
   the 81 LRS/Vehicle Fleet Management which indicates payment method of the vehicle
   damage and that the vehicle is no longer needed for investigation of the accident or abuse.
   Commanders may initiate a DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss,
   investigation into the circumstances involving an accident or suspected abuse case where
   gross negligence is evident.
   4.6. Vehicle accident and abuse repair costs (material and/or contract costs) will be borne by
   the unit responsible for the damage. Unit responsible may be different than the unit assigned
   (i.e., U-Drive-It fleet is assigned to 81 LRS/LGRDD but used on daily basis by all
   organizations).
      4.6.1. All accident and abuse repairs will be accomplished by contract maintenance
      whenever possible unless the vehicle is considered special purpose and parts are not
      available to local contractors.
      4.6.2. All accident and abuse repairs performed by 81 LRS/LGRV will require a direct
      transfer of funds from the responsible organization to the 81 LRS/LGRV account prior to
      release of vehicle back to user. Funds transfer will be accomplished by a form letter (see
      Attachment 2) to the responsible organization commander for endorsement and then
      forwarded to 81 CPTS/FM for funds transfer. Courtesy copies will be sent to 81 LRS/RA
      and 81 LRS/LGRV.
      4.6.3. If the repairs are performed by contract services, the responsible organization must
      make direct payment to the local repair shop prior to the vehicle being repaired and
      returned back to the user. This direct payment to the local repair shop should be in the
      form of a Government Purchase Card or an AF Form 9 coordinated through Contracting.
   4.7. Owning units are responsible for affecting payment or transfer of funds from other
   organizations. VCO/VCNCO will ensure copies of accident reports are submitted to 81
   TW/JA not later than 1 duty day after an accident with a privately owned vehicle.
   4.8. Due to extended downtime for vehicles undergoing extensive repairs due to accidents
   and abuses, 81 LRS/LGRDD will only be able to provide a U-Drive-It loaner vehicle under
   specific cases, such as falling below Mission Essential Levels.
   4.9. Resolution of disagreements concerning implementation of these policies will follow the
   normal chain of command; squadron commander to squadron commander, then group
   commander to group commander. The 81 MSG/CC is the final decision authority to resolve
   all conflicts concerning the vehicle accident, abuse, and incident program.
5. Exception to Reimbursements. Funds will not require transfer or payment for damage
resulting from an incident as described in paragraph 1.3.
