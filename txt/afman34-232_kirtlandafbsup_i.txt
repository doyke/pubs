3.8. Aircraft Scheduling. Scheduling will be on a first come, first served, basis for daily flying.
Managers shall establish cross-country scheduling and approval procedures, and include those
procedures in the SOP.
   3.8.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Reservations. Aircraft will be reserved on a first-come,
   first-served basis. The computer-scheduling program, FlightSchedulePro.com will be used to
   schedule all flights. Members may place themselves on a standby list in case of
   cancellations. Local area flights cannot be reserved more than 60 days in advance. If there
   are conflicts in the scheduling of an aircraft and cannot be resolved, contact the flight center
   manager or chief flight instructor.
   3.8.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Cancellations. The member should cancel scheduled
   flights no later than 24 hours before the scheduled takeoff time. It is the student’s
   responsibility to notify his/her flight instructor of any changes or cancellations. When
   airplane reservations are cancelled due to maintenance, the flight center staff will attempt to
   notify the individuals affected or attempt to find an equivalent airplane for the same time
   block. Failure to use the airplane, as scheduled, because of an unexcused “no show” will
   result in the member being charged 75 percent of the expected aircraft and instructor fees.
   Any aircraft scheduled for a local flight, and not claimed within 20 minutes of the scheduled
   period, will be made available for use for the remainder of the period.
   3.8.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Schedule for Checkout. Any member may schedule an

   flight that departs the local area. The local area consists of a 50 nautical mile radius that is
   centered on the ABQ International Sunport. Extensions to the local area include Socorro and
   Grants, NM. See Figure 3.3 (Added). Cross country flights are not authorized unless a
   cross country request is submitted and approved by the chief flight instructor; or, in the case
   of same-day “out-and-back” requests, the CA or an instructor.
       3.8.5.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Members will submit a local cross country request
       for all cross country flights, including training flights and out-and-backs. Members shall
       schedule the aircraft using Flight Schedule Pro.
       3.8.5.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Cross country requests will not be approved unless
       the pilot is checked out and current in the scheduled aircraft. However, this will not
       prohibit the pilot from reserving an aircraft if the member can be reasonably expected to
       gain currency prior to the day of the flight.
       3.8.5.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Maximum duration of any cross country will be 15
       days, unless other arrangements are made with the manager. The manager shall be

  before removing the fuel filler cap or while inserting the ground cable jack on the fuel
  nozzle.
  3.16.3. No active ignition sources are permitted within 50 feet of an aircraft being refueled.
  No preflight involving energized electrical systems, engine starts, or maintenance of aircraft
  parked within 50 feet of the refueling operation is permitted.
  3.16.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Procedures at KAFB Aero Club. All flight center
  pilots will receive refueling training during their initial checkout by a flight center instructor,
  to include fire extinguisher use and the location of the emergency fuel cut-off valve. Safety
  goggles are available for use and are kept in the oil locker.
     3.16.4.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Each pilot is responsible for refueling, cleaning
     windscreens, and adding oil (if required) after each flight.
     3.16.4.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Enter the refueling loop, from the south, so the
     pumps are on the pilot’s left side. Put the nose wheel on the yellow line in front of the
     pumps—this will ensure adequate wing tip clearance for all flight center aircraft. Avoid
     the gravel/soft asphalt areas north and south of the tanks.
     3.16.4.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) When the air tankers are parked at the south end
     of their servicing manifolds, it may be impossible to exit the north side of the refueling
     loop. In that case, back and turn the aircraft away from the pumps with the tow bar and
     exit the loop on the south side.
     3.16.4.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Damage can occur to the filler neck of the aircraft
     if excessive force is applied to it by the nozzle. Do not allow the weight of the hose and
     nozzle to bear on the filler neck opening. Never leave the nozzle in the opening if you
     forget to turn on the pump and return to the pump controls. To prevent contamination
     and damage, do not allow the pump nozzle to drag on the ground.
     3.16.4.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) The requirement to refuel after each flight may be
     waived by the chief flight instructor for local flights under specified conditions. Make an
     entry in the maintenance record if the aircraft was not refueled and note the reason.
     Include in the entry the amount of time flown, so the next person may ascertain whether
     the aircraft needs to be refueled prior to their flight.
  3.16.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Fuel Spills. In the event of a fuel spill at the fuel
  pumps, take whatever action appropriate to stop the flow of fuel. Normally turning off the
  pump with the key should work. Use the emergency cut-off if necessary. Then notify flight
  center management/maintenance, the KAFB Fire Department, 911 or (853-9111 from a cell
  phone), and KAFB Environmental Management, 846-2751. Should a fuel spill occur causing
  puddles of fuel, under or around an aircraft, do not attempt to start the engine. The aircraft
  will be towed clear using the tow bar. The fire department must be called to dispose of the
  spilled fuel. There is a phone located northeast of the fuel tanks on the light pole.

   3.16.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Refueling During Inclement Weather. Do not refuel
   aircraft when surface wind speed, including gusts, exceeds 25 knots. Do not refuel during
   sandstorms, in heavy rain, or if lightning is observed within five miles of the airport.
3.17. Flight Restrictions. The following restrictions and requirements apply to all members
operating club aircraft as pilot-in-command.
   3.17.1. Weather Minimums.
       3.17.1.1. Day VFR minimums are 1,500-foot ceiling and 3 statute miles visibility.

       compatible circling minimums, both ceiling and visibility, at the departure airport or the
       takeoff minimums listed in the Terminal Flight Information Publication for the airport,
       whichever are greater. (NOTE: Pilots with over 100 hours actual instrument time logged
       as PIC may takeoff when the weather is at or above the lowest compatible approach
       minimums at the departure airport or the takeoff minimums listed in the Terminal Flight
       Information Publication for the airport, whichever are greater.)
       3.17.1.4. Pilots shall comply with maximum crosswind components for each pilot rating
       and make and model aircraft posted in the aircraft checklist.
       3.17.1.5. Flight will not be initiated if surface winds are forecast to be greater than 30
       knots, and flights will be terminated as soon as practicable if surface winds exceed 30
       knots.
       3.17.1.6. Flight under special VFR, as defined in 14 CFR Part 91, is limited to pilots
       with a current instrument rating, in an aircraft certified for instrument flight, and only at
       an altitude that assures terrain and obstacle clearance established in paragraph 3.17.7 of
       this manual.
       3.17.1.7. Simulated emergency training is limited to Visual Meteorological Conditions
       (VMC).
       3.17.1.8. Managers shall establish minimum Runway Condition Reading (RCR) criteria
       for aircraft, to include maintenance ground run operations.
       3.17.1.8. (KIRTLANDAFB) Runway Condition Reading (RCR). This is a term air
       traffic control (ATC) uses to describe braking action reports to AF and ANG aircraft. It
       is useful in determining aircraft controllability when the surface has deteriorated due to
       rain, snow, sleet, or icy conditions. Ensure RCR is known.
          3.17.1.8.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Do Not Land. Pilots of flight center aircraft
          will not land at airports where braking action is reported as not existent “None, Not
          existent (NIL)”. If at all possible pilots of flight center aircraft will divert to another
          airport if braking action is reported as “Poor”.
          3.17.1.8.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) No Taxi, No Run Ups.                            Pilots and
          mechanics will not taxi or perform run-ups on untreated snow or ice. If the area has
          been cleared or sanded, the pilot or mechanic may proceed; however, if the aircraft
          brakes fail to hold the aircraft in position, the operation will be terminated.

     instructor onboard is qualified to act as PIC under instrument conditions in the aircraft
     used for the flight.
     3.17.2.8. Local VFR night flight, unless the pilot has logged at least 50 hours as PIC and
     maintains visual contact with an airport approved for night operations, or is a current and
     qualified instrument rated pilot.
     3.17.2.9. Simulated night instrument practice in the local area unless a second pilot, with
     night currency in the aircraft being flown, is onboard as a safety observer and has access
     to the flight controls.
  3.17.3. Passengers.
     3.17.3.1. The PIC shall not allow any passengers to be carried onboard the aircraft unless
     they have completed an AF Form 1585. (NOTE: Executed forms shall not be carried
     onboard the aircraft, and the form must be re-executed at least every 12 months.)
     3.17.3.2. A parent or legal guardian shall execute the document on behalf of any person

     Transportation approved infant/child seat restrained by an individual seat belt.
  3.17.4. Duty Day Restrictions.
     3.17.4.1. Maximum aero club duty day is 12 hours for a single pilot or 16 hours for two
     qualified pilots in an aircraft with dual flight controls.
     3.17.4.2. Flight duty day begins when the pilot(s) reports to the aero club for the first
     flight, or to the duty location (place of employment) for the first duty (work) of the day,
     which ever occurs first.
     3.17.4.3. Minimum crew rest between duty days is 10 hours after 8 hours or less of duty

     under the control of ABQ Approach. Momentary stops at Double Eagle II or Belen
     Alexander for pattern work is considered under ABQ Approach Control. If a flight plan
     cannot be filed before takeoff, one will be filed by radio as soon as feasible after
     departure. All flight plans filed for outside the local area must be activated.
     3.17.5.2. Before filing to a military field, contact the destination base operations and aero
     club (if applicable) to ensure they can accept the aircraft, and obtain a Prior Permission
     Required (PPR) number, if required. (NOTE: Enter the statement "USAF Aero Club
     aircraft, please advise _____ Base Operations" in the remarks section of the flight plan.)
     3.17.5.3. When departing a military base from other than home station, the pilot shall file
     a flight plan with the local base operations.
  3.17.6. Approved Airports/Runways/Taxi Procedures.
     3.17.6.1. Pilots shall not perform straight-in VFR approaches to non-towered airports.
     (NOTE: This does not apply to practice instrument approaches being flown under radar
     control when the safety pilot is able to simultaneously monitor approach control and the
     Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) and make appropriate position calls on the
     CTAF.)
     3.17.6.2. Pilots shall self-announce pattern position on downwind, base, and final leg
     using the phraseology recommended in theAeronautical Information Manual (AIM).
     3.17.6.3. Pilots shall only land at active airports listed in FAA or DOD flight information
     publications, or those designated by the installation commander. (NOTE: If an
     emergency or precautionary landing is made at an unauthorized location, the pilot shall
     not takeoff without the club manager’s approval.)
     3.17.6.4. Pilots shall not takeoff or land on runways less than 2,000 feet long, or the sum
     of the aircraft takeoff and landing ground roll, whichever is greater.

AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 29


     3.17.6.6. When approaching a non-towered airfield with unknown runway surface or
     approach conditions, pilots shall make a low approach to the landing runway to determine
     surface conditions before making an approach to landing. (NOTE: Not applicable to
     actual instrument approaches.)
     3.17.6.7. Pilots shall not accomplish takeoff or landing rolls across raised arresting
     cables and must use minimum speed if the aircraft must taxi over arresting cables.
     3.17.6.8. Pilots shall not taxi within 10 feet of an obstacle unless wing walkers or
     designated taxi lines, suitable for the make and model aircraft being operated, are used.
     3.17.6.9. Unless a higher taxi speed is required to prevent delay of traffic flow, pilots
     shall not exceed a slow walk while taxiing in congested areas, or a brisk walk in all other
     areas.
     3.17.6.10. Pilots shall not perform touch and go landings in complex aircraft.
     3.17.6.11. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Taxi Procedures. Flight center aircraft will
     follow designated taxi routes and will not use designated vehicle roadways for taxiing.
     Do not cross double yellow lines along taxi routes. The only exception to this is to enter
     the parking ramp. Taxiing between the double yellow line and parked aircraft is not
     allowed, except to enter a row for parking the aircraft. Taxiing an aircraft from one side
     of the base operations hangar to the other will be accomplished using Taxiway B and
     maintaining radio contact with ground control.
        3.17.6.11.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight center aircraft will not be taxied
        closer than 500 feet behind a large aircraft whose engines are running. Flight center
        aircraft will not be stopped for engine run-up, or other purposes, in a position such
        that jet or propeller blast from passing large aircraft will be directed at flight center
        aircraft from a distance of less than 500 feet. When a large aircraft is taxiing from the
        opposite direction, move your aircraft well off to the side of the taxiway to avoid
        possible intense propeller or jet engine blast.
        3.17.6.11.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight center aircraft will not be taxied or
        parked closer than 300 feet from a hovering helicopter, or a helicopter on the ground
        with its rotor blades in motion.
        3.17.6.11.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight center aircraft will not be taxied
        within 50 feet of any aircraft that is being refueled.
        3.17.6.11.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight center aircraft will not be taxied
        within 50 feet of the hangar. Aircraft engines will not be operated east of the base
        operations hangar between the hangar and the vehicular roadway.
     3.17.6.12. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Restricted Area.                 A restricted ramp area
     (Figure 3.2. Taxi & No Go Areas) is located east of the hangar and identified by a
     painted red line. Designated entry control points are marked with white paint and are for
     official use only. NOTE: Pilots must notify the Site Security Control Center (SSCC) by
     phone (846-1478 or 846-1323) prior to crossing the red line, give tail number and
     estimated time of crossing. Pilots may taxi an aircraft through the area during the course
     of normal operations but may not enter the area on foot without a restricted area badge.
30                           AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


     Engine run-up may be performed in the restricted area, but if the pilot rejects the aircraft
     he or she must taxi clear of it prior to shut down and egress.

     3.17.11.3. Solo student pilots shall not perform touch-and-go landings.
     3.17.11.4. Student pilots shall not fly more than 10 hours solo or exceed 30 days without
     a dual proficiency flight. This flight will include all items listed in 14 CFR Part 61.87 (d)
     and (e).
     3.17.11.5. Student pilots shall not fly solo at night.
32                          AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


     3.17.11.6. Solo student pilots shall not conduct simulated emergency procedures, to
     include simulated forced landings.
     3.17.11.7. The chief flight instructor shall develop standard training cross-country routes
     for student pilots. Only the chief flight instructor may authorize the use of other routes.
        3.17.11.7.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Cross Country Routes. As defined in
        para 3.8.5 (Added), the routes identified in Figure 3.3 (Added) are approved and
        may be flown. They also may be flown in reverse direction when desired. Routes not
        established in this supplement may not be used, unless the chief flight instructor
        approves them. Remain Over Night (RON) is not permitted, except when due to
        weather or mechanical failure. Student pilots will fill out cross country requests for
        all cross country training, since they will leave the “local area” during the flight.
        Only these routes are allowed – (unless approved by the Chief Flight Instructor):

     airports approved by the chief flight instructor.
     3.17.11.10. Unless restricted by local area procedures, solo student pilots will use the
     student pilot radio identification procedure as specified in the Aeronautical Information
     Manual.
     3.17.11.11. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Student Pilots who enroll in a flight center
     training course will conform to established rules and policies governing flying operations.
     These are covered in the course curriculum, flight center instructions, AFIs and
34                           AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


     AFMANs, CFRs, and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Students will be un-
     enrolled from training for any of the following reasons:
        3.17.11.11.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Chronic, unexcused absences.
        3.17.11.11.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Operating aircraft in an unsafe or reckless
        manner.
        3.17.11.11.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Falsifying flight records or training
        documents.
        3.17.11.11.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Carrying passengers as a student pilot.
        3.17.11.11.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Substandard performance if, in the
        opinion of the instructor and the chief flight instructor, further training is
        unwarranted.
     3.17.11.12. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Deviation of Plans. It is occasionally
     necessary for student pilots to land at other than their planned destination, or to remain at
     an airport until weather conditions improve. When this situation arises, the student pilot
     will call the KAFB Flight Center or his/her instructor for approval to depart and return to
     ABQ International Sunport Airport. Phone calls for this purpose to the flight center
     should be made on the (505) 242-4184 number and can be made as a collect call. In the
     event the flight center is closed, the pilot shall call their instructor, the chief flight
     instructor or the manager.
     3.17.11.13. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Student pilots, who have not been cleared for
     solo flight, will not taxi aircraft without the instructor in the cockpit.
     3.17.11.14. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Instructors will cover fire extinguisher use with
     their student pilots relative to fire extinguishers placed in each row of parked aircraft.
     3.17.11.15. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Student pilots will identify each and every solo
     maneuver practiced during the solo flight in their grade folders. A “checkmark” will be
     used to mark the block for each item practiced on that flight.
     3.17.11.16. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) All entries in the student training folder will be
     made in ink.
  3.17.12. Fuel Reserves.
     3.17.12.1. Pilots shall not begin a flight unless there is sufficient fuel to complete the
     flight to the point of intended landing, fly from that airport to an alternate (if an alternate
     is required), and then fly after that for at least 1 hour at normal cruise consumption.
     3.17.12.2. If a flight extends to a point where less than 1 hour of fuel remains, the PIC
     will land at the nearest suitable airport to obtain additional fuel.
     3.17.12.3. For flight planning purposes the PIC shall calculate fuel consumption using
     the aircraft or engine manufacturer’s data, whichever is greater.
     3.17.12.3. (KIRTLANDAFB) To prevent fuel management shortfalls, the following
     observations regarding fuel management will be observed by all Flight Center pilots.
AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                35


         3.17.12.3.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Fuel consumption in the Pilot Operating
         Handbook (POH) may vary significantly from that published by the engine
         manufacturer.
         3.17.12.3.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Improper leaning techniques can greatly
         increase consumption.
         3.17.12.3.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Any attitude, other than level, positive G
         flight can cause fuel interruption in gravity - fed fuel systems.
         3.17.12.3.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Range data published by the manufacturer
         is very optimistic.
         3.17.12.3.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Know your departure fuel.
         3.17.12.3.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Account for all phases of flight and use
         pessimistic fuel consumption rates.
         3.17.12.3.7. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Know and use proper leaning techniques.
         3.17.12.3.8. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Prolonged slips, skids, or turbulence can
         easily uncover a fuel port when there is minimum fuel in tanks.
         3.17.12.3.9. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Know your fuel consumption and how long
         you have been airborne.
     3.17.12.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Baron Aircraft. The fuel level in the auxiliary
     fuel tanks should be maintained at or above 5 gallons to prevent the fuel cells from
     deteriorating and should be full for flights outside the local training area.
  3.17.13. Other Restrictions.
     3.17.13.1. Pilots shall not use club aircraft for towing gliders or sail planes.
     3.17.13.2. Pilots shall not use club aircraft for parachuting or skydiving.
     3.17.13.3. Club members shall not use club aircraft for commercial purposes.
     3.17.13.4. For all flights, pilots shall compute takeoff and landing performance for each
     airport of intended use based on actual or forecast conditions. In addition, pilots will
     check actual aircraft takeoff performance against computed data, and abort the takeoff if
     aircraft performance is inadequate.
     3.17.13.5. Pilots shall calculate weight and balance data for each flight.
     3.17.13.6. Pilots shall not takeoff with snow or frost on the aircraft.
     3.17.13.7. Pilots shall not hand prop aero club aircraft certified to operate with an
     electrically driven starter.
     3.17.13.7. (KIRTLANDAFB) All KAFB Aero Club aircrafts have electrically driven
     starters.
         3.17.13.7.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) All starts will use the built-in starter. If
         necessary the external battery may be used if a second person is available and familiar
         with using the battery and cable system. That individual will connect external cables
 36                           AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


           while the pilot remains in the aircraft. Never leave the aircraft running if the pilot
           cannot occupy the pilot seat for any reason.
           3.17.13.7.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aircraft engines will not be operated east
           of the hangar unless the aircraft is east of the vehicle road marked on the ramp by
           double solid yellow lines. Engine operation between the hangar and the road is
           considered hazardous and will be reported as a safety violation.
       3.17.13.8. Pilots will not taxi an aero club aircraft until each person onboard has properly
       fastened their seat belt.
       3.17.13.9. Pilots will comply with established bird condition procedures.
       3.17.13.10. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aerobatics, including spins, are prohibited
       except for maneuvers required by the flight instructor-training course.
       3.17.13.11. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Weather Limitations. No flight will be made
       into areas of known or forecast icing conditions, severe weather areas, or where wind is
       forecast over 25 knots. The calculation for wind speed is steady-state plus one-half the
       gust factor.
       3.17.13.12. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) The T-41C is limited to 105 miles per hour
       (mph) indicated air speed (IAS) for cruise climb and will not be operated in cruise flight
       at power settings above 2600 revolutions per minute (rpm), to prevent engine over speed.
3.18. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Cross Country Procedures. Scheduling is addressed in
Paragraph 3.8.5. An instructor or clearing authority may approve last minute changes to cross
countries or “pop-up” after assuring that there will not be any scheduling conflicts, the airports
are legal to fly to and all regulation will be adhered to.
   3.18.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Prior to departure on a cross country flight, the pilot
   will become familiar with all factors that affect the flight.
       3.18.1.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Current and appropriate aeronautical charts
       covering the entire route of flight will be carried on the flight.
       3.18.1.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Weather data, appropriate to the flight, will be
       obtained within 2 hours prior to take off.
       3.18.1.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Clearance Procedure. The Pilot In Command
       (PIC) will compute the number of hours remaining until the next scheduled 100-hour
       inspection to ensure that no airworthiness directives (AD)s or 100 hour inspections are
       over flown.
   3.18.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Navigation and Survival Kits. Both navigation and
   survival kits are available for use on cross country flights (survival kit is required). Contents
   of the survival kit are displayed on the container.
       3.18.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Navigation kits are required for instrument flight
       rule (IFR) flights and optional for VFR. A pilot who wishes to use a navigation kit will
       sign for the entire kit and remove it from the cabinet. They must take all required
       publications; no incomplete kits shall be left in the cabinet. The pilot may leave any
       unnecessary publications behind in his car during the flight, but kits in the cabinet are
       considered complete. The pilot will check the contents of the navigation kit to ensure
AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   37


     that the charts, approach books, etc. are current. The chief flight instructor may issue
     individual publications to members on a first-come, first- serve basis.
     3.18.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Survival kits are not to be opened, except in an
     emergency. Upon return from a cross country flight, the member will ensure navigation
     kits are complete and secure. If a survival kit seal has been broken, notify a flight center
     official; do not return the kit to the shelf for reuse.
  3.18.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Late Return. If an aircraft cannot be returned on
  schedule, the pilot will notify the flight center as soon as possible. If a member leaves an
  aircraft at another location, for any reason other than mechanical failure, they are responsible
  to pay all tie-down, hangar, storage, or other fees incurred, and to return the aircraft within a
  reasonable time. If the member is unable to personally return the aircraft, the flight center
  will take whatever action is required to return it. In this event, the member who left the
  aircraft is responsible for all expenses incurred in returning it. The flight center will keep
  these expenses to a minimum. The flight center is not responsible for additional member
  expenses incurred because of aircraft mechanical failure. Members planning extended cross
  country flights, who have deadlines to be back in the ABQ area, should consider these rules
  carefully before deciding to use a flight center aircraft for travel.
  3.18.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Accidents or Incidents. Report IAW Chapter 5. The
  aircraft checklist contains instructions and phone numbers for contacting the flight center. In
  the event of a landing off of a hard surface runway, pilots will not attempt to takeoff. If an
  unplanned hard landing occurs away from KAFB, contact the flight center for takeoff
  approval.
  3.18.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Maintenance. A qualified FAA-certified mechanic
  must return damaged or malfunctioning aircraft to service.
     3.18.5.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Members will not contract for, nor obligate the
     flight center for maintenance services without obtaining prior specific approval from the
     flight center manager. In such cases, the manager will coordinate with the Fixed Base
     Operator (FBO) on repairs and attempt to make arrangements for payment.
     3.18.5.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) The flight center manager must approve repairs in
     order for the member to be reimbursed for maintenance expenses incurred away from the
     home field. In the event that the FBO demands cash for repairs, the pilot should make
     the payment and return the invoice to the flight center for reimbursement.
  3.18.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Deviations. Significant deviations from original flight
  plan and cross country request will be reported to the flight center or one of the telephone
  contacts listed in the aircraft checklist. Specifically, the flight center should be aware of any
  RON at other than scheduled locations.
  3.18.7. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) RON Actions. The pilot will ensure the aircraft is
  securely locked, chocked fore and aft of each main landing gear, static grounding cable
  attached properly (if available), tied down, control locks and pitot covers installed (if
  applicable), and that the aircraft is serviced.
     3.18.7.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) The pilot will pay all fees in connection with the
     RON.
 38                           AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


      3.18.7.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) If possible, let airport personnel know where you
      can be contacted.
   3.18.8. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Fuel and Oil Purchases. The flight center reimburses
   members for fuel and oil purchases, for cross country flights, based on a fixed rate posted in
   the flight center. A copy of the fuel receipt must be submitted as proof of purchase. The
   member is responsible for excess costs. Oxygen is not a reimbursable item.
3.19. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Lost Communication Procedures.
   3.19.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Within 50 Nautical Miles. If in the air and within 50
   miles of ABQ, and you have not contacted ABQ approach, land at an approved non-towered
   airport and inform the flight center of your whereabouts (status and location).
   3.19.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Outside 50 Nautical Miles. If not within 50 miles,
   land at the most appropriate public-use, hard surface, non-towered airport and inform the
   flight center of your status and location.
   3.19.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) If you have contacted ABQ approach, continue
   according to your last instructions. If you have not been cleared to land and are entering the
   traffic area:
      3.19.3.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) From the North, circle above the intersection of
      Interstate 25 (I-25) and Interstate 40 (I-40), until you receive a light signal from the
      tower. Then continue in accordance with light signal instructions.
      3.19.3.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) From the South, circle above Isleta Pueblo, until
      you receive a light signal from the tower; then continue IAW light signal instructions.
      3.19.3.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Consider the option of landing at Double Eagle II
      airport, in lieu of returning to ABQ. This will create some inconvenience; however, it
      may be safer for all aircraft during the peak period.
3.20. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Mid-Air Collision Avoidance.
   3.20.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) There are low altitude tracks for C-130s refueling
   helicopters to the southwest of ABQ. Watch for and remain clear of in-flight refueling
   operations. You may check Notice to Airmen, (NOTAM) prior to flight.
   3.20.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) ABQ Approach/Departure Control vectors numerous
   aircraft over the northwest practice area. Watch for inbound or outbound traffic to ABQ
   International Sunport Airport, particularly when operating above 8,500 feet means sea level
   (MSL).
   3.20.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) When operating south of ABQ International Sunport
   Airport at low level, watch for helicopters transitioning to their practice field approximately
   12 miles south of the airport.
   3.20.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) There is an aerobatics box in the local training area. It
   is located at the ABQ 345 radial, 12 Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), ½ nm radius,
   surface to 9,500 feet. Flight Service or Approach/Departure Control may advise when the
   box is in use; however, other pilots frequently use it without providing notification. Exercise
   caution near this area.
AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                    39


   3.20.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Bird Hazards. Rio Grande Valley is a main migratory
   route. Pay attention to the Bird Hazard Board posted by the key box in the club. Also be
   alert when flying over bodies of water. Animals on the taxiways/ramp at KAFB are not
   uncommon and create a real FOD problem. Report any bird strikes utilizing the AF Form
   853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report, which are posted on the Flight Center wall by the
   bulletin board.
3.21. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Parking. Each member is responsible for the security of the
aircraft after the flight. Parking will normally be in the flight center parking spots, west of the
hangar. Pilots may leave aircraft parked near the fuel pumps between flights only if a face-to-
face or telephone exchange is made with the oncoming pilot. Aircraft will be chocked and
secured per the checklist. NOTE: Aircraft must be towed onto the paved taxiway before engine
start to avoid propeller damage.
   3.21.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aircraft parked on the ramp must have all 3 tie-downs
   (tail, each wing) installed; grounding wire attached, and have both main wheels chocked fore
   and aft.
   3.21.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aircraft parked in the hanger must have the nose wheel
   chocked and a ground wire attached to the aircraft.
3.22. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Diversion. Pilots on local area flights who divert to an
airport, other than ABQ, for weather or other reasons (with the exception of a bona fide
emergency) will be responsible for returning the airplane to the flight center, as soon as possible.
If the member is unable or unwilling to do this, they will be charged for the costs of returning the
airplane. Every effort will be made to keep these costs to a minimum.
3.23. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Extreme Weather Procedures.
   3.23.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Cold Weather Operations. The two biggest problems
   with cold weather are frost and engine starting difficulties. This section describes procedures
   to be used as a guide in minimizing delays and costly replacement of batteries.
       3.23.1.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Frost, Snow and Ice. Do not, under any
       circumstances, attempt to takeoff with any frost, snow or ice on the wing or tail surfaces.
       3.23.1.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Frost                 Removal. When          below-freezing
       temperatures are forecast, the flight center will try to have aircraft parked in a hangar
       when scheduled before 0900 hours. In the event your aircraft has frost accumulation, taxi
       or tow the aircraft to the hangar. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to defrost in the
       hangar. If you need to remove frost from the aircraft surfaces, the following procedures
       apply:
           3.23.1.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) If available, request maintenance personnel
           to apply heat or de-icing fluid to the frosted surfaces.
           3.23.1.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Do not use scrapers, credit cards, or any
           other such device on windshields or side windows. Heat or de-icing fluids are the
           only approved methods of removing frost from clear plastic surfaces.
           3.23.1.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Brushes for sweeping frost from wing and
           tail surfaces are located along each row of aircraft.
40                           AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


         3.23.1.2.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Orient the aircraft to take advantage of the
         sun for melting frost.
  3.23.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Engine Start Procedure. Cold weather takes a heavy
  toll on aircraft batteries each winter. The following procedures have been successful in the
  past; however, preheating is always the best option.
     3.23.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Proceed with engine starting as outlined in the
     checklist. Use the primer as needed, but not in excess. Wet plugs do not start in cold
     weather.
     3.23.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) If the aircraft starter will not turn the engine,
     contact maintenance for starting assistance. If all attempts fail, bring the battery or the
     aircraft into the hangar. Dead batteries will freeze and cannot be recharged.
  3.23.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hot Weather Operations. The greatest problem with
  hot weather operation is reduced aircraft performance and engine overheating.
     3.23.3.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Take-off and climb performance requirements
     may exceed published data for the aircraft. Pilots may use a performance computer or the
     Koch chart to evaluate aircraft performance. Take-off will not be attempted unless
     aircraft performance is verified as adequate for conditions and terrain. The pilot must
     carefully consider waiting until conditions improve and consider the benefits of reduced
     aircraft loading. Density altitude will be computed for all flights.
     3.23.3.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Constantly check oil temperature. When the oil
     temperature approaches the red line the aircraft should be maneuvered into cruise flight
     until the temperature is reduced. If this is unsuccessful, land at nearest suitable field until
     a cooler time of the day. The following corrective actions may also be useful:
         3.23.3.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Slow speed/high power operations should be
         limited/avoided.
         3.23.3.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Climb at higher than normal airspeed
         (enroute climb vs. Vy).
         3.23.3.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Slightly enrich the mixture.
         3.23.3.2.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Operate at reduced power for cruise.
         3.23.3.2.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Leave cowl flaps open after level off (if so
         equipped) and monitor cylinder head temperatures.
  3.23.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Severe Weather Operations. This section establishes
  procedures for the termination of flight center flying; and the recall, or diversion of airborne
  aircraft during periods of forecasted, or reported severe weather conditions. Normally, local
  flights in flight center aircraft are conducted in VFR, low-wind conditions. When weather
  conditions pose a hazard, the manager, chief flight instructor, or CA will take appropriate
  action.
     3.23.4.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Local area conditions considered to pose a hazard
     include the following:
AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   41


        3.23.4.1.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Winds above 25 knots (including ½ the gust
        factor), or gusts exceeding 30 knots.
        3.23.4.1.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Lightning thunderstorms, within 5 miles of
        ABQ International Sunport Airport, predicted to pass within 2 miles of the airport.
        3.23.4.1.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hail or tornadoes.
     3.23.4.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hangar of Aircraft. Members, employees, and
     instructors will hangar as many aircraft, as possible, when threatening weather exists.
     3.23.4.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Recommended                    actions     for    supervisory
     personnel:
        3.23.4.3.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Terminate further flying by flight center
        aircraft.   Announce the decision in the flight center and request ABQ
        Tower/Approach Control informs departing/airborne aircraft.
        3.23.4.3.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Recall all or certain airborne aircraft, if the
        weather forecast gives sufficient warning to recover aircraft before weather hazards
        develop.
        3.23.4.3.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Inform airborne aircraft of the weather
        situation and divert them to suitable alternate, or have them remain clear of the
        hazardous weather until it dissipates.
        3.23.4.3.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Avoid the trap of issuing a recall after the
        weather has already deteriorated, since this ensures that the aircraft will face
        hazardous conditions on recovery. Recall requires time and should be used when
        timely forecasts provide the necessary time to recover before the hazard develops.
  3.23.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Recall/Divert Checklist. The following actions will be
  taken, should it become necessary to recall or divert aircraft:
     3.23.5.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Evaluate weather and decide which pilot
     categories are affected and whether to recall or divert specified aircraft or all aircraft. If
     recall/divert is needed, use the radio of an aircraft on the ramp, or a portable radio, and
     broadcast on 121.5, Guard frequency.
     3.23.5.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Use the following contact information for
     assistance in relaying instructions to airborne aircraft:
        3.23.5.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight Service Station, 1-800-WXBRIEF.
        3.23.5.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) ABQ Tower, 856-4904.
        3.23.5.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) ABQ Approach, 856-4903.

      3.23.5.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Secure Flight Line Aircraft. Check aircraft for
      proper tie-down and installation of control locks. Provide wing walkers, if required for
      taxiing aircraft. Aircraft will not be taxied/towed when winds exceed 40 knots.
      3.23.5.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Responsibilities of Individual Personnel. The
      manager, or chief flight instructor, will be responsible to implement these actions, if they
      are present. In their absence, the clearing authority is the responsible individual; but
      flight instructors should volunteer advice and assistance, and should accept the direct
      responsibility for flights by their students. In all cases, flight center employees, flight
      instructors, and flight center members should volunteer their services to assist
      supervisory personnel to implement these instructions.
   3.23.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Evacuation/Diversion Procedures. In the event of
   severe weather as described above, flight center aircraft will normally be hangared. If hangar
   space is not available, the flight center manager, chief flight instructor, or other flight center
   official will direct evacuation of aircraft. If time permits the aircraft will be directed to a
   location where the threat of damage is reduced. Natural phenomena/disasters that could
   justify evacuation are tropical depressions, floods, tornadoes, toxic spills/leaks, etc. Timely
   warning is essential and is unlikely to be available for some of these phenomena.
3.24. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Other Flight Center Procedures. This section includes
other operational procedures that have been incorporated from PIF items.
   3.24.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Ground Handling of Aircraft. Do not use the
   horizontal tail to lift the nose gear during parking/towing/repositioning of any Cessna
   aircraft. This can cause severe damage, including a cracked spar.
   3.24.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Risk Management. For risk management purposes the
   PIC will use the “I’M SAFE” Personal Checklist from the acronym published in the
   Aeronautical Information Manual along with the Flight Training Center Systems (F.T.C.S.)
   Dispatch Checklist
      3.24.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) I = Illness
      3.24.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) M = Medical
      3.24.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) S = Stress
      3.24.2.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) A = Alcohol
      3.24.2.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) F = Fatigue
      3.24.2.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) E = Emotion
   3.24.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Fire Tanker Operations. During the summer months
   Fire Tanker operations require additional precautions near the refueling area (see paragraph
   3.16.4.2.2.). When the tankers are flying missions, they pull into position, reload with fire
   retardant, and depart almost immediately. Ground crews are present during these operations.
   Don’t taxi behind the tankers while their engines are running, or stop and shutdown in a
   location where a tanker’s prop blast could strike your aircraft. Potentially damaging prop
   blast exists several hundred feet behind these aircraft.

   3.24.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) T-41 Engine Clearing. IAW FAA-H-8083-3A
   Airplane Flying Handbook located in the pilots reference material library in the main Flight
   Center office area.
   3.24.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Weather Briefings. A thorough pre-flight weather
   briefing will be obtained from flight service or FAA-approved computer weather services
   prior to departure. Pilots will obtain the latest available information on weather conditions
   that could cause alteration of the planned. Weather forecasts will be updated at regular
   intervals along the route through Flight Watch.
   3.24.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Touch-and-Go. Touch-and-go landings (if authorized
   for the aircraft) may be made by FAA- certified pilots (not solo student pilots) on all hard
   surface runways at ABQ International Sunport, Santa Fe, Grants-Milan, Alexander (Belen),
   Double Eagle II, and on runway 15/33 at Socorro. Touch-and-go landings in all retractable
   gear aircraft are prohibited, in addition to this publication’s restriction for complex aircraft.
3.25. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight Center Security. Member access to the facility is
provided through a cipher lock on the main door. Each member has a six digit code, which
allows a traceable access to the facility. Aircraft keys will be kept in a locked cabinet.
3.26. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) ABQ International Sunport Airport Procedures. Advise
ABQ Approach that you will be parking at the flight center when inbound.
   3.26.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Intersection Departures. Intersection takeoffs are not
   authorized for the Baron unless the runway remaining is at least the distance of the calculated
   Accelerate/Stop plus 20%.
   3.26.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Noise Abatement. T-41C aircraft engines produce
   above average noise because they turn at high RPM. When departing on runway 8 the
   normal procedure is to delay turning northbound until east of the airport boundary. This
   usually allows for a climb to above 6,000 feet MSL before crossing Gibson Avenue. If the
   tower controller requests an early northbound turn that takes you across Gibson below 6,000
   feet MSL, reduce power to 2400 RPM until above 6,000 feet MSL. Use short field technique
   when departing on runway 35 from intersections Alpha or Bravo to gain as much altitude as
   possible before crossing Gibson. At Gibson, accelerate to the best rate of climb airspeed
   (Vy) and, if below 6,000 feet MSL, reduce power to 2400 RPM. In any case, full power
   should be used if safety would be compromised by a power reduction.

   safety meeting prior to regaining flying privileges.
   4.1.5. The installation commander may authorize members and flight instructors to view a
   videotape of the safety meeting to satisfy attendance requirements.
   4.1.5. (KIRTLANDAFB) If members are unavailable due to emergency, temporary duty
   (TDY) status, or official duty commitments, the installation commander has authorized
   KAFB members to view a video of the meeting. In these instances members will provide
   appropriate documentation substantiating reason for excusal. Also obtain approval from the
   flight center manager prior to viewing the videotape, sign appropriate attendance forms, and
   a flight center official will ensure the member’s flying status is upgraded through the
   computer dispatch system.
   4.1.6. The manager may authorize attendance at another military aero club’s safety meeting
   to satisfy attendance requirements.
   4.1.7. Safety meeting format is at the discretion of the manager or club safety officer;
   however, the following topics are recommended for periodic discussion.

4.2. Fire Extinguishers. Fire extinguishers shall be readily accessible during engine starts,
aircraft maintenance, and aircraft refueling. Local fire protection authorities shall determine the
amount, locations, and types of fire extinguishers to be used.
   4.2.1. Fireguards are not required for aero club operations.
   4.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aircraft Fire. Fires during preflight and engine start are
   very hazardous. Safety of people always takes priority over preservation of property.
   Remain clear of a fire that is rapidly growing or uncontrolled. Do not attempt to extinguish a
   fire if it is unsafe to do so. Always notify the fire department of any fire, even if the fire
   appears to be out.
       4.2.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Instructors will cover the use of flight line fire
       extinguishers during student checkouts, initial and annual check rides.
       4.2.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) If a fire occurs while starting, attempt to put out the
       fire with an extinguisher. However, if it is not safe for you to attempt to extinguish the
       fire, proceed to the nearest phone, call the fire department, and provide all information
       necessary for them to locate the aircraft.
       4.2.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Follow the procedures in the aircraft’s operating
       handbook in the event of an induction system or engine fire during starting, ground
       operations, or shutdown. If time permits, call Ground Control on 121.9 to request
       emergency assistance. All aircraft occupants should be briefed to gather 50 yards upwind
       of the aircraft for a head count in the event that a ground evacuation is required. If the
       aircraft has a fire extinguisher, it may be used for small fires.
4.3. Flight Clothing. Pilots are encouraged to wear Nomex clothing, particularly gloves, while
flying. Wear of synthetic materials such as nylon and polyester next to the skin is strongly
discouraged.
4.4. Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standards. Clubs shall comply
with applicable portions of AFOSH standards.
4.5. Disciplinary Action/Retraining. Managers shall deny flying privileges to any pilot(s)
involved in an accident, incident, unusual occurrence, or in actions which may be perceived as a
 46                           AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


violation of established directives, until a reasonable determination of the facts can be made and
the pilot’s aero club privileges are reinstated by the installation commander. Student pilots
involved in any of the above-mentioned actions may continue the dual portion of their flight
training. However, they will not solo until the investigation is completed and the installation
commander reinstates their solo flight privileges.
   4.5.1. The club safety officer shall investigate the event to determine if the pilot(s)
   knowingly violated established guidance, and/or whether the pilot(s) should receive
   additional training. The club safety officer will present their findings to the standardization
   board. The standardization board will make recommendations to ensure this event does not
   reoccur and forward those recommendations through the manager to the installation
   commander for approval.
   4.5.2. If the installation commander determines the pilot(s) knowingly violated established
   guidance; the pilot(s) shall be removed from the club. (NOTE: "Knowingly" shall be
   interpreted to mean a similarly experienced pilot, in a similar situation, would have known
   the actions were in violation of established directives). The pilot(s) will not be eligible to
   reapply to any USAF Aero Club for a period of at least one year.
       4.5.2.1. Managers will forward copies of the events that led to the member’s dismissal
       and approved recommendations to their MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVPAR.
4.6. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Safety Guidance.
   4.6.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Director’s Guidance. Taking calculated risks in flying
   will not be fostered, condoned, or accepted. Our flying and ground operations are based
   upon, guided by, and executed under the concept that all facets of our mission fall in place
   behind safety. In other words, SAFETY COMES FIRST. This means that everyone
   connected, directly or indirectly, with flight center operations must take a professional
   approach to the business. Personnel must follow technical references and checklists to the
   letter. Except when undergoing training under competent supervision, aircrew members
   must be fully qualified in their mission. When, in their opinion, conditions either locally, en-
   route, or at destination indicate flight cannot be accomplished in a safe and efficient manner,
   the flight will be cancelled.
   4.6.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight Center Guidance. Safety will be the first
   consideration in all actions. If the pilot, student, or instructor is not absolutely certain the
   flight can be accomplished safely, the flight will be cancelled. The guidance is simple:
   WHEN IN DOUBT, DON’T.
4.7. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hazard and Safety Reports.
   4.7.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hazard Reports. A Hazard Report (HR) is an AF report
   submitted on AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. The report is used to identify areas where
   hazards, either flight or ground, may exist. Forms are available at the flight center. The
   report should be given to the flight center safety officer or base safety personnel for
   processing.
   4.7.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Safety Reports. The FAA Aviation Safety Reporting
   Program uses the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a third party, to
AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   47


   receive and analyze Aviation Safety reports. This system is described in FAA AC 00-46C,
   and forms are available at the flight center or ABQ Flight Service Station.
4.8. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aircraft Accident/Incident Reporting. Take whatever
action is necessary to protect life and prevent further injury or damage, then notify the flight
center. The flight center is responsible for notifying various agencies both on KAFB, at Air
Force Personnel Center (AFPC) Services Directorate (SV) using the checklist in the “Clearing
Authorities Handbook”. During normal duty hours, the flight center manager will assume duties
of key personnel notification. On weekends and holidays, notification responsibility will be
vested in the clearing authority or senior member present.
   4.8.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Required Reports. There may be several reports
   required by both the AF and the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB). The
   reporting procedures are found in at attachment 5, and in NTSB part 830. If a NTSB report
   is required, two copies of the report should be retained by the pilot for insurance reporting.
   A qualified USAF flight safety officer will conduct the official investigation for each flight
   center accident, incident, or unusual occurrence.
   4.8.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Bird Strike. The flight center is considered a military
   activity for purposes of the Bird Strike Reporting program (BASH). In the case of a bird
   strike, if there is any suspicion of damage, the flight should be terminated as soon as is
   practical, and the aircraft inspected. If the inspection reveals questionable damage, notify the
   flight center and request instructions. Note the type of bird, if possible, and the
   altitude/phase of flight in which the strike occurred. Complete AF Form 853.

           tanks.
           5.1.2.1.2.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Analysis. The contractor will provide a
           documentation of the laboratory analysis of the fuel to the flight center at the time
           of delivery of the fuel.
           5.1.2.1.2.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Filters. Fuel delivery system filter(s)
           will be replaced IAW manufacturer’s recommendation.
        5.1.2.1.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hazardous                                 Material
        Management. Hazardous materials will be handled in compliance with directions
        and precautions/warnings on the labels of the containers. Safety Data Sheets
        (formerly known as MSDS) will be displayed for all hazardous materials stored and
        used in the shop. Personnel handling hazardous materials will comply with the
        Hazardous Chemical Program described by the 377 MSG (Mission Support Group)
        Bio-environmental Management Office (CEIE). Absorbent material will be applied
        immediately to all spills. Large fuel spills will be responded to by the Fire
        Department. Absorbent material used in large fuel spills will be given to the Fire
        Department for proper disposal.
        5.1.2.1.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Safety Kits. A complete first aid kit and an
        eyewash facility will be maintained in the flight center maintenance area. Safety
        goggles and gloves will be used when using solvents for cleaning parts as required by
        Air Force Instruction 91-203 (incorporated AFOSH Standards)
        5.1.2.1.5. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Windows. Aircraft              window      cleaning
        supplies, located by the fuel pumps, will be checked daily and stocked by a flight
        center mechanic. Trash cans around the fuel pumps will be inspected and emptied as
        needed.
     5.1.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Aircraft Discrepancy Reporting Procedures.
        5.1.2.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Responsibilities. The pilot-in-command is
        responsible for reporting any discrepancies or malfunctions discovered during pre-

        forms are provided for each aircraft and are used to document aircraft malfunctions
        and repair actions.
 50                          AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014


          5.1.2.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Reporting Procedures. When a discrepancy
          is noted, it should be entered in the ADP computer program. Discrepancies should be
          concise, but comprehensive (i.e., “VOR #2 needle inop. To-From flag and navigation
          audio were normal” would be preferable to “VOR inop”). Discrepancy pages will
          only be used on cross country flights or when the computer is down. The data will be
          transferred to the computer when the cross country flight has returned and/or when
          the computer is back on line. The discrepancy page should be given to the
          Maintenance Technician. Deferred maintenance pages are reserved for deferred
          write-ups and will be annotated only by maintenance personnel.
              5.1.2.2.2.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Enter only one discrepancy in each
              block. Make sure you use the correct section and write only one discrepancy per
              block. Describe the discrepancy in detail and include your phone number in case
              maintenance has questions. If the discrepancy is a grounding item, notify
              someone in the management chain to ensure appropriate action is taken.
              5.1.2.2.2.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Do not repeat previously reported
              discrepancies, unless they were cleared/corrected or you have additional
              information to provide.
              5.1.2.2.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Hard landings or suspected hard
              landings are mandatory discrepancies and must be reported to the manager, or
              chief flight instructor.
              5.1.2.2.2.4. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Pilots will not clear a discrepancy,
              without the approval of maintenance personnel, except for signing off refueling
              not previously accomplished. Instructors may clear discrepancies that are
              determined to be operator-related (i.e., “unable to transmit from co-pilot side”;
              “turned on intercom, operational check good”).
          5.1.2.2.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Flight                     Center          Operations
          Notification. After completing the discrepancy form, advise the flight center
          manager, chief flight instructor, or CA. The person, who is notified, will ground the
          aircraft by writing the word “OUT” on the flight schedule, and in red, on the
          maintenance status board. The book will be placed in the maintenance “in box” and
          the keys will be placed in the key lock box. If no operations personnel are available,
          the pilot discovering the discrepancy will take these actions.
   5.1.3. 100 hour and annual inspections prescribed by 14 CFR Part 91.409 are required for all
   aero club aircraft operations. These inspections must be IAW the manufacturer’s checklist.
   However, if a manufacturer’s checklist is not available, one must be developed that meets the
   requirements of 14 CFR Part 43, appendix D.
   5.1.4. Managers will document the circumstances resulting in any overflight of an annual or
   100 hour inspection.
   5.1.5. Managers shall notify HQ AFSVA/SVPAR within 48 hours of receiving any FAA
   notice of maintenance discrepancies.
5.2. Time Between Overhaul (TBO).
   5.2.1. Overhaul aircraft components at the manufacturer’s recommended TBO.
AFMAN34-232_KIRTLANDAFBSUP_I 18 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   51


   5.2.2. If engines meet airworthiness standards at TBO, managers may delay engine overhaul,
   rebuild, or replacement until TBO plus 20 percent, provided they conduct actions prescribed
   by Federal Aviation Regulations for 100 hour inspections every 50 hours on the engine(s).
   5.2.3. Managers will use suppliers designated by HQ AFSVA/SVPAR for engine overhauls.
   Aero clubs will not overhaul or rebuild engines without approval from HQ AFSVA/SVPAR.
   Overhauled or rebuilt engines should have detailed logbooks, serviceability tags, and
   appropriate break-in procedures. If appliances are included with the engine, they must also
   have serviceability tags.
5.3. Compliance With Manufacturer’s Service Bulletins. Unless specifically exempted or
modified by HQ AFSVA/SVPAR, clubs shall complete all actions directed by manufacturer’s
mandatory service bulletins.
5.4. Grounding an Aircraft. Any aero club pilot or airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic,
or the manager shall ground an aircraft, if in their opinion; the aircraft is not in an airworthy
condition. AFTO 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy And Work Document (or equivalent), will
be used to document discrepancies, which caused the grounding action. The aircraft shall not be
operated until released by a club A&P mechanic with appropriate documentation.
   5.4.1. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Grounding Discrepancies.                       When a grounding
   discrepancy is discovered, the individual discovering the discrepancy will ensure the aircraft
   is secured, locked, and that the keys are placed in the key drop box. The individual should
   also notify a flight center official, (manager, instructor, clearing authority, or mechanic) and
   advise them of the aircraft’s status. The flight center official will reschedule flights, as
   appropriate and coordinate maintenance. If problems occur away from KAFB, the manager
   or chief mechanic will coordinate maintenance actions to return the aircraft to service. If you
   determine that an aircraft needs to be grounded after flight, park the aircraft on the line and
   secure it. Don’t taxi it to the hangar. Maintenance will work on it on the line or tow it to the
   hangar as needed. This procedure guards against possible wind damage to aircraft left
   unsecured.
   5.4.2. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Grounding Reasons.                  Flight center aircraft will be
   grounded for reasons

       Mandatory Equipment List.
   5.4.3. (Added-KIRTLANDAFB) Return to Flight. Only FAA-certified mechanics are
   authorized to return a grounded aircraft back to service; therefore, all pilots must be certain
   that discrepancies are valid. The mechanic who returns the aircraft to serviceable status will
   make an entry in the log clearing the discrepancy. The log becomes a part of the aircraft’s
   records.
5.5. Maintenance Records. The manager, with assistance from the club maintenance officer or
chief mechanic, shall ensure aircraft maintenance records are maintained IAW applicable FAA
and Air Force guidance. Minor unscheduled maintenance shall be recorded on an AFTO Form
781A or equivalent substitute. As a minimum, the AFTO Form 781A substitute shall have
discrepancy, corrective action, and certification sections. The individual performing the repair or
inspection shall certify their corrective actions in the maintenance record. (NOTE: Technical
Orders Series 00-20 do not apply to the maintenance of these forms, and use of other AFTO
forms in the 781 series is optional.)
   5.5.1. The AFTO Form 781A, or its substitute, will be maintained in 100 hour increments
   between required inspection cycles, and maintained for the previous 200 hours of operation.
   When these records exceed the 200-hour retention requirement, dispose of them in 100 hour
   increments according to AFI 37-138.

                                   GRADING PRACTICES

A3.1. Ensure all instructors are grading against a uniform standard and the applicant’s progress
is assessed against their ability to meet the requirements of FAA Practical Test Standards (PTS)
for the desired certificate or rating. Unless waived by HQ AFSVA/SVPAR, the following grades
shall be used on the applicant’s training record.
A3.2. Individual Maneuver/Task Grade
   A3.2.1. P = Proficient. The applicant meets the applicable FAA PTS for the individual
   maneuver/task without intervention or verbal assistance from the flight instructor.
   A3.2.2. S = Safe. While the applicant does not fully meet the PTS, they are able to
   consistently perform the maneuver/task safely, without flight instructor intervention or verbal
   assistance. The applicant is cleared to perform this maneuver/task solo.
   A3.2.3. A = Accomplished. Unsafe to perform this maneuver/task solo. The applicant is
   unable to perform the maneuver/task without demonstration, intervention, or verbal
   assistance from the flight instructor, or the applicant’s relative experience makes it
   impossible to determine if they could perform the maneuver/task without assistance.
   A3.2.4. D = Demonstrated Only. The flight instructor demonstrated the maneuver/task;
   however, the student was not allowed to accomplish the maneuver/task. (NOTE: If the
   instructor demonstrated the maneuver/task and then allowed the applicant to perform it, the
   grade shall reflect the applicant’s performance.)
   A3.2.5. √ = Accomplished While Solo. Student pilots will place an individual “p" in the
   appropriate box to indicate they performed the maneuver one or more times while solo.
A3.3. Overall Grade
   A3.3.1. The following grades will be used to assess the students overall performance for the
   flight. If an applicant receives a grade of below average or below acceptable standards, the
   chief flight instructor shall review the applicant’s performance with their flight instructor
   prior to the applicant’s next flight.
   A3.3.2. 1 = Excellent. The applicant’s performance exceeded expectations, given their
   phase of training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.3. 2 = Above Average. The applicant’s performance was above average, given their
   phase of training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.4. 3 = Average. The applicant’s performance was average, given their phase of
   training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.5. 4 = Below Average. The applicant’s performance was below average, given their
   phase of training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.6. 5 = Below Acceptable Standards. The applicant’s performance was below average
   given their phase of training, experience, etc.

  required until a change occurs. Enter the effective date of the gain or loss in the remarks
  column. Do not use a numerical designator for the month. (NOTE: The gain and loss dates of
  inter-command transfers must coincide to ensure no lapse in insurance coverage; therefore,
  the gaining and losing clubs must establish a mutually agreeable date on which the transfer
  occurs.)
  A6.2.24. Signature: Managers will sign the AF Form 270 in the lower right hand corner.
NOTE:
  1. A single sortie may involve one or more categories; for example, an individual may fly 2
  hours for recreational purposes and then an hour of pattern work for currency. In this instance
  that individual would log 2 hours T-3 and 1 hour T-2 time. In each case the total of T-1, T-2,
  and T-3 hours must equal the total time flown.
