SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates the opening paragraph and implements the new current formatting
publication guidelines and administration changes.
1. SORTS data is classified in accordance with AFI 10-201, Status of Resource and Training
System, paragraph 1.4 as supplemented. The same data used or displayed for purposes other than
SORTS is classified in accordance with governing directives.
2                                                       507ARWI10-202 18 NOVEMBER 2009


NOTE: All actual unit C-Levels and Measured Resource Area Percentages are Classified.
Response Times and data used to determine C-levels are classified according to the applicable
source documents.
2. SORTS information is classified (as a minimum) as follows:
    2.1. CONFIDENTIAL:
       2.1.1. Single unit’s overall C-Level and each measured resource area C-Level.
       2.1.2. Each Measured resource area percentage of a unit.
       2.1.3. Limiting Factors (LIMFACS) for specific units, unless reference is made to a
       factor with a higher classification applies.
    2.2. SECRET:
       2.2.1. C-levels combined for more than one unit.
       2.2.2. Combined measured resource area percentages of more than one unit.
3. Classification and Marking procedures are as follows for the SORTS Report:
    3.1. Each worksheet that contains C-level’s or measured resource area percentages will have
    the highest classification on that page stamped on the top and bottom of each page.
    3.2. All worksheets will have the Declassification statement at the bottom of the Overall
    worksheet completed each month. Declassify 4 years from date of report for confidential
    worksheets.
4. The SORTS report worksheets when completely filled out must be safeguarded and always
under your direct control. If you are not actively using the report, place it face down or place a
cover sheet over it. Standard Form (SF) 705, Confidential Cover Sheet, states that the holder or
custodian of the document must have a classified document in their immediate possession. Cover
sheets also protect information when you are not using the report. Before you let anyone view
the report, the holder of the information, must ensure the person receiving the information has
the proper level of clearance and has the “need to know”. If you are unsure, contact your local
security manager.
5. The SORTS report must be stored in a Government Services Administration (GSA) security
container. To verify your container is GSA approved, call your local security office or manager.
A GSA approved security container must have the following:
    5.1. A label indicating it is an approved container will be displayed on the face of the top
    drawer.
    5.2. A Test Certification label will be inside the locking drawer of the container.
    5.3. The safe cannot be locked if one of the non-locking drawers is in the open position.
6. If the SORTS report is taken from the Command Post ensure the report remains on base and
is safeguarded at all times. If the report has to be taken off base for any reason ensure a
Department of Defense (DD) Form 2501, Courier Authorization Card is issued to the SORTS
monitor handcarrying the report. This form is used in conjunction with the Entrance/Exit
Inspection Program; it should be issued only for a temporary need (not on a long-term basis such
as one year).

NOTE: Handcarrying is the last choice for transmitting classified information. It should be used
only after all other means have been found to be inadequate.
7. For more guidance on Security refer to AFI 31-401, Managing the Information Security
Program and Department of Defense Regulation (DODR) 5200.1, DOD Information Security
Program Regulation. It is suggested that each unit maintain these regulations.
