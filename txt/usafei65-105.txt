This instruction implements AFPD 65-1, Management of Financial Services, and prescribes USAFE
Form 100, Supplies or Services Order Under US - UK Government Agreements, to procure United States
(U.S.) support from the Defence Estates (United States Forces (DE(USF)). It applies to all personnel
within the financial community who are responsible for processing United Kingdom government agency
payments. It serves as a source reference for personnel within the financial community who are responsi-
ble for processing United Kingdom government agency payments. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG) units. Attachment 1 contains a glossary of references
and acronyms. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and dis-
posed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Extensive changes in poli-
cies and procedures from the previous edition required a complete revision of this publication.


1. General Information.
   1.1. Scope. This instruction does not pertain to construction management activities or construction
   projects (including Military Construction (MILCON)) executed in the United Kingdom (UK) by Air
   Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) or the UK Ministry of Defence, Defence
   Estates (DE) on behalf of AFCEE or United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE).
2                                                                           USAFEI65-105 3 JULY 2008


    1.2. USAFE Form 100. Use USAFE Form 100 to purchase supplies and services from United King-
    dom (UK) agencies, normally the DE(USF). Unless specifically authorized, do not use the DD Form
    1155, Order for Supplies and Services, or Standard Form (SF) 1449, Solicitation/ Contract/Order for
    Commercial Item.
    1.3. Authority. The U.S. and UK Cost Sharing Agreement, 4 April 1973, specifies that the UK gov-
    ernment will accomplish U.S. construction. The U.S. General Accounting Office/Defense Accounting
    and Audit Division letter, 28 May 1958, in response to 3 AF letter, 7 April 1958, Specific Financial
    Arrangements with the British Government, grants authority to use a special form executed and
    administered outside of normal contracting channels, to order supplies and services under U.S.-UK
    Government Agreements.
    1.4. Responsibilities for USAFE Form 100.
       1.4.1. Commander. The commander designates those officials authorized to initiate USAFE
       Forms 100. The commander approves or appoints an approving official with authority to approve
       USAFE Forms 100 as the commander’s designee. For the purpose of this instruction, “com-
       mander” refers to the legal holder of funds, usually the wing commander.
       1.4.2. Initiating Office. Officials authorized by the commander to initiate USAFE Forms 100
       have responsibility for preparation. Initiating officials also have the responsibility to establish and
       maintain a register of control numbers for the USAFE Forms 100 they prepare.
       1.4.3. Approving Official. The commander, or an official specifically designated by the com-
       mander as approving authority, is responsible for approving all USAFE Forms 100 issued for the
       installation. The approving official designated by the commander may not be a member of an
       office or function that initiates USAFE Forms 100.
       1.4.4. Financial Management Analysis and Liaison (FMA). The FMA is responsible for
       receiving and numbering the USAFE Form 100 obligation to the accounting system. The FMA is
       also responsible for the distribution of all USAFE Forms 100 initiated and issued by the base for
       which the FMA has servicing responsibility. HQ Air Force Center for Engineering and the Envi-
       ronment, Atlantic Division, RAF Waterbeach (AFCEE/CMT) also generates USAFE Forms 100
       as needed for base level requirements (typically these are conjunctive projects to Military Con-
       struction Project (MCP) actions).
       1.4.5. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (Limestone), (DFAS (LI)). The DFAS (LI) is
       responsible for recording the obligation to the accounting system, maintaining all USAFE Forms
       100 and the payment of all claims against them.
    1.5. Documentation. Maintain USAFE Form 100 and all supporting documents according to RDS
    located in AFRIMS: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

2. Preparation and Distribution of USAFE Form 100.
    2.1. FMA Action for USAFE Form 100.
       2.1.1. Upon receipt of the approved order, the FMA must ensure that all blocks on the form are
       properly completed and all copies of the order are legible. Return the order to the initiating office
       if it is incomplete or if the copies are not legible.
USAFEI65-105 3 JULY 2008                                                                                   3


      2.1.2. The FMA or a designated certifying officer determines the services or supplies being
      ordered are proper charges to U.S. appropriated funds, identifies the chargeable appropriation and
      fiscal year, and certifies availability of funds by completing Block 14. d. e. and f. If there is doubt
      about the propriety of the purchase or the appropriation chargeable, the certifying officer must
      consult the budget officer and the initiating officer. Use extreme caution when funding a revised
      USAFE Form 100 issued in a prior fiscal year. Be very careful that prior year funds are not used to
      fund current year requirements according to DFAS-DE 7000.4-R, Accounting for Obligations.
      2.1.3. When USAFE Forms 100 are funded using a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request
      (MIPR), or other funding advice, the recipient of the funding advice certifies fund availability.
      However, these forms must be processed through the FMA for assignment of a control number
      and appropriate distribution.
      2.1.4. The FMA will forward the USAFE Form 100 to the DFAS (LI) by transmittal. Make the
      following minimum distribution:
         2.1.4.1. DFAS (LI) - one copy.
         2.1.4.2. FMA - one copy.
         2.1.4.3. Initiating Office - original.
         2.1.4.4. Funding FMA. If another FMA’s funds are cited (such as, from a MIPR or AF Form
         616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA)), send a legible copy to that FMA. If more than one
         FMA’s funds are cited, ensure each FMA is provided a legible copy for their files. NOTE:
         Ensure the MIPR number or AF Form 616 advice number is included as part of the typed
         accounting classification.
      2.1.5. HQ AFCEE/CMT actions for USAFE Form 100 follow the same procedure as indicated
      above in paragraphs 2.1.1. through 2.1.3.
   2.2. DFAS LI Action for USAFE Form 100.
      2.2.1. The DFAS (LI) will be responsible for loading all USAFE forms into Integrated Accounts
      Payable System (IAPS). Post the USAFE Forms 100 in pounds sterling, in the obligation stage
      using the correct foreign currency conversion rate. Annotate clearly on the form the contract num-
      ber, Program Summary Record (PSR), and Document Summary Record (DSR).

3. Accounting Procedures.
   3.1. General. The base level FMA and/or HQ AFCEE/CMT (as appropriate) will record, administer,
   and validate obligations for approved and funded USAFE Form 100.
      3.1.1. For USAFE Form 100, convert the pound sterling obligations to dollar equivalents and
      record in accounting records as follows:
         3.1.1.1. Record obligations and disbursements citing funds covered by the Foreign Currency
         Fluctuation Account (FCFA) at the specified budget rate of exchange for the fiscal year cited.
         Identify any gain or loss at the time of payment for credit or charge to the FCFA (for Defense
         Medical Facility Office (DMFO) fund cites, budget program activity code (BPAC) 670 is used
         to record foreign currency fluctuations).
4                                                                         USAFEI65-105 3 JULY 2008


           3.1.1.2. An AF Form 616 is used on occasion to provide authority to cite funds to a designated
           UK base for supplies and services. For USAFE Forms 100, the base civil engineer (BCE) will
           coordinate the funding and execution of the AF Form 616 with the FMA. Accounting for the
           AF Form 616 will be according to DEFAS-DE 7010.5-R, Direct Reimbursement and Receiv-
           able Transactions at Base Level.
       3.1.2. After final payment is made the BCE will give notification in form of a deobligation letter
       to DFAS (LI) to deobligate the remaining funds. A modification to the USAFE Form 100 is not
       required to deobligate residual funds. If the remaining balance is a significant amount, DFAS (LI)
       must contact the initiating office and the servicing FMA to ensure all performance documentation
       has been received. If a UK agency subsequently submits a valid claim for additional costs, recover
       the USAFE Form 100 from the retained files in order to update the payment record to reflect the
       additional claim. If the claim exceeds the amount of the final USAFE Form 100, contact the initi-
       ator to validate the claim and obtain a revised USAFE Form 100 before payment.
       3.1.3. DFAS (LI) will reconcile and validate all unliquidated USAFE Form 100 obligations at
       least quarterly and at the end of each fiscal year, in accordance with DFAS-DE 7000.4-R. In addi-
       tion, DFAS (LI) will perform a quarterly validation of all obligations in expiring appropriations
       and at least monthly during the last quarter. Aggressive follow-up is important as this will prevent
       the loss of those expiring funds and preclude payments from being made out of current year funds.
       DFAS (LI) should forward extract portions of the open document list (under cover of a transmittal
       letter) to the BCE or other initiating activities to obtain obligation status information.
    3.2. Accounting Procedures - DMFO. The DMFO provides funding through Directorate of Ser-
    vices (HQ USAF/SV) to the Financial Analysis Division (HQ USAFE/FMA) Unit 3050, Box 5, APO
    AE 09094-0505. HQ USAFE/FMA makes a further distribution of funds to HQ AFCEE/CMT using
    operating budget account number 8015. Although funded through United States Air Force (USAF)
    MCP channels, DMFO military construction projects are subject to the same conditions as work for
    other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. Accounting and reporting procedures are similar to
    USAF military construction work because of the similarity in funding procedures in use for this orga-
    nization.
    3.3. Rental of Housing. BCE forwards estimate letters to the FMA on a monthly or quarterly basis
    and provides the FMA with invoices and receiving reports. The FMA will obligate the funds under a
    Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document (MORD), USAFE Form 100, or agreement
    number. The FMA then sends the invoice and receiving report, along with the accounting classifica-
    tion to be used, to the DFAS (LI) for payment through IAPS.
    3.4. Initiating MIPR Orders to Other DoD Agencies. Not all MCP is accomplished by DE (USF)
    or another UK agency. If another DoD activity is performing MCP for the Air Force, HQ AFCEE/
    CMT will initiate a MIPR and forward it to the Mildenhall FMA for fund certification. Use U.S. dollar
    amounts in the MIPR.
       3.4.1. The FMA will retain one copy of the MIPR and record a commitment. Return the remain-
       ing copies to HQ AFCEE/CMT.
       3.4.2. HQ AFCEE/CMT will then forward the MIPR to the performing activity. The performing
       activity will accept the MIPR by initiating a DD Form 448-2, Acceptance of MIPR, and return suf-
       ficient copies to HQ AFCEE/CMT, Unit 5780, APO AE 09459-5780. HQ AFCEE/CMT will for-
       ward an accepted copy of the MIPR to the FMA.
USAFEI65-105 3 JULY 2008                                                                                5


      3.4.3. If the performing activity accepts the MIPR on a reimbursable basis, the FMA will move
      the commitment to the obligation stage upon receipt of the MIPR acceptance. If a MIPR is
      accepted on a direct cite basis (category II), the MIPR will remain committed until the initial copy
      of the contract (or equivalent obligation document) is received. Account for this document in the
      same manner as normal construction contracts, and send to DFAS (LI) as the charges will come
      through the by-others cycle.
      3.4.4. The performing activity will bill DFAS (LI) for reimbursable services provided. DFAS (LI)
      will pay each bill (SF Form 1080, Voucher for Transfer Between Appropriations and/or Funds)
      presented after completion of the Receiving Report, by HQ AFCEE/CMT. If the MIPR contains
      funds for more than one construction line number, DFAS (LI) will maintain a separate DSR pay-
      ment record for each line number. DFAS (LI) will make the payments through IAPS.

4. Performance Documentation.
   4.1. Receiving and Acceptance Documents , USAFE Form 100. The BCE initiating the USAFE
   Form 100 is responsible for receiving all DE (USF) invoices charged against that USAFE Form 100.
   The BCE is also responsible for preparing and forwarding the original and three copies of the 3AF
   Form 428, Certificate of Acceptance of Services, to the servicing FMA for each invoice. Do this no
   later than 30 days after the supplies or services have been received and accepted. Except in extreme
   situations, only one USAFE Form 100 will be cited for payment on each 3AF Form 428.
   4.2. Statement of Financial Completion, USAFE Form 100. The BCE will forward a copy of each
   statement of financial completion to the FMA immediately upon receipt from DE (USF). The final
   invoice accompanies the statement. The FMA will then forward the documents to the DFAS (LI).
   4.3. Cost Overruns. The BCE will obtain additional funding for an impending cost overrun before
   the completion of a project and initiate a revised USAFE Form 100, accordingly. The FMA will adjust
   recorded obligations based on this revision.

5. Payment Procedures.
   5.1. General. DFAS (LI) is the paying office for all billings and claims for purchases of supplies and
   services from UK government agencies (with the exception of Army and Air Force Exchange Service
   (AAFES) and Non-appropriated Fund (NAF)). Payment is made when the agency submits a claim or
   invoice. For the purposes of this instruction, the words “claim” and “invoice” can be used inter-
   changeably. Payments are processed as “for others” if funds of other agencies are cited on the USAFE
   Form 100.
   5.2. Payment Voucher. Make all payments to UK government agencies through IAPS. Use the auto-
   mated SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, to make payment
   according to this instruction and DFAS-DER 177-102, Commercial Transactions at Base Level (PA).
   Each SF 1034 will clearly reference the USAFE Form 100 that authorized the purchase, the invoice
   number, date of invoice, date of delivery, and the amount.
      5.2.1. Supporting documents for USAFE Form 100 payments include the invoice and 3AF Form
      428. A copy of each paid SF 1034 is available electronically through the Defense Finance and
      Accounting Service Electronic file Room (DFAS EFR). NOTE: Send a copy of the SF 1034,
      claim or invoice, receiving or acceptance of services document, and funding document (MIPR or
      AF Form 616) to the finance office of the funds charged on all “for others” payments.
6                                                                          USAFEI65-105 3 JULY 2008


    5.3. Method of Payment. Payments to UK agencies are in pounds sterling by check or electronic
    funds transfer (EFT) through IAPS.
    5.4. Payments to DE(USF), USAFE Form 100. DE(USF) submits a copy of the invoice to the
    appropriate BCE.
       5.4.1. The BCE prepares and forwards the original and two copies of the receiving report or cer-
       tificate of acceptance of services, with the invoices attached, to the servicing FMA. Cite only one
       USAFE Form 100 per 3AF Form 428. Due to IAPS constraints, reference only those multiple
       invoices that are consecutively numbered on any one 3AF Form 428.
       5.4.2. Upon receipt of the invoice and receiving report the FMA will ensure the total of the
       invoice or invoices matches the total cited on the 3AF Form 428. The FMA will ensure only one
       USAFE Form 100 is referenced for payment per 3AF Form 428 and sufficient funds are available
       for payment in IAPS. The FMA will also annotate on the 3AF Form 428 the USAFE Form 100
       number as entered in IAPS and the DSR to use when making the payment. Resolve any discrepan-
       cies before sending to the DFAS (LI). Send the original proper invoice and two copies by transmit-
       tal to the DFAS (LI) for processing.
    5.5. Payment Terms. The DFAS (LI) will make every effort to process the invoice in IAPS within 2
    days of receipt. Payment terms are net 5 days.
    5.6. Payment for NAF USAFE Forms 100. The NAF Accounting Office (AO) will make payments
    for NAF funded projects. NAF fund balances are not maintained in the DFAS (LI)’s accounting sys-
    tem database.
       5.6.1. Upon receipt of an invoice and receiving report from BCE, the NAF AO will make pay-
       ment to the UK Agency or Vendor in pounds sterling.
       5.6.2. The NAF activity must issue a check in pounds sterling payable to the UK Agency or Ven-
       dor. The NAF AO will contact DE (USF) if payment is not made within 10 workdays of receipt of
       the invoice and receiving report. The NAF AO will be responsible for accomplishing second
       requests and elevating subsequent follow-up.
    5.7. Payments to UK Agencies other than DE(USF). Make payments to other UK agencies in a
    similar manner to the claims procedures for DE(USF).
       5.7.1. Each agency submits a claim to the BCE.
       5.7.2. The originating activity furnishes BCE the documents previously described in paragraph
       5.2.1.
       5.7.3. The BCE forwards the package to the FMA. The FMA, in turn, forwards all necessary
       paperwork, including the obligating document or contract, to DFAS (LI) for payment.
    5.8. Credit Invoice Processing. DFAS (LI) will encourage agencies to account for agency internal
    credits and send DFAS (LI) only debit invoices. IAPS does not have the capability to process credit
    invoices. If credit invoice processing is unavoidable, DFAS (LI) will process the credits against debit
    invoices. Take care to process credits and debits in the accounting system according to their respective
    accounting classifications.
       5.8.1. Forms Prescribed. USAFE Form 100, Supplies or Services Order Under US – UK Govern-
       ment Agreements.
USAFEI65-105 3 JULY 2008                                                                        7
