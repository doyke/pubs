carts, ATVs, quad-runners, snowmobiles, etc.) not meeting specifications of Title 49 CFR
571.500 FMVSS will be categorized as OGMVCs and assigned prime NSN 2340-00-585-7495
in AFEMS, AS 036. OGMVCs will be purchased IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR), Defense FAR Supplement, AF FAR Supplement, related AFIs and AFPD 64-1, The
Contracting System, and managed IAW AFMAN 23-110 and AFI 91-207, Air Force Traffic
Safety Program. Note: Skid steer loaders and mini-excavators made by Bobcat or other
manufacturers are classified as registered vehicles and will be managed as vehicles under the
category of Base Maintenance/Construction Equipment.
3. Non-REMS Low Speed Vehicles (NRLSV) Definition: LSVs purchased with unit funds
prior to 1 June 2006, organizations may continue to manage these assets as equipment until the
vehicle has reached its life expectancy. This category of LSVs will be assigned prime NSN
2340-00-540-3900, AS 036 and will be considered as non-REMS reportable LSVs (NRLSV).
4. OGMVC’s/NRLSV’s are for official use only. The instructions pertaining to government
motor vehicle (GMV) abuse and misuse will apply.
5. NRLSV’s/OGMVCs: NRLSVs and OGMVCs programs will be an UCI checklist item(s) to
ensure all management and maintenance requirements are being met. During VVVs, OGMVCs
and non-REMS reportable LSVs will be considered as an element of a unit’s total motor vehicle
capability when assessing vehicle fleet size adequacy.
6. Vehicle/Equipment Determination: All purchase requests for equipment which could be
categorized as a ―vehicle‖ will be routed through 78 LRS/LGRV and in-turn sent to MAJCOM
for final determination (examples: trailers, golf carts, ATVs, loaders, etc). Only those assets
categorized as ―equipment‖ and cataloged as an ―OGMVC‖ will be managed IAW this
publication. Requests which are determined to be a ―vehicle‖, must be procured and managed
IAW AFI 23-302.
7. Safety:

     9.2. Equipment Custodian will provide AF Form 2005 with equipment account, detail
     number, unit type code (UTC), increment number (when applicable), serial number, NSN,
     and registration number to 78 LRS/LGRM when asset is being processed for turn-in. 78
     LRS/LGRM -EAO will do final inspection and remove asset from CA/CRL and process to
     DRMS. The EAO section will then provide LGRV with the above information to remove
     asset from OLVIMS.
10. Organization Responsibility:
     10.1. To provide Commanders, equipment custodians and VCOs/VCNCOs with added
     oversight, it is highly recommended organizations establish a separated shop code for
     OGMVCs/NRLSVs assigned to their unit/squadron (example: 901LG or 901OG). The
     account will be independent from other shop equipment thus increasing asset visibility and
     accountability.
     10.2. Equipment custodians with OGMVCs/NRLSVs assigned can submit a WR-ALC Form
     229 to establish a separate shop code (LV or OG). Once established, the assets will be
     transferred to the new account.
11. OGMVC/NRLSV Equipment Custodian/VCO/VCNCO Responsibility:
     11.1. Equipment Custodian and VCO/VCNCOs will be the focal point for transfers, asset
     accountability, Report of Surveys (ROS), purchase request, fuel keys, PMI and salvage.
     Equipment Custodian will also provide 78 LRS/LGRV the following information: year
     equipment was manufactured, purchase price, make, model, serial number or VIN number,
     manuals, equipment account, serial/VIN number and all applicable checklist. During the
     annual Vehicle Control Program (VCP) visit, documentation on OGMVC and NRLSV assets
     will be inspected. This will include but not limited to safety, serviceability, PMI and overall
     condition. Any unit that has more than 5 percent of its total assigned OGMVCs/NRLSVs
     recorded as over-due scheduled maintenance (by date) during the last 6 month period prior to
     the annual VCP assistance visit will achieve an unsatisfactory rating. The results of the
     inspection will be included in the annual VCP visit findings.
     11.2. Equipment Custodian and VCO/VCNCO will ensure all pending maintenance actions
     are accomplished and the VCO/VCNCO will notify Vehicle Management and Analysis
     (VM&A) when PMI actions have been completed. The notification will consist of one of the
     following: invoice from vender, Air Force approved system generated invoice or work order.
     Assets will have PMI and services accomplished IAW owner’s manual. When owner’s
     manual is not available the PMI will be performed at a minimum, annually. The AF Form
     4354 can be used as a guideline for completing PMIs when owners’ manual(s) are not
     available. This form can be down loaded at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. 78 ABW/SE
     will be notified by X registration number and the organization(s) which fail to have PMIs
     completed by due date(s). VCO/VCNCOs are required to keep a copy of invoices or have
     access to Air Force system generated invoice/work orders.
     11.3. Equipment Custodian in conjunction with the VCO or VCNCO will ensure a lesson
     plan is developed in coordination with 78 ABW/SE. The lesson plan should include, but is
     not limited to inspection prior to use, safe operation, and any other operator specific
     instructions IAW applicable owner's manual. Documentation of training will be on AF Form
     55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or approved equivalent.

12. Operators responsibility:
   12.1. Operators will complete unit specific training before operating OGMVCs.
   Documentation of the training will be on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record,
   or approved equivalent. Operation of GMVs (owned, leased or rented) requires possession of
   an AF Form 2293, U.S. Air Force Motor Vehicle Operator Identification Card, this
   requirement includes OGMVCs.
   12.2. Operators will inspect asset prior to use, utilizing the AF Form 1800 and document
   daily/weekly inspections. The completed forms will be maintained by the VCO/VCNCO
   IAW AFI 23-302 and Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at
   https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Assets with any safety discrepancies, to include overdue PMI,
   will be taken out of service immediately and reported to the custodian/VCO for corrective
   action.
13. 78 LRS/LGRM Responsibility:
   13.1. LGRM will manage organizational CA/CRLs. They will provide LGRV the account,
   shop code and custodians contact information of organizations with OGMVCs/NRLSVs
   assigned.
   13.2. LGRM will notify LGRV when OGMVCs/NRLSVs transfers by providing the
   account, shop code, X-Registration number and detail the asset transferred to and from.
   13.3. LGRM will load OGMVCs into Air Force Equipment Management System as follows;
   UTC first two positions will be the year, the remaining positions will be the last 4 of the
   VIN/Serial number. LGRMS will also when possible, embed the last 6 characters of the
   registration number into increment number (example: X00001). If this is not feasible, a ―P‖
   series NSN will be established with the ―X‖ registration number (Example:
   2340P10X12345).
14. 78 LRS/LGRV Responsibility:
   14.1. LGRV will notify LGRM when OGMVCs are received. This information will include
   year, make, model, document number when applicable and serial/VIN number.
   14.2. LGRV will request ―X‖ registration numbers for OGMVC/NRLSV from Vehicle and
   Equipment Management Support Office (VEMSO). The ―X‖ registration number will be
   placed on the rear of all OGMVCs and NRLSVs. The markings will be visible from the rear.
   To standardize placement and size, LGRV will install these markings. (T.O. 36-1-191)
   14.3. LGRV will load OGMVC/NRLSV into OLVIMS database for tracking purposes and
   notify the VCO or VCNCO and custodians of pending PMI’s dates. A copy of the completed
   PMI’s documentation will be maintained by VM&A. VM&A will notify the 78 LRS/CC and
   78 ABW/SE when asset(s) PMI become overdue.
