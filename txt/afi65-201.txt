                                             Chapter 1

                              GOALS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Introduction. To meet the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA)
requirements, all government agencies must establish, evaluate and report on internal controls,
and submit an annual Statement of Assurance (SoA) to the President and the Congress.
     1.1.1. Managers must:
     1.1.2. Apply controls to all administrative, operational, and programmatic functions as well
     as accounting and financial management;
     1.1.3. Ensure internal control costs do not exceed the expected benefits;
     1.1.4. Use the annual SoA to report:
        1.1.4.1. Compliance with the FMFIA;
        1.1.4.2. Administrative, operational, programmatic and financial management internal
        control material weaknesses; and,
        1.1.4.3. Plans for taking corrective action to mitigate material weaknesses.
1.2. Objectives. The Managers’ Internal Control Program (MICP) utilizes a system of internal
controls that should provide reasonable assurance that:
     1.2.1. Obligations and costs comply with applicable law.
     1.2.2. The Air Force safeguards all funds, property and other assets against waste, loss,
     unauthorized use, and misappropriation.
     1.2.3. Personnel accurately record revenues and expenses used to operate the agency and
     maintain accountability over assets.
     1.2.4. Program, administrative, and operating functions are efficiently and effectively carried
     out in accordance with applicable laws and administrative policy.
1.3. Internal Control Standards. Managers have the fundamental responsibility to establish
and maintain internal controls in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control and the United States
Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control (GAO/AIMD-00-
21.3.1). The OMB Circular A-123 specifically outlines five standards providing the basis against
which internal control is to be evaluated, to include all aspects of operations whether
programmatic, financial or compliance. The five standards are:
     1.3.1. Control Environment. Understanding management’s attitude, awareness, and actions,
     clearly defined authority and responsibility, appropriate delegation of authority and
     responsibility, integrity and ethical standards, commitment to competence, hierarchy for
     reporting, proper support for human capital hiring, training, advancing and disciplining.
     1.3.2. Risk Assessment. Identifying internal and external risks, taking into account previous
     audit findings, inspections and other assessments, and known instances of noncompliance
     with laws, regulations and policies; then analyzing risk for potential effect and impact. Some
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                        5


   significant events can affect risk, these include: complexity or magnitude of programs or new
   operations, extent of manual processes, related party transactions, decentralized versus
   centralized accounting, accounting estimates, new programs, new personnel, new technology,
   new or amended laws, regulations or accounting standards.
   1.3.3. Control Activities. The policies, procedures, and mechanisms in place that ensure
   management’s directives are carried out, such as proper segregation of duties, physical
   control over assets, proper authorization, appropriate documentation and access to
   documentation, analytical review and analysis, and safeguarding information.
   1.3.4. Information and Communications. Information should be communicated to relevant
   personnel at all levels within an organization. The information should be relevant, reliable,
   and timely. It is also crucial that an agency communicate with outside organizations as well,
   whether providing information or receiving it.
   1.3.5. Monitoring. Management should conduct periodic reviews to determine the
   effectiveness of internal controls through self-assessment by management, direct testing or
   evaluations from the Inspector General (IG), auditors, or other assessment organizations. The
   assessment should include obtaining an understanding of the major types of activities the
   agency uses to monitor internal control and how those activities are used to initiate corrective
   actions. Every step of the assessment process should be documented.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities. Note: The MICP roles are inherently governmental. Only
civilian employees and/or military members of the Air Force, to include direct-hire foreign
national employees, are authorized to serve in the MICP roles listed below. Contractors or
indirect-hire foreign national employees are not authorized to serve in the MICP roles indicated;

     Service, and the Air Force District of Washington are PREs of the Air Force MICP.
     Headquarters Air Force/Resource Management (HAF/RM) serves as the PRE
     headquarters for all Secretariat and Air Staff offices. SAF/FM will report directly to the
     SECAF, due to its unique reporting requirements specific to the ICOFR and ICOFS. The
     heads of these organizations are the Air Force’s highest level Assessable Unit Managers
     (AUM) who direct the MICP within their organizations.                 Specifically, these
     organizational heads must:
        1.4.4.1.1. Appoint a Program Administrator (PA) to manage the overall MICP and
        ensure program compliance through regular internal MICP reviews. The Program
        Administrator shall be in the financial management and comptroller organization.
        EXCEPTION: At locations without a financial management organization (for
        example, Secretariat or Air Staff) the organization head designates the office to
        perform PA duties;
        1.4.4.1.2. Establish internal controls to mitigate risks and to meet the objectives of
        the MICP;

        units;
        1.4.4.1.4. Evaluate internal controls to ensure cost does not exceed the benefit
        derived from implementing the control;
        1.4.4.1.5. Prepare an annual statement, which states whether or not there is
        reasonable assurance that the objectives of the MICP were met. The annual statement
        must be signed by the commander or commander’s principle deputy and may not be
        delegated. These statements collectively form the support for the Secretary of the Air
        Force’s Annual SoA to the Secretary of Defense;
        1.4.4.1.6. Ensure compliance in response to SAF/FM direction on MICP
        implementation and report progress on the status of material weakness corrective
        actions;

        continued operation of the MICP (See paragraph 1.4.5.4.).
     1.4.4.2. Secretariat and Air Staff organizations who oversee field activities must include
     their Field Operating Agency (FOA) in their MICP. They may require separate FOA
     management control plans and PAs. The oversight principal may have the FOA
     commander provide a separate supporting SoA. They should include documents that
     show the FOA’s compliance with the MICP to support the principal’s statement.
     1.4.4.3. Subordinate organization commanders are responsible for their internal controls.
     Each commander must: Establish internal controls to meet program objectives and
8                                                               AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


       continuously monitor and improve the effectiveness of internal controls. Furnish, upon
       request by higher headquarters, a statement giving reasonable assurance that they have
       met the objectives of the MICP. Carry out MICP responsibilities as higher headquarters

       1.4.5.10. Will be appointed in writing by the commander or commander’s designee.
    1.4.6. Assessable Unit Managers: The AUM is the principle manager or head of the
    assessable unit with authority and responsibility over the internal controls of the assessable
    unit. The AUMs are responsible for their organization’s internal controls. AUM
    responsibility may apply at any management level, including the PRE to the smallest
    organization as determined by the PRE. AUMs should have an understanding of key
    processes, internal controls, and associated risks. AUMs are responsible for the continual
    monitoring, testing and improvement of internal controls. For available training resources,
    AUMs should contact their PAs. AUMs must operate an effective internal control system,
    evaluate the control system, and correct known weaknesses. Whether controls apply to
    administrative, operational, or programmatic functions, the assessable unit manager must
    develop, implement, and maintain an internal control system as an integral part of the process
    used to operate the organization. Each AUM must:

                                          Chapter 2

                                       PROCEDURES

2.1. MICP Implementation. The Air Force will implement the MICP at all levels. Leadership
will include as part of their basic management philosophy a culture to sustain organizational
support for internal controls and internal control processes to improve effectiveness and
accountability for results. Managers will prevent this process from becoming an isolated
exercise. Periodic assessments should be integrated as part of management’s continuous
monitoring of internal control. To the greatest extent possible, the MICP should be consolidated
with daily operating and management practices and utilize existing evaluative processes.
Implement the MICP as follows:
   2.1.1. Segment the organization into assessable units. Divide each primary and subordinate
   reporting organization into entities capable of being evaluated by internal control assessment
   procedures as outlined in paragraph 2.2;
   2.1.2. Develop a management control plan as defined in paragraph 2.3;
   2.1.3. Perform a risk assessment to identify potential hazards that will prevent the AU from
   achieving its objectives, document findings and implement the internal controls necessary to
   mitigate the risks as defined in paragraph 2.4;
   2.1.4. Conduct and document internal control assessments as described in paragraph 2.5.2;
   2.1.5. Develop and implement corrective action plans for identified deficiencies and
   weaknesses as outlined in paragraph 2.6; and,
   2.1.6. Prepare an SoA that provides an overall level of assurance of the effectiveness of
   internal controls as described in paragraph 3.2 and discloses internal control material
   weaknesses.
2.2. Segmentation:
   2.2.1. PREs should be segmented along organizational, programmatic, or functional lines
   into AUs so that all subcomponents or organizations under the direct authority, supervision,
   and/or responsibility of the Department of the Air Force are identified as a separate and
   distinct AU or are included as a part of another AU. The sum of the AUs must encompass the
   entire organization. No Air Force activity or program is exempt from the requirements of the
   MICP. This includes all personnel assigned to Air Force organizations and reporting
   organizations for which the Air Force serves as the executive agent.
   2.2.2. PREs may determine how far the segmentation should progress in order to achieve
   adequate oversight of internal control responsibilities. Designate AUs of appropriate nature
   and size that a single manager may be held responsible for the assessment of internal
   controls. To the extent practical, standardize AUs and associated internal controls for the
   operation of common functions and activities throughout organizations.
   2.2.3. AUs must meet the following criteria:
       2.2.3.1. Have clear limits or boundaries and be identifiable to a specific responsible
       manager;
 12                                                            AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


      2.2.3.2. Be large enough to allow observations that provide reasonable assurance that
      internal controls are in place and adequate, but not so large that any material weakness
      goes un-detected. The AUM should have a span of control to be able to actively
      participate in the review process.
      2.2.3.3. For activities or functions that are contracted out, Air Force managers
      performing related functions that are inherently governmental in nature (for example,
      property accountability, contract administration, and quality assurance) must form the
      assessable unit over that activity or function.
2.3. Management Control Plan (MCP):
   2.3.1. PREs identified in paragraph 1.4.4.1 shall establish and maintain a comprehensive
   MCP detailing the PRE’s assessable units and the processes and procedures for conducting
   the MICP. An AU inventory will be maintained in a MCP which should be updated at least
   annually.
   2.3.2. The MCP must include at a minimum: number of AUs, title of each AU, responsible
   AUM, date of last MCP review, responsible AUA, status of AUM training, material
   weaknesses and reportable conditions, if reported, and corrective action plans, if applicable.
2.4. Risk Assessment.
   2.4.1. Prior to assessing risk, management must establish a clear mission and objectives for
   the assessable unit.
   2.4.2. A risk assessment determines where a potential hazard exists that might prevent the
   organization from achieving its objectives. The risk assessment should be updated as
   policies, procedures and missions change within the AU. Asking the following questions
   may help to identify risks:
      2.4.2.1. What could go wrong in the process?
      2.4.2.2. What processes require the most judgment?
      2.4.2.3. What processes are the most complex?
      2.4.2.4. What must go right for mission success?
      2.4.2.5. How could we fail to accomplish our objectives?
      2.4.2.6. How do we know whether we are achieving our objectives?
      2.4.2.7. Where are our vulnerable areas?
   2.4.3. Management should identify and document risks that are internal and external to the
   organization as a part of standard operating procedures. Specific analysis methods can vary
   by organization due to varying mission requirements and difficulty assigning qualitative and
   quantitative risk levels. Management should consider the significance of the risk (low,
   medium, high), likelihood of occurrence, and what actions should be taken.
   2.4.4. Management should also consider the following when assessing risk: previous reports
   and findings; e.g., auditor identified, results of internal management reviews, non-
   compliance with laws, regulations, policies and procedures within the organization.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                      13


   2.4.5. Management should consider mechanisms for assessing special risks associated with
   changing environment and mission conditions. Existing risk management programs and tools
   should be leveraged where possible. Procedures and policies outlined in AFI 90-901,
   Operational Risk Management, may be used as a basis for MICP risk assessments; however,
   safety programs alone do not address all potential risks an assessable unit may face in
   accomplishing its mission and safeguarding its assets. Risk assessments, as a part of safety
   programs, contribute to, but will not likely fully satisfy the requirement for an AUM to assess
   risks under the MICP.
2.5. Internal Control Assessment:
   2.5.1. AUMs are responsible for continuously monitoring their internal controls.
   2.5.2. Internal control assessments are performed by or at the direction of AUMs to
   determine whether internal controls exist, are correctly implemented, and to ensure that
   internal control systems are working effectively to mitigate risks. Internal control
   assessments are of two broad types: 1) a specific detailed examination of internal controls in
   a prescribed review format especially designed for that purpose, (see paragraph 2.5.5) or 2)
   using a variety of assessment processes that provide adequate information regarding the
   effectiveness of control techniques, (see paragraph 2.5.4).
   2.5.3. AUMs must:
      2.5.3.1. Develop and communicate a written description of the organizations goals and
      corresponding internal controls. These descriptions may already exist in current
      regulations, standard operating procedures, and other similar documentation. If the
      observed controls differ from the AU’s written description, the AUMs will update the
      description of the controls;
      2.5.3.2. Evaluate their internal controls so that excessive controls can be eliminated and
      weak controls can be improved; and,
      2.5.3.3. Ensure internal control assessments are documented and the documentation is
      maintained as a part of the AU MICP and in compliance with AFRIMS.
   2.5.4. In order to streamline the process of reviewing internal control systems, DoDI
   5010.40, Mangers’ Internal Control Program, encourages managers to rely on existing
   internal control reviews. Managers shall not duplicate existing reviews that have included a
   specific assessment of internal controls and are properly documented. Managers are
   encouraged to utilize the following sources of information for existing internal control
   assessments:
      2.5.4.1. Management and oversight reviews;
      2.5.4.2. Computer security reviews;
      2.5.4.3. Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA), Department of Defense Inspector General
      (DoDIG) and GAO audits, inspections, or investigations;
      2.5.4.4. Annual assessments performed in accordance with other statutory requirements
      such as the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Government
      Performance and Results Act, Improper Payments Information Act, and Clinger-Cohen
      Act;
 14                                                             AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


      2.5.4.5. System compliance reviews;
      2.5.4.6. Program evaluations;
      2.5.4.7. Self inspection program, Staff Assist Visits (SAV);
      2.5.4.8. Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI); and,
      2.5.4.9. Quality Assurance (QA) reviews.
   2.5.5. If an existing assessment of controls is not available, then an appropriate internal
   control review shall be performed for the assessable unit. Locally developed review formats
   may be used and shall be completed with consideration of the Internal Control Standards
   (paragraph 1.3.). The Air Force has developed a standard review format that can also be
   used for this purpose. It conforms to all program requirements of OMB and DoD, and is
   available from the SAF/FMPA program office. The standard format is a simple and uniform
   way of conducting and documenting the accomplishment of an internal control evaluation.
2.6. Corrective Action Plan:
   2.6.1. An AUM must prepare and implement a corrective action plan for all internal control
   material weaknesses as they are identified. The correction of internal control weaknesses is
   an integral part of management accountability and must be considered a priority. It makes no
   difference if the weakness is systemic or if the weakness is merely a failure to follow
   established procedures. In both cases, the weakness must be reported and corrected.
   2.6.2. The recommendations for corrective action shall correlate with the risk. In some cases
   management should strengthen the existing controls, and in others, management should
   include new controls. Managers must always consider the materiality of the weakness and
   the cost implications of actions to correct it when determining a corrective action plan.
   2.6.3. A corrective action plan identifies specific actions and completion dates for correcting
   the material weakness. The plan lists the tasks, called milestones, together with interim
   target dates for accomplishment. Milestones may be revised as required. The final milestone
   shall be one of verifying that the corrective actions achieved the desired results.
   2.6.4. For internal control deficiencies that are not included as material weaknesses in the
   SoA, corrective actions shall be developed and tracked internally at the appropriate level.
   2.6.5. The performance appraisal of the responsible senior management official for
   correction of material weaknesses reported in the Secretary’s SoA shall evaluate the effective
   and timely resolution of the material weakness IAW DoDI 5010.40.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                       15


                                           Chapter 3

                                         REPORTING

3.1. General. The reports relating to the MICP have been assigned Report Control Symbol DD-
Comp AR 1618. The Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller (OUSD(C)) issues reporting
guidelines and formats for all required reports. SAF/FM will issue appropriate call letters to
PREs transmitting the prescribed guidance and current reporting formats.
3.2. Air Force Statement of Assurance:
   3.2.1. SAF/FM will prepare the Air Force SoA according to instructions received from the
   OUSD(C). The statement will provide the Secretary of the Air Force’s level of reasonable
   assurance of the effectiveness of Air Force internal controls. A single cover memorandum
   will state the senior management assessment as to whether or not there is reasonable
   assurance that the Air Force’s internal controls are in place and operating effectively in three
   distinct processes.
       3.2.1.1. ICONO as it pertains to the overall program, operational, and administrative
       controls relevant to all mission-essential functions throughout the Air Force.
       3.2.1.2. ICOFR relevant to the financial reporting functions of the Air Force’s Primary
       Financial Reporting Elements; the Air Force General Fund and the Air Force Working
       Capital Fund (See chapter 4).
       3.2.1.3. ICOFS relevant to the integrated financial management system’s conformance
       with Federal requirements (See Chapter 5).
   3.2.2. Each assessment will take one of the following forms:
       3.2.2.1. Unqualified statement of assurance. (―I have reasonable assurance that....‖).
       Provides a firm basis and appropriate justification for reasonable assurance.
       3.2.2.2. Qualified statement of assurance. (―I have reasonable assurance that...except
       for....‖). Explains why the material weakness(s) precludes an unqualified statement.
       3.2.2.3. Negative statement of assurance. (―I do not have reasonable assurance that....‖).
       Explains why the overarching effect of weaknesses negates reasonable assurance.
   3.2.3. Where the annual SoA provides an unqualified statement of assurance, it shall be
   supported by clear indications that AUMs understand and adhere to the GAO Standards for
   internal control in the Federal Government, are formally held accountable for the
   effectiveness of their internal controls, have evaluated key internal controls as applicable to
   the AU, reported material weaknesses, if any, and have taken corrective action to resolve
   them.
   3.2.4. Where the annual SoA provides a ―qualified‖ statement of assurance, the area or areas
   in question shall be specified and related to material weaknesses being reported.
   3.2.5. The body of the statement will provide a description of how the MICP was
   implemented during the year, improvements and innovations to the program, overview of
   training, disclose material weaknesses, describe the plans and schedules for correcting those
   weaknesses, and give the status of corrective actions on prior year weaknesses.
 16                                                              AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


3.3. Supporting Statements of Assurance:
   3.3.1. Each PRE must submit a supporting ICONO SoA that provides an overall level of
   assurance as described in paragraph 3.2.2. These supporting statements formulate the
   collective basis for the Secretary's SoA.
   3.3.2. HAF/RM and SAF/FM will address their SoA to the Secretary of the Air Force. All
   other PREs will address their SoA to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. All statements are
   due on the date designated by the annual call letter. PRE supporting statements will be
   submitted to SAF/FMPA for review and to support development of the Secretary's SoA.
   3.3.3. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) will address their statements, if required by
   provisions of paragraph 1.4.4, to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff oversight
   organization.      Accordingly, oversight organizations' supporting SoA will include
   responsibility for the evaluation and reporting on internal controls of their designated FOAs.
   3.3.4. PREs must develop a building block process to support their annual statements. A
   supporting letter or SoA from each echelon to the next higher echelon as determined in
   paragraph 2.2 is required. These submissions serve as supporting documentation to the PRE
   statement and shall be maintained in compliance with the AF Records Disposition Schedule
   in AFRIMS.
   3.3.5. Assurance letters at subordinate levels may disclose weaknesses of varying degrees of
   significance to the PRE as a whole. Management shall collect, analyze and document those
   crosscutting weaknesses or items common to several units and other significant deficiencies
   and consider whether they are appropriate for inclusion in the SoA to the next higher-level
   official. Reference the DoDI 5200.1-R Information Security Program, to ensure documents
   containing potential weaknesses and deficiencies are properly marked and safeguarded if
   necessary.
   3.3.6. The supporting SoA is based on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
   internal controls as of the end of the current fiscal year. Practical considerations of preparing
   a year-end statement in advance of the completion date may require an earlier cutoff date for
   internal processing and coordination. Significant findings, after the administrative cutoff
   date, shall be forwarded immediately to the AU’s next level of management for amendment
   to its supporting statement. Administrative results and minor findings shall be reported in the
   subsequent reporting period.
3.4. Concept of Reasonable Assurance:
   3.4.1. In the context of the FMFIA, "reasonable assurance" refers to a satisfactory level of
   management confidence that internal controls are adequate and operating as intended.
   Inherently a management judgment, reasonable assurance recognizes that acceptable levels
   of risk exist due to outside factors which cannot be avoided or the cost of management’s
   ability to achieve absolute control would exceed the benefits derived.
   3.4.2. The determination of reasonable assurance is a subjective management judgment. The
   subjectivity of this judgment can be reduced significantly by considering the following:
      3.4.2.1. The degree to which all AUMs understand and adhere to the GAO Standards for
      Internal Control in the Federal Government and the OMB Circular A-123.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                      17


      3.4.2.2. The degree to which AUMs are held formally accountable for the effectiveness
      of their internal controls and are evaluated on their performance in this regard.
      3.4.2.3. The timeliness, adequacy, and results of internal control evaluations, including
      the correction of any internal control weaknesses detected.
      3.4.2.4. Assessments from other sources (for example, audits, inspections, and
      investigations); media coverage; and direct management reviews or assessments by
      senior officials.
      3.4.2.5. Supporting SoA from subordinate AUMs.
3.5. Concept of Material Weakness:
   3.5.1. Deficiencies in internal controls must be reported by the AUM if they are deemed to
   be material to the AU. Noncompliance with existing internal controls or ineffective internal
   controls shall be reported by the responsible AUM as a part of their supporting SoA.
   3.5.2. Subordinate AUMs must report deficiencies that are either material enough to warrant
   the attention of more senior management or require the participation of more senior
   management to resolve. This information may be modified by management as it is reported
   forward. As part of the aggregation process, senior management may delete less significant
   control deficiencies and may add new items which apply at more senior organizational levels.
   Thus, what may be a material weakness at one level may not be material at the next higher
   level. If the decision is made to exclude a material weakness during the reporting process,
   this decision must be clearly documented and retained as a part of the AU’s MCP for review.
   This process culminates with the PRE denoted in paragraph 1.4.4, reporting their most
   significant internal control problems in their supporting SoA. EXCEPTION: ―Significant
   Deficiencies‖ identified from evaluations conducted in accordance with the FISMA of 2002
   must be reported as a material weakness under ICOFS (See chapter 5).
   3.5.3. To be considered material, a weakness must meet the following two conditions:
      3.5.3.1. It must involve a weakness in internal controls, such as the controls are not in
      place, are not being used or are inadequate. Resource deficiencies in themselves are not
      internal control weaknesses.
      3.5.3.2. It must warrant the attention of the next level of command, either because that
      next level must take action or because they must be aware of the problem. This requires a
      management judgment, particularly in determining whether the next level of command
      must be aware of a weakness. The fact that a weakness can be corrected at one level does
      not exclude it from being reported to the next level; demonstrating the ability to
      effectively identify internal control weaknesses is one of the primary reasons for
      reporting a material weakness.
   3.5.4. Material weaknesses are defined as having the potential to: Impair fulfillment of
   essential operations or mission, violate statutory or regulatory requirements, deprive the
   public of needed government services, endanger national security, cause adverse publicity or
   embarrassment, diminish credibility or reputation, lead to waste or loss of funds, property, or
   other resources, allow fraud or other criminal activity to go undetected, cause harm, even
   though minor individually, because it can be extensive in the aggregate, or cause loss of
 18                                                             AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


   control over a significant amount of the resources for which an organization is responsible
   (including resources other than money; i.e., personnel, equipment, etc.).
   3.5.5. Material weaknesses can be identified by other organizations, such as OSD functional
   offices, GAO, DoDIG, or AFAA. AUMs will give strong consideration to these
   recommendations and work toward a consensus on material weakness reporting with these
   offices.
3.6. Material Weakness Quarterly Reporting:
   3.6.1. All PRE’s must provide a quarterly update on the status of corrective actions related to
   open material weaknesses to the SAF/FMP. The 1st and 2nd quarterly updates are due on the
   10th business day after the end of the quarter. The submission of the PRE’s SoA will serve
   as the 3rd quarter update and the coordination and review of the Air Force SoA will serve as
   the 4th quarter update.
   3.6.2. Identify and report all material weaknesses according to standard DoD Internal
   Control reporting categories. See Attachment 2 for the list of reporting categories.
3.7. Weakness Tracking System:
   3.7.1. SAF/FMPA will maintain a summary of all material weaknesses. PREs must maintain
   a subordinate system to track their own material weaknesses. Information in the tracking
   system must include the Internal Control Reporting Category, narrative description of the
   problem, corrective action milestone chart and the name of the responsible official and point
   of contact for corrective action progress.
   3.7.2. A material weakness may be reported as closed only after corrective actions are
   verified as effective. This verification may be completed by specific management reviews,
   follow-on audits, metric tracking, or other independent validation. There must be sufficient
   time between implementation of the final corrective action and verification of the corrective
   actions to demonstrate internal controls are working properly in normal operations. The
   verification shall be documented and the documentation maintained as a part of the reporting
   agency’s weakness tracking system and shall be maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363 and
   disposed of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. The documentation
   must be sufficient enough for an independent reviewer to reach a similar conclusion. A
   material weakness cannot be closed until the verification is complete.
   3.7.3. When possible the audit follow-up process as required in AFI 65-403 may be used to
   track the planned corrective actions for each internal control weakness stemming from audit
   reports. Corrective action plans must be consistent with corrective action status reports in the
   audit follow-up process.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                      19

               INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

4.1. Overview. Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123, directs a robust process for assessing,
documenting, and reporting on the effectiveness of ICOFR. This is to include internal controls
over the Air Force’s annual financial statements and other significant internal or external
financial reports.
   4.1.1. The OUSD(C) requires a separate assurance statement from the Secretary of the Air
   Force on the effectiveness of ICOFR reporting as part of the SoA. This statement is based on
   the results of assessments and deliverables completed in accordance with the United States
   Air Force Implementation Guidance for OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A issued by
   SAF/FMP.
   4.1.2. The ICOFR effort is done in addition to the required efforts for all AUs under the
   MICP. SAF/FM centrally directs the overall Air Force ICOFR focus areas and deliverable
   response to OUSD(C). In order to meet these requirements, SAF/FM will task functional Air
   Staff and Major Command activities to perform work related to the processes detailed in this
   section. These tasks shall be considered part of the AU MICP responsibilities and given a
   high priority.
4.2. Reasonable Assurance. Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123 requires reasonable
assurance over financial reporting such that management can reasonably make the following
assertions:
   4.2.1. All reported transactions actually occurred during the reporting period and all assets
   and liabilities exist as of the reporting date (existence and occurrence);
   4.2.2. All assets, liabilities, and transactions that should be reported have been included and
   no unauthorized transactions or balances are included (completeness);
   4.2.3. All assets are legally owned by the agency and all liabilities are legal obligations of
   the agency (rights and obligations);
   4.2.4. All assets and liabilities have been properly valued, and where applicable, all costs
   have been properly allocated (valuation);
   4.2.5. The financial report is presented in the proper form and any required disclosures are
   present (presentation and disclosure);
   4.2.6. The transactions are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations (compliance);
   4.2.7. All assets have been safeguarded against fraud and abuse; and
   4.2.8. Documentation for internal control, all transactions, and other significant events is
   readily available for examination.
4.3. Internal Control Standards. Management is responsible for developing, documenting and
maintaining internal control activities over financial reporting that comply with the following
OMB and GAO standards:
   4.3.1. Control Environment: Understanding management’s attitude, awareness, and actions,
   clearly defined authority and responsibility, appropriate delegation of authority and
 20                                                             AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


   responsibility, integrity and ethical standards, commitment to competence, hierarchy for
   reporting, proper support for human capital hiring, training, advancing and disciplining.
   4.3.2. Risk Assessment: Identifying internal and external risks, taking into account previous
   audit findings, internal management reviews, noncompliance with laws, regulations and
   policies; then analyzing risk for potential effect and impact. Some significant events can
   affect risk, these include: complexity or magnitude of programs or new operations, extent of
   manual processes, related party transactions, decentralized versus centralized accounting,
   accounting estimates, new programs, personnel, technology, or amended laws, regulations or
   accounting standards.
   4.3.3. Control Activities: The policies, procedures, and mechanisms in place that ensure
   management’s directives are carried out, such as proper segregation of duties, physical
   control over assets, proper authorization, appropriate documentation and access to
   documentation, analytical review and analysis, and safeguarding information.
   4.3.4. Information and Communication: Includes obtaining an understanding of the financial
   systems, communicating the duties and responsibilities to personnel for proper handling of
   external information, planning for disaster recovery, and determining the type and
   sufficiency of reports produced.
   4.3.5. Monitoring: Management shall conduct periodic reviews to determine effectiveness of
   internal controls through self assessment by management, direct testing or evaluations from
   the IG, auditors, or other assessment organizations. The assessment will include obtaining an
   understanding of the major types of activities the agency uses to monitor internal control over
   financial reporting and how those activities are used to initiate corrective actions.
   4.3.6. The GAO Financial Audit Manual identifies three types of audit risk components:
      4.3.6.1. Inherent Risk – the original susceptibility to a potential hazard or material
      misstatement, assuming there are no related specific control activities.
      4.3.6.2. Control Risk – the risk that a hazard or misstatement will not be prevented or
      detected by the internal control.
      4.3.6.3. Combined Risk – also known as residual risk; the likelihood that a hazard or
      material misstatement would occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by
      the agency’s internal control.
4.4. ICOFR Assessment. OMB A-123 Appendix A prescribes a process for management to
assess internal control over financial reporting. The process includes:
   4.4.1. Establishing a high-level governance body such as a Senior Assessment Team (SAT).
   4.4.2. Evaluating internal control at the entity level which encompasses the 5 components of
   internal controls as outlined in detail in 4.3.
   4.4.3. Evaluating internal control at the process, transaction, or application levels.
   Management’s knowledge of daily operations, significant accounts or groups of accounts,
   major classes of transactions, understanding the financial reporting process, understanding
   control design, be able to identify controls not adequately designed, test controls and assess
   compliance to support management’s assertions.            By obtaining knowledge of the
   organization’s key processes by performing process risk assessments to financial assertions,
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                           21


   providing reasonable assurance of completeness, rights and obligations, valuation, existence
   and occurrence, presentation and disclosure, as well as compliance with laws and regulations;
   while safeguarding assets from fraud, waste, and abuse and identifying existing key controls
   intended to mitigate identified risk.
   4.4.4. Assessing and testing the design and operation of ICOFR, the assessment should
   conclude that internal controls are operating effectively and identify if a material weakness
   exists in the design or operation. Management shall assess ICOFR using a variety of
   information sources, including those specific to internal control reviews or as a by-product of
   other reviews, such as IG, GAO, and AFAA audit reports.
   4.4.5. Documenting the entire assessment process from the establishment of a SAT including
   key decisions, to the identification of deficiencies and development of corrective action
   plans. Documentation can be electronic or hard copy and shall be readily available for
   review. Documentation shall be maintained for weaknesses that are downgraded from a
   reportable condition to a deficiency in order to support management decisions.
   4.4.6. Issue a SoA of ICOFR as a subset of the Annual Statement of Assurance. The
   statement must take one of the following forms: unqualified, qualified, or statement of no
   assurance.
4.5. Materiality. Risk assessments under ICOFR must contain a risk analysis of all material
business processes that affect financial reporting with specific focus on those business events
that significantly increase or decrease financial statement balances. The Air Force’s planning
level of materiality is 0.99 percent of adjusted assets for Balance Sheet accounts and 0.99 percent
of total budgetary resources for Statement of Budgetary Resources accounts. Other factors such
as transaction volume, program visibility, or command directed focus areas may also be
considered in determining materiality.
4.6. Material Weaknesses. The criteria for a material weakness in ICOFR differs from that
described in paragraph 3.6. An ICOFR material weakness is a deficiency that adversely affects
the Air Force’s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data that
will result in more than a remote likelihood of a material misstatement of the financial
statements, or other significant financial reports, that do not prevent or detect a material
weakness. Corrective action milestones for ICOFR material weakness will be reported as part of
the Financial Improvement Plans (FIPs) maintained in the OUSD(C) Financial Improvement and
Audit Readiness (FIAR) tool.
   4.6.1. All Air Force AUMs may be responsible for corrective action of ICOFR material
   weaknesses impacting their organization or function, as the root causes of the weakness may
   not be limited to financial management. Corrective action of ICOFR material weaknesses
   must:
   4.6.2. Require prompt resolution of corrective actions,
   4.6.3. Provide for appointment of an overall corrective action accountable official from
   senior management, reporting to the SAT if applicable,
   4.6.4. Assure that performance appraisals of appropriate officials reflect effectiveness in
   resolving or implementing corrective action for the identified material weakness IAW the
   OMB Circular A-123, chapter V, Correcting Internal Control Deficiencies; AFI 36-1001,
22                                                            AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


  paragraph A3.2.3; and the GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1, Standards for Internal Controls -
  Management of Human Capital,
  4.6.5. Maintain accurate records on the status of the identified material weaknesses through
  the entire process of resolution and corrective action,
  4.6.6. Assure that the corrective action plans are consistent with laws, regulations, and
  administration policy. A determination that a material weakness has been corrected should
  be made only when sufficient corrective actions have been taken and the desired results
  achieved consistent with Paragraph 3.7.2. Along with testing of the applicable internal
  controls, resolution of an ICOFR material weakness may also require financial statement
  balance reconciliation and validation to ensure the controls are effective. This determination
  shall be made in writing and include supporting documentation available for review by the
  SAT.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                     23


                                           Chapter 5

                 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL SYSTEMS

5.1. Overview. It is the responsibility of all Air Force managers that develop, deploy or sustain
information systems, to effectively develop and maintain ICOFS. The Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMS) is the unified set of Air Force financial systems and financial
portions of mixed systems that encompass the hardware, software, personnel, processes,
procedures, controls and data necessary to carry out financial management functions and
operations. OUSD(C) requires a separate assurance statement from the Secretary of the Air Force
on the effectiveness of ICOFS as a subset of the annual SoA.
   5.1.1. The ICOFS effort is in addition to the required efforts for all AUs under the MICP.
   SAF/FM centrally directs the overall Air Force ICOFS response to OUSD(C). In order to
   meet these requirements, SAF/FM will task functional Secretariat, Air Staff and Major
   Command activities to perform work related to the processes detailed in this section. These
   tasks shall be considered part of the AU MICP responsibilities and given a high priority.
5.2. Internal Control Standards. Management shall ensure the effectiveness of security
controls over information resources that support Air Force operations and assets. The two broad
groups of information system controls are application controls that cover the processing of data
within the application software, and general controls that apply to all mainframe, minicomputer
and network systems, (core financial systems). These controls are interrelated; both are needed
to ensure complete and accurate information processing.
   5.2.1. Management shall ensure the controls are adequate and are proportionate with the risk.
   5.2.2. Management shall prepare a report on the effectiveness of the ICOFS.
   5.2.3. Management shall disclosed material weaknesses on the annual SoA and must include
   specific plans and schedules for corrective actions. Each material weakness corrective action
   plan will follow procedures as described in paragraph 3.6. and shall include a validation
   milestone which evaluates and certifies the effectiveness of the corrective action.
   5.2.4. The ICOFS SoA is based on the results of assessments completed in accordance with;
   the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), Public Law 104-208,
   Title VIII (31 U.S.C. 3512 note), OMB Circular A-123, OMB Circular A-127 Financial
   Management Systems, OMB Circular A-130 Management of Federal Information Resources,
   DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoDFMR) Volume 1, Chapter 3 and the GAO
   Standards for Internal Control.
5.3. Assessment. Management must ensure that proper controls, manual or automated, are in
place for the operation of the IFMS as well as the management of the system functionality as part
of the MICP. Key considerations when developing IFMS internal controls include, but are not
limited to:
   5.3.1. Management must have controls over information which is not directly transferred
   from the accounting system to the financial report, but requires intervening calculation,
   summarizations, etc.
 24                                                              AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


   5.3.2. Data transfers to core financial systems must be traceable to the transaction source and
   posted to the core financial system in accordance with the Federal Accounting Standards
   Advisory Board (FASAB), to include the United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL).
   5.3.3. Controls must be in place to ensure completeness, accuracy, authorization, and
   validity of all transactions during application processing.
   5.3.4. Data centers and client-server operation controls will include backup and recovery
   procedures, contingency and disaster recovery plans.
   5.3.5. Access security controls must be in place to prevent un-authorized internal and
   external access, such as identification and authentication, security configuration, physical
   access and system penetration.
   5.3.6. Management must consider system software internal controls including control over
   the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of all system software.
   5.3.7. Controls shall be established at an application’s interface to verify inputs and outputs.
5.4. Reliability. Substantial compliance with ICOFS is achieved when an agency’s financial
management systems routinely provide reliable and timely financial information for managing
day-to-day operations as well as produce reliable financial statements, maintain effective internal
control, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                      25


                                          Chapter 6

                               SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

6.1. Special Access Programs. Air Force Special Access Programs (SAP) are established and
maintained when it is necessary to protect the most sensitive capabilities, information,
technologies, and operations or when otherwise mandated by statute. The Air Force must
establish controls, infrastructure and processes to manage, execute and protect the SAPs. Key
roles and responsibilities for establishing a SAP are identified in the AFI 16-701 Oversight,
Management and Execution of Special Access Programs.
   6.1.1. PREs have overall responsibility for their SAP AUs and will report an unclassified
   level of assurance over the effectiveness of SAP internal controls in their annual SoA.
   6.1.2. Special Access Programs are required to align their MICP efforts to the extent
   possible to comply with the guidance outlined in this instruction.
   6.1.3. SAF/FMBIB is responsible for policy, oversight, program review/site visits, and
   training of all special program units/activities for MICP purposes.
   6.1.4. Each SAP AUM will provide a level of reasonable assurance over the effectiveness of
   internal controls in a supporting statement of assurance through their chain of command up to
   their PRE with a copy to SAF/FMBIB.
   6.1.5. Reporting and tracking of a material weakness will be reported directly to
   SAF/FMBIB upon original determination from the unit/program and command level. Further
   consideration and determination will be accomplished by SAF/FMBIB along with
   appropriate command, audit, and other SAP personnel deemed necessary. However, the
   process for corrective actions will remain similar in nature and comply with this guidance.
   Any questions or concerns on handling material weaknesses should be directed to
   SAF/FMBIB.
6.2. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Implications:
   6.2.1. The Department of the Air Force annual SoA may be made available, upon request, to
   the general public, except in the case of any Statement containing certain restricted
   information. The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act specifies that information in the
   following categories be deleted from the Statement before it is made available to the public:
       6.2.1.1. Information specifically prohibited from disclosure by any provision of law.
       6.2.1.2. Information specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the
       interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.
       6.2.1.3. All other requests for information about MICP, internal control evaluation
       results, supporting SoAs or other information developed through the internal control
       process are to be handled in accordance with procedures for release of information
       established by DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DOD Freedom of Information Act
       Program.
6.3. Host Tenant Relationships: Responsibilities of the MICP follow the chain of command.
26                                                        AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


  6.3.1. Tenant units on other MAJCOM bases must perform internal control evaluations at
  the direction of the tenant unit's parent command.
  6.3.2. The PA will make recommendations to the commander where functions overlap or
  where functional OPRs disagree over who has responsibility for a certain action.

Terms
Assessable Unit (AU)—The basic segment for which internal controls are evaluated. An AU is
a programmatic or organizational subdivision capable of being evaluated by internal control
assessment procedures. An AU shall be of an appropriate size to ensure the AUM has a
reasonable span of control over its internal controls.
Assessable Unit Administrator (AUA)—Administers the MICP within their AU.
Assessable Unit Manager (AUM)—The AUM is the principle manager or head of the
assessable unit with authority and responsibility over the internal controls of the assessable unit.
Combined Risk—also known as residual risk; the likelihood that a hazard or material
misstatement would occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the agency’s
internal control.
Control Risk—the risk that a hazard or misstatement will not be prevented or detected by an
internal control.
Functional OPR—Conduct and report on the internal control assessments for their section,
program, or function under an AU.
 30                                                              AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012


Inherent Risk—the original susceptibility to a potential hazard or material misstatement,
assuming there are no related specific control activities, such as human error.
Internal Control—The organization, policies, procedures, and instructions adopted by
management to reasonably ensure mission or operational objectives are met, and programs
achieve intended results, and to help managers safeguard the integrity of their programs. The
concept of internal control applies to all Air Force activities.
Internal Control Assessment—A documented review performed by an AU to determine
whether internal control techniques are effectively implemented to accomplish administrative,
operational, and mission objectives.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR)—Provides an explicit level of assurance
on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for each financial statement
reporting entity. The assurance shall be based on the results of management’s assessment
conducted according to the requirements of OMB Circular A-123 Appendix A and the ICOFR
guidance.
Internal Control over Financial Systems (ICOFS)—Provides an explicit level of assurance on
the effectiveness of internal controls over financial systems. The assurance shall be based on the
results of management’s assessment conducted in accordance with the requirements of OMB
Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems.
Internal Control over Nonfinancial Operations (ICONO)—Provides an explicit level of
assurance on the effectiveness of internal controls over non-financial reporting for each entity as
it pertains to the overall program, operational, and the administrative controls relevant to all
mission-essential functions. The assurance shall be based on the results of management’s
assessment conducted according to the requirements of OMB Circular A-123 and the GAO
Standards.
Managers’ Internal Control Program (MICP)—The formal effort of an organization to ensure
that internal control systems are working effectively through assignment of responsibilities at the
policy level, issuance and implementation of guidance, conduct of internal control assessments,
and reporting to senior management.
Management Control Plan (MCP)—A written plan that details the AU’s inventory and is
updated annually. The inventory will be maintained in the MCP and used to monitor progress
and ensure that planned actions are taken. It must include at a minimum: 1) number of AUs, 2)
title of each AU, 3) responsible AUM, 4) date of last MCP review 5) responsible AU
administrator, 6) status of AUM training,7) material weakness and reportable conditions, if
reported, 8) corrective action plan.
Material Weakness for ICOFR—A reportable condition or combination of conditions that
adversely affects the entity’s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external
financial data reliably and according to generally accepted accounting principles. The condition
creates more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entity’s financial statements, or
other significant financial reports, is more than inconsequential and will not be prevented or
detected.

not substantially in conformance with the Federal system requirements.
AFI65-201 30 JANUARY 2012                                                                     31


Material Weakness for ICONO—A reportable condition that the DoD Component Head deems
significant enough to report to a higher level. It is management’s judgment as to whether or not
a weakness is deemed material.
Primary Reporting Element (PRE)—All Major Commands (MAJCOM), the Air Force
Operational Test and Evaluation Center, United States Air Force Academy, Air Force District of
Washington, Air National Guard and Army Air Force Exchange Service are designated primary
reporting elements of the Air Force MICP. SAF/FM will report directly to the Secretary of the
Air Force (SECAF). Headquarters USAF, Resource Management (HAF/RM) serves as the PRE
for all Secretariat and Air Staff offices. The heads of these organizations are the Air Force’s
highest level Assessable Unit Managers (AUM) who directs the MICP within their
organizations.
Program Administrator (PA)—Form the MICP focal point network.                     The Program
Administrator prepares and maintains the PRE’s MCP.
Reasonable Assurance—An informed judgment, based upon an evaluation of all available
information that the organization's systems of internal control are operating in a manner that
achieves the objectives of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act.
Senior Assessment Team—A team of senior level executives to provide oversight of assessing
and documenting the effectiveness of internal controls and FMFIA ICOFR and ICOFS and
oversight and risk management for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act expenditures.
Statement of Assurance (SoA)—An annual assessment in prescribed format that provides
leader’s explicit level of assurance on whether the internal controls are effective. The SoA is a
self-assessment conducted for mission-essential functions relative to risk and identifies any
material weaknesses found.
Unqualified SoA—An unqualified SoA provides reasonable assurance that internal controls are
effective with no material weakness(es) reported or that the IFMS is in conformance with
Federal requirements. Each unqualified statement must provide a firm basis and evidence for that
position in the SoA.
Qualified SoA—Provides reasonable assurance that the internal controls are effective with the
exception of one or more material weakness(es) or the IFMS is not fully compliant with Federal
requirements reported. The material weakness in internal controls must be cited in the SoA that
precludes an unqualified statement.
No Assurance SoA—no assurance provides no reasonable assurance that internal controls are
effective because no assessments were conducted, the noted material weakness(es) are pervasive
across many key operations or the IFMS is substantially noncompliant with Federal
requirements.
GAO Standards for Internal Control—
Control Environment—The organizational structure and culture created by management and
employees to sustain organizational support for effective internal controls. When designing,
evaluating or modifying the organizational structure, management must clearly demonstrate its
commitment to competence in the workplace. Within the organizational structure, management
must clearly: define areas of authority and responsibility; appropriately delegate the authority
and responsibility throughout the organization; establish a suitable hierarchy for reporting;

support appropriate human capital policies for hiring, training, evaluating, counseling,
advancing, compensating, and disciplining personnel; and uphold the need for personnel to
possess and maintain the proper knowledge and skills to perform their assigned duties as well as
understand and be responsible for maintaining effective internal control within the organization.
Risk Assessment—Management should identify internal and external risks that may prevent the
organization from meeting its objectives. When identifying risks, management should take into
account relevant interactions within the organization as well as with outside organizations.
Management should also consider previous findings; e.g., auditor identified, internal
management reviews, or noncompliance with laws and regulations when identifying risks.
Identified risks should then be analyzed for their potential effect or impact on the organization.
Control Activities—Control activities include policies, procedures, and mechanisms in place to
help ensure that organizational objectives are met. Several examples include proper segregation
of duties; physical control over assets; reconciliation of actual and recorded inventory; access
restrictions to classified information; proper authorization; and appropriate documentation and
access to that documentation.
Information and Communication—Information should be communicated to relevant personnel
at all levels within an organization, in a form and within a timeframe that enables them to carry
out their responsibilities. The information should be relevant, reliable, and timely. It is also
crucial that an organization communicate with outside organizations as well, whether providing
information or receiving it. Examples include receiving updated guidance from central
organizations; management communicating requirements to the operational staff; and operational
staff communicating with the information systems staff to modify application software.
Monitoring—Monitoring the effectiveness of internal control should occur during the normal
course of business. In addition, periodic reviews, reconciliations or comparisons of data should
be included as part of the regular assigned duties of personnel. Periodic assessments should be
integrated as part of management’s continuous monitoring of internal control, which should be
ingrained in the agency’s operations. If an effective continuous monitoring program is in place,
it can provide the resources needed to maintain effective internal controls throughout the year.
Deficiencies found in internal control should be reported to the appropriate personnel and
management responsible for that area. Deficiencies identified whether through internal review
or by an external audit should be evaluated and corrected. A systemic process should be in place
for addressing deficiencies.
