                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose: This manual describes the procedures and actions for 14 AF and its subordinate
units to initiate voluntary or involuntary activation of assigned/attached Air Force Reserve
(AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) units and personnel. For the purposes of this handbook,
ARC refers to both the AFR and ANG.
1.2. Mobilization: Mobilization is the process by which the Armed Forces, or part of them, are
elevated to a state of readiness for war or other national emergency. The mobilization process of
preparing for war or other emergencies includes assembling and organizing personnel and
material for active duty military forces, activating the ARC including federalizing the National
Guard, extending terms of service, surging and mobilizing the industrial base, and bringing the
Armed Forces to a state of readiness for war or other national emergency. HAF/A1 is the OPR
for mobilization/activation funding for ARC support.
1.3. Activation: Activation is the generally the process of placing a volunteer ARC individual,
UTC, or unit on orders and in federal status (for ANG). Authority for activation of volunteers is
delegated in most cases to the MAJCOM and in some specific cases to the NAF commander.
The authority to activate at the NAF level must be delegated in writing from the SECAF to the
MAJCOM. If not, all requests to activate a unit must be coordinated up the chain as a Request
for Forces (RFF). Presently, the Secretary of the Air Force and AFSPC/CC has delegated
authority to order volunteer ANG members into federal service to the Numbered Air Forces
(NAFs).
     1.3.1. The AFSPC/Functional Area Manager (FAM) for operational requirements
     (AFSPC/A3) manages Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) mandays used to place ARC
     members on active duty in support of AFSPC missions via volunteer activation IAW Title-10
     USC, § 12301(d).
     1.3.2. MPA requirements are appropriated each Fiscal Year (FY) from AF/A1 to AFSPC
     based upon projected operational requirements submitted from the field. In support of this,
     prior to the end of each FY, 14 AF/A3 collects operational MPA manday requirements from
     its units and headquarters staff and submits a prioritized list of requirements to AFSPC for
     inclusion in MAJCOM and higher headquarters prioritization and approval process. Then, at
     the beginning of each FY, AFSPC delegates the AF/A1 approved MPA budget & associated
     operational mission requirements to 14 AF/A3 to manage and distribute internally. 14
     AF/DS and 14 AF/A4/6/7 manage the non-operational MPA budget apportioned to 14 AF.
     1.3.3. Travel, lodging and per-diem requirements for ARC members activated will be
     assumed by the gaining unit.
1.4. Volunteerism preferred. When practicable, volunteerism is the preferred option for
soliciting ARC support to satisfy manpower requirements.            Under volunteerism, the
AFSPC/FAM will utilize MPA mandays to place members on active duty orders IAW Title-10
USC, § 12301(d), as the MPA days are available. If mobilization authority is secured, volunteers
can be brought to active duty ahead of non-volunteers, consistent with manpower and mission
needs. No ARC member should be required to “volunteer”. Non-volunteers can be brought to
           14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013                                                                           5


           active duty through mobilization or limited activation authority consistent with law (e.g., non-
           volunteers can be activated to perform their annual training).
           1.5. Laws, Authorities and Levels of Mobilization: Title 10 of the United States Code (Title
           10 U.S.C.) contains the statutes governing manpower mobilization. Reference AFI 10-402,
           Volume 1, chapter 3 for a detailed description of levels of mobilization and legal authorities.
           1.6. Categories of Reservists: Reservists supporting the 14 AF mission, whether they are in the
           Air Force Reserves or the Air National Guard, are assigned to the Ready Reserves.
              1.6.1. The Ready Reserve: The primary manpower pool of the reserve components. The
              primary Ready Reserve sub-components affecting 14 AF ARC activation include the
              Selected Reserve and the Individual Ready Reserves (IRR).
              1.6.2. The Selected Reserve: Those units and individuals within the Ready Reserve
              designated as so essential to initial wartime missions that they have priority of all other
              Reserves. Generally required to perform one weekend of training each month (Inactive Duty
              for Training (IDT) or weekend drill) and two weeks of training each year (Annual Training
              (AT)) for which they receive pay and benefits. Members of the Selective Reserve can be
              involuntarily ordered to active duty under a Presidential Reserve Call Up, Partial
              Mobilization or a Full Mobilization. All National Guard units are considered to be part of
              the Selected Reserve.

           Table 1.1. ARC Activation Statutes, Authorities, Provisions and Uses
  1.6.3. The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR): IRR is a manpower pool of individuals who have already received
  military training, either in the Active Component or in the Selected Reserve. Members of the IRR can volunteer for
      training or active duty assignments, and they can also be involuntarily ordered to active duty under a Partial
                                Mobilization or a Full Mobilization.ACTIVATION STATUTES

                                           Chapter 2

                     ACTIONS TO ACTIVATE 14 AF ARC FORCES

2.1. Requirement Identification: USSTRATCOM has delegated operational control to
AFSPC/CC and tactical control to the CDR JFCC SPACE in order to exercise appropriate
command and control of assigned units necessary to meet its space mission requirements.
AFSPC exercises administrative command and control (ADCON) of assigned units to organize,
train, and equip units supporting the USSTRATCOM space missions of force enhancement,
space support, and space control and other missions as assigned.
2.2. Initiation of the Activation/Mobilization Process: As the gaining MAJCOM for
mobilized and/or activated space forces, AFSPC specifies the additional ARC manning
necessary to satisfy its force provider role to USSTRATCOM and other combatant commands.
In support of this task, AFSPC also monitors the readiness of ARC units that may be gained
during mobilization or activation through the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)
process to ensure they are sufficiently organized, trained and equipped, and specifies its
requirements to the appropriate AFRC and ANG counterparts, which exercise ADCON until
mobilization or activation has been effected.
   2.2.1. AFSPC/A1submits requests for MPA mandays to AF/A1 for approval. The AFSPC
   FAMs are responsible for orders allocations to fulfill activation or mobilization requests (ref
   Table 2.1. Assigned/Attached 14 AF (AFSTRAT) Air National Guard Units and HQ FAMs).
   The FAMs coordinates with AFSPC/A1 to determine the appropriate and available funding
   for activated or mobilized ARC personnel. MPAs mandays will be utilized to the maximum
   extent possible; however, in cases where involuntary mobilization is necessary and has been
   approved, AF/A1 is responsible for appropriating adequate funds to place ARC members on
   active duty for the duration of the mobilization. All orders will be loaded by the FAMs into
   the Command Manday Allocation System (CMAS) for each ARC member activated or
   mobilized. The ARC member or unit will initiate orders using the Air Force Reserve Order
   Writing System (AROWS).
   2.2.2. Upon mobilization or activation, AFSPC exercises shared ADCON of the assigned
   ARC units and members. 14 AF identifies the requirements for ARC augmentation,
   activation, or mobilization to support missions assigned to it by AFSPC or USSTRATCOM.
   Consistent with this, where mobilization/activation of specific ARC units has been identified
   in an OPLAN, the determination has been made. In such cases, the 14 AF will simply
   execute the appropriate steps to ensure that AFSPC/FAMs request and secure authorization
   to mobilize or activate the pre-identified unit/UTC.
   2.2.3. The following two critical pieces of information must be identified prior to requesting
   the activation of ARC forces: 1. Unit Type Codes (UTCs); 2. Duration of service required.
   UTCs are building blocks of capabilities that can be ordered to meet a warfighter
   requirement. They are comprised of personnel and/or equipment and are most commonly
   used in a deployment scenario. Because many of the ARC units supporting 14 AF are
   deployed in-place, UTCs are developed and approved to meet anticipated surge requirements
   for the missions they perform and/or augment.
 8                                                             14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013


     2.2.4. 14 AF/A3 is the OPR at the C-NAF for maintaining a complete list of
     activation/mobilization triggers IAW current OPLANS and SPACECON checklists. This
     information is maintained and is available in the CG/CR CAT binder that is maintained by 14
     AF/CG/CR. Activation triggers are events or stimuli that lead to the activation of a particular
     ARC unit. CR/CG will coordinate with the requesting organization the appropriate AFSPC
     Functional Area Manager (FAM), AFSPC/CG/CR staff and the unit/member to be activated
     to ensure all applicable logistics and administrative tasks are in work.
     2.2.5. 14 AF/A3 and as necessary JFCC-SPACE/J3, should be ready to send a mobilization
     or activation request message to HQ AFSPC/A1as soon as a trigger has been met.
     Accordingly, all mobilization and activation request messages should be pre-coordinated for
     approval through the 14 AF/CC or 14 AF/CV (as appropriate).
2.3. Tasking: Once requirements are determined from the supported OPLAN, or from critical
COCOM-identified need, 14 AF must task subordinate units to consider implications of ARC use
and identify ARC forces that must be activated/mobilized to meet these mission requirements.
This tasking will usually be conveyed to subordinate wings via memo or letter from 14 AF.
Units should review both in-place and deployment requirements to obtain total ARC manpower
requirements. An active duty component making a request for ARC activation must provide
justification to 14 AF/A5X describing why they cannot fulfill mission requirement from within
the active duty forces. Exceptions to this include a 14 AF gained ARC unit (e.g., 9 SOPS, 137
SWS, etc.) that operates a unique one-of-a-kind system requested to be employed or backed-up
by USSTRATCOM.
2.4. Deploy In-Place ARC: Deploy in-place requirements are those needed to perform
continuing missions at existing installations, or for surge requirements due to real world or
exercise contingencies, or for critical new system employment/training during stressed manning
periods. The in-place requirements may consist of a unit by UIC, or a UTC sourced from an
ARC unit, or it may consist of individual AFSCs from ARC units. The tasking may support a
surge workload beyond the capability of the normal peacetime manning of the Active Duty unit
and full-time ARC personnel, necessitating the activation/mobilization of traditional (part-time)
ARC forces. These requirements and the time in relation to D-day when they are needed to be
fully operational must be identified to 14 AF/A5X by requesting wings and units as soon as
possible, and then incorporated by 14 AF/A5X into any supporting plans (wing level).
2.5. Deployable ARC: 14 AF/A5X must review the supported TPFDD LOI and Annex N of
the supported OPLAN. These documents should identify any space systems that will deploy
upon execution of the OPLAN, or those systems requiring additional manpower support. Where
appropriate, the requesting unit should identify the space system function and capability required
to provide support and the ARC unit that operates the system. The request should include the
UIC, UTC, or AFSCs required, the number of personnel, and the time of activation or
mobilization in relationship to C-day, and specify the impact on operations if involuntary call-up
is delayed or denied. 14 AF/A5X should review the TPFDD LOI to ensure that any required
ARC mobilization guidance and taskings are fully understood. 14 AF/A5X must ensure that
required ARC personnel figures are summarized in the 14 AF Reserve Component Requirements
Summary Table (Appendix 5 to Annex A) and this is provided to JFCC SPACE and AFSPC
planners and AFSPC/A1.
14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013                                                                     9


2.6. Staffing & Coordination: The ARC forces that have been identified by unit, UTC, UIC,
and/or IMAs required to support a specific OPLAN should be provided by AFSPC/A5X to HQ
AFSPC for the development of a Reserve Component Force List for each tasked OPLAN. 14
AF also provides its total ARC requirements to JFCC SPACE to be combined with the ARC
requirements of the other services (Army, Navy, etc), to create JFCC SPACE’s ARC
Requirements Summary Table. This table becomes part of a supporting plan (usually Appendix
5 of Annex A) and provides a numerical basis for requesting specific legal authorities and levels
of mobilization. Once ARC requirements are ascertained and have been provided to HQ
AFSPC/A1, AFSPC/A1, if it concurs, notifies NGB/CF and ANG/A3/A5 of all ANG
requirements for each OPLAN or CONPLAN they support. In addition, the HQ AFSPC CAT
must notify the HQ AFRC CAT and the AFRC FGC of all identified AFRC unit and IMA
requirements for every OPLAN they support. In addition to notifying HQ AFRC/CAT, for IMA
requirements, HQ AFSPC should notify HQ Air Reserve Personnel Center/Directorate of
Personnel (ARPC/DP) of all IMA positions identified that are required to support each OPLAN
or CONPLAN in effect, and for any theater emergent requests.

                                          Chapter 3

                       GENERAL/SUPPORTING INFORMATION:

3.1. Roles and Responsibilities:
   3.1.1. Combatant Commanders: The combatant commanders develop OPLANs and
   Concept Summaries. As part of their operations planning responsibilities, they determine
   mobilization requirements and, based on additional planning guidance, incorporate
   information on specific force levels projected to be available into OPLANs and Operations
   Orders (OPORDs).
   3.1.2. Military Departments: The Military Departments prepare detailed mobilization
   plans identifying the actual forces and support to be provided and execute mobilization at the
   direction of the Secretary of Defense. They identify and request invocation of emergency
   authorities necessary to implement mobilization plans. They plan for the fill and sustainment
   of organized and/or structured units with all categories of personnel and equipment. Wartime
   manning must satisfy two concurrent major requirements: (1) combat units/UTCs to meet
   OPLAN force commitments, and (2) sustaining and supporting activities. The initial
   objectives of this planning are to identify the numbers and skills of personnel needed in
   wartime and to develop and validate wartime requirements and priorities. The Military
   Departments mobilize the ARC in crisis and war.
   3.1.3. Service Headquarters: The Service Headquarters advises the service component
   commanders, via service unique planning systems, of the resources available to support joint
   requirements. The Service Headquarters maintains the automated war planning system,
   unique to each Service, that provides the Service commanders current policies, planning
   factors, and JSCP apportioned forces for conducting and supporting wartime operations.
   Service headquarters may request activation authority from OSD and upon receipt of such
   authority delegate the authority to the MAJCOMs to activate the RCs.
   3.1.4. Major Commands: The major commands of the services are responsible for
   developing the Unit Type Codes (UTCs). The UTC is the common denominator in the
   communication of force date in automated data processing systems. The UTC is used to
   define force requirements in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES). It
   is used to identify and further describe units in the Status of Resources and Training System
   (SORTS). ARC units are mobilized by UTCs and UICs. IMAs are mobilized by AFSCs.
   3.1.5. MAJCOM Functional Area Manager: The MAJCOM/FAMs coordinate on
   requests for mobilization and may recommend disapproval if overall USAF manning is
   sufficient to address the manning shortfall proposed to be addressed by the mobilization.
   The FAM provides appropriate data entry into JOPES/DECAPES to begin the formal process
   of activation (assuming a mobilization is already approved). The FAM will also be critical
   for the activation of volunteer forces.
   3.1.6. Service Components: Service components to the combatant commands are
   responsible for developing supporting plans tasked by the combatant command to which they
   are apportioned or assigned in the JSCP. Each service component must identify its ARC
   requirements needed to support each plan. Each component must ensure that the ARC
14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013                                                                      19


   requirements of their subordinate units are rolled-up into the support plan submitted to the
   combatant commander. If ARC units are not specifically called for in the combatant
   commander’s OPLAN or Support Plan, the service component must make the determination
   what ARC requirements, if any, are needed to support the service component in the
   accomplishment of its mission. In the case of AFSPC, in-place units that are not be
   identified in any TPFDD perform the vast majority of taskings. The in-place units must be
   identified to HQ AFSPC in order to be tasked in HQ USAF War Mobilization Plan (WMP).
   If a USAF unit is not listed in the WMP, taskings will be difficult and mobilization of RC
   units will be delayed.
   3.1.7. 14th Air Force (Air Forces Strategic): 14 AF (AFSTRAT) must work in concert
   with JFCC SPACE to identify ARC requirements during the planning process. During a
   crisis scenario, 14 AF will initiate a request for activation which may result in a mobilization
   request to AFSPC for processing up the service chain. This same activation request may
   result in the activation of volunteer ARC members by HQ AFSPC.
3.2. Force Activation Options:
   3.2.1. Authority and Types of Activation: All authority to institute activation of ARC
   forces or active duty retirees stems from United States Code and Public Law. Generally, the
   nature and imminence of the emergency governs the level of response. Emergency actions
   are governed by congressional action, Executive Orders, federal regulations, departmental
   regulations and Service regulations derived from United States Code and Public Law.
   3.2.2. Selective Mobilization (10 USC § 331, 332, 333, and 12406): For a domestic
   emergency, the President (or Congress upon special action) may order expansion of the
   Active Armed Forces by mobilization of ARC units and/or individual reservists to deal with
   a situation where Armed Forces may be required to protect life, federal property and
   functions, or to prevent disruption of federal activities. A selected mobilization normally
   would not be associated with a requirement for contingency plans involving external threats
   to national security. The number of personnel involved is determined by the units selected
   for mobilization.
   3.2.3. Secretarial Ready Reserve Call-Up Authority: The Secretaries of the Military
   Departments have the authority to order ARC members to active duty with their consent,
   IAW 10 USC § 12301(d). Additionally, the Secretaries of the Military Departments may
   order any Reserve unit or individual in an active status to active duty involuntarily, IAW 10
   USC § 12301(b), for 15 days per year. Under the above sections of the law, the consent of
   the Governor of a State or territory is required prior to calling to AD ANG members;
   however, the consent of the governor may not be withheld (in part or in whole) with regard to
   active duty outside of the United States, its territories or possessions, because of any
   objections to the location, purpose, type, or schedule of such duty 10 USC § 12301(f). These
   authorities may be used to gain access to ARC units or members in the early stages of a
   crisis. If required beyond 15 days, members may be retained on active duty as volunteers
   under 10 USC § 12301(d) or subsumed within a subsequent call-up authority. IAW 10 USC
   § 12304(b), the Secretaries of the Military Departments have the authority to order to active
   duty, without the consent of the members concerned, up to 60,000 reserve component
   personnel (DoD wide) for preplanned missions in support of COCOMs for up to 365
   consecutive days. This statute is a standing activation/mobilization authority that does not
 20                                                           14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013


   require a Declaration of national Emergency or Presidential Call-up prior to use. Members
   ordered to active duty under this authority are not counted against active duty end-strength.
   3.2.4. Presidential Reserve Call-Up (10 USC § 12304): When the President determines
   that it is necessary to augment the active forces for any operational mission or that it is
   necessary to provide support for responses to certain emergencies, he may authorize the
   Secretary of Defense, without consent of the members concerned, to order any unit, and any
   member not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit of the Selected Reserve (as
   defined in section § 10143(a) of Title 10, USC), or any member in the Individual Ready
   Reserve mobilization category and designated as essential under regulations prescribed by
   the Secretary concerned, under their respective jurisdictions, to active duty (other than for
   training) for not more than 365 days. Not more than 200,000 members of the Selected
   Reserve and the Individual Ready Reserve may be on active duty under this section at any
   one time, of whom not more than 30,000 may be members of the Individual Ready Reserve.
   3.2.5. Partial Mobilization (10 USC § 12302): Upon declaration of a national emergency
   by the President or when otherwise authorized by law, an authority designated by the
   Secretary concerned may order an augmentation of the Active Armed Forces (short of full
   mobilization) and mobilization of the Ready Reserve (units and individuals) for up to 24
   consecutive months, without the consent of the ARC members. There is a limitation of
   1,000,000 total Ready Reserve members from all ARCs who can be forced into AD without
   their consent.
   3.2.6. Full Mobilization (10 USC § 12301): Requires passage by Congress of a Public Law
   or joint resolution declaring war or a national emergency. Provides authority to mobilize all
   ARC units and individual reservists in the existing force structure, and the material resources
   needed to support the expanded structure.
Note: That the call-up of ANG members requires the permission of the Governor concerned, but
that such permission cannot be withheld with regard to AD outside the US because of any
objections to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such AD.
All forces up to the strength of the approved force structure may be mobilized. This
mobilization authority is for the duration of the war or emergency and for 6 months thereafter.
   3.2.7. Total Mobilization (10 USC § 12301 and Additional Titles 10 and 50 Emergency
   Authorities): Involves expansion of the Active Armed Forces by organizing and/or
   activating additional units beyond the existing approved force structure and the mobilization
   of all additional resources needed, including civilian facilities to round out and sustain such
   forces. Strength levels beyond full mobilization are determined by the President and
   approved by Congress.
   3.2.8. Volunteerism: Volunteerism is the most common method of employing/activating
   ARC forces. Support ranges from a single IMA on a MPA tour to members of an ARC
   associate unit providing extended support to an active unit during a crisis. Operations
   conducted for training purposes, while supporting the active component, do not fall under
   volunteerism.

Terms
Air Reserve Component (ARC)—Includes the Air National Guard of the United States
(ANGUS) and the Air Force Reserve.
Alert Order (CJCS)—A crisis action planning directive from the Secretary of Defense, issued
by the Chairman, that provides essential guidance for planning and directs the initiation of
execution planning for the selected course of action authorized by the Secretary of Defense.
Allocation—The resources provided to the commander of a unified command by the NCA with
advice from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with other members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, for execution planning or actual execution.
Allotment—The temporary change of assignment of forces between subordinate commands.
The authority to allot is vested in the commander having combatant command (command
authority).
Apportioned Forces—The forces available for contingency planning; may be more or less than
those allocated for execution planning or actual execution.
Apportionment—The designation of forces and resources to a COCOM for contingency
planning.
Area of Responsibility (AOR)—The geographical area associated with a combatant command
within which a combatant commander has authority to plan and conduct operations. In naval
usage, a predefined area of enemy terrain for which supporting ships are responsible for covering
by fire on known targets or targets of opportunity and by observation. In the context of the
AFSPC ARC requirements summary table, include AFSPC ARC forces that are currently in or
plan to deploy to the AOR of the supported COCOM during execution of that COCOM’s
OPLAN/CONPLAN under the column labeled “ARC IN AOR.”
Assist/Mob/Deploy/Sustain (IMA)—In the context of the 14 AF ARC requirements summary
table, include all 14 AF (AFSTRAT) IMAs that are required to be mobilized to support the
OPLAN being developed.
Assist/Mob/Deploy/Sustain (OTHER)—In the context of the AFSTRAT requirements
summary table, include all 14 AF ARC forces that are not used as backfill, are not IMAs, are not
in the AOR, and do not directly assist the supported COCOM’s forces in their execution of an
OPLAN. These include any AFSTRAT ARC medical, dental, security forces, mobilization
processing site staffs, space maintenance, and maintenance support activity staffs.
Augmentation Forces—Forces to be transferred to the operational control of a supported
commander during the execution of an operation.
Backfill—ARC units and individuals recalled to replace deploying active units and/or
individuals in the continental United States and outside the continental United States.
Combat Forces—Those forces whose primary functions are to participate in combat. In the
traditional USAF sense, these forces consist of flying forces such as those contained in the USAF
War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 3, Part 1. For purposes of AFSPC forces and this
document, it consists of those forces performing space systems operations.
Combat Support (CS) Forces—Those forces whose primary functions are to directly support
combat operations. Includes strategic air, intra-theater airlift, air rescue, tankers, and other direct
 28                                                             14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013


sortie support functions. Also includes space systems maintenance, Security Forces (SF),
command and control systems, intelligence, aircrew protection, weather, and combat
communications.
Combat Service Support (CSS) Forces—Includes safety, communication electronics, fuels,
logistics, PME, maintenance management, supply, transportation and vehicle maintenance,
information management, communication/computer systems, civil engineers, historian,
commissary, MWR, public affairs, security police (law enforcement), printing, mission support,
manpower, visual information, medical, dental, legal, chaplain, contracting, financial, and special
investigation.
Commander’s Estimate—A logical process of reasoning by which a commander considers all
the circumstances affecting the military situation and arrives at a decision as to a course of action
to be taken to accomplish the mission. A commander’s estimate which considers a military
situation so far in the future as to require major assumptions is called a commander’s long-range
estimate of the situation.
CONPLAN—An operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
COCOM’s Strategic Concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary by the
COCOM to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are not calculated and
TPFDD files are not prepared. CONPLANs are considered transportation feasible when the
capability to move forces, equipment, and supplies exists from the point of origin to the final
destination according to the plan. Supporting COCOMs will provide an assessment on
movement of forces from point of origin to the POE.
Crisis Action Planning (CAP)—The JOPES process involving the time-sensitive development
of joint operation plans and orders in response to an imminent crisis. CAP follows prescribed
crisis action procedures to formulate and implement and effective response within the time frame
permitted by the crisis. The time-sensitive planning for the deployment, employment, and
sustainment of assigned and allocated forces and resources that occurs in response to a situation
that may result in actual military operations. Crisis action planners base their plan on the
circumstances that exist at the time planning occurs.
Course of Action (COA)—A plan that would accomplish or is related to the accomplishment of
a mission. The scheme adopted to accomplish a task or mission. It is a product of the JOPES
concept development phase. The supported commander will include a recommended course of
action in the commander’s estimate. The recommended course of action will include the concept
of operations, evaluation of supportability estimates of supporting organizations, and an
integrated time-phased database of combat, combat support, and combat service support forces
and sustainment. Refinement of this database will be contingent on the time available for course
of action development. When approved, the course of action becomes the basis for the
development of an operation plan or operation order.
Contingency Planning—The JOPES process involving the development of joint operation plans
for contingencies identified in joint strategic planning documents. Conducted principally in
peacetime, contingency planning is accomplished in prescribed cycles that complement other
Department of Defense planning cycles and in accordance with the formally established Joint
Strategic Planning System.
14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013                                                                    29


Execution Planning—The phase of the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System crisis
action planning process that provides for the translation of an approved course of action into an
executable plan of action through the preparation of a complete operation plan or order.
Execution planning is detailed planning for the commitment of specified forces and resources.
During crisis action planning, an approved operation plan or other NCA-approved course of
action is adjusted, refined, and translated into an operation order. Execution planning can
proceed on the basis of prior contingency planning, or it can take place in the absence of prior
planning.
Flexible Deterrent Options (FDO)—A planning construct intended to facilitate early decision
by laying out a wide range of interrelated response paths that begin with deterrent-oriented
options carefully tailored to send the right signal. An effective FDO response should capitalize,
whenever possible, on the synergy gained by combining the effects of military, diplomatic,
informational, and economic FDOs, which must be designed not to put US forces in needless
jeopardy if deterrence fails. Space deterrent measures can only be effective provided the
adversary has the means to detect and recognize escalating space support to the theater. Some
examples of military deterrent options include: begin moving forces to air and sea ports of
embarkation, upgrade alert status, activate the Reserve Components via a PRC, and exercise
WMD passive defense.
Forces for Unified Commands Memorandum—This document provides force assignment
direction in compliance with 10 USC 162 and 167 and reflects the peacetime disposition of
forces. It does not constitute wartime force apportionment for planning or force allocation at
execution. The tables in this memorandum represent force assignment guidance and where
appropriate, indicate the corresponding numbers of associated primary authorized equipment or
primary aircraft authorized. This document is classified SECRET.
Force List—A total list of forces required by an operation plan, including assigned forces,
augmentation forces, and other forces to be employed in support of the plan.
Full Mobilization—Requires passage by the Congress of a Public Law or Joint Resolution
declaring war or a national emergency. Provides authority to mobilize all reserve units and
individuals in the existing force structure and the material resources to support the expanded
structure.
Force Shortfall—A deficiency in the number or types of units available for planning within the
time required for performing an assigned task.
Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA)—An individual reservist attending drills who
receives training and is pre-assigned to an active component organization, a Selective Service
System, or a Federal Emergency Management Agency billet that must be filled on, or shortly
after, mobilization. IMAs train on a part-time basis with these organizations to prepare for
mobilization. Inactive duty training for IMAs is decided by component policy.
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)—A manpower pool consisting of individuals who have had
some training and who have served previously in the Active Component or in the Selected
Reserve and have some period of their military service obligation remaining. Members may
voluntarily participate in training for retirement points and promotion with or without pay.
Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES)—JOPES is the integrated joint
conventional and nuclear command and control system used to support military operation
 30                                                             14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013


planning, execution, and monitoring (including theater-level nuclear and chemical defense plans)
activities. JOPES incorporates policies, procedures, personnel, and facilities by interfacing with
ADP systems, reporting systems, and underlying Global Command and Control System (GCCS)
ADP support to provide senior-level decision makers and their staffs with enhanced capability to
plan and conduct joint military operations. JOPES policies, procedures, and ADP systems
provide the mechanisms to submit movement requirements to USTRANSCOM for joint
operations and exercises.
Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC)—Those headquarters commands, and
agencies involved in the training, preparation, movement, reception, employment support, and
sustainment of military forces assigned or committed to a theater of operations or objective area.
JPEC usually consists of the Joint Staff, Services, certain Service major commands (including
the Service wholesale logistics commands), unified and specified commands (and their Service
component commands), sub-unified commands, Transportation Component Commands, JTFs (as
applicable), Defense Logistics Agency, and other Defense agencies especially designated combat
support agencies (e.g., DIA, DISA, DLA, DTRA, NIMA, and NSA) as may be appropriate to a
given scenario.
Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP)—The JSCP basic document, CJCSI 3110.01, TOP
SECRET, provides strategic guidance, establishes requirements, and apportions resources to the
CINCs and Service Chiefs to accomplish tasks and missions based on near-term military
capabilities. There are thirteen supplements to the basic document. Beginning with CJCSI
3110.02 through CJCSI 3110.13 and one under development CJCSI 3110.15. These
supplements range in classification from UNCLASSIFIED through TOP SECRET.
Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS)—The primary means by which the CJCS, in
consultation with the other members of the JCS and the CINCs, carries out his statutory
responsibilities to assist the President and Secretary of Defense in providing strategic direction to
the Armed Forces; prepares strategic plans; prepares and reviews contingency plans; advises the
President and Secretary of Defense on requirements, programs, and budgets; and provides net
assessment on the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the United States and its allies as
compared with those of their potential adversaries.
Mobilization—The process whereby a nation makes the transition from a normal state of
peacetime preparedness to a warfighting posture. It involves the assembly, organization, and
application of the nation’s resources for national defense and it encompasses all activities
necessary to prepare systematically and selectively for war.
Mobilization Plans—These plans detail responsibilities and procedures for accomplishing
timely and effective mobilization. Programming data contained in the USAF WMP-3 and the
USAF program series documents will be used as a mobilization planning base.
National Security Council (NSC)—A governmental body specifically designed to assist the
President in integrating all spheres of national security policy. The President, Vice-President,
Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense are statutory members. The CJCS; Director, Central
Intelligence Agency; and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs serve as
advisers.
14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013                                                                     31


Notional Tasking—A procedure to facilitate planning among all the Services, commands, and
agencies whereby operation plan forces are expressed as standard type units as described in the
type unit data file disseminated by the Joint Staff; no specific units are identified.
Operation Order (OPORD)—A directive issued by a commander to subordinate commanders
for the purpose of effecting the coordinated execution of an operation.
Operation Plan—Any plan for the conduct of military operations. Plans are prepared by
combatant commanders in response to requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked
by the establishing combatant commander. Operation plans are prepared in either complete
format, as a concept plan (CONPLAN, with or without a TPFDD), or as a functional plan.
OPLAN—An operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for
development of an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to execute
the CINC’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the theater of
operations. The forces and supplies are identified in time-phased force deployment data files.
OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan will be prepared with the
appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as described in the JOPES manuals
containing planning policies, procedures, and formats. OPLANs are considered transportation
feasible when the capability to move forces, equipment, and supplies exists from the point of
origin to the final destination according to the plan. Supporting CINCs will provide an
assessment on movement of forces from point of origin to the POE.
Partial Mobilization—Required to meet a war or a national emergency. The Congress or the
President may augment the Active Armed Forces and mobilization of the Ready Reserve for up
to 24 months. There is a limitation of up to one million total Ready Reserve.
Planning Order (CJCS)—An order issued by the Chairman to initiate execution planning. The
planning order will normally follow a commander’s estimate and will normally take the place of
the CJCS ALERT ORDER. NCA approval of a selected COA is not required before issuing a
CJCS PLANNING ORDER.
Presidential Reserve Call—up (PRC)—Provision of Public Law Title 10 USC § 12304
provides the Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast
Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy) a means to order not more than 200,000
members of the Selected Reserve and certain Individual Ready Reserve members to active duty
for other than training without their consent for not more than 270 days when the President
determines it is necessary to augment any operational mission, without a declaration of a national
emergency.
a.—For regional conflicts, the PRC could be expected to augment the Active component to
satisfy specific force shortfalls (units and individual mobilization augmentees) relevant to the
contingency. It may be initiated before, concurrent with, or after the onset of hostilities.
b.—The PRC may be viewed as a precursor to partial mobilization and should be available
before unambiguous warning of a potential adversary attack. Forces available under this
authority can provide a tailored or operational response of limited scope or may be used as a
precursor to subsequent mobilization.
 32                                                            14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013


Reserve Components (RCs)—Reserve Components of the Armed Forces of the United States
are: (a) the Army National Guard of the United States; (b) the Army Reserve; (c) the Naval
Reserve; (d) the Marine Corps Reserve; (e) the Air National Guard of the United States; (f) the
Air Force Reserve; and (g) the Coast Guard Reserve.
Ready Reserve—The Selected Reserve, Individual Ready Reserve, and Inactive National Guard
liable for active duty as prescribed by law. (Title 10 USC § 10142, 12301, and 12302).
Secretarial Ready Reserve Call—up Authority—Public Law Title 10 USC § 12301 gives the
Secretaries of Military Departments and the Department of Homeland Security (for the Coast
Guard) the legal authority to order to active duty, without their consent, any unit or any member
not assigned to a unit in an active status in a Reserve component under the jurisdiction of that
Secretary for up to 15 days per year. Concurrence of the governors of states, or the
Commanding General, District of Columbia, is required to order members of the National Guard
to active duty under this authority. However, the Governor's consent cannot be withheld with
regard to service outside the U.S., its territories and possessions, because of any objection to the
location, purpose, type or schedule of such active duty.
Selected Reserve—Those units and individuals within the Ready Reserve designated by their
respective services and approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as so essential to initial wartime
missions that they have priority over all other Reserves. All Selected Reservists are in an active
status. The Selected Reserve also includes persons performing initial active duty training.
Time—Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD)—The computer supported database portion
of an operation plan, which contains time-phased force data, non-unit related cargo and
personnel data, and movement data for the operation plan. It includes identification of forces
(combat, combat support, and combat service support) origin, available dates, latest arrival dates
at PODs and final destinations. These records also contain movement requirements associated
with the unit, such as short tons and number of personnel. Non-unit records include cargo re-
supply (by Class of Supply) and personnel replacements. Detailed description of TPFDD format
can be found in CJCSM 3150.16 Joint Operation and Planning Execution System Reporting
Structure (JOPESREP), 15 Mar 96.
Total Mobilization—Expands the Active Armed Forces by organizing and/or activating
additional units beyond the existing approved force structure and the mobilization of all
additional resources, including civilian facilities to round out and sustain such forces.
Unified Command Plan (UCP)—The UCP establishes the missions, responsibilities, and force
structure for commanders of unified combatant commands and establishes their general
geographic areas of responsibility and functions. The President, in the UCP, identifies
SECDEF’s “Forces for Unified Commands Memorandum” as the instrument by which forces are
assigned for peacetime disposition. Under title 10, United States Code, section 161, requires the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review this document not less often than every 2 years
and recommend to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, any necessary changes. This
document is classified SECRET.
Unit Identification Code (UIC)—A 5-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies
each Active, Reserve, and National Guard unit of the Armed Forces.
Unit Type Code (UTC)—The UTC is the basic building block for determining detailed
manpower and logistics support requirements. It is the common denominator in the
14AFH10-301 2 JANUARY 2013                                                                    33


communication of force data in automated data processing systems. The UTC is a 5-character
alphanumeric code controlled by the Joint Staff. The assignment of a UTC categorizes each type
organization into a class or kind of unit having common distinguishing characteristics. The UTC
is used to define force requirements in the Joint Operations Planning and Execution System
(JOPES).      It is also used to identify manpower requirements in the Contingency
Operation/Mobility Planning and Execution System (COMPES). A UTC becomes standard
when it is registered into the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)
and entered into the Type Unit Characteristics (TUCHA) file with complete movement
characteristics. For more information on UTCs, see AFMAN 10-401V1.
Volunteerism—Allows the Secretary of the Air Force to place the Air Reserve Component
Selected Reserve on active duty. This authority is usually used as a bridge to expand Active
force capabilities while awaiting legal authority for PRC.
Warning Order (CJCS)—A preliminary notice of an order or action which is to follow. A
crisis action planning directive issued by the CJCS that initiates the development and evaluation
of Courses of Action (COA) by a supported commander and requests that a commander’s
estimate be submitted. A planning directive that describes the situation, allocates forces and
resources, establishes command relationships, provides other initial planning guidance, and
initiates subordinate unit mission planning.

1. (U) PURPOSE. This Appendix provides the Reserve Component (RC) Requirement
Summaries. The numbers of ARC personnel required to support this plan are used by
USSTRATCOM and the CJCS to specify the legal authority required to initiate the mobilization
of all ARC forces in support of this OPLAN.
2. ( ) GENERAL. This plan assumes that Guard and Reserve forces assigned, apportioned, and
committed to USSTRATCOM will have been recalled to active duty by Presidential Reserve
Call-up (PRC) (Title 10 USC § 12304), Partial-Mobilization (Title 10 USC § 12302), or a Full-
Mobilization (Title 10 USC § 12301 (a)) prior to commencing a National Command Authority
(NCA) directed execution of USSTRATCOM OPLAN 1234-01.
3. ( ) ARC REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY FOR A FLEXIBLE DETERRENT OPTION
(FDO) IN SUPPORT OF USSTRATCOM OPLAN XXXX-YY.
Recommend these Reserve Components (RCs) be mobilized via a PRC as an FDO for CDR
JFCC SPACE in support of USSTRATCOM OPLAN 1234. By mobilizing these RCs that
maintain and operate ______________, opponents can see the heightened state of alert of JFCC
SPACE forces and may act as a deterrent to escalating actions. Additionally, by activating these
deployable forces in an FDO, the 96-hour mobilization process of obtaining mobilization
authorization, issuing the activation order, and mustering the units at home station will give these
units the needed time to prepare for deployment.

A. ( ) Mission. In addition to the missions described above under the FDO, these additional
forces perform Command & Control of Space Systems to include performing launch and early
orbit analysis, satellite payload and bus operations, anomaly resolution, and end of life
operations for warning, surveillance, navigation, communications, and weather satellites.
Additionally, the IMAs and an AFRC unit perform Command & Control of space forces while
assigned to the Joint Space Operating Center (JSPOC).
B. ( ) Shortfalls. Since neither JFCC SPACE nor 14 AF (AFSTRAT) have their own TPFDD,
the deployment process for 14 AF (AFSTRAT) forces is quite complex. Coordination must be
far enough in advance among USSTRATCOM, USTRANSCOM, the supported COCOM, 14 AF
(AFSTRAT) staff, and the unit to make this deployment work. There are several shortfalls that
exist with USxxxXXXX’s OPLAN XXXX TPFDD ######. They are …
