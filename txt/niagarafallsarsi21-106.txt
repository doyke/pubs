1. Responsibilities. The Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Superintendents, in
conjunction with the Base Fire Chief and Wing Safety Officer, is specifically responsible for
ensuring strict compliance with the procedures herein. All Aircraft maintenance supervisors and
the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) or Command Post (CP) supervisor ensure personnel
receive briefings and comply with the procedures outlined in this instruction.
2. Procedures. Follow the procedures listed below during a suspected or actual hot brake
situation:
     2.1. Aircrew discovered hot brake conditions
        2.1.1. Aircrew will immediately notify CP and Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station (ARS)
        Control Tower of a hot brake condition. Hot brake conditions frequently occur due to
        high speed abort, brake malfunction, or landing requiring heavy braking. When Niagara
        Tower is closed, Airfield Management will be contacted on CP frequency and will notify
        the 914th Fire Emergency Services via the secondary crash net. The Senior Fire
        Department Officer (SFO) will notify the Buffalo Control Tower when the incident is
        terminated.
        2.1.2. The CP/MOC will immediately notify the following agencies: Airfield Security
        Forces, Fire Emergency Services, 914th/107th Supervisor of Flying, 914th Wing Safety
        and the MOC.
        2.1.3. MOC personnel will run the emergency action checklist.
        2.1.4. Aircrew will stop the aircraft on the hammerhead/taxiway clear of the runway,
        shut down, deplane and chock the nose wheels, using aircraft chocks. The aircrew then
        evacuates the area by moving forward from the main crew entrance to avoid main wheels
        for a distance of at least 300 feet. Note: DO NOT SET THE PARKING BRAKE.
     2.2. Maintenance ground crew discovered hot brake conditions:
        2.2.1. Maintenance ground crew will immediately notify the aircrew and other
        maintenance personnel of the condition. The aircraft will be shut down and chocks
        installed at the nose wheels, using aircraft chocks. All personnel will evacuate the area
        by moving forward from the main crew entrance to avoid main wheels for a distance of at
        least 300 feet.
        2.2.2. Flight line expediter will immediately notify the MOC.
Note: For ground crew discovered hot brake conditions the MOC will also notify CP. The CP
will notify the Niagara Falls IAP Control Tower to run the Primary Crash Net and inform all
required response sections.
     2.3. Upon declaration of a “Hot Brake Emergency", Fire Department personnel and Security
     Forces or DOD Police are responsible for the following:
        2.3.1. Fire Department personnel will respond to the scene and direct any necessary fire
        fighting or rescue operation. If no fire is present, upon consultation with the Senior
        Aircraft Maintenance supervisor, the SFO makes the determination to remain in an
        emergency (full alert) status or terminate. Upon termination of the emergency, the SFO
        releases the aircraft back to maintenance personnel. The SFO will notify the Niagara
        Falls control tower when the incident is terminated.
