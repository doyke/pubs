                                                Chapter 1

                        APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Authority. (DoD Financial Management Instruction (DoDFMR), Volume 9, Chapter 1.) This
instruction prescribes supplemental procedures for processing travel orders and claims for the Air Force
as authorized in the DoDFMR, Volume 9, Chapter 1. Information in this part should not be construed as
modifying the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) for uniformed personnel, the Joint Travel Regula-
tions (JTR) for civilian employees, and the DoDFMR, Volume 9 that controls under all circumstances.
Travel reengineering sites must use JFTR/JTR, Appendix O to determine travelers’ entitlements. The
JFTR/JTR are available at: http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/trvlregs.html
The DoDFMR is available at: http://www.dtic.mil/comptroller/fmr. See AFI 65-601, Volume 1 and
AFMAN 65-604 for additional information on travel policies and coding structure.

1.2. Applicability. The provisions of this instruction:
   1.2.1. Are mandatory for all Air Force activities performing base-level accounting and finance travel
   type functions. Deviations are not authorized without approval from the Air Force Accounting and
   Finance Office (AFAFO). Prior to a command issuing a supplement to this instruction, it must be for-
   warded to AFAFO/FMF, 6760 East Irvington Place, Denver, CO 80279-8000, for coordination. Upon
   release of the command supplement a finalized copy must be forwarded to AFAFO.
   1.2.2. Apply to:
       1.2.2.1. Travel payments made from appropriated funds, including the industrial fund, regard-
       less of whether or not the payments are made in dollars or foreign currency.
       1.2.2.2. Air Force activities and individuals authorized to prepare certificate vouchers, statements,
       orders, or papers in support of travel transactions.

1.3. Change Suggestions. Suggestions for improvement, addition, or revision are solicited. Send sug-
gestions through major commands (MAJCOMs) to AFAFO/FMF for evaluation and appropriate action.
Send requests for technical assistance, including interpretations of this instruction, through MAJCOMs to
AFAFO/FMF. Requests submitted should include appropriate documentation and recommended solu-
tions.

                                                  Chapter 2

                        ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL PROCEDURES

2.1. General. (JFTR, par. U2100 and JTR, par. C3054-B). The legal rights to and liabilities of allow-
ances are established when the travel expenses are incurred under orders. Such orders may not be revised
or modified retroactively so as to increase or decrease the rights and benefits, which have been fixed
under the applicable statutes or instructions. A clerical correction in the form of an amendment may be
made after the effective date of the orders only when an error is obvious on the face of the order and all
facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that some provision previously determined and definitely
intended has been omitted through error in preparing the orders (54 Comp Gen. 638 (1975)).

2.2. Competent Travel Orders Required for Payment. (JFTR, par. U2115, JTR, par. C3050, and
DoDFMR Volume 9, Chapter 5). The following are acceptable orders for payment:
     2.2.1. True or properly certified travel order copies. (Ensure both sides are copied).
     2.2.2. Extract order copies to include messages, which contain all pertinent information.
     2.2.3. Legible order copies reproduced by copying machines. Do not withhold payment of a claim
     solely because a travel order cites an incorrect accounting classification (centrally managed or spe-
     cific allotment). Instead, state the correct accounting classification on the voucher and adjust the erro-
     neous obligation accordingly. Refer to the DoDFMR Volume 9, 050307B for supporting
     documentation to change another accountable station’s accounting classification.
     2.2.4. Facsimile order copies can be sent for certification. Once certified, the returned copy is treated
     as the original.
     2.2.5. An electronic order signed with an electronic signature block.

2.3. Classified Travel Orders. For specific requirements for travel under classified orders, see par.
11-11.

2.4. Order Effectiveness. (JFTR, par. U2140 and JTR, Chapter 3) Temporary Duty (TDY) orders
remain in effect if:
     2.4.1. A traveler traveling under blanket or repeated TDY orders returns from a mission to the perma-
     nent duty station (PDS).
     2.4.2. A traveler is required to return to the PDS for TDY requirements (field trips with courses of
     instruction) or transportation reasons (weather, fuel, mechanical delay, or procurement) and the order
     contemplates continued TDY.
     2.4.3. A traveler returns to the PDS including home (from which the traveler usually commutes to the
     PDS) for personal reasons during a TDY period.
NOTE: No allowances are credited for any day the traveler was in a leave status for the whole day
(JFTR, par. U4102-B and JTR, par. C4563-C1).
     2.4.4. Before completing TDY, additional TDY orders are published directing travel to another loca-
     tion, which may include the traveler’s PDS. The additional TDY orders merely suspend executing the
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                             13


  original orders. After completing the additional TDY, the traveler again comes under the provisions
  of the initial order.
  2.4.5. FSO's may use a statement from the order-issuing official instead of an amended order to effect
  proper payment when the traveler:
     2.4.5.1. Adds or omits travel to places stated in the order
     2.4.5.2. Changes the order of continuity of places shown, or
     2.4.5.3. Changes the original specified time duration at a place stated in the order, provided the
     change is within total time limits. No amendment or statement is required for the changes in
     2.4.5.1. through 2.4.5.3. if itinerary variations are authorized.
14                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


                                                Chapter 3

          TRANSPORTATION AND ACCOMPANIED BAGGAGE ALLOWANCES AND
                         LOCAL TRAVEL ALLOWANCES

3.1. General. Guidance on the use and procurement of transportation is a traffic management office
(TMO) responsibility. For information regarding the movement of personnel, contact the TMO. (DoD-
FMR Volume 9, DoDD 4500.9 and DoDI 4500.42, Part I; JFTR, Chapter 3; JTR, Chapter 2; and AFI
24-101).

3.2. Use of (Contracted) Commercial Travel Offices. In arranging official travel, traveler must use the
following, if available, in accordance with DoDD 4500.9 Transportation and Traffic Management, DoDI
4500.42 DoD Passenger Transportation Reservation and Ticketing Services, JFTR, par. U3120 and JTR,
par. C2207:
     3.2.1. (Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (CTO).
     3.2.2. In-house Travel Office.
     3.2.3. General Services Administration (GSA) Travel Management Center (TMC).
        3.2.3.1. Government-wide Policy for CTO Use. It is the policy of the Uniformed Services that
        travelers use CTOs, when available, to arrange official travel except when authorized in accor-
        dance with JFTR, par. U3110 and JTR, par. C2207. The CTO is considered available in virtually
        all circumstances. The traveler or those arranging travel must make every attempt to contact the
        CTO to arrange official travel to include utilizing the toll free number, contacting the command
        post, etc., if outside normal operating hours.
            3.2.3.1.1. CTO Availability. When a CTO is available and arrangements are made through a
            non-contract travel agent or common carrier direct purchase, reimbursement is limited to the
            amount the government would have paid if arrangement had been made through a CTO. This
            does not imply that non-CTO use is acceptable, and travelers may be subject to disciplinary
            action for failing to comply with orders and DoD policy.
NOTE: Finance Service Offices, Transportation Management Offices, order-issuing officials, command-
ers, etc., should NOT promote non-CTO use for official travel. This violates our Service contract with the
CTOs. Travelers must comply with the Fly America Act, see par. 3.4. Tickets purchased directly from
a non-contract travel agent or common carrier are not reimbursable when the trip is cancelled. Use of unit
funds is not authorized to reimburse travelers under these circumstances. Fees may be claimed for
re-ticketing along with the self-procured airfare purchases. The total cost of airfare and associated fees is
limited to what the government would have paid if proper procedures had been followed.
            3.2.3.1.2. CTO Non-Availability. The rare circumstances that the CTO is not available, the
            order-issuing official must certify that a CTO was/is not available to arrange transportation.
            Reimbursement is paid for the actual cost of the authorized or approved transportation not to
            exceed (NTE) the least expensive unrestricted commercial coach fare that meets mission
            requirements. Note: City-Pair airfares may not be available, since the CTO is not available.

3.3. Directed Transportation Mode. (JFTR, par. U3002-B or JTR, par. C2206).
     3.3.1. Reimbursement Examples:
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                     15


        3.3.1.1. Member performs transoceanic travel on a PCS. (JFTR, par. U5108). Member person-
        ally procures air transportation for their transoceanic travel. Member is not reimbursed for this
        travel.
        3.3.1.2. Member with authorized dependents personally procures air transportation for the trans-
        oceanic travel on a PCS. Member is not reimbursed for this travel; however, the dependents are
        limited to what it would have cost the government to procure the transportation.
        3.3.1.3. Traveler is directed to utilize government-procured transportation for TDY travel. Trav-
        eler procures his or her own ticket (non-CTO) or utilizes a POC to perform the travel. Reimburse-
        ment to the traveler is limited to what it would have cost the government to procure the official
        transportation.
        3.3.1.4. Traveler is directed to utilize a government owned vehicle (GOV) as a passenger for TDY
        travel. Traveler utilizes a POC to perform the travel. Traveler is not reimbursed since there is no
        additional cost associated with the GOV (JFTR, par. U3002-B and JTR, pars. C2001-A3d and
        C4651-D2).
        3.3.1.5. Traveler is directed to utilize Military Air (MILAIR) for TDY travel. If traveler procures
        transportation, reimbursement is limited to the government cost for MILAIR travel (JFTR, par.
        U3002-B and JTR, par. C2206-B and E).

3.4. U.S. Flag Air Carrier (Certificated Air Carrier) Use. ( J F T R , p a r. U 3 1 2 5 - C , o r J T R , p a r.
C2204-B).

3.5. Terminal Travel. (JFTR, par. U3320 and JTR, par. C4657). If the traveler is a passenger in a POC
owned/operated by a person not entitled to terminal travel reimbursement for that particular trip, the pas-
senger is entitled to claim terminal mileage as owner/operator if he or she incurred operating expenses.
When the traveler pays the parking fee at the terminal he or she may be reimbursed for such fee whether
or not mileage is claimed for travel to and from such terminal (JFTR, par. U3320-B or JTR, par. C4657-B
for parking limitations). For servicing OCONUS terminals see Attachment 2.
    3.5.1. Roundtrip Expenses Incurred for Drop-off or Pick-up at a Common Carrier Terminal. (JFTR,
    par. U3320-A or JTR, par. C4657-A). When a POC is driven round-trip to drop-off or pick-up a trav-
    eler at a common carrier terminal, the traveler shall be paid mileage for the round trip distance and
    reimbursed parking fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls for the most direct route.
    3.5.2. Expenses Incurred for Two One-Way Trips to and from a Common Carrier Terminal. (JFTR,
    par. U3320-B and JTR, par. C4657-B). When a POC is used for one-way travel from a residence or
    duty station to a common carrier terminal and then from the terminal to a residence or duty station
    when the TDY is completed, a traveler shall be paid mileage and reimbursed for parking fees, ferry
    fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls for the most direct route.
    3.5.3. Traveler Departs from PDS on TDY. (JFTR, par. U3320-C and JTR, par. C4657-C). When a
    POC is driven from a traveler’s residence to the PDS on the day the traveler departs from the PDS on
    TDY requiring at least one night's lodging, and from the PDS to the residence on the day the traveler
    returns, the traveler who paid the expenses of operating the POC shall be paid mileage plus parking
    fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls for the most direct route.
    3.5.4. Two or More Travelers Travel in Same POC. (JFTR, par. U3320-D and JTR, par. C4657-D).
    When a traveler transports other travelers to or from the same carrier terminal, mileage is authorized
16                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     for the additional distance involved supported by a total distance or odometer readings certified as
     correct by the traveler. Only one traveler may be paid mileage for the same trip. A traveler who pays
     a parking fee at the terminal may be reimbursed.

3.6. Reimbursement for the Cost of Damages to Commercial Rental Vehicles. (DoDFMR, Vol. 9,
Chapter 4).

3.7. Local Travel: (JFTR, pars. U3500 and U3505 and JTR, pars. C2400 and C2401).
     3.7.1. If the order-issuing official determines that a POC is authorized for local travel in and around
     the PDS, the traveler shall be paid mileage for the distance that exceeds the traveler’s normal commut-
     ing distance. Note: Designated-approving officials may not approve their own voucher(s) for pay-
     ment.
     3.7.2. Local Area Definition. FSO’s must ensure that local directives clearly define the local area in
     which transportation expenses may be authorized or approved for conducting official business (JFTR,
     par. U3500-B and JTR, par. C2400-B). When two or more installations are in proximity of each other,
     the senior commander or senior service commander should determine the local area. Note: An arbi-
     trary mileage radius should not be established in setting up the local commuting areas of permanent
     and temporary duty stations. (59 Comp. Gen. 397 (1980))
     3.7.3. Lodging in the Local Area. (JFTR, pars. U4102-D, U4102-E, and U4105-H). There is no
     authority to pay per diem for travel or TDY within the PDS limits unless the TDY meets the criteria
     of U4105-H. Note: Allowances under this paragraph are authorized when such duty is performed
     under emergency circumstances that threaten injury to human life or damage to property of the Fed-
     eral Government, provided overnight accommodations are used by reason of such duty. When travel-
     ers perform TDY in the local area but outside the PDS limits and require quarters, travel orders are
     necessary to support payment of the claim. See JTR, par. C4552-D for civilian employees.

3.8. Excess Baggage. (JFTR, par. U3015 and JTR, par. C2302). Travelers directed to perform a TDY
can be authorized/approved excess baggage. This authority allows travelers to transport their excess bag-
gage one of two ways:
     3.8.1. Hand carry the excess baggage with them on the designated flight; or
     3.8.2. Ship the excess baggage to their temporary duty station and/or permanent duty station. The
     postal system must be utilized for shipment of excess baggage. Travelers who decide to ship (mail)
     excess baggage are required to retain and provide a copy of the receipt from the post office (regardless
     of amount). The receipt must include the weight of the excess baggage being certified. Mailing
     charges are claimed on the settlement voucher and the receipt must accompany the claim.

3.9. Service Charges for Cancelled Airline Reservations or Tickets. Airlines may assess surcharges
for cancelled airline reservations or tickets. The following procedures are used to defray or reimburse
these surcharges as the situation may require:
     3.9.1. Traveler purchases ticket after orders are published; military or government procured transpor-
     tation becomes available and is used. Reimburse surcharge under JFTR, par. U4520 or JTR, par.
     C4709 on the settlement voucher.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 17


  3.9.2. Traveler purchases ticket, uses it for a leg of the journey and another mode to complete travel.
  Reimburse the surcharge on the settlement voucher according to JFTR, par. U4520 or JTR, par. C4709
  provided the change in travel was driven by circumstances beyond the traveler's control.
  3.9.3. Traveler purchases ticket after orders are published, then trip is cancelled before effective date.
  Reimburse surcharge on SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business,
  and attach a copy of the original order along with rescinding amendment under JFTR, par. U4539 or
  JTR, par. C4710.
18                                                                           AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


                                                  Chapter 4

                                     TEMPORARY DUTY TRAVEL

4.1. Travel of Aircrew Members (Military Members Only). (JFTR, par. U2200-C, Table U2c and par.
U7100). Members of an organization, whose regularly assigned duty consists of performing flights from
a PDS to other point(s) and return, are considered to be performing their regularly assigned duties. These
members are entitled to per diem allowances while away from the PDS. However, there is no authority
for reimbursement for travel expenses between home and place of abode and the place (office) where they
report for their regular duties at the PDS. To readily identify aircrew members, the abbreviation “ACRW”
is to be entered on the Flight Authorization or DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel
for DoD Personnel. An aircrew member is away from the PDS when the aircraft departs (wheels up) until
the aircraft returns (wheels down). These provisions do not apply to Reserve Component aircrew mem-
bers for travel upon call to and relief from active duty. Aircrew status for Reserve Component members
only applies after the member arrives at the active duty location and terminates when the member departs
incident to relief from active duty.

4.2. Per Diem Entitlement for TDY with or without a Fixed-Starting Date. (JFTR, par. U4100, JTR,
par. C4552 and DoDFMR, Vol. 9).
     4.2.1. Policy on Per Diem Payment. It is Air Force policy that travelers should not be paid per diem
     incident to reporting at a TDY station earlier than the date specified in orders or the date required to
     perform duty unless:
        4.2.1.1. Earlier reporting is necessary because of transportation schedule variations;
        4.2.1.2. The duty may be performed at any time as differentiated from a fixed period; or
        4.2.1.3. The order-issuing official determines that early reporting is or was in the government’s
        best interest, or has been caused by conditions beyond the traveler’s control.
     4.2.2. Per Diem for Travel Time:
        4.2.2.1. TDY Having a Fixed Starting Date. From the order, establish the required reporting date.
        Use this required reporting date for constructed travel time computation. Use a schedule that
        would permit reporting at, or as close as possible before, the required reporting date. General
        rules for determining required reporting date:
            4.2.2.1.1. If the order does not contain specific reporting instructions, establish required
            reporting time as though the order directed reporting on the day before the TDY (class, train-
            ing course, etc.) start date.
        4.2.2.2. TDY Not Having a Fixed Starting Date. Normally, orders for this type of TDY contain
        an on-or-about departure date from the PDS. The absence of a specific reporting date usually indi-
        cates that accomplishment of the mission is not tied to a definite date or period. Unless informa-
        tion concerning duty requirements indicates otherwise, accept the actual arrival date at the TDY
        station as the required reporting date. If the actual arrival date is not acceptable (for example, it is
        known to be earlier than necessary), establish a required reporting date based on available infor-
        mation. Use schedules, including Air Mobility Command (AMC) schedules when appropriate,
        that would permit reporting at, or as close as possible before, the required reporting date.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                   19


   4.2.3. Continuous TDY Periods. If a traveler performs two or more consecutive TDY periods
   (school, training courses, POE/POD travel, etc.) and through no fault of the traveler, there is an inter-
   val between the ending of one period and the starting of the next, per diem is payable for the period the
   traveler remains at the first TDY location or after arrival at the next TDY location, to include official
   travel time between locations.

4.3. Constructed Travel:
   4.3.1. Travel by POC Authorized as Advantageous to the Government. (JFTR, par. U3305 and JTR,
   par. C4661-A).
      4.3.1.1. The constructed arrival date at the TDY location is the day before the first day of duty.
      4.3.1.2. The constructed time and departure date from the TDY location when returning to the
      PDS is 0600 hrs the day following the last day of duty. (See Figure 4.1.)
      4.3.1.3. Constructed schedules should not include travel between 2400 and 0600.
   4.3.2. Travel by POC Not Advantageous (Traveler’s Convenience). (JFTR, par. U3310 and JTR, par.
   C4661-B). Cost of government transportation includes:
      4.3.2.1. Transportation Request (TR) cost(s) as shown in the TDY order or as quoted by the local
      CTO;
      4.3.2.2. Constructed transportation costs to and from the local servicing terminals (PDS and
      TDY);
      4.3.2.3. Constructed cost (obtained from TMO) to ship excess baggage authorized in the order
      and verified with the traveler that the baggage was transported in the POC; and
      4.3.2.4. Constructed per diem for travel via the TR as determined by par. 4.3.4. Compare the trav-
      eler’s actual travel and transportation allowances consistent with the cost of the government pro-
      cured transportation. Pay the lesser of actual or constructed cost (Figure 4.2.). For TDY travel,
      TR cost is based on city-pair fares, where applicable, otherwise, lowest unrestricted coach fares
      obtained by contacting TMO.
   4.3.3. Passengers in POCs:
      4.3.3.1. Advantageous to the Government. Mileage allowance is not payable. Per diem is paid
      for travel as actually performed per JFTR, par. U3305 and JTR, par. C4661.
      4.3.3.2. Not Advantageous to the Government. Mileage allowance is not payable. Per diem is
      paid for actual travel time or constructed schedule computed in par. 4.3.4., whichever results in the
      lesser amount.
   4.3.4. All Other Modes. (JFTR, pars. U4325 and U4340 and JTR, pars. C2207 and C4661-C). In
   determining a constructed schedule, (see Figure 4.2. and Figure 4.3.), use the following steps:
      4.3.4.1. To a TDY Location:
          4.3.4.1.1. Establish the authorized reporting date according to par. 4.2. of this instruction.
          4.3.4.1.2. Determine required transportation mode(s), i.e., either/or a combination of air, rail,
          or bus.
20                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


            4.3.4.1.3. Use a schedule that allows arrival before or on the authorized reporting date (estab-
            lished in par. 4.3.4.1.1. above) from:
                4.3.4.1.3.1. Air--Transportation Management Office (TMO)/CTO.
                4.3.4.1.3.2. Rail--TMO/CTO.
                4.3.4.1.3.3. Bus--Local bus schedule.
            4.3.4.1.4. Always allow adequate travel time for the traveler to arrive at the carrier terminal
            two hours before scheduled departure on domestic flights, three hours for international flights,
            and to travel from the carrier terminal to place of duty. Note: Additional time authorized
            when local conditions warrant.
            4.3.4.1.5. Do not begin or end a constructed schedule, including terminal travel, between
            2400-0600 hours unless that is the only schedule available to meet the required reporting date/
            time.
        4.3.4.2. From a TDY location to the PDS:
            4.3.4.2.1. Establish departure day after the last duty day.
            4.3.4.2.2. Determine required transportation mode(s), i.e., either/or a combination of air, rail,
            or bus.
            4.3.4.2.3. Use a schedule that allows departure on the authorized departure date (established
            in par. 4.3.4.2.1. above) from:
                4.3.4.2.3.1. Air--TMO/CTO.
                4.3.4.2.3.2. Rail--TMO/CTO.
                4.3.4.2.3.3. Bus--Local bus schedule.
            4.3.4.2.4. Always allow adequate travel time for the traveler to arrive at the carrier terminal
            two hours before scheduled departure on domestic flights, three hours on international flights,
            and allow sufficient travel time from carrier terminal to place of duty or home. Note: Addi-
            tional time authorized when local conditions warrant.
            4.3.4.2.5. Do not begin or end a constructed schedule, including terminal travel, between
            2400-0600 hours unless that is the only schedule available. Note: When the actual travel time
            by POC, not to exceed the allowable travel time (JFTR, par. U3005-C and JTR, par. C4300),
            results in a lesser per diem entitlement than the constructed time, use the actual. For travel
            between TDY locations, use steps for travel to a TDY location (See par. 4.3.4.1.).
     4.3.5. Constructed Lodging Costs. In many instances, it is necessary to construct a traveler as if he or
     she remained overnight at a TDY point. For example, a traveler performs required duty on any given
     day and departs the same day after completion of duty for leave. The traveler’s constructed schedule
     (if required) should start no earlier than the day after the last day of duty. The lodging cost incurred
     for the previous day (if any) is included in the constructed cost. Example: Traveler departs TDY
     point on 1 June; duty performed that day. On 31 May, the member incurred a $14.00 VOQ charge.
     Allow the ‘constructed’ $14.00 VOQ charge for 1 June consistent with the constructed schedule.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               21


   4.3.6. Delays. Treat necessary delays at POE or POD as authorized delays. The member remains in
   a travel status when government scheduled transportation causes early arrival at the port or causes a
   delay at the port awaiting onward transportation.

4.4. TDY Travel and Leave (Military Members Only):
   4.4.1. General. A member on TDY may be authorized leave en route.
   4.4.2. Leave En route to and from TDY (including Permissive Travel). (See Table 4.1.). Charge
   leave for all excess travel time (any days not included in the constructed schedule or days not catego-
   rized as permissive travel time. (See Table 4.2.).
      4.4.2.1. Constructed schedule includes travel by POC if the cost is less than TR. Exceptions to
      charging leave may be made when duty is performed for the majority of a day on the departure day
      or arrival day at the PDS or when the departure day from the PDS is a non-duty day.
      4.4.2.2. Permissive travel in conjunction with funded TDYs, where the permissive travel is taken
      either prior to or after completing the funded TDY, does not negate the travel entitlement to the
      funded TDY location. Travel allowances are properly payable for direct travel from the PDS to
      funded TDY locations(s) and return to the PDS. (See AFI 36-3003)
   4.4.3. Leave During TDY:
      4.4.3.1. The TDY unit controls and reports through its servicing FSO, leave taken during a TDY
      period that involves departure from and return to the TDY station. The member should attach a
      copy of each AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization, issued during TDY to the travel
      voucher.
      4.4.3.2. Leave taken at a TDY point and reported by the TDY FSO appears on the by-others trans-
      action portion of the JDC listing UH099CA11. (See DFAS-DEM 7073-1). Obtain a copy of the
      listing from the customer support section and check for possible leave (SB) transactions.
          4.4.3.2.1. If the voucher has been paid, verify that no per diem was paid during the leave
          period and contact the member if the data is questionable. If per diem was erroneously paid
          while in leave status, take collection action.
          4.4.3.2.2. If the voucher has not been paid, suspense the listing until the member's estimated
          TDY return date to compare it with the voucher before settlement to ensure no per diem is paid
          while in leave status. Continue to suspense this listing until a voucher is filed.
      4.4.3.3. Leave taken at the PDS before or after the TDY is not to be included in the orders. If
      orders erroneously authorize leave at the PDS, Customer Support must advise the Commander
      Support Staff to take appropriate action.
      4.4.3.4. Passes During TDY. Passes cannot be used for additional travel time. Passes must start
      and end at the same location according to AFI 36-3003.
      4.4.3.5. Return to PDS from TDY for Personal Reasons. (JFTR, par. U4130). Members who vol-
      untarily return to the PDS between TDY locations are charged leave, except non-duty days, for
      any days not involved in the constructed travel schedule between TDY points. Note: Members
      who return to the PDS/home on a special pass (See AFI 36-3003) are returning to PDS for per-
      sonal reasons.
22                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


        4.4.3.6. Travel from TDY Station during Downtime. (JFTR, par. U4130). Members on TDY
        often find themselves in the situation where training or duty is interrupted. An example of this sta-
        tus is during the Christmas/New Years holiday season. For employee’s guidance see par. 10.2. of
        this instruction.
            4.4.3.6.1. When a member returns to the PDS to perform duty, allowances prescribed in JFTR,
            par. U4130 are authorized. If the member is not directed to return home; therefore, the condi-
            tions under return to PDS for personal reason applies. Note: The PDS commander must
            approve return to the PDS to perform duty. A statement from the PDS commander must be
            attached to the travel claim.
            4.4.3.6.2. Members remaining at the TDY location continue with TDY allowances.
            4.4.3.6.3. Members returning to the PDS in a leave status or who take leave at a location other
            than the PDS (to include convalescent leave) are not entitled to per diem or transportation,
            JFTR, par U4102-B. This paragraph does not apply to return to the PDS for personal reasons
            when not in a leave status. Normal rules for charging leave apply. The TDY unit charges the
            leave.

4.5. Permissive Travel Time. Air Force policy allows permissive travel time to be granted to members
authorized to travel by POC for personal convenience on a funded TDY of 16 calendar days or more, as
stated on the order, at one location and the member is not reimbursed actual travel costs according to
JFTR, par. U3310, and Chapter 4, par. 4.4. of this instruction. To compute the number of permissive
travel days granted, subtract the number of constructed travel days from the lesser of the actual travel days
used or the number of authorized travel days (350 miles per day, JFTR, par. U3305-C). (See Figure 4.4.).
(Example: 1000 miles/350 = 3 days authorized by POC: actual travel days used is greater than autho-
rized; member is authorized 3 days (1 constructed, 2 permissive); any excess travel days are charged as
leave). Permissive travel time is not authorized when a directed transportation mode is available but not
used. Additional per diem or actual expense is not authorized for days categorized as permissive travel
time. WHEN THE ORDER-ISSUING OFFICIAL AUTHORIZES TRAVEL BY POC FOR PERSONAL
CONVENIENCE IN TDY ORDERS, AN ADDITIONAL STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZ-
ING PERMISSIVE TRAVEL TIME IS NOT REQUIRED. A member, who originally met the 16-calen-
dar day criterion, cannot be denied permissive travel time when the TDY is curtailed before the
16-calendar day period is met. When a member's original TDY is less than 16 calendar days and after
travel commences, the TDY is extended to 16 or more calendar days, permissive travel time is not autho-
rized.

4.6. Inpatient Authorized to Subsist Out. (JFTR, par. U7125-D) (See Figure 4.5.).

4.7. Field Duty. (JFTR, par. U4102-L).
     4.7.1. A member on field duty (See Glossary of Terms) is not entitled to per diem except under con-
     ditions described in JFTR, par. U4102-L.
     4.7.2. Issuance of Non-Field Duty Certificate. Members on field duty who have one of the exceptions
     provided in JFTR, par. U4102-L, are required to obtain non-field duty certificates from the appropri-
     ate official to support payment of per diem. AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect-Use of Gov-
     ernment Facilities, DD 1351-5, Government Quarters and Meals, or a memo approved by the TDY
     site Commander (or designee) may be used to support reimbursement of occasional meals actually
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  23


   purchased. See JFTR, pars. U4102-L and U4510. Note: Reimbursement is based on actual expense
   (See JTFR, par. U4510-B2). If no funds are expended, there is no reimbursement. Reimbursement
   must not exceed the PMR. The incidental expense portion is not payable see JFTR, par. U4510-B2.
   For civilian employees see JTR, par. C4554-D.

4.8. TDY Travel Involving International Dateline. (JFTR, par. U4115 and JTR, par. C4553-E). In
computing per diem where the international dateline is involved, the computation is based on actual
elapsed time rather than calendar days. (See 39 Comp. Gen. 853 (1960)). (See Figure 4.6.).

4.9. Actual Expense Allowance (AEA). (JFTR, Chapter 4, Part C and JTR, Chapter 4, Part M). Appli-
cable approval authority is in JFTR and JTR, Appendix L. Information to be included in request is
located in JFTR, par. U4215-F and JTR, par. C4603-F.
   4.9.1. AEA claims over 150% not to exceed 300%. Follow the format in JFTR, par. U4215-F and
   JTR, par. C4603-F. Before a claim can be forwarded for consideration, the traveler must first obtain
   approval from the lower level AEA approval official (wing commander or equivalent or delegated to
   group commander). Tenant Units or Detachments have the discretion to staff their AEA requests to
   the host Wing Commander or their own Wing Commander/MAJCOM. The claim can be denied at
   that level of authority. In such cases, the claim will not be forwarded to a higher level for further con-
   sideration.
       4.9.1.1. Air Force policy requires the following additional information on AEA claims: allowed
       costs, actual costs, difference in costs, summary of efforts made to secure lodging within estab-
       lished per diem rates--to include list of lodging facilities contacted and complete explanation of
       the circumstances that warranted the request. Note: Claims are limited to significant circum-
       stances beyond the traveler’s control; e.g., natural disasters or major events or conferences that
       have affected all the lodging facilities in an area. Travelers are responsible for ensuring travel
       arrangements are made within the prescribed per diem rates. Lack of knowledge of prescribed
       rates is not justification for an AEA claim over 150% of the prescribed per diem rates.
       4.9.1.2. For cases forwarded to higher headquarters for approval/disapproval, the authority listed
       in JFTR/JTR, Appendix L is the final authority.
       4.9.1.3. The AEA authority may not be used as a blanket authority. It must be used only on an
       individual trip basis, and only after appropriate consideration is given to the facts existing in each
       case at the time travel is directed and performed. This does not prevent AEAs for groups or con-
       ferences under JFTR, par. U4215-B and JTR, par. C4603-B.
       4.9.1.4. Conference Lodging. See JFTR, Chapter 2, Part G and JTR, Chapter 4, Part S.

4.10. Availability and Use of Government Quarters.
   4.10.1. Members who perform TDY of 24 hours or less at a military installation are encouraged to use
   available government quarters to the maximum extent possible. Per diem cannot be reduced if a
   member does not use government facilities when the duration of TDY or delay is less than 24 hours,
   even though the travel order directs use of such facilities (JFTR, par. U1045-B4). A member whose
   original delay was 24 hours or less, and is extended at the location (to include circumstances beyond
   their control), reverts to the rule for members TDY for more than 24 hours and must use available
   government facilities, unless the government quarters use would have adversely affected mission per-
24                                                                          AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     formance. If a member voluntarily uses quarters at a nearby military installation, use of available
     messing facilities does not reduce per diem entitlement (JFTR, pars. U4125, U4400 and U1045). For
     non-availability documentation, see JFTR, par. U1045-C.
     4.10.2. For civilian employees see JTR, par. C1055.

4.11. Changes to Selected Meal Options. The order-issuing official is responsible for selecting the
appropriate meal option prior to preparation of the TDY orders. However, there may be circumstances
where the meal option selected turns out to be inappropriate and, in these cases, the order-issuing official
may change the meal option. It is important to remember a meal option resulting in a reduced entitlement
cannot be made retroactive with the exception of a deductible meal. (See JFTR, par. U4165 for rule).
     4.11.1. Meal option changes that result in an increased per diem rate. The order-issuing official
     selects the meal option based on the mission and information available http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/
     lodging.html (AFMAN 34-255) when the TDY order is being prepared. If, at any point, it is deter-
     mined that the meal option selected was insufficient (increased only), it may be changed to reflect the
     proper meal option. This is based on the non-availability of meals (missed meals). Example: The
     traveler’s order states government dining facility is directed; however, due to the work schedule the
     traveler misses a meal. Upon return, the order-issuing official would annotate the order with the
     appropriate meal option, in this case the proportional meal rate. If the member is deployed in support
     of a Joint Task Force (JTF), missed meals are tracked using the AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse
     Effect. The deployed commander or designee approves non-availability of directed meals. The mem-
     ber submits this information when filing the travel voucher. Note: Only the tasking headquarters can
     change meal options for members deployed in support of a JTF operation. Local order-issuing offi-
     cials cannot dictate a meal option different than the tasking message. This does not preclude use of
     the AF Form 2282 when appropriate signatures are obtained.
     4.11.2. Meal option change that results in a decreased per diem rate. The order-issuing official selects
     the meal option based on the mission and information available when the TDY order is being pre-
     pared. If, during the TDY, a different meal option becomes applicable, the order-issuing official may
     direct a new meal option using a current or future effective date. The TDY order is annotated with the
     new direction and effective date. Example: The order-issuing official authorizes the locality rate,
     due to the non-availability of a dining facility at the TDY location. The order-issuing official is noti-
     fied that the dining facility is now available. Using this information and a review of the mission
     requirements, the order-issuing official could decide to direct the member to use the government din-
     ing facility. If the order-issuing official determines the government dining facility would meet the
     mission requirements, the TDY traveler would be briefed that government meals are available and
     directed and the Government Meal Rate (GMR) will become effective on a current date or future date.
     Upon return, the order-issuing official would annotate the order with the appropriate directed meal
     option and date directed. It is important to remember that the meal option cannot be changed to reflect
     a RETROACTIVE DECREASE in entitlement. Example: Member’s TDY order is silent on meal
     direction. Upon return from TDY, the order-issuing official states the order was prepared incorrectly
     and the member should have been directed to use the government dining facility. The member would
     still be entitled to the locality meal rate since travel has been completed and the change required
     would result in a retroactive reduction.
     4.11.3. TDY members who are directed to use government dining facility and quarters: If the TDY

NOTES:
  1. The TDY unit commander, through the servicing FSO, reports leave taken while at a TDY point.
     These leave periods are shown on the travel voucher for control purposes, but are not reported on
     AF Form 985, Report of Travel/Time (DJMS).
     2. A member is entitled to per diem for allowable travel time necessary to perform the directed
        travel; therefore, leave is not charged for any day for which some per diem is payable. To deter-
        mine duty status for the departure day from or arrival at PDS when not an allowable travel day,
        see Table 4.2.
     3. The actual travel time is the allowable travel time. See par. 4.4.2.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                27


    4. When actual travel time is less than the allowable travel time computed, the actual travel time is
       the allowable.
    5. Travel days not covered by notes 2 and 3 can be categorized as permissive travel time per par. 4.5.
    6. For employees’ guidance, see JTR.

                                                Chapter 5

                   PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL FOR MILITARY MEMBERS

Section 5A—Member Travel

5.1. Travel and Transportation Options. (JFTR, par. U5105).
     5.1.1. Land and Transoceanic Travel Performed on the Same Day. (JFTR, par. U5105-B). A member
     performing land travel via POC and transoceanic travel on the same day is entitled to lodgings plus
     per diem and if the owner/operator of the POC, the MALT portion of MALT PLUS per diem.
     5.1.2. Mixed Modes of PCS Land Travel. (JFTR, par. U5105-E). When a member travels by mixed
     modes as defined in JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix A, for an authorized leg of the journey, total reim-
     bursement for POC and personally-procured commercial travel may be no more than the MALT
     PLUS payable for the entire ordered travel distance less the cost of any government procured trans-
     portation used for a portion of the journey. (Note: Do not collect excess cost from the member if
     deducting the cost of the Government-procured transportation for the ordered travel from the MALT
     PLUS results in a negative amount.)

5.2. En Route Temporary Duty (TDY).
     5.2.1. General. (JFTR, par. U5113). When PCS orders direct TDY after departure from the old per-
     manent duty station (PDS), but before arriving at the new PDS, a member is authorized per diem IAW
     JFTR, Chapter 4. Compute travels time as if each leg of the travel were a separate PCS.
     5.2.2. Authorized Reporting Time. Follow the instructions in Chapter 4 of this instruction to deter-
     mine authorized reporting time and date. The authorized reporting date is a day of duty and lodgings
     plus per diem is payable. When the departure day is a day of duty lodgings plus per diem is payable
     unless needed to pay MALT PLUS per diem.
     5.2.3. TDY at or Near Old or New PDS. (JFTR, par. U5120-D). The Air Force does not authorize
     placement of members on TDY under these conditions. This TDY must be performed before depar-
     ture from the old PDS or after arrival at the new PDS (AFI 36-2110, par. 4.6.4.1). If a member per-
     forms TDY to a new PDS (PCS order published) prior to departing in a PCS status, TDY allowances
     are properly payable if the member returns to the old PDS prior to departure and performs regularly
     assigned duties. If the member's return is solely for out-processing, with no other duty performed,
     TDY allowances are not payable (AFI 36-2110, par. 4.6.4.2.1. and Comp Gen. B-216465, 22 May
     1985).
     5.2.4. Members who arrive at their new PDS and require additional training at the same PDS prior to
     assuming their new duties cannot receive per diem. (JFTR, par. U4102-D).

5.3. Enlistment, Reenlistment, or Induction. (JFTR, par. U5108-C). It is Air Force policy that mem-
bers whose first assignment is for basic training, indoctrination, or processing are furnished transportation
in kind and meal tickets (MTs). If available transportation or MTs are not used, no reimbursement is
authorized. If transportation and MTs are not available, the member is authorized to travel and transpor-
tation allowances, IAW, Chapter 5.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  41


5.4. Travel Via Designated Place. The allowances prescribed in JFTR, par. U5120-G are authorized to a
member who travels via the designated place of dependents when they relocate at Government expense
to/from that place incident to the member's PCS to/from an unaccompanied or dependent restricted over-
seas tour. For computing allowances, use separate legs of travel to/from the designated place (per diem is
not payable while at the designated place).

5.5. Circuitous Travel. (JFTR, par. 5116-E and AFI 24-101, par. 3.10).

5.6. Separation/Retirement from the Service or Relief from Active Duty. (JFTR, par. U5125 and par.
U5130). Once a home is selected and allowances have been received, (monetary or in-kind) a member
cannot change that selection (the selection is irrevocable).
   5.6.1. The MPF determines if airmen and Reserve officers separating at date of separation (DOS)
   qualify for full travel entitlement and includes this authority in the separation order. HQ AFPC makes
   the determination for Reserve/Regular officer actions they approve (see AFIs 36-2102 and 36-2110).
   5.6.2. A member separating from the service has 6 months from their date of separation to complete
   travel. A member retiring from the service has 12 months to complete travel. Travel and transporta-
   tion time limitation extensions (JFTR, par. U5012-I). See Air Force Supplement, JFTR, Volume 1 for
   Air Force policy for extensions.

5.7. Allowable Travel Time Computation. (JFTR, par. U5160).
   5.7.1. General. Travel time is computed independently of monetary entitlement.
   5.7.2. Orders Canceled, Amended, or Modified. (JFTR, par. U5120-E). Compute allowable travel
   time for PCS travel between the points for which member was authorized travel allowances. Compute
   each leg of travel as a separate PCS. The date notified is a duty day.
   5.7.3. Allowable Travel Time-Insufficient to Accomplish Required Travel. (JFTR, par. U5160-E).
   Additional travel time may be authorized/approved when actual travel time exceeds authorized travel
   time for reasons beyond the member’s control (such as acts of God, restrictions by Government
   authorities, difficulties in obtaining fuel for POCs or other reasons satisfactory to the member’s new
   commanding officer). The amount of additional travel time authorized may be the actual delay period
   or a shorter period as determined appropriate by the member’s new commanding officer. The expla-
   nation of the circumstances, which necessitated the delay, together with the commanding officer’s
   action, must be attached to the voucher.
       5.7.3.1. Inconvenience or personal wishes are not a basis for submission of a request.
   5.7.4. PCS from Leave Status. If the member is reassigned while in an emergency or ordinary leave
   status, the leave is cancelled by the losing unit and the entire period, including leave, allowable travel
   time, and proceed time, is computed by the gaining station.
   5.7.5. Travel Time for Separation/Retirement. Separate travel time is not granted. Member may
   depart PDS on/after start date of permissive TDY/terminal leave.

5.8. Leave.
   5.8.1. Dates on Travel Vouchers. Use departure and arrival dates as shown on member's travel itiner-
   ary to compute allowable travel time, chargeable leave, and proceed time. Member's departure and
42                                                                          AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     arrival dates should coincide with departure and arrival dates to or from PDS or local area, whichever
     applies or date member is available for duty.
     Examples:
     Member arrives Peterson AFB, CO on Friday and checks into billeting and calls his/her supervisor.
     Member reports to duty section Monday morning. Arrival date is Friday.
     Member arrives F.E. Warren AFB, WY on Monday and checks into billeting. Member reports to duty
     on Friday. Arrival date is Friday.
     5.8.2. Time in Excess of Allowable Travel Time. Charge the time used by a member in excess of the
     allowable travel time, unless otherwise provided for, against member's leave account.
     5.8.3. Departure Day.
        5.8.3.1. The departure day from the permanent duty station, regardless of hour, is a day of leave,
        unless out-processing was required to be performed that day.
        5.8.3.2. For TDY en route, the departure day from the TDY station is a day of leave, unless the
        member performed scheduled duties/out-processing (more than checking out of lodging) before
        departure.
     5.8.4. Arrival Day. The arrival day for duty at a station, regardless of the hour, is a duty day.
     5.8.5. A member who is not eligible for dependent travel at government expense but who has been
     authorized space-available transportation for the dependents to CONUS must be charged leave while
     awaiting such transportation.
     5.8.6. Graduation Leave for Academy Graduates. (AFI 36-3003, par. 14.11.1). Graduates must take
     and complete graduation leave within three months after the members’ graduation and before they
     report to their first PDSs or ports of embarkation for permanent duty outside the CONUS.
     5.8.7. Leave on Separation and Retirement. When member files final settlement voucher for separa-
     tion and retirement travel, take the following action:
        5.8.7.1. If the voucher shows that the member departed the final PDS on or after date of separa-
        tion (DOS) or retirement (DOR), no leave is chargeable.
        5.8.7.2. If the settlement voucher itinerary shows that the member departed the PDS before DOS/
        DOR:
            5.8.7.2.1. Determine if permissive TDY/terminal leave was charged. If the member departed
            prior to permissive TDY/terminal leave start date, travel-generated leave is chargeable for the
            excess days. If the member out-processed the duty day prior to start of permissive/terminal
            leave, allow this day as a day of duty.

5.9. Ports of Embarkation (POE) and Debarkation (POD). (JFTR, par. U5160-B).
     5.9.1. The authorized reporting time and date at a POE is one day prior to port call. If member arrives
     early and doesn't obtain a statement authorizing early arrival from personnel or the appropriate sup-
     port agency, the actual departure day from the POE is the port call date and one day prior to port call
     is the authorized reporting time. Excess time is charged as leave. Use actual or constructed travel
     time between permanent duty station (PDS) and POE/POD. For computation of PCS travel and leave,
     treat POE/POD as TDY en route.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 43


   5.9.2. Do not charge leave for the arrival day at POD even though member departs from the port the
   same day on leave.

5.10. Delay Involving POV Port and POE/POD.
   5.10.1. When non-duty day(s) (weekends and holidays) immediately precedes the port call date and
   immediately follow the day the POV was delivered for shipment, additional travel time is authorized
   for the interim non-duty day(s).
   5.10.2. When non-duty day(s) immediately follows the arrival day at the POD and immediately pre-
   cede the day the POV was picked up from the POV port, additional travel time is authorized for the
   interim non-duty day(s).
   5.10.3. MALT PLUS is authorized for the member and dependents (if applicable) for the non-duty
   day(s) authorized as additional travel time. A commander's approval is not required when travel is
   accomplished according to par. 5.10.1. or par. 5.10.2. of this instruction.

5.11. Recruiters’ Assistance Program (RAP). (AFI 36-3003, par. 14.10). Members may be authorized
to participate in this program upon graduation from technical school or officer’s training school (OTS),
and prior to arrival at first PDS for a period not to exceed 12 days. The days are charged as permissive
travel.

5.12. Permissive PCS Travel. The arrival day at the new PDS is a day of duty. All other time is charged
as leave.

5.13. Proceed Time. (AFI 36-2102). Members authorized to transportation of dependents and/or ship-
ment of household goods or unaccompanied baggage may be authorized four days of proceed time when
being reassigned to or from an unaccompanied or dependent restricted tour. Proceed time is authorized
only when members actually relocate their dependents and/or household goods (to include unaccompa-
nied baggage) in conjunction with the unaccompanied tour or dependent restricted tour. It is a four-day
period of authorized absence not chargeable to leave or travel time. The time is meant to enable a member
to attend to the administrative details involved in a PCS move. If proceed time is authorized, charge the
last four days that would have been charged as leave as proceed time. If this is impractical, due to report-
ing requirements, proceed time may be any four non-travel days between departure day from the old PDS
to arrival day at the new PDS. Proceed time is not granted under the following conditions:
   5.13.1. Incident to the member's first PCS or,
   5.13.2. Incident to separation, release from active duty or retirement.

5.14. Per Diem Entitlement at Separation Processing Station of Choice (SPBC).            (JFTR,      pars.
U5125-A3 and U5130-A3).
   5.14.1. Applicable to members retiring/separating from OCONUS locations. (AFI 36-3203, par. 2.2).
   5.14.2. SPBC is an Air Force base in the United States with an MPF and FSO selected by the retiring/
   separating member as the base nearest or most directly en route to the member’s projected HOS/
   HOR (AFI 36-3203, par. 2.4). The selected destination for HHG shipment should determine the
   appropriate SPBC. SPBCs selected for high housing allowances or personal travel preferences are not
   authorized.
44                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     Example: Member is stationed at Ramstein AB, Germany and is retiring. Member selects Los Ange-
     les AFB, CA as the SPBC. However, the member’s HHG government bill of lading states Biloxi, MS.
     The SPBC should be Keesler AFB, MS.
     5.14.3. The SPBC is treated as a TDY location en route to the HOS/HOR. A member is authorized
     per diem while at the SPBC. Exception: member separates/retires at the SPBC. If the member’s
     HOS/HOR is located within the local area of the SPBC, then per diem is not authorized.

5.15. Use of More Than Two Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) for PCS, Separation/ Retirement
Travel. (JFTR, par. U5015-B). Use of more than two POCs may be authorized/approved as advantageous
in the order or by a statement from the order-issuing/approving official for PCS, separation or retirement
travel. Only AFPC can authorize/approve items in par. 5.15.7. below. If authorization is not stated in the
order, the traveler is required to file the original and one copy of the statement with the travel claim.
Qualifying factors:
     5.15.1. More than eight family members travel together by POC, including the member;
     5.15.2. Because of age or physical condition, a dependent needs special accommodations in one vehi-
     cle and second and third vehicles are required for more than five other family members;
     5.15.3. A member must report to a new duty station in advance of travel by dependents who delay
     travel for acceptable reasons (such as school term completion, property sale, settlement of personal
     business affairs, HHG transportation, non-availability of adequate housing at the new duty station)
     and more than four dependents travel by POC later;
     5.15.4. More than four dependents travel unaccompanied by POC between authorized points other
     than those for the member’s travel (such as travel to/from a designated place without the member or to
     the new PDS when the member has TDY en route;
     5.15.5. More than four dependents travel unaccompanied to the new duty station in advance of the
     member’s reporting date for acceptable reasons (such as to enroll children in school at the beginning
     of the term or secure housing);
     5.15.6. More than six family members travel together by POC, including the member, over the
     ALCAN highway (safety guidelines require extra spare tires, parts, tools, etc.); or
     5.15.7. Special circumstances not included in 5.15.1. through 5.15.6. must be authorized/approved by
     AFPC.
NOTE: The purpose of reimbursing members MALT PLUS per diem is to “move” people not vehicles.

5.16. PCS Travel Involving Ocean-going Ferries. (JFTR, par. U5116-C3). For examples of travel
involving ocean-going ferries, see Figure 5.1. and Figure 5.2..

Section 5B—Dependent Travel (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part C and Appendix A).

5.17. General. Reimbursement for dependent travel is authorized only if travel has been performed with
the intent to establish a bona fide residence. (JFTR, par. U5203-B) The reasons listed below are not
travel to a bona fide residence:
     5.17.1. Presumption that a home would be selected,
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  45


   5.17.2. Brief stays to conduct official business,
   5.17.3. Establishment of legal residence, that is, registers to vote, obtains driver’s license, etc., in a
   particular state unless travel is performed thereto, or
   5.17.4. Trips involving short visits, to friends, or relatives, and vacations.

5.18. Dependency Determination. (JFTR, Appendix A):
   5.18.1. General. Eligible dependents for travel allowance purposes are defined in JFTR, Appendix A.
   When a determination on a questionable relationship or dependency has been made, documentation is
   filed in the FSO management file for future reference (see DFAS-DEM 7073-1). This data is required
   by administrative personnel to support the issuance of travel orders, and by FSOs in the settlement of
   travel claims.
   5.18.2. DFAS-DE Determinations. Dependency determinations are processed by DFAS-PMJPD/DE
   on referrals and rebuttals submitted by the FSO. DFAS-PMJPD/DE will advise FSOs of approval or
   disapproval.

5.19. Monetary Allowance in Lieu of Transportation (MALT) PLUS Per Diem. (JFTR, pars. U5015
and U5210). The following procedures apply for dependents traveling by POC for the official distance of
ordered travel.
   5.19.1. Concurrent vs. Non-concurrent. Dependents are not traveling concurrently with the member
   if they travel separately from the member on different routes or at different times. (See Figure 5.3.).
   Example: Dependents depart three hours after the member departs in a separate POC. They meet at
   the same location later that day and complete the PCS travel concurrently. This does not constitute
   non-concurrent travel.

5.20. Travel and Transportation Involving Old and/or New Non-PDS Location. ( J F T R ,                p a r.
U5218). Once a member has exercised the right to transportation of dependents to an alternate location,
further transportation at government expense is not authorized incident to that PCS even though the alter-
nate location to which dependents travel is a shorter distance than travel between the old and the new sta-
tion.

5.21. Student Dependents. The first travel to the member’s new PDS must be accomplished on the
member’s PCS order.
Example: Member is stationed at Hickam AFB, HI and receives orders to Kadena AFB, Japan. Student
dependent departs Hickam prior to member’s departure on a student dependent travel order in August and
starts the fall college term. At Christmas, the dependent travels to Kadena. This travel must be accom-
plished on the member’s PCS order. Travel entitlement is limited to the ordered travel (Hickam to
Kadena). The student dependent may be returned to school on student dependent travel orders.

Section 5C—Household Goods. (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part D).

5.22. General. (JFTR, par. U5300). Air Force household goods (HHG) shipment policy is in AF Supple-
ment/JFTR, Volume 1. Included in this instruction are procedures and approval authorities for extension
of separation and retirement limitations.
46                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


5.23. Personally Procured Move (PPM) for Transporting Personal Property. (Formerly the DITY
Move Program). (JFTR, par. U5320-D and JFTR, Vol. 1, Air Force Supplemental, Uniformed Service
Personnel).
     5.23.1. General. The PPM program was initiated to provide members or next of kin of a deceased
     member an alternative method of moving HHG while offering a monetary incentive to save govern-
     ment funds. The following conditions apply:
        5.23.1.1. The member must have an order authorizing movement of HHG.
        5.23.1.2. The member or representative must be counseled by the TMO prior to a PPM.
        5.23.1.3. For transoceanic shipments under this program see JFTR, Vol. 1, Air Force Supplemen-
        tal, Uniformed Service Personnel.
        5.23.1.4. PPMs are strictly voluntary.
     5.23.2. Impact on Other PCS Entitlements. When the member and/or dependents ride to the destina-
     tion in the rental vehicle or a POC, which is used for the PPM, they are authorized both the PPM
     allowances and MALT PLUS per diem for the authorized POCs (including rental vehicles). The
     rental vehicle or POC, used for the PPM, is one of the two authorized POCs.
     5.23.3. Payments. For documentation requirements and procedures, see Chapter 8.
     5.23.4. PPM Expenses Exceeding 95 Percent Limitation. When a member incurs PPM expenses that
     exceed the 95 percent limit, reimbursement is payable for actual expenses NTE Government Con-
     structed Cost.

5.24. Transportation Services Directly Procured by the Member with a Commercial Company.
(AF Supplement/JFTR, Volume 1). A member or next of kin of a deceased member may ship the mem-
ber's HHG at personal expense and claim reimbursement for actual cost of shipment NTE the government
constructed cost.

5.25. Services Not Reimbursable:
     5.25.1. Services performed before receipt of orders. (In cases of emergency or of service exigency,
     when documented by claimant's commander maybe exceptions). A statement from the PCS order–
     issuing official or designated representative must be used to substantiate reimbursement for a PCS
     move the member claims to have been advised orders would be issued (JFTR, par. U5330-G).
     5.25.2. Storage in transit after the first 90 days when conditions were not beyond control of the mem-
     ber or incident to transportation.
     5.25.3. Storage incident to a temporary change of station other than as provided in the JFTR.
     5.25.4. Commercial storage when government facilities are available. Claimant is responsible for
     ascertaining availability of government facilities.

Section 5D—Transportation of Privately Owned Motor Vehicle (POV).

5.26. Policy. (JFTR, par. U5413). Delivery or pick-up of a POV concurrent with PCS is defined as any
vehicle transportation action performed entirely within a separate leg of PCS travel. All other vehicle
transportation actions are considered non-concurrent (see Figure 5.3. and Figure 5.4.).
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               47


   5.26.1. Concurrent. (JFTR, pars. U5413-C, D, and E).
   5.26.2. Non-Concurrent. Members are authorized to transportation allowances according to JFTR,
   par. U5413-B, for transportation of a vehicle to or from a VPC/port by any means (commercial or per-
   sonally procured). For the purpose of receiving transportation allowances, there are no restrictions as
   to who may deliver or pick up the vehicle. Note: Members are not authorized to government-pro-
   cured transportation for this travel.

5.27. Processing Time. The member is due one day for POV processing at the vehicle port/VPC in addi-
tion to the day at the APOD. Normally, per diem is not authorized. MALT PLUS is payable for the addi-
tional travel time when authorized delays occur as outlined in par. 5.10. of this instruction.

5.28. Shipment of POV at Personal Expense. (JFTR, par. U5425-B).

5.29. Determination of Vehicle Port/VPC. (JFTR, par. U5435, and AF Supplement/JFTR, Volume 1).
The vehicle port/VPC to which transportation entitlements are authorized is the port nearest the old or
new duty station or a port/VPC between the old and new duty station. Contact TMO to determine the
appropriate vehicle port/VPC.

5.30. Restrictions. (JFTR, par. U5435-B). Travel and transportation allowances are authorized only in
connection with the shipment of authorized vehicles. If more than one vehicle is shipped (one at govern-
ment expense and one or more at personal expense), transportation allowances for delivery/pickup are
only authorized for the vehicle shipped at government expense (DD Form 788 or the member's statement
accompanied by a copy of the commercial firm's receipt).

Section 5E—POV Storage when POV Transportation is not Authorized. (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part E,
Section 2).

5.31. Eligibility. Members with an effective date of PCS orders of 1 April 1997 or later are eligible for
this entitlement.

Section 5F—Mobile Home Allowance. (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part F).
48                                                                AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005

                                               Chapter 6

            TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES UNDER SPECIAL
                       CIRCUMSTANCES AND CATEGORIES

6.1. United States Air Force Academy Cadets. Administrative Turnback to a Later Class (Hardship).
(AFI 36-2020) Travel of turnback-cadets to and from the Academy is performed at no expense to the Air
Force.

6.2. Travel Incident to Applicant Processing. (JFTR, par. U7025).
   6.2.1. General. Members in these categories are furnished transportation and meal tickets (MTs). If
   available transportation or MTs are not used, no reimbursement is authorized unless approved by the
   order-issuing official. If transportation and MTs are not available, member is authorized to TDY
   allowances.
   6.2.2. Approval for Payment. The responsible Air Force recruiting squadron commander certifies
   approval for payment of travel and/or transportation allowances authorized in this paragraph in Item
   IV, DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher or item 21a, DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, as
   applicable.

6.3. Reimbursement of Expenses Incurred in Performance of Official Recruiting Duty. (JFTR, par.
U7030) Out-of-pocket recruiting expenses are reimbursable. Such reimbursement is for personnel
assigned within the recruiting service who are actively engaged in recruiting Air Force members. For
Reserve recruiter expenses of an unusual nature, request for determinations should be referred to HQ
AFRC/RS, 155 Richard Ray Boulevard, Robins AFB, GA 31098-1635.

6.4. Air Crews. (JFTR, par. U7100). Flight crews engaged in scheduled air transport operations or train-
ing for such duties are authorized to travel and transportation allowances under JFTR, Chapter 4, without
specific travel orders (47 Comp Gen. 477 (1968)). JFTR, Chapter 3, Parts C and E apply at locations
other than the PDS. A signature from the aircraft or squadron commander after the travel completion
must be included either on the original voucher or copy of the attached flight order.

6.5. Commuting Area Travel any Tour Less than 20 Weeks. (JFTR, par. U7150).
   6.5.1. No per diem or actual expense allowances are payable between the home or place from which
   the Reserve Component (RC) member is called to active duty and the permanent duty station in cases
   where the RC member commutes daily between home, or place from which call is to active duty, and
   the permanent duty station. RC members are authorized mileage reimbursement of one round trip for
   each consecutive tour outside of corporate limits.
   6.5.2. RC members who are within the commuting area (but outside the corporate limits) but are pre-
   cluded from commuting due to the nature of the duty are authorized to reimbursement for occasional
   meals not to exceed the proportional rate and/or quarters in accordance with JFTR, par. U4510-B.
   Example: Member ordered to active duty: 1-5 Sep will commute. On 2 Sep, ordered to work until
   project is completed. Worked: 0800 hrs, 2 Sep and required to remain overnight at duty location until
   1300 hrs, 3 Sep. Authorized to claim reimbursement for evening meal, 2 Sep, and morning meal, 3
62                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     Sep. Reimbursement is limited to the actual cost of the meals not to exceed the proportional meal rate
     for the locality for each day involved.
NOTE: A reservists that is commuting would normally be required to procure a meal and is not autho-
rized any reimbursement for that meal. (Normally lunch for day workers).

6.6. Active Duty Training (ADT). (JFTR, par. U7150-A).
     6.6.1. Per Diem Entitlements while at an Annual Tour Location. No per diem is payable if both gov-
     ernment quarters and mess are available (JFTR, par. U7150-A1c). When the member presents an
     impracticability or adverse effects statement covering all or part of the training period, or if AFMAN
     34-255 (http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem) shows government quarters or meals as not available, per
     diem is authorized according to JFTR, par. U1045 and JFTR, Chapter 4, Parts B, C, or E, as applica-
     ble. Since a training location is a permanent duty station, members on annual training are not in a
     travel status while at the training location.
     6.6.2. Multiple Annual Tour Locations. In the case of multiple annual tour locations, each location is
     not always a PDS. The nature of the duty determines whether a location is considered a PDS or TDY
     station. A TDY station can be reflected by either a separate TDY order (or flight authorization) or
     may be stated on the call to duty order by stating "with further TDY to...”. The following scenarios
     are used for clarification:
        6.6.2.1. A member called to active duty to perform an annual tour at the unit of assignment is not
        authorized per diem. Any travel away from the annual tour location is TDY and per diem is pay-
        able.
        6.6.2.2. A member, called to the unit of assignment only for the purpose of obtaining onward
        transportation to the actual annual tour location, would have both locations reflected as an annual
        tour location or PDS. Per diem would not be payable if government quarters and meals are avail-
        able.
        6.6.2.3. A member who travels from home (or place from which called to active duty) to one or
        more annual tour locations and then returns to home (or place from which called to active duty)
        without returning to the prime duty location has more than one PDS. Each station would be an
        annual tour location and per diem would not be payable if Government quarters and meals are
        available.
     6.6.3. Travel within and adjacent to Permanent Duty and TDY Stations. JFTR, Chapter 7, Part G, and
     Chapter 4 of this instruction apply.
        6.6.3.1. Duty at all Locations for Less than 20 Weeks. Members performing other than annual
        tours who perform duty at one or more locations and the time at each location is less than 20
        weeks are authorized to travel and transportation allowances the same as an active member on
        ordinary TDY.
        6.6.3.2. Duty at any Location for 20 or More Weeks. Members performing a tour that prescribes
        duty at one location for 20 or more weeks are authorized PCS allowances for travel. Dependent
        travel and household good shipments are authorized to and from each location where duty is
        ordered for 20 or more weeks.

6.7. Inactive Duty Training (IDT). (JFTR, par. U7150-C).
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 63


   6.7.1. At the Unit Headquarters or Member's Unit of Assignment. RC member is not authorized
   travel and transportation allowances for any inactive duty training at the city or town in which the unit
   headquarters or the unit of assignment is located. This includes travel between home and unit, atten-
   dance at weekly drills, or duty in lieu of weekly drills.
   6.7.2. At place other than Unit Headquarters or Unit of Assignment. An RC member directed to
   travel to a location other than the assigned unit or headquarters, authorized inactive duty training pay
   for one or more days, is authorized the TDY allowances prescribed in the JFTR, Chapter 4.
   6.7.3. Inactive Duty Training Performed before or after an Active Duty Tour. RC members may per-
   form inactive duty training before or after an active duty tour without the loss of the original travel
   allowances for the Active Duty Tour. The travel voucher should reflect the exact itinerary. Con-
   structed travel computation techniques are applicable, according to the provisions of JFTR, Chapter 4.
   Depending upon the constructed travel day, the member may or may not be authorized additional per
   diem.

6.8. Active Duty without Pay. (JFTR, par. U7150-B).
   6.8.1. Standby Reserve. There is no authorization for travel and transportation allowances for mem-
   bers of the Standby Reserve of the Armed Forces who voluntarily perform active duty training with-
   out pay.
   6.8.2. Technicians (Dual Status). As of 10 February 1996, per diem may be authorized by the Secre-
   tarial Process for dual status military technicians (as described in 10 U.S.C. 10216) while on leave
   from technical employment and performing active duty without pay (5 U.S.C. 6323(d)) outside the
   CONUS. Technicians deploying to designated OCONUS who exercise the 44-day leave option, are
   authorized TDY allowances prescribed in the JFTR, Chapter 4.
   6.8.3. Others. Except as provided by 6.8.2., other RC members who perform duty without pay may
   be authorized/approved occasional meals, quarters, and/or the applicable mileage rate for travel to and
   from their duty stations, including travel required in connection with qualifying physical examinations
   or conditions precedent to the duty involved. They are not authorized per diem or AEA at the duty
   station (44 Comp. Gen. 615 (1965) or 46 Comp. Gen. 319 (1996))

6.9. Members of the Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (SROTC). (JFTR, par. U7150-E).
   6.9.1. Definitions. Members of SROTC (10 U.S.C. 2104) are non-scholarship cadets. Members of
   SROTC (10 U.S.C. 2107) are scholarship cadets. All SROTC members travel on Invitational Travel
   Orders.
   6.9.2. Non-scholarship Cadets. (10 U.S.C. 2104; JFTR, par. U7150-E2d). Individuals are authorized
   mileage reimbursement only. Whether the cadet is the owner/operator or passenger of the POC, they
   are authorized this allowance.
      6.9.2.1. Transportation for Examination or to Observe. (JFTR, par. U7150-E2(b)). SROTC
      advance training members or designated applicants may be furnished transportation and subsis-
      tence, or be paid mileage as prescribed in JFTR, par. U7150-E2(c) and (d) for travel to and from
      installations.
64                                                                      AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


        6.9.2.2. Transportation for Field Training. (JFTR, par. U7150-E2(a)). SROTC advance training
        members or designated applicants are authorized transportation between home or the location of
        the SROTC unit, as specified in the orders, and the authorized field-training site.
     6.9.3. Scholarship Cadets. (10 U.S.C. 2107; JFTR, par. U7150-E3). Travel to Accept Appointment.
     These cadets are authorized PCS allowances as for officer members as outlined in JFTR, Volume 1,
     Chapter 5, Part B. The allowances may not exceed those payable from the appointee’s permanent res-
     idence, home, school, or duty station at the time travel begins to the educational institution. The
     owner/operator of this POC is authorized MALT PLUS Per Diem while the passengers of the POC are
     authorized per diem only.

6.10. Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) Reservists. HPSP reservists are required to
perform 45-day tours of duty. The location or medical facility where they perform this tour of duty nor-
mally has government quarters and meals available.

6.11. Service Charges for Quarters/Surcharge in Government Dining Facility.
     6.11.1. RC members not authorized per diem or AEA, who occupy transient government housing
     while performing active duty for training, may be reimbursed the actual lodging cost.

6.12. Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) Leave Travel/In Place Consecutive Overseas Tour
(IPCOT). (JFTR, par. U7200). COT leave travel must be authorized in the member's orders. Travel is
authorized to the home of record (HOR) or a place not to exceed the cost to the HOR. (Exception: The
Secretary of the Air Force has authorization to approve any place according to JFTR, par. U7200-A3b).
The HOR must be stated in the orders.
     6.12.1. Travel Time for COT Travel. Travel time for COT travel is computed the same as normal
     PCS travel according to JFTR, par. U5160. Each separate leg of the journey is computed indepen-
     dently with travel time allowed for each leg based on the mode(s) used per the JFTR, par. U5160.
     (See Figure 6.1. and Figure 6.2.).
     6.12.2. Deferred COT.
        6.12.2.1. The COT leave travel entitlement is meant to be used between the losing and gaining
        PDS. However, if due to service emergencies the member, who must traverse CONUS to get to
        their new PDS, cannot use the COT leave travel entitlement en route, the losing commander can
        authorize a deferment. See par. 6.13.2.4 for members who do not have to traverse CONUS to get
        to their new PDS. The deferment approval must be based on mission reasons, not the personal
        preference of the member. The losing commander must evaluate the need to defer the members
        COT leave travel entitlement on an individual basis. The losing commander is the only approval
        authority for COT leave travel deferment for members. This is not a rubber stamp program. The
        losing commander must evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the need to defer the member’s COT
        leave travel based solely on service exigencies. Examples of service exigencies include extreme
        manning shortages at the losing station, the need to avoid disruption of dependent school sched-
        ules if the member is required to rotate during the school term, or immediate reporting require-
        ments at the new PDS. When granting a COT deferment the losing commander must consider the
        member’s report-not-later-than date (RNLTD), date eligible for return from overseas (DEROS),
        and whether mission reasons prevent the member from taking at least 11 days of leave en route.
        This does not preclude the losing commander from authorizing leave (non-COT) en route during
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               65


       the PCS. If the losing commander determines the member cannot be released for 11 days or more
       of leave en route and still allow the member to meet the RNLTD, then a deferment of the COT
       leave travel entitlement may be justified. If the losing commander determines that a deferment is
       authorized, and the member wants to take leave (non-COT) en route, the losing commander must
       authorize the member leave (non-COT) en route. This determination is based on, but not limited
       to mission requirements, when the member can depart the old PDS, and the RNLTD at the new
       PDS. The PCS orders must reflect the authorization to defer the COT leave travel entitlement and
       the authorization (if applicable) to take leave (non-COT) en route. If the member can take at least
       11 days or more en route, the COT leave travel entitlement has been used.
NOTE: The number of non-COT leave days the member can take en route is limited to 10 days. Mem-
bers who had their COT leave travel entitlement deferred but exceeded the 10-day leave limitation may
request a review of their circumstances. Members must submit a written request for review through their
chain of command to AF/DPPC. The reason for exceeding the 10-day leave limitation must be based on
reasons beyond the member’s control. Members must remember that if the exception to policy is granted
any reimbursement for PCS COT leave travel must be paid back to the government.
       6.12.2.2. If a member is authorized to defer COT leave travel by the losing commander, the fol-
       lowing statement must be included on the PCS order, “Member and/or dependents are authorized
       to defer their COT leave travel entitlement”. If en route leave is granted, an additional statement
       must be included to read “Member is authorized to take not more than 10 days of leave en route in
       conjunction with the COT deferment”. If a member exceeds the authorized en route leave days,
       the COT leave entitlement has been used.
NOTE: The deferral of COT leave does not qualify or allow a member to carry more than 60 days of
leave from one fiscal year to the next.
       6.12.2.3. Members who must traverse CONUS on their way to new PDSs are expected to use their
       COT leave travel entitlement en route. Members traverse the CONUS if they pass across, over, or
       through the CONUS. If the member is unable to use the COT leave travel entitlement en route due
       to mission reasons and the losing commander has granted a deferment of the COT leave travel
       entitlement, the deferment should begin within 6 months of the end of the new tour. Examples:
       Members going PCS from Ramstein AB, Germany to Osan AB, Korea; members going PCS from
       Elmendorf AFB, AK to Ramstein AB, Germany; or members going PCS from Southwest Asia to
       Misawa AB, JA would have to obtain their losing commanders approval in order to defer COT
       leave travel.
       6.12.2.4. Members authorized COT leave travel entitlement that do not traverse the CONUS to
       their new PDS, do not have to obtain the losing commanders permission for COT leave travel
       deferment. Members must remember that the COT leave travel entitlement should begin within 6
       months of the end of the new tour. Examples: Members going PCS from Ramstein AB, Germany
       to Lakenheath AB, UK and members going PCS from Eielson AFB, AK to Elmendorf AFB, AK
       would not have to obtain their losing commanders approval for deferment.
NOTE: The Major Commands (MAJCOMs) on a case by case may waive the 6-month rule.
       6.12.2.5. Limitations on Reimbursement:
           6.12.2.5.1. Members and command-sponsored dependents who qualify for the COT travel and
           transportation allowances are paid from the members old PDS to the member’s HOR to the
           member’s new PDS, or in the case of deferment, from the member’s new PDS to the member’s
66                                                                           AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


            HOR to the member’s new PDS. Authorized travelers can travel to any other location; how-
            ever, reimbursement is limited to the round trip cost to the members HOR. IPCOT travel and
            transportation allowances are paid from member’s current PDS to the member’s HOR and
            return. Authorized travelers can travel to any other location; however, reimbursement is lim-
            ited to the round trip cost to the members HOR. Tours and cruise packages are not authorized
            for reimbursement in connection with COT/IPCOT leave travel. All travelers must contact
            their local Transportation Management Office/(Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (TMO/
            CTO) to make travel arrangements and receive information on travel restrictions for transoce-
            anic travel. Failure to contact the TMO/CTO may result in non-reimbursement of self-pro-
            cured travel.
            6.12.2.5.2. Members and command-sponsored dependents in Alaska authorized COT/IPCOT
            are limited to reimbursement for government procured air travel. Members can file a waiver
            request to allow travel by privately owned conveyance versus government air travel. Mem-
            bers must submit a written justification to the local MPF for approval by HQ PACAF/DP.

6.13. Extended Hospitalization Resulting in Permanent Change of Station (PCS). ( J F T R ,                p a r.
U7252). An attendant for a military member is authorized applicable travel allowance during the time
spent at the medical facility. If it is determined to assign the patient to the hospital (PCS), the attendant's
entitlement to lodging plus/actual expenses will end at 2400 hours on the day after the patient has been
notified of the reassignment.

6.14. Funded Rest and Recuperative (R&R) Leave Transportation. (JFTR, par. U7300). Issuance of
transportation must be supported by a special order. Include in the order:
     6.14.1. Statement that special 15-day leave and space-required transportation to and from R&R desti-
     nation is authorized.
     6.14.2. Fund citation (unit O&M funds).
     6.14.3. Customer identification code (CIC) for AMC airlift.
     6.14.4. Dates travel are to begin and end.

6.15. Disciplinary Travel. (JFTR, par. U7450). Members traveling incident to disciplinary action are
not authorized per diem. Included is travel for the purpose of court-martial or non-judicial punishment
proceedings, including consulting with defense counsel.

6.16. Transportation of Remains of Deceased Members and Deceased Dependents. ( J F T R ,                  p a r.
U7600). See AFI 34-242, Chapter 5 and AFI 24-101, Chapter 2 for further guidance.

6.17. Travel Under Permissive Travel Authorizations. (JFTR, par. U7650). Policy and guidance gov-
erning travel under permissive travel authorizations are covered in AFI 36-3003.

6.18. RC Members Traveling to Medical Appointments. RC members not already on active duty mil-
itary orders may be placed on invitational travel orders (ITOs) when directed by appropriate military med-

                                                  Chapter 7

                                 PREPAYMENT AUDIT PROCEDURES

7.1. Statutory Authority and Limitations.
     7.1.1. The General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agen-
     cies, Fiscal Procedures, Title 7, Chapter 7, paragraph 7.4e, and Appendix iii, prescribe the author-
     ity and liabilities of statistical sampling used in prepayment examination. In summary, the public laws
     on statistical sampling provide that FSOs and their certifying officers, acting in good faith, will not be
     held liable with respect to any certification or payment on a voucher which is not subject to examina-
     tion because of the prescribed sampling procedures, provided that such officer and the Defense
     Finance and Accounting Service have diligently pursued collection action to recover illegal, improper,
     or incorrect payments as prescribed by the Comptroller General.
     7.1.2. Maximum Dollar Limits. The head of each agency may approve the use of statistical sampling
     for prepayment examination of disbursement vouchers for amounts not in excess of $2,500 per
     voucher.
     7.1.3. Travel Voucher Certification. For Customer Service sections where 100 percent audit is not
     performed, certifying officers will use the internal sampling feature in IATS/RTS. The system param-
     eters must be set at a minimum of 10% audit for all travel claims processed. All travel claims over
     $2,500 require audit.

7.2. Definitions:
     7.2.1. Prepayment examination - audit of a voucher prior to the payment. Does not apply to advance
     travel payments.
     7.2.2. Total entitlement - the amount on the "Total Entitlement" line in the Summary of Payment
     block on the voucher before any advance or accrued payments are deducted. Does not include trans-
     portation expenses, such as GTRs, MTAs, TWs, etc., not paid directly to the traveler.
     7.2.3. Trainee - person not fully qualified to perform a function.
     7.2.4. Statistical sampling - used when you want to determine the magnitude of a problem in a total
     population given that it is not economical to perform a 100 percent audit. And, where it is desirable to
     have a very high degree of confidence that the audit results would measure the population characteris-
     tic with a predictable precision. Statistical sampling requires random sampling to eliminate personal
     biases from the selection process.
     7.2.5. Random sampling - a method of selecting settlement vouchers for prepayment audit that
     assures each qualifying voucher in a consecutive group has equal chance of selection. Random num-
     ber tables, tossing a die, spinning a dial with five numbers, computer assisted number generator, or
     other unbiased methods are available. Please note that sequential sampling of every fifth voucher is
     not random sampling, and is not approved for these prepayment audits.

7.3. Areas Approved.
     7.3.1. Statistical sampling must be used for all travel settlement vouchers with total entitlement of
     $2,500 or less, and not computed by a trainee.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                              73


   7.3.2. Major Command Directors of Accounting and Finance or FSOs may determine a limit less than
   $2,500 per voucher.

7.4. Implementation. It is mandatory for FSOs to use these continuous sampling procedures. Major
Commands should monitor implementation of these procedures; however, FSOs must keep all documen-
tation as prescribed by 7.6.2.4.

7.5. Payment Sampling and Review of Settled Travel Claims.
   7.5.1. A pre-payment examination (audit) is required to ensure that travel vouchers contain the neces-
   sary substantiation and documentation for lawful and proper payment. Perform these audits on all
   travel vouchers $2,500 and over, and on a statistical sampling of vouchers less than $2,500. Areas to
   examine are:
      7.5.1.1. Payment is permitted by law and applicable instructions.
      7.5.1.2. Required administrative authorizations and approvals for payment are obtained.
      7.5.1.3. Request for payment is supported by basic documents.
      7.5.1.4. Name and address of payee, as verified by database, is correct.
      7.5.1.5. Manual calculations are correct or appropriate and correct data is put into automated com-
      putation systems.
      7.5.1.6. All transactions are properly charged to the correct appropriation.
      7.5.1.7. Appropriations are available at the time to support disbursement. (Indicated by appropri-
      ate signatures on orders.)
      7.5.1.8. Special certificates or receipts are attached to the voucher, as required.
      7.5.1.9. Duplicate payments are prevented through proper manual or automated edits and checks.
      (See Figure 7.1.)
   7.5.2. In preparing to select claims for random audit, estimate the number of claims expected to be
   processed for the current month. Use past data, such as an average of the past three months, to make
   this estimate. The estimate is needed to determine the sample size and sample selection criteria. Use
   only claims under $2,500 for this estimate, as only claims under $2,500 may be randomly audited. All
   claims $2,500 and over (excluding transportation costs) must be audited.
   7.5.3. The chart in Figure 7.4. provides the approximate sample size based upon the estimated total
   number of claims for the given month. If the estimated total number of claims subject to sampling is
   less than 50, then review all claims. For example, if the estimated number of TDY claims is 2,000, the
   sample size will be about 95. The sampling interval would be 21 in this example. A random start
   from 1 to 21 would be selected. Every 21st claim would be selected for audit until the entire popula-
   tion (2,000) was exhausted and the total sample (95) achieved. Note that the actual sample size will
   probably vary from the estimate. Also note that your sampling interval remains the same during the
   month. At the beginning of the next month a different sampling interval may be used based on a
   revised estimate of the population size.
74                                                                             AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     7.5.4. Paragraph 7.5.3. of this instruction reflects a manual sampling interval/selection process. The
     Directorate for Finance and Accounting Systems Transition is testing the automated systems to ensure
     their sampling procedures correspond to the procedures approved by DFAS-HQ.
         7.5.4.1. If you use the Integrated Automated Travel System (IATS), use the instructions above and
         the chart following the checklist to estimate your population and sample size. After determining
         those amounts, divide your sample size by the population to get the percent of vouchers to be
         audited. Go into IATS maintenance (percentages and constants) and insert the appropriate per-
         centage. Also, ensure the parameter for dollar threshold audit is set at $2,500.00.
         7.5.4.2. If you use another automated travel system, ensure the system’s random selection proce-
         dure gives each voucher under $2,500 an equal chance of selection for audit. Ensure you use the
         method in 7.5.3. when estimating the population and determining the sample size. If this is the
         case, you may use the automated auditing capability of your system to select your vouchers to be
         audited.
         7.5.4.3. If your systems do not meet the above criteria, you must use the manual method until your
         systems are enhanced to meet DFAS-HQ guidelines. If you are on a system other than IATS, and
         do not know if your system meets the above criteria, contact your systems component for informa-
         tion.
     7.5.5. Automated systems currently flag vouchers for auditing and release the block to the lead clerk
     or travel supervisor for audit. The lead clerk or travel supervisor continues to perform this function.
     However, the auditor will use the checklist at the end of this message when reviewing the travel
     claims selected for audit. If a claim contains a discrepancy not listed on the checklist, list it as a mis-
     cellaneous error, either TDY (Category 15) or PCS (Category 14), and specify the reason for error on
     a separate sheet. These checklists are part of the mandatory reporting procedures, when released by
     SAF/FM.
     7.5.6. The checklists referred to in par. 7.5.5. of this instruction follows. It provides a list of items that
     should be reviewed in the for monthly population sizes greater 7,000, the sampling interval is about
     equal to the population size divided by 100. For example, if the number of TDY vouchers processed
     each month is approximately 7,500, then the sampling interval is 75, the sampling frequency is 1/75
     and the total number of TDY vouchers selected for audit is about 100.
     7.5.7. DFAS-DE Field Sites have no responsibility in monitoring Air Force travel computation
     pre-payment audit and reporting requirements.

7.6. Documentation Requirements.
     7.6.1. Vouchers examined must carry evidence of the examination. When a voucher has an "audited
     by" block and that voucher is examined under these procedures, the "audited by" block must be ini-
     tialed, otherwise this block is left blank. When a voucher requires certification, such as SF Form
     1164, the word "audited" is included above the signature; otherwise a signature only is required.
     7.6.2. Monthly summary reports, supported by worksheets, are prepared for review and analysis by
     the FSO. The FSO uses these reports to determine whether to continue the prepayment audit proce-
     dures, or whether to limit use of the procedures to certain technicians, or specific types of payments,
     and whether corrective action to minimize errors is appropriate and adequate.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               75


     7.6.2.1. Audit log worksheets may consist of copies of voucher logs, spreadsheet forms, or com-
     puter-generated products.
     7.6.2.2. Whatever method is used, the audit log must be in original order of receipt of vouchers for
     processing. It must include all vouchers, not just the settlement vouchers or those within the dollar
     limit set by the FSO/Field Site for prepayment audit sampling. This ensures the documentation
     supports the sample plan and shows which vouchers were excluded from the sampling and why
     (such as, advance payment, disbursements over the dollar limit above, or voucher processed by
     trainees). The following minimum data are required.
        7.6.2.2.1. Voucher identification of each voucher examined. Employee last name and SSN
        should be used as a minimum, since the voucher is audited prior to assigning a voucher num-
        ber for payment.
        7.6.2.2.2. Total dollars disbursed for the month. This allows the FSOs/Field Sites to project
        the total impact of discrepancies (errors) on their total account.

                               PROCESSING TRAVEL VOUCHERS

Section 8A—Military Travel

8.1. General. The Privacy Act of 1974 affects all travel claims. Each form that solicits personal data
contains a Privacy Act statement, either incorporated in the body of the form or in a separate statement
accompanying each form. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining records subject to the Pri-
vacy Act of 1974. Privacy Act system notice number A0037-1 MTMC, Defense Travel System, applies.
Upon completion of travel, the traveler furnishes a complete statement of all travel performed according
to the travel order. Final settlement vouchers, including no-pay vouchers, must contain a complete itiner-
ary for the entire travel period including round-trip temporary duty (TDY) away from a TDY point and all
leave periods used. The FSO is not required to pay incomplete, improperly prepared, or doubtful claims.
AF Form 828, Incomplete Travel Claim or Notice, or computer-generated substitute may be used to return
incomplete travel claims to the claimant. The Customer Support area establishes internal controls and
necessary procedures to ensure receipt of required information.

8.2. Forms. These forms are authorized for paying travel allowances to travelers:
   8.2.1. DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher.
   8.2.2. DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher.
   8.2.3. DD Form 1351-2c, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher (Continuation Sheet).
   8.2.4. DD Form 1351-3, Statement of Actual Expenses.
   8.2.5. DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Travel Payment List.
   8.2.6. SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business.
   8.2.7. AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour.

8.3. Use of the Forms. These permit a choice between one payment on one form or multiple payments
on two or more forms. Use of other forms or deviation from these is not authorized:
   8.3.1. DD Form 1351--to pay travel advances, supplemental payments or as the coversheet to multi-
   ple payments.
   8.3.2. DD Form 1351-2 –to pay completed travel for military, civilian and their dependents, if appli-
   cable.
       8.3.2.1. Use DD Form 1351-2 as a consolidated statement of travel for a number of persons with
       identical itineraries. Show the individual settlements on DD Form 1351-6. Voucher the DD Form
       1351-2. Use this form for dependents' travel and dislocation allowance. In addition this form is to
       be used for submitting claims for reimbursement for transportation of mobile homes used as a res-
       idence. Also used to substantiate a supplemental payment when a corrected itinerary is necessary.
   8.3.3. DD Form 1351-2c. Use this form as a continuation sheet for DD Form 1351-2.
   8.3.4. DD Form 1351-3. Use this form to claim actual subsistence expenses for travel and TDY per-
   formed under an actual expense basis.
82                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


     8.3.5. DD Form 1351-6. Use this form to make multiple payments for travel and TDY performed
     under like conditions and circumstances. Do not use when paying civilian PCS advances.
     8.3.6. SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business. The authorization
     for reimbursement of expenses incurred within and around a TDY station are normally included in the
     order and claimed in item 5 of the DD Form 1351-2. If reimbursement for expenses is approved after
     the travel, use a SF 1164 to show approval and attach it to the DD Form 1351-2. SF 1164 is also used
     to claim expenses incurred in connection with recruiter duty and expenses incurred within and around
     the permanent duty station.

8.4. Voucher Preparation. Travelers complete all vouchers, schedules, claims, and attached statements
using non-erasable ink or electronic form programs. Make voucher entries as specifically directed. A
voucher must be submitted any time travel is performed incident to a travel order regardless of monetary
allowances accruing. All Reserve Component members who performed duty in a commute status not
within the corporate limits, and were not in per diem status, may submit their AF Form 938 with com-
pleted POV statement for claims of mileage only in place of a DD Form 1351-2.
EXCEPTIONS: Civilians who travel on orders at no expense to the Government are not required to file
a voucher. Individuals who travel on unfunded EML orders are not required to file a voucher.

8.5. DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher.
     8.5.1. Block 3-Payment for. Check appropriate block for item of entitlement being paid (items a.
     through h.). If entitlement being paid is not listed, enter entitlement in items i. or j.
     8.5.2. Block 5-Individual Payment. Enter traveler identification data in items a. through e. The enti-
     tlement(s) and amount(s) being advanced must be identified in item f. Amount of allowance either
     requested or computed will be entered in item f.
     8.5.3. Block 8-Remarks. Enter an explanation of how entitlement was computed, if required. When
     paying supplemental payments or advances for separation/retirement travel refer to Chapter 8 and
     Chapter 9 for additional requirements.

8.6. DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. This form is used in the settlement of PCS and
TDY claims for all travelers. Unless otherwise specified, travelers must furnish the following informa-
tion in their travel statements.
     8.6.1. Itinerary:
        8.6.1.1. Duty status statement.
        8.6.1.2. TDY. Annotate words "duty", "non-duty", or "N/A" (not available for duty) as applicable
        as the first and last entry, and on the departure day from the TDY point. This entry will suffice as
        member's certification as to whether member did (duty) or did not (N/A) perform duty for the
        majority of the day on the departure/arrival day from or to the PDS or perform duties on the depar-
        ture day from TDY point. "Non-duty" means member's regularly scheduled non-duty day.
        8.6.1.3. PCS. For departure day annotate "out-processing" only if out-processing was actually
        performed on departure day from old PDS. If TDY en route is involved, reflect a duty status state-
        ment for the departure day from the TDY point. Determine allowable travel time, leave, or pro-
        ceed time charges (do not use estimated travel time as shown on the travel orders). Note: For
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                              83


     ACSC/AWC Students, have the member certify the departure date, since these students normally
     out-process en masse a week prior to graduation.
     8.6.1.4. Date travel begins.
     8.6.1.5. Date of arrival and departure at each of these places:
         8.6.1.5.1. Place(s) of TDY.
         8.6.1.5.2. Place(s) at which transportation mode changes.
         8.6.1.5.3. Place(s) of delay en route incident to the transportation mode. Do not list routine
         connecting stops in CONUS except for ground locations at 2400 hours and arrivals or depar-
         tures at port of embarkation (POE) or port of debarkation (POD). When travel is performed by
         privately owned conveyance (POC), it is necessary to list all overnight stops for TDY travel.
         8.6.1.5.4. Place(s) where leave is taken. If leave is taken while TDY with a subsequent return
         to the same TDY location, points of travel must be shown. Military traveling PCS entirely by
         POC need not show leave locations in the itinerary.
         8.6.1.5.5. Place of receipt of cancellation, modification, or revocation of orders.
         8.6.1.5.6. From TDY point to PDS or home for personal reasons.
         8.6.1.5.7. Vehicle processing ports/VPCs for the pickup or delivery of a POV when shipment
         of POV is authorized for a permanent change of station.
         8.6.1.5.8. For PCS-Show date when arriving for duty at the new PDS.
     8.6.1.6. For TDY-Show date when returning to duty location or residence.
     8.6.1.7. Members of the Reserve components, performing ACDUTRA, whose orders reflect "will
     commute," only need to show departure from home and arrival at duty station and arrival at home
     on the last day of duty. Members whose orders reflect "will not commute," and who voluntarily
     commute are authorized mileage according to JFTR, par. U7150. The voucher must show the first
     and last day of duty and contain the statement "commute daily (date) through (date)."
     8.6.1.8. Except as required in par 8.6.1.7. above, travel during TDY while on pass, during week-
     ends, holidays, and off-duty days, when duty is not required need not be shown on the itinerary
     since this travel does not affect the per diem computation unless the member returns to the home/
     PDS.
  8.6.2. Transportation Modes. List each transportation mode used. This includes all government
  transportation and all transportation modes between points of delay en route chargeable as leave. In
  listing the modes, use a combination of two letters to form a descriptive symbol. The reverse of appli-
  cable forms shows the authorized letters. The first letter shows how transportation was obtained; the
  second letter shows the actual transportation mode used. Travelers must check owner/operator or pas-
  senger block (DD Form 1351-2, block 16), as appropriate, when traveling by POC. Owner/operator
  category includes the person primarily responsible for payment of operating expenses.
  8.6.3. Cost of Lodgings.
     8.6.3.1. Annotate lodging cost(s) in Block 18, if applicable.
84                                                                          AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


        8.6.3.2. A receipt is required for all lodging regardless of amount (JFTR, par. U2510). An admin-
        istrative statement on the orders or on the settlement voucher is required to support the non-avail-
        ability of government quarters. (See JFTR, par. U1045 for quarters availability requirements.)
     8.6.4. Lost or Destroyed Receipts. If a lodging receipt is lost or destroyed, the traveler must provide
     a statement showing dates, places, and amounts. This statement may be either a separate attachment
     or included on the travel voucher.
     8.6.5. Deductible Meals. Show number and date(s) deductible meals were used in block 19.
     8.6.6. Other Considerations:
        8.6.6.1. Advances/Prior Payments. Show advances/prior payments in block 9. Reference con-
        sists of amount, date paid, voucher number, and disbursing station number.

        date and time of admission and discharge is required when traveler is an inpatient for any part of
        the TDY.
        8.6.6.3. Travelers claim terminal mileage (distance) in block 15f or 18.

8.7. DD Form 1351-2c, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. This form is used only as a continuation of
DD Form 1351-2. Preparation is the same as DD Form 1351-2.

8.8. DD Form 1351-3, Statement of Actual Expenses. When using this for travelers claiming actual
expense reimbursement, the traveler prepares the claim as follows:
     8.8.1. Date. Enter each calendar day the traveler is authorized actual expense reimbursement.
     8.8.2. Lodging. (See par. 8.6.3. of this instruction.).
     8.8.3. Meals. The traveler claims the actual amount incurred (plus tip, if applicable) for each appro-
     priate meal. If a free, deductible meal, or meal provided within a registration fee is used, annotate the
     meal block(s) accordingly.
     8.8.4. Laundry/Dry Cleaning. The traveler claims the actual amount incurred for these services when
     appropriate. It is valid to prorate the actual cleaning costs into the entire period of the days actual
     expense is claimed in lieu of claiming a lump sum on any given day.
     8.8.5. Local Transportation. The traveler may claim transportation costs not specifically authorized
     or approved for the travel performed.
     8.8.6. Other. Complete as detailed in note 4 of the DD Form 1351-3.
     8.8.7. Signature and Date. The traveler must sign and date the DD 1351-3 to authenticate the claim.

     puted for the entire period at that location. AEA is not computed for partial days. (JFTR, par.
     U4225-A). The orders-issuing official is required to sign all DD Forms 1351-3 involving claims for
     days of departure and return to the PDS.

8.9. DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Travel Payment List. When using this form to consolidate either
advance payments or final settlement, prepare as follows:
     8.9.1. Page. Number pages in sequence.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 85


   8.9.2. Organization and Station. Identify the organization preparing the list.
   8.9.3. Date of Payment. Enter brief block date, from covering DD Form 1351 or DD Form 1351-2.
   8.9.4. Payee Identification. Enter name, SSN, Travel order number, and traveler’s signature.
   8.9.5. On the line immediately following the last payee named enter "End of listing". Do not pay any-
   one whose name appears after this entry.
       8.9.5.1. Total. Enter total amount of payments shown on preceding lines for the individual page.
       If further pages are used, the last page must shown the grand total for all pages under the column
       headed, amount paid, and the subtotal for the individual page under the column headed "Itinerary
       Designation". Note: Do not use this form when paying civilian PCS entitlement advance(s). Use
       a DD Form 1351 so that each entitlement for which an advance is paid can be identified for proper
       entry into ATRAS.
   8.9.6. When used as a final settlement voucher, use a DD 1351-2 for the itinerary.

8.10. SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business:
   8.10.1. The claimant enters on the SF 1164 all information needed by the line and column designa-
   tions. Also:
       8.10.1.1. Enter the transportation mode used in column D.
       8.10.1.2. If a POC was used, show the distance between points traveled on official business from
       odometer readings. (JFTR, par. U3505). When like trips between the same points are made on a
       repeated basis, one entry on the SF 1164 showing the distance between these points suffices.
       Enter as a statement on the SF 1164 "Repeated number of trips performed". When distance is not
       readily available from actual odometer readings, use the Defense Table of Distances to establish
       distances.
   8.10.2. Submit SF 1164 to the FSO in triplicate when the travel master record is on file in the paying
   FSO.
   8.10.3. When SF 1164 is prepared as a supporting document to a settlement voucher, prepare in the
   same number of copies and for the same distribution required for DD Form 1351-2. Enter the total
   amount claimed on SF 1164 in the appropriate column in block 18 of DD Form 1351-2 with a nota-
   tion, "See SF 1164 attached".
   8.10.4. The claimant dates and signs the SF 1164 in Block 10. Show administrative approvals
   required for entitlement by signature in the approving officer's block, of either the commander or des-
   ignee or the order-issuing approving official. As an optional requirement in cases where the adminis-
   trative approval signature element is not legible, return the form to the claimant for a typed signature
   element. Resource advisors are required to enter the fund cite and initial the SF Form 1164 when used
   as a voucher without supporting orders.

8.11. Travel Itinerary Statement. Upon completion of travel, the traveler furnishes a complete state-
ment of all travel performed according to the travel order. Ensure the travel itinerary accurately shows all
travel conditions having a bearing on travel time, leave, and proceed time. The traveler's statement is the
basis for a claim to travel allowances. As used here, “claim” means the traveler's right to travel allow-
ances as authorized by law and instructions. When the traveler has signed and presented the statement, it
86                                                                           AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


becomes an official, integral part of the claim. As such, it is subject to Article 107, UCMJ and 18 U.S.C.
1001 (false official statements); Article 132, UCMJ and 18 U.S.C. 287 (frauds against the government),
and 28 U.S.C. 2514 (forfeiture of fraudulent claims). Claimant's statement substantiates voucher on
which their dependents' travel account is settled. By signing the original form, claimant authenticates the
statement regardless of who prepares it.

8.12. Statement Use. Examine the travel statement carefully. Compare the information and reconcile
with the terms of the travel order and all other available statements or copies of vouchers of prior travel
payments. Check the travel time between points shown on the statement against the transportation mode
shown. Use the analysis of the statement of travel and supporting documents for:
     8.12.1. Computation of Travel Allowances:
        8.12.1.1. Determine propriety of the claim.
        8.12.1.2. Compute amounts of travel allowances authorized.
     8.12.2. Adjust total amount authorized by the amount of prior payments.
        8.12.2.1. Make payment, adjustment, or reject the claim.
     8.12.3. Computation of Travel Time and Leave. Follow procedures and instructions in Chapter 4,
     and Chapter 5. The technician computes the military travel allowances, reviews voucher, determines
     allowable travel time and leave periods, and completes AF Form 985, Report of travel time and leave.
     If orders erroneously show leave period at PDS before or after TDY, coordinate with military pay and
     the member to ensure proper leave charged. Leave at PDS is properly charged on AF Form 988. For
     civilian travelers, the employee’s supervisor determines chargeable leave.

8.13. Attachments and Statements Affecting Computation. The following attachments are to be used
as applicable:
     8.13.1. Flying/Training Mission. Flight crews engaged in scheduled air transport operations or train-
     ing for such duties, support their claim with either a certified Flight Authorization, or by certification
     of the aircraft commander in Block 21A of DD Form 1351-2.
     8.13.2. Statement of Actual Expenses. JFTR, par. U4200, prescribes the use of a statement of actual
     expenses to support reimbursement on an actual expense allowance basis. Travelers should itemize
     their expenses on a daily basis using DD Form 1351-3. The original of the statement is attached to the
     original DD Form 1351-2 and copies are attached to the FSO’s retained voucher copy and to payee's
     voucher copy.
     8.13.3. Nonavailability of a Directed Transportation Mode:
        8.13.3.1. General. If orders direct travel by a specific transportation mode, but that mode is not
        available, a certificate of non-availability is needed to support payment of MALT or reimburse-
        ment of actual transportation cost. The traffic management office (TMO) at the location from
        which the member departs must issue the certificate (see AFI 24-101). Show on the certificate the
        capacity in which the officer signs and the base or organization for which the officer is acting. If
        a directed mode is not available at departure time, an amendment to the travel order should be
        published to delete this requirement if the non-availability statement cannot be obtained.
        8.13.3.2. Military Air Directed.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                  87


         8.13.3.2.1. If military air is directed but not available and TRs are furnished, this certificate is
         not required.
         8.13.3.2.2. A non-availability statement is not required when a separate journey (leg of travel)
         commences from other than a military installation.
  8.13.4. Use of Commercial Rental Vehicles. When the traveler is authorized and uses a commercial
  rental vehicle, the following items should be attached to the claim:
     8.13.4.1. A receipt from the rental agency itemizing all charges, unless the charges are under $75.
     8.13.4.2. If a mileage charge is included, and the traveler used the vehicle partly for personal use,
     a statement is required showing the number of personal miles driven.
     8.13.4.3. Collision Damage to Rental Vehicles.
         8.13.4.3.1. Travelers will submit claims for reimbursement of personal funds paid for the
         repair of damages to a rental vehicle to the FSO. Documentation to support the claim is out-
         lined in DoDFMR, Vol. 9, Chapter 4 and AFI 51-502, Chapter 2. Prior to submission to the
         FSO, the traveler must forward the claim to the local legal office. The legal office determines
         whether the damage occurred while in the performance of official business. If damage
         occurred while the traveler was performing official business, then reimbursement of the full
         amount claimed, not to exceed the deductible amount contained in the rental agreement, is
         authorized. If the damage occurred while on other than official business, then reimbursement
         is not authorized. The FSO is responsible for final approval of the claim.
         8.13.4.3.2. Claims received by the FSO from a rental car agency or the traveler (when no per-
         sonal funds have been paid) must be forwarded to the local legal office. The legal office deter-
         mines whether the damage occurred while in the performance of official business or if willful
         and wanton negligence on the part of the traveler was involved. If damage occurred while per-
         forming official business, direct payment for the full amount of the claim not to exceed the
         deductible amount contained in the rental agreement is authorized to the rental car agency. If
         the rental car agency is listed on the MTMC agreement and the damage to the rental vehicle is
         due to willful and wanton negligence on the part of the traveler, then the rental car agency
         should be reimbursed or paid for the full cost of repairs to the vehicle. If the damage occurred
         on other than official business, direct payment to the rental car agency in the full amount of the
         damage is authorized; however, the amount paid by the Government must be collected from
         the traveler determined responsible (68 Comp. Gen. 309, B-232352, March 7, 1989). The
         FSO is responsible for final approval of the claim and for pursuing collection action against
         the responsible traveler.
         8.13.4.3.3. If a third party is liable (including the traveler's private insurer), the local legal
         office may assert a claim under the provisions of AFI 51-502. Travelers are required to sign a
         statement that they are aware that any reimbursement for the rental vehicle repair cost received
         from the rental agency, private insurance, or responsible third party is the property of the Air
         Force. The reimbursement must be remitted to the FSO unless the traveler paid the repair cost
         to the rental car agency with personal funds and was not reimbursed by the Air Force.
  8.13.5. Registration and Education/Training Fees. (AFI 65-601, Volume 1.).
88                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


        8.13.5.1. Registration Fees. The authorization or approval for payment of registration fees is a
        function of the orders-issuing official. Registration fees, which are authorized or approved as a
        requirement at federally and non-federally sponsored meetings, are reimbursable.
            8.13.5.1.1. Supporting Documentation.
                8.13.5.1.1.1. Receipts are required for all individual expense amounts of $75 or more.
                (JFTR, par. U2510).
                8.13.5.1.1.2. An itemized receipt or administrative statement indicating meals and lodging
                included in the registration fee when the orders do not include this information. The
                receipt or statement should indicate which meals were included, number of nights lodging,
                and the cost per night.
        8.13.5.2. Education and Training Fees (as defined in Attachment 1 of this instruction). Receipts
        are required for amounts of $75 or more.
     8.13.6. AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect - Use of Government Facilities. AF Form 2282
     is used to claim missed meals or nonuse of government quarters, when government meals and quarters
     are available and directed.
     8.13.7. Government Excess Baggage. The traveler must attach the receipt to the travel settlement
     voucher DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-voucher.

8.14. Signature:
     8.14.1. Claimant's Signatures. Claimant signs and dates the form used to claim travel allowances. If
     DD Form 1351-6 is used, instructions in Chapter 8 apply. If claimant is unable to sign:
        8.14.1.1. Enter an X mark, in parentheses, between the claimant's given name (or names) and sur-
        name. One disinterested person, whose signature and address are entered immediately after the
        claimant’s name, must witness it.
        8.14.1.2. If physically unable to sign by mark, the claimant may authorize another person to sign.
        It must be done in the presence of the claimant and a witness. Certificates are executed by the per-
        son who wrote the signature and by the witness. These must state that the signature was made at
        the request of and in the presence of the claimant and a witness.
        8.14.1.3. A court approved guardian may be authorized to sign the travel claim on behalf of a
        physically or mentally incapable (e.g.,) traveler.
     8.14.2. Blanket/Repeated Travel Order Settlement Vouchers. The approving official prior to payment
     must review settlement vouchers that have used blanket and/or repeated travel orders as the authority
     for travel. The approving official’s review can also be accomplished using separate letters that specif-
     ically address the trip being claimed. These letters must be attached to the original and first copy of
     the settlement voucher. Validation of approving official signature using signature cards, etc. is not
     required. MAJCOMs may approve waivers to this requirement for general officers, wing command-
     ers, commanders of geographically separated units, and other designated travelers occupying similar
     positions.
     8.14.3. Use of Facsimile Signatures. These are authorized on administrative statements supporting
     travel claims (statements of non-availability, etc.). A person who authorized another to use his or her
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                    89


   facsimile signature stamp is responsible for safeguarding against misuse. Use of a facsimile signature
   does not alter the responsibility of the person whose signature is used.
   8.14.4. Delegated Authority for Signing Administrative Statements. The term designee, as used in
   this instruction, generally means a person authorized to sign documents or correspondence. The des-
   ignee signs for the person who has basic responsibility. ("For the Commander", "For the Transporta-
   tion Officer," etc.). This places the designee in a position of responsibility for the facts stated over the
   signature (see DFAS-DE 7010.1-R).
   8.14.5. Use of Power of Attorney. Use of a power-of-attorney is not acceptable.
   8.14.6. Special Instructions. Except for advances, and if individual DD Forms 1351-2 are signed, the
   signature of each individual must be obtained on DD Form 1351-6 whether payment is made by
   check, Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), cash, or if no pay is due. This signature attests to the certifi-
   cate at the top of the multiple travel payments list. For advances, the payee's signature is required only
   as a receipt for cash payment.
   8.14.7. Other Authorized Signatures. The following individuals are authorized to sign a travel claim
   for a deceased traveler:
       8.14.7.1. Legal representative, the executor, administrator, or personal representative.
       8.14.7.2. Surviving spouse (widow or widower).
       8.14.7.3. Summary court officer.

       8.15.3.3. DD Form 1351-6, if requested by the traveler.
   8.15.4. Accountable Station's Copy. If the travel order involves funds of another station, forward a
   copy of that voucher to your servicing Field Site to support the for-others transactions even if no funds
   are chargeable to the appropriation. Attach a copy of the orders (both sides) and all documentation
   relative to transportation by TR or MTA. Copies of vouchers or supporting documents are not
   required for classification codes (see AFMAN 65-604) with the following exceptions: Budget
   projects or subprojects 5769.OZ or 5869.OZ. Send vouchers and supporting documents citing these
   projects or subprojects to DFAS-DE.

8.16. Debt Collection. The FSO initiates collection action on sums due from personnel as a result of
travel. These include an erroneous payment, a delinquent advance, or a balance due from the overpay-
ment of an advance. For erroneous payments resulting from settlement payments, the provisions of 5
U.S.C. 5705 apply for civilian employees and provisions of 37 U.S.C. 1007 apply for military members.
     8.16.1. Cash Collections. Process cash collections using DD Form 1131.
     8.16.2. Involuntary Collections.
        8.16.2.1. Follow-up must be accomplished in accordance with Chapter 9 to attempt cash collec-
        tion.

        processing by the appropriate payroll office.
     8.16.3. For individuals not on local Air Force payroll system, follow procedures in Chapter 8 and
     Chapter 9.

8.17. Adjusting or Collecting Travel Payments--Purpose and Scope. See DFAS-DE Interim Guid-
ance on Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations.

8.18. Control Logs. Control logs are required to be maintained in the FSO for all travel payments and
collections.
     8.18.1. Voucher Control Log. These logs list each voucher in numerical sequence beginning with "1"
     at the start of each new fiscal year (FY), with a "T" prefix for disbursement vouchers and a "CT" pre-
     fix for collections. All numbers must be accounted for. Voucher numbers not being used must be
     voided. The voucher control logs are submitted to the disbursing function in the FSO daily. Receipt
     of vouchers is verified by signing the control logs.
     8.18.2. Leave Document Control Log. Account for travel generated leaves on AF Form 1486, Unit
     Leave Control Log. Information to include on the AF Form 1486 is:
        8.18.2.1. Assign a leave authorization number beginning with "1" at the start of each new fiscal
        year (FY).
        8.18.2.2. Date of voucher payment.
        8.18.2.3. The member's name.
        8.18.2.4. The member's SSN.
        8.18.2.5. The chargeable leave dates.
        8.18.2.6. Date leave processed on the daily register of transactions (DROT). Follow up with Cus-
        tomer Support on any leave authorization numbers that have been used but do not appear on a
        DROT within seven calendar days after the number was issued. A copy of the DROT should be
        obtained to verify processing of all travel-generated leaves. Note: Cross-reference the applicable
        disbursement voucher number.

8.19. Multiple Accounting Classifications and Travel Involving Two Fiscal Years. Travel involving
multiple accounting classifications normally occurs on an order/s with funds of different organizations
used to pay for the travel, or when an order directs travel across two fiscal years. Travel and related trans-
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               91


portation expenses are recorded against the accounting classification in accordance with the guidance
below.
   8.19.1. Per Diem. Charge per diem, including the lodging costs, to the accounting classification/FY
   applicable to each day.
   8.19.2. Reimbursable Expenses. Charge reimbursable expenses, other than transportation expenses,
   to the accounting classification/FY current at the time the expense is paid by the traveler. Expenses
   that are incurred over a period of time, such as rental vehicles, are averaged over the period of time
   and charge on a daily basis to the accounting classification/FY applicable to each day.
   8.19.3. Transportation Expenses (POC). This applies to monetary allowance in lieu of transportation
   (MALT). In determining the accounting classification/FY to charge, divide the travel portion of the
   TDY into legs: PDS to TDY station; between TDY stations; and TDY station to PDS. Charge the
   accounting classification applicable when a particular leg begins. If leave is authorized, charge the
   accounting classification current on the first day of allowable travel for the leg.
   8.19.4. Travel Involving Two FYs.
       8.19.4.1. Post that portion of an order representing a valid obligation of current year funds where
       travel starts in one FY and is completed in the next FY.
       8.19.4.2. Post the advance in the current FY, including the portion of the advance that applies to
       travel extending into the next FY.
       8.19.4.3. After FY-end closeout, establish an obligation for the amount expected to be earned in
       the new FY. Do not adjust the advance payment.
       8.19.4.4. The paying FSO adjusts the portion of the advance paid at the time of settlement as fol-
       lows.
       8.19.4.5. Subtract the advance from the entitlements earned against the accounting classification
       the advance was originally paid out of.
       Example:
       Advance paid in FY 00 $600
       Total entitlement earned in FY 00: $400
       Total entitlement earned in FY 01: $210
       Amount due traveler: $10
       Record transactions in the accounting classification:
       5703400 300 XXXX XXXXXX XX 409 XXXXXX ($200.00)
       5713400 301 XXXX XXXXXX XX 409 XXXXXX $210.00
       8.19.4.6. Ensure the net adjustments processed in the internal records agree with adjustments
       made in the accounting classification.
       8.19.4.7. Examples of input for BQ and processing instructions are in DFAS 7077.2-M, Section
       30.
92                                                                           AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


        8.19.4.8. Line item accounting on for-others and CMA settlement or supplemental travel vouch-
        ers is required to allow accountable stations to record expenses against the proper accounting clas-
        sification and financial data elements. Under the voucherless travel system, vouchers are not
        forwarded to the accountable station; therefore, it is critical for the paying FSO to process the enti-
        tlement expenses to the proper accounting classification and financial data elements.

8.20. Refusal of Amount Due. When the settlement voucher is computed and the traveler refuses to
accept all or part of the total amount due, process the voucher as prescribed below:
     8.20.1. If the traveler offers the refused amount as a gift to the Air Force, collect the gift into receipt
     account 571299, Gifts to the United States Not Otherwise Classified (see AFI 51-601):
        8.20.1.1. The traveler signs for the total amount due.
        8.20.1.2. Prepare DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, with the normal entries. In addition,
        an offer and acceptance of the gift is entered on the DD Form 1131.
        8.20.1.3. Unconditional Offer of Gift. "I (name) do hereby voluntarily and unconditionally, give,
        transfer and convey $(amount), free and clear of all encumbrances, to the Secretary of the Air
        Force (or designee), acting on behalf of the United States of America, to have and to hold abso-
        lutely, the same forever, hereby relinquishing for myself, my executors, administrators, heirs and
        assigns all ownership, rights, interest and possession therein. Signature:_____________
        Date:________.”
        8.20.1.4. Gift Acceptance. "Dear (name), I received your offer of gift dated (date) by which you
        transferred $(amount) to the United States as a gift. By authority of the Secretary of the Air Force,
        I accept with pleasure your gift of $(amount) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2601. Thank you for your
        kindness and generosity. Sincerely yours, (Authorized Signature)."
        8.20.1.5. Give the traveler completed copies of the disbursement and collection vouchers.
        8.20.1.6. Ensure that the disbursing voucher and collection voucher is properly cross-referenced.
            8.20.1.6.1. On the disbursement voucher, enter: "Traveler donated $ (amount) and it is col-
            lected on collection voucher (number), dated, ADSN of (number)."
            8.20.1.6.2. On the collection voucher enter: "See disbursement voucher (number) dated
            (date) ADSN (number) for payment collection computation."
     8.20.2. If traveler declines to offer the refused amount as a gift to the Air Force:
        8.20.2.1. Enter the amount accepted in the Amount Paid block of the traveler voucher.
        8.20.2.2. Annotate the voucher with the statement "Traveler Refuses the Total Amount Due of
        $(amount) and accepts only $(amount)."
        8.20.2.3. Retain a balance of the established unliquidated obligation equal to the entitlement
        amount refused by the traveler. This is necessary in case the traveler later requests the remainder
        of the entitlement (54 Comp. Gen. 393 (1974) and 26 Comp. Gen. 956 (1947)). This balance is
        retained as a valid obligation for 6 years (statute of limitations) after the date travel was per-
        formed. Retain a copy of the signed memorandum declining the entitlement with the AEU sup-
        porting documents.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 93


8.21. Promotional Gratuities. (See AFI 51-601).

8.22. Travel Payments Control. Each voucher for a travel payment must cite the last previous voucher
paid under the same travel authority. Settlement vouchers supported by blanket or repeated travel orders
need only cite previous vouchers paid in conjunction with the particular trip being claimed.
   8.22.1. Voucher Distribution. If the ADSN charged is not the traveler’s final destination, send a copy
   of the voucher to the FSO responsible for paying travel allowances for the traveler’s PDS.
   8.22.2. By Whom Applied. The FSOs identified below apply the controls as indicated:
       8.22.2.1. Old Servicing FSO (if travel is a PCS):
           8.22.2.1.1. Gives traveler a copy of voucher and forwards copy to gaining/servicing FSO.
       8.22.2.2. Servicing TDY Station or TDY en Route:
           8.22.2.2.1. Gives traveler a copy of voucher and forwards copy to gaining/servicing FSO.
       8.22.2.3. New Servicing FSO (if travel is PCS):
           8.22.2.3.1. Use the Central Travel History Record (CTHR) to verify any previous payments
           made to the traveler, if applicable. Use documents borrowed from traveler, if necessary, to
           verify entitlements in settling the travel allowances. Attach all source documents to the
           retained copy of the member’s PCS settlement voucher.
       8.22.2.4. Applies To. These controls are applied to all Air Force personnel in a travel status.

AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               95


8.26. Retirement /Separation. Final payments for dependent travel may be paid prior to the effective
date of member’s separation or retirement; however, to avoid possible overpayments dependent vouchers
cannot be settled prior to settlement of member’s voucher. If dependent vouchers are received prior to the
member’s voucher, return voucher to the member for resubmission with the member’s settlement voucher.
Vouchers must be suspended in case any change to the JFTR are made between date of payment and
actual date of separation or retirement, which would impact the member’s entitlement. All retirement/
separation vouchers are settled by the losing FSO.
   8.26.1. If traveler has an indebtedness at separation or retirement, see DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
   Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations.
   8.26.2. Retiree, Select Overseas Home of Selection (HOS). When a retired member selects a home in
   an overseas location, which is not the member's HOR or point from which the member was initially
   called or ordered to active duty, the member's reimbursement is limited to the cost to the government
   had the member selected a home at a specified place in the CONUS (JFTR, par. U5130-A1).
       8.26.2.1. The limitation for travel and transportation reimbursement and the shipment of house-
       hold goods (HHG) costs must be based on the same CONUS location. The point, which is most
       advantageous for travel purposes, is not always the point most advantageous for the shipment of
       HHG. Follow these steps:
       8.26.2.2. At the retirement briefing, MPFs should advise members who elect to retire in an over-
       seas location to contact their local FSO for assistance and counseling on determining and docu-
       menting the CONUS point on which their travel and transportation entitlement is to be based.
       8.26.2.3. The FSO should counsel the member on entitlements according to JFTR, par.
       U5130-A1. The member should be advised that travel is not required to the specified CONUS
       point, only designate it to be used for travel and transportation (including HHG) cost comparisons.
       FSO should pick the further point from the PDS and explain the travel entitlements to that point.
       8.26.2.4. The retiree should be sent to TMO for counseling. The TMO determines the point most
       advantageous for the shipment of HHG. The TMO provides the member with the estimated cost
       for the shipment of HHG to the overseas HOS, the point mentioned above and the point selected
       by the FSO based on the member's estimated weight of HHG. The retiree should be sent back to
       the FSO.
       8.26.2.5. The FSO determines the member's travel entitlements to the point selected as most
       advantageous for shipment of HHG. At this time the retiree must select a CONUS point that is
       most advantageous when considering HHG shipment and travel entitlements. This point must be
       documented and used by the TMO and FSO for entitlement purposes.

Section 8B—Dependent Travel

8.27. Members must substantiate claims for reimbursement for travel of dependents in these spe-
cific cases:
   8.27.1. Travel Orders. Members must support claims for reimbursement with three copies of the PCS

   ceding PCS orders also must be furnished. When a PCS order is amended, rescinded, or revoked after
   dependents commence travel, three copies of the change of orders must be furnished, and a statement
   showing date and place notice was received.
96                                                                       AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005

        8.27.2.2. If dependents performed transoceanic travel at personal expense, a receipt must be
        obtained showing the kind of transportation, the cost, and the points between which the transpor-
        tation was used. Obtain a certificate from the origin TMO stating government procured transpor-
        tation was not available, if appropriate. A U.S Flag Air Carrier must be used, if not available, a
        statement to this effect is required. (JFTR, Chapter 3, part B).
     8.27.3. Assignment from Unaccompanied Tour to Accompanied Tour. When a member is relieved
     from an unaccompanied tour and is assigned to an accompanied tour or when the restriction against

8.28. Dependent Travel for Home Basing and Follow-on Assignments. If the member's order restricts
travel of dependents to the home-basing/follow-on location and transportation is performed to a different
location, PCS allowances are payable according to JFTR, Chapter 5, Part C. When such payments are
made, report the violation of the home-basing/follow-on agreement to the local MPF for possible change
in assignment action.

     claim or by separate attachment, is permitted in lieu of the document required in 8.29.1. above. This
     statement must include the words that permanent government quarters were not assigned.
NOTE: A member with dependents who does not relocate the dependents is considered a member with-
out dependents for DLA.
     8.29.3. Promotions after PCS Order Issuance. Members, promoted after PCS orders issuance and on
     or before the effective date of orders, are authorized DLA based on the higher grade. Examples of

   8.30.1. Reference to Secretarial Finding. When a member performs more than one PCS in the same
   FY in which a Secretarial determination is required for payment of DLA (JFTR, par. U5620 and AFI

Section 8D—Shipment and Storage of Privately Owned Vehicle

8.31. Claims Procedure and Authority for Shipment of Privately Owned Vehicle. The PCS o rder
and DD Form 788, Private Vehicle Shipping Document for Automobile, are required to support payments
for travel to and from the vehicle port/VPC. In case where a member performs PCS travel and has a com-
mercial shipping firm process the vehicle for transport to and from the vehicle port/VPC at government
expense, a DD Form 788 is normally not in the member’s possession at the time the claim is processed for
payment. The DD Form 788 or a statement from the member accompanied by a copy of the commercial
firm to support the payment is acceptable in this instance. Note: A separate temporary duty (TDY) order
is not required when a separate trip is performed for members travel using the PCS order. JFTR, par.
U5425-B, authorizes reimbursement for shipment of a privately owned vehicle (POV) at personal
expense but only in exceptional cases. Make these reimbursements on an SF 1113, Public Voucher for
Transportation Charges, and an SF 1113a, Public Voucher for Transportation Charges (Memorandum
Copy). Support the voucher with the member's PCS orders, statement of the government representative
who furnished the erroneous advice resulting in the member shipping POV at personal expense (51 Comp
Gen. 838 (1972)), and TMO’s statement concerning constructed government cost, and receipt for costs
incurred.
98                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


8.32. Claims Procedures and Authority for Storage of Privately Owned Vehicle. JFTR, par. U5464,
authorizes reimbursement for storage of a privately owned vehicle (POV) when POV transportation is not
authorized or storage in connection with contingency operation TDY. The member must provide a copy
of the PCS/contingency TDY order and a copy of the paid storage receipt. POV storage payments are
made after the fact, on a monthly basis.

       ing (FITW) deduction at the current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rate in the payment
       computation payment block of the payment voucher as appropriate. (See DFAS-DE 7077.2-M,
       Section 30).

Section 8F—Mobile Home Allowance
8.36. Forms. DD Form 1351-2 is used to claim mobile home allowance.
8.37. Substantiating Documents. The member's travel order supporting the voucher must contain
authority to move a mobile home. In the case of personally procured transportation of a mobile home, a
statement of authorization issued by a TMO is required. Include the information prescribed below.
    8.37.1. Information Necessary for Computations. Complete DD Form 1351-2, Block 15 to show the
    starting point and destination within CONUS or Alaska.
    8.37.2. Dependent Travel Authorization. When a mobile home is transported to or from a designated
    place under JFTR, par. U5505, the claim must be supported with three copies of the orders authorizing
    the dependents' travel to the member's station.
    8.37.3. Evidence of Movement by Personally Procured Commercial Transportation. Where a claim
    involved movement of a mobile home by personally procured commercial transportation, the original
    voucher must be supported with the original or legible copy of the commercial transporter’s bill. The
    bill must be completely itemized to preclude the settlement of unauthorized costs. Where the voucher
    includes settlement of an advance of mobile home allowance and the transporter is the same one sub-
    mitting the estimate on which the advance was based, the FSO attaches to the DD Form 1351-2 the
    transportation agent's statement furnished with a copy of the DD Form 1351 received from the FSO
    who paid the advance. The claimant uses either a paid or unpaid bill to support claim for mobile home
    allowance.

                                                ADVANCES

9.1. Forms. The forms to be used to advance travel allowances are DD Forms 1351 and 1351-6. DD
Form 1351 is the only form that can be used for separation/retirement travel and civilian PCS entitle-
ments.
      9.1.1. DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher.
      9.1.2. DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Travel Payment List.

9.2. Department of Defense (DoD) Standard Travel Advance Policy. (DoDFMR, Volume 9.) It is
departmental policy that travel advances are not authorized unless an exception is granted to the standard
practice of the traveler using his or her individual government travel card or the traveler is an infrequent
traveler and does not have a government travel card. Individuals who have a government travel card must
obtain their cash needs via the travel card ATM. Personnel who do not have the government travel card
must obtain advances through EFT. All Air Force military and civilian employees with the government
travel card that travel, including permanent change station (PCS), are strongly encouraged to use the card
for expenses incurred during official travel. Cardholders must charge lodging expenses in connection
with official travel, including destination point and while en route. Lodging expenses charged to the card
must be in support of government travel only. Cardholders may charge transportation expenses, local
ground transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on travel orders. Such transportation must be in
support of government business only. Cardholders may charge meal expenses in connection with official
travel only while away from their home installation, including while en route to or from their travel loca-
tion. Cards may be used during a PCS. Cardholders in a PCS status must assure that all card charges are
paid in a timely manner. If the PCS will take more than 45 days, cardholders are allowed an EFT advance
to their financial institution to cover card charges.

9.3. Unique Requirements:
      9.3.1. Separation/Retirement. A member who is separating or retiring can be paid an EFT advance
      incidental to separation/retirement no more than 10 workdays prior to the member and/or depen-
      dent(s) actual travel dates. Retirees and their dependents may be advanced one hundred percent of the
      amount computed under 9.5.2. below. For separation travel, other than those members serving less
      than ninety percent of their initial prescribed period of service, the member may be advanced MALT
      or transportation cost for personal travel only and seventy five percent of the applicable MALT or
      transportation cost only for the dependents. Per diem is not authorized in advance. For members sep-
      arating with less than ninety percent prescribed service of their initial enlistment, see JFTR, pars.
      U5165 and U5250 for advances and JFTR, par. U5125 for entitlements. For members separating
      under other than honorable conditions, see JFTR, par. U5165.
         9.3.1.1. If the retiree selects an overseas HOS see Figure 9.4. for a sample letter for the retiree to
         accomplish with the help of the FSO and TMO. This letter documents the member's selection of
         the CONUS point on which their travel and transportation entitlement will be based. This letter
         should be accomplished in four copies. The original should be held at the TMO and the other
         three are retained by the member, two of which are to filed with the member’s advance and settle-
         ment voucher.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                              109


      9.3.1.2. Separatees must indicate in section V (DD Form 1351) the city and state of their intended
      destination.
   9.3.2. Group Advances. The following procedure may be used for advance travel payments for
   groups on a processing line. When the traveler comes to the counter for an advance, annotate copies
   of the travel orders with the daily voucher number assigned for advances. Also, write the amount of
   the advance and the appropriate accounting classification on each travel order, if more than one is
   present. Give a copy of the order to the cashier who will enter the payment data on either a DD Form
   1351-1 or DD Form 1351-6. The FSO balances with the cashier and prepares a DD Form 1351-cover
   sheet.
   9.3.3. Civilian Employee Permanent Change of Station. Employees are to maximize use of the GTC
   for PCS travel. If an employee does not have a GTC an EFT advance by the FSO may be made.
   Advances covering employee PCS moves are to be made in incremental amounts to meet reimburs-
   able expenses as they are expected to occur. Advances should be processed at the losing station for
   only those allowances, which the employee expects to incur a related expense concurrent with travel
   to the new PDS. Each allowance being advanced must be identified on the payment voucher along
   with the dollar amount paid. The following entitlement codes are used to record the payment into the
   accounting system, at the accountable station, and may be used in lieu of the entitlement name to iden-
   tify the allowance being advanced on the payment voucher:
                      EM - Employee Travel
                      DP - Dependent Travel
                      HH - House-hunting Trip
                      TQ - Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense
                      HG - Household Goods Shipment/Storage (not involving GBL)
                      MH - Mobile Home Movement (not involving GBL)
   Advances for any other PCS allowances are not authorized. To prevent possible overpayments when
   the settlement is processed, advances computed for Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense Allow-
   ance or Household Goods Shipment/Storage should be reduced by twenty eight percent to offset any
   potential tax liability.

9.4. Payment of Advance Travel Allowances
   9.4.1. General. When a request for advance is submitted to the FSO, advise the traveler that any debt
   resulting from the receipt of the advance is subject to deduction from their payroll account. The fol-
   lowing statement is provided to each traveler prior to or upon receipt of an advance: "Pursuant to 5
   U.S.C. 5705 (employees) and 37 U.S.C. 1007(c) (members), any indebtedness resulting from the
   receipt of this advance may be deducted without further notice from your current pay, final pay, or
   other monies due you unless you make voluntary restitution." This notice may be provided on the
   advance payment voucher, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the FSO. Acknowledgment
   (signature) by the traveler is not required. The travel advance payment cannot exceed the estimate
   cost of the official travel. All TDY advances should be paid by the member’s home station except in
   cases of emergency.
110                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


      9.4.2. Mobile Home Allowance. If the member is unable to use the government charge card for ship-
      ment of the mobile home, the member can request an EFT advance. The member's request for EFT
      advanced payment of mobile home allowances must be supported by a written statement from the
      TMO showing the points between which the shipment is authorized based on the member's permanent
      change of station orders and what it would cost to ship the member's prescribed household goods
      allowance at government expense between such points. Procedures covering advance payment of
      mobile home allowance for employees are in JTR, par. C1101 and for members are in JFTR, par.
      U5560.
      9.4.3. Dependent Travel. An EFT advance of dependent travel allowances is authorized and payable
      to the member upon request. An EFT advance will be paid only when it can be determined from the
      member that dependents will relocate from the old station. When the movement of dependents is
      delayed, the member must request an EFT advance of travel allowances from the new station. An
      EFT advance for dependent(s) of a deceased member may be paid by any Air Force installation. The
      paying FSO sends the voucher information by message within two days of payment to the deceased
      member’s servicing FSO.
      9.4.4. Return of Absentees, Stragglers, Deserters or Other Members without Funds. JFTR, par.
      U7400, permits an FSO to advance funds to an absentee, straggler, deserter or other members without
      funds. The funds may equal cost of meal tickets (MTs) and/or government procured transportation
      (formerly called TRs) necessary for travel to the new duty station or place directed by competent
      authority. The FSO advises the member's commander of the amount advanced and the major account-
      ing classification from which funds were advanced. This advance is entered on the member's master
      military pay account (MMPA). When TRs and/or MTs are issued, take cost charge action prescribed
      in DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations.
      9.4.5. Officer Training School (OTS) Advance Payments. The losing PDS should not pay a member
      an advance beyond OTS. The member may elect to receive an advance after graduation from OTS
      from the Maxwell FSO. The Maxwell FSO should inform the member to submit all copies of orders
      from the last PDS to Maxwell AFB and from Maxwell AFB to their new PDS to include any TDY en
      route when they settle their travel voucher.
      9.4.6. Personal Procedure Moves (PPM) (Formerly DITY Moves). The government travel card may
      be used to procure supplies and services associated with personally procured household goods ship-
      ments, mobile home moves, and PP moves. The use of the card to obtain cash advances is authorized
      for personally procured mobile home moves and PP moves; however, cash advances for personally
      procured HHG shipments are not authorized. PP moves must be approved by TMO in advance of the
      move. All members are strongly encouraged to obtain an estimate of the costs they expect to be reim-
      bursed by the Government before utilizing the travel card for personally procured HHG shipments,
      mobile home moves, or PP moves.
      9.4.7. Accrual Payments for TDYs over 45 days. Accrual payments begin 30 days from the 1st day of
      the TDY, and continue in such manner (payment every 30 days) until the member returns to the PDS.
      (Exception: Airline tickets charged to the traveler’s Government Travel Card (GTC) may be paid upon
      traveler’s request if split disbursement option is used, but not earlier than member’s departure.) The
      only documentation required to pay an advance is the worksheet (see Figure 9.1.) and a copy of the
      member’s traveler orders. Members are not required to fill out a travel voucher or turn in receipts
      until travel is complete. For payment procedures see Figure 9.2. and Figure 9.3. Note: Accrual pay-
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               111


   ments are paid by member’s home station except for PCS with a TDY en route over 45 days, which
   are paid by the TDY station.

9.5. How to Compute Advances
   9.5.1. Temporary Duty (TDY).
       9.5.1.1. Cardholder (See Glossary). Cardholders must use their Government contractor-issued
       travel cards to charge major chargeable expenses (see Glossary) and to obtain cash advances for
       authorized and allowable out-of-pocket expenses (see Glossary) through the Government ATM
       Cash Advance Program (See DoDFMR, Volume 9). A cardholder is not authorized an advance
       cash/check/EFT payment from an FSO or agent office. Exception: An FSO or agent is authorized
       to make an advance payment for authorized out-of-pocket expenses, computed per subparagraph
       9.5.1.2. below, when the order states the cardholder is not able to use a Government contrac-
       tor-issued travel card to charge major chargeable expenses and/or is not able to obtain a cash
       advance through the Government ATM Cash Advance Program.
       9.5.1.2. Other travelers. Limit the travel advance to 80 percent of all authorized and allowable
       out-of-pocket expenses the traveler expects to incur during travel, plus up to 100 percent of autho-
       rized and allowable registration fees.
       9.5.1.3. Travel by privately owned conveyance (POC) for the traveler's convenience. Follow the
       procedures in par. 4.3. of this instruction to compute the transportation allowances. See par.
       9.5.1.1. or par. 9.5.1.2. above for advance payment limitation.
   9.5.2. Permanent Change of Station (PCS).
       9.5.2.1. Members. Authorized to 100 percent of authorized and allowable PCS allowances.
       When possible members should use the government travel card for PCS expenses. If the member
       is to perform a TDY en route, compute the TDY advance portion (stationary days) as prescribed
       by par. 9.5.1.2. above (all members are categorized as "other travelers" for TDY en route pur-
       poses).
           9.5.2.1.1. Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) Advance. (JFTR, par. U5725). Members are
           authorized to 100 percent of authorized and allowable expenses. When possible members
           should use the government travel card for these expenses. The number of days authorized to
           advance is up to local commander’s discretion. When a request for advance is submitted to the
           FSO, advise the traveler that any debt resulting from the receipt of the advance is subject to
           deduction from their payroll account.
       9.5.2.2. Employees. See par. 9.3.3. above, JTR, par. C1101, and DoDFMR, Vol. 9. Also, see par.
       9.5.2.1. above for advance payment limitation for PCS travel and TDY en route stationary days.

9.6. Funds Chargeable. The FSO charges travel advances to the funds certified as available and cited in
the travel orders. When funds for two fiscal years are cited on the orders, charge advances to the FY cur-
rent at the time of payment, regardless of when actual travel commences. Only one-dollar amount is
charged even though multiple EEICs and BPACs are involved.

9.7. Substantiating Documents. A minimum of three copies of the applicable travel order must be fur-
nished to the FSO. One is attached to the original of the payment voucher as a substantiating document.
112                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


The second is retained with the FSO's copy of the payment voucher. The third is returned to the traveler
with a copy of the payment voucher.

9.8. Time of Payment. Except when otherwise provided in the order, local conditions determine how
payment should be made. Normally, the advance should not be paid more than three workdays before the
traveler departs the duty station on official TDY travel and ten workdays before departing on PCS. For
personnel at duty locations not having a local payment office, the advance may be paid earlier as required
by mail or transportation schedules.

9.9. Distribution:
      9.9.1. General. Basic distribution requirements are covered in Chapter 8.
      9.9.2. Advance Mobile Home Allowance for Commercial Movement:
         9.9.2.1. The TMO provides a written statement showing the authorized shipping points based on
         member's permanent change of station order and what it would have cost the government to ship
         the member's maximum authorized weight allowance of household goods between such points.
         9.9.2.2. Forward a copy of the voucher to the FSO providing member service. If unknown, send
         to commander of member with the request that delivery be made to the FSO providing service.
         Attach copies of the commercial transporter's estimate of cost and TMO's certification. The FSO:
             9.9.2.2.1. Enters amount on travel record.
             9.9.2.2.2. Holds voucher copy for use with settlement voucher.
      9.9.3. For Others Payments. That Service makes advances using another Service’s funds unless
      approved otherwise. If the DSSN charged is not at the traveler's final destination, send a copy of the
      voucher (or message if paid within 5 days of the members projected departure from the TDY location)
      to the FSO that pays travel allowances for the traveler's PDS.

9.10. Recording PCS Advances Properly
      9.10.1. PCS advance payments to military members are charged to subproject "0X" regardless of the
      allowances being advanced.
      9.10.2. Employee PCS advance payments are charged to the applicable EEIC and entitlement code
      (See par. 9.3.3. above).
      9.10.3. All Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA) payments are processed as an advance payment using
      an entitlement code of "WT". When the Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA) payment is made
      in year two, all advances coded "WT" are taken into consideration (WTA is partial payment of RITA
      and must be accounted for in the computation).

9.11. Follow-up: For follow-up procedures, see DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel
Accounting Operations.

                           Pre-established Payments (Prior to Departure)


Brief traveler on the requirements for receiving advance payments.
Have the traveler complete the worksheet prior to departing TDY.
Traveler returns the completed worksheet and copies of the orders/amendments to
  the servicing FSO.
The FSO establishes a suspense file with all the completed worksheet and orders.
The FSO reviews the suspense file on a daily basis to ensure all payments are made
  in a timely manner.
Compute accrual-advance payments as follows:
  a. Airline ticket (if applicable)
  b. Accrued rental car expenses (if applicable)
  c. Accrued lodging expenses
  d. 100% Miscellaneous reimbursable expenses
  e. 100% Accrued M&IE
(Note: A traveler should receive 100% of M&IE since it has already been “earned” and the traveler
may need entire amount to pay GTC bill. Possibility of overpayment is minimal, since the traveler
has already accrued M&IE for days, which are being paid.)
The payment is processed into IATS as an advance, not a partial settlement
The payment method is in accordance with the traveler’s worksheet (e.g., Split Disbursement).
This process starts 30 days from the 1st day of the TDY and continues every 30 days until the
  traveler's projected return date.
The traveler retains receipts until the TDY is complete.
Note: There is no requirement to complete a travel voucher until TDY is completed.

                                              Chapter 10

                               CIVILIAN TRAVEL SETTLEMENTS

Section 10A—Employee Temporary Duty

10.1. General. As with military TDY, employees are required to furnish a complete statement of travel
upon completion of the ordered travel. Chapter 8 provides a list of applicable forms, which can be used
to submit a statement of travel. These forms are prepared according to Chapter 8 with the following
exceptions:
   10.1.1. Employees do not need to include a duty statement on the departure day from the PDS or res-
   idence.
   10.1.2. If the employee delays departure from TDY location on other than non-duty days, the depar-
   ture day will be the date the employee was last available for duty.
   10.1.3. Employee need not include a duty statement on the arrival day back at the PDS or residence.

10.2. Travel from TDY Station during Downtime. Employees on TDY often find themselves in the
situation where training or duty is interrupted. An example of this status is during the Christmas/New
Years holiday season.
   10.2.1. Employees remaining at the TDY location not taking leave continue with TDY allowances.
   10.2.2. Employees voluntarily returning to the PDS receive allowances according to JTR, pars.
   C4563 and C4677. Leave should be charged for all normal duty days not worked while in the vicinity
   of the PDS. Days worked and appropriate leave is recorded on the employees T&A form.

10.3. Attachments and Statements. The certificates and statements discussed in Chapter 8 apply to
claims submitted by employees with the following exceptions:
   10.3.1. Use of Government Quarters and Government Dining Facility:
       10.3.1.1. An employee is not required, however is encouraged, to use available government quar-
       ters according to JTR, par. C1055.
       10.3.1.2. Employees are not required to use available government dining facilities at the TDY
       location. Unless a specific rate of per diem is authorized when these facilities are available per
       diem may only be reduced if meals were "used" as distinguished from "available."
   10.3.2. Non-availability of an Authorized Transportation Mode:
       10.3.2.1. Military Air Required. When military air is required in an employee's orders, a state-
       ment of non-availability is required if reimbursement is to be given for travel by an alternate
       mode.
       10.3.2.2. Other Specific Modes Authorized. If an employee is authorized to travel by a specific
       mode (other than military air) and uses an alternate mode, the employee is reimbursed for the
       actual mode used according to the JTR, par. C2206.
       10.3.2.3. Non-availability Certificate for a Government Vehicle. When travel is required by gov-
       ernment vehicle and the permanent duty station (PDS) traffic management office (TMO) cannot
120                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


         provide the vehicle, the PDS TMO issues a statement of non-availability for round trip temporary
         duty travel.

10.4. Processing. Vouchers of employees are processed the same as for military members as contained in
Chapter 8 except entitlements are determined according to the JTR. In addition, leave will not be
charged on the voucher.

10.5. Number and Distribution of Voucher Copies. The applicable forms used by the employee to
submit his or her statement of travel require distribution the same as for military members (see Chapter
8).

Section 10B—Employee PCS Travel

10.6. General. The employee must submit all claims or final statements of travel, to the FSO servicing
the PDS. Final settlement vouchers must contain a complete itinerary for the entire period of travel in the
same fashion as for military personnel (see Chapter 8). Questions on civilian entitlements should be
directed to the individual's Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF).

10.7. Forms and Their Use :
      10.7.1. DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. This is the basic form used by employees
      to claim allowances for their personal travel, shipment of HHG, temporary storage, miscellaneous
      expense allowance, home marketing incentive payment, subsistence expense, and transportation of
      dependents.
      10.7.2. DD Form 1351-2c, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher (Continuation Sheet). As the title suggests,
      this form is used in conjunction with the basic DD Form 1351-2 when space on the basic form is inad-

      portation documents, and certificates or statements as required.

      tained in 8.13. In addition, the below listed requirements apply:
         10.9.1.1. Use of Government Quarters and Government Dining Facility. The traveler's statement
         as to use of government quarters and government dining facility substantiates entitlement.
      10.9.2. Exception by the Travel Approving/Directing Official to the Daily Minimum Driving Dis-
      tance. The travel approving or directing official may grant exception to the provisions of JTR, par.
      C4300, when travel between the old and new duty station is delayed for reasons clearly beyond the
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                             121

vouchers according to Chapter 8.

10.11. Dependent Travel.

       10.11.2.1. Claims for concurrent employee dependent travel are to be completed in the same man-
       ner as for military dependent travel.
       10.11.2.2. Claims for non-concurrent travel requires a separate DD Form 1351-2. The DD Form
       1351-2 includes the same information as required for employee PCS to include all attachments
       and statements necessitated by the circumstances of travel.
   10.11.3. Attachments and Statements:
       10.11.3.1. Concurrent Travel. No unique additional attachments or statements are required for
       submission of these claims.
       10.11.3.2. Non-concurrent Travel. Dependents traveling separate claims require the same support
       documentation as the employee’s claim.
   10.11.4. Processing:
       10.11.4.1. Unique Processing Requirements. Review claims for employee dependent travel with
       the same care as for the employee’s claim.
       10.11.4.2. Computation:
          10.11.4.2.1. Concurrent Travel. Compute entitlements for dependent PCS travel as required
          in JTR, Chapter 7.
          10.11.4.2.2. Non-concurrent Travel. Compute entitlements for the spouse's PCS travel as you
          would for the employee had the employee traveled with the dependents (JTR, Chapter 4 and
          par. C7006).

10.12. Household Goods.
   10.12.1. Claims. Employees file claims for the movement and or storage of HHG on DD Form

10.22. Relocation Services Contract. (JTR, Chapter 15.) HQ USAF/DPPC manages the relocation ser-
vices contract. It is a program used in lieu of the direct reimbursement method of compensating employ-
ees for selling their home upon a PCS. The official reviewing the real estate claim of an employee who
was authorized the relocation services contract (but did not accept the appraised value offer) must disal-
low dual benefits, e.g., reimbursement for appraisal fees and termite inspection.

10.23. Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA). (JTR, Chapter 16 and DoDFMR, Vol. 9.)
   10.23.1. General. Public Law 98-151 authorizes a Relocation Income Tax (RIT) Allowance for U.S.
   Government civilian employees who report to their new duty station on or after 14 November 1983.
   Its purpose is to reimburse certain employees substantially all of the additional Federal, State, and
   local income taxes incurred by the employee as the result of certain local travel and transportation
   expenses and relocation allowances which are furnished in kind, or for which reimbursement or an
   allowance is provided by the Government (see DoDFMR, Vol. 9). The RITA entitlement is a
   two-year, two-process calculation:
   10.23.2. Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA). The WTA is an estimated partial payment of the final
   RITA payment designed to cover federal income tax withheld from the PCS moving expense reim-
   bursement. It is intended to provide an immediate offset to the tax withheld on the payment and is
   also subject to withholding. As a result, a WTA payment allows the employee to receive the same
   reimbursement had the withholding not been required. DoDFMR, Vol. 9 indicates an employee must
   agree in writing to repay any excess WTA amount paid in year one. The agreement may be written on
   the settlement voucher or may be a separate statement. The statement should read similar to "I agree
   to repay any excess amount of WTA paid to me in year one and submit the required certified tax infor-
   mation and claim for my RIT allowance within 120 days, unless an extension is granted by the com-
   manding officer or designee of the DoD component concerned, after the close of year one. I
   understand failure to comply with this requirement will preclude the DoD components payment of the
   WTA. I also understand the entire WTA will be considered an excess payment if the RIT allowance
   claim is not submitted in a timely manner to settle the RIT allowance". Note: Year one. The calendar
   year in which the relocation expenses and resultant taxes are reimbursed to the employee. The dollar
   value of the reimbursement will appear on the employee's W-2 as additional income.
   10.23.3. Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA). The RITA payment is made in the calendar year
   following the calendar year in which the WTA is paid. RITA is based on employee's gross compensa-
   tion, tax filing status, and marginal tax rates. It reconciles the WTA payments with the employee's
126                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


      personal tax liability. The employee must file a claim for RITA; it is not automatic. If an employee
      does not file for the RITA in year two, the employee is liable for the additional Federal Income Tax
      incurred as a result of the additional income (see DoDFMR, Vol. 9). The RIT Allowance does not
      cover any moving expense for which the IRS allows an exclusion. In some instances when an
      employee files the final RITA claim in the second year, he/she will be in a lesser tax bracket because
      of lower earned income. If the RITA calculation results in a negative amount do not adjust prior year
      or current year income. The employee is obligated to repay this amount as a debt due the Government
      according to Collection Procedures, DoDFMR, Vol. 9. A negative W-2 is not issued. Advise the
      employee to consult with their tax advisor for IRS procedures in handling repayments of debts. Note:
      Year two. The calendar year in which the RITA payment is made. The dollar value of the payment
      will appear on the employee's W-2 as additional income.
      10.23.4. Tax Withholding. Both the WTA and RITA are subject to Federal Income Tax Withholding
      (FITW), Federal Income Contribution Act (FICA), and Medicare. State and local (if applicable) tax
      withholding rates must be considered in the RITA computation. However, neither is to be withheld
      from the payment to the employee.
      10.23.5. Funding. RITA is a PCS travel settlement adjustment; therefore, normal prior year funding
      procedures apply. That is, the reimbursable expenses of an employee transferred in the interest of the
      Government must be charged against the appropriation current when valid travel orders are issued.
      The organization responsible for the original funding of the move has the responsibility to secure ade-
      quate funds for the adjustment vouchers (65 Comp. Gen. 45 (1984)).
      10.23.6. Requirements.
         10.23.6.1. Develop a file on each employee eligible for WTA and/or RITA.
         10.23.6.2. Notify employee of the entitlement by providing a copy of AF Form 3541, Relocation
         Income Tax Allowance Employee Information Handout, Figure 10.1.; a copy of AF Form 3544,
         Taxable Reimbursement Worksheet, Figure 10.4.; PCS Entitlements; and the Relocation Income
         Tax Allowance Certification, Figure 10.3.
         10.23.6.3. Compute and process claims by referring to JTR, Chapter 16; AF Form 3539, Work-
         sheet for Civilian Entitlements, Figure 10.2.; AF Form 3542, Relocation Income Tax Allowance
         (RTIA) – Year 2 Calculation, Figure 10.5.; and AF Form 3543, Relocation Income Tax Allowance
         (RITA) Worksheet or the computerized RITA program.
         10.23.6.4. Advise the employee that the RITA payment will be reported to the IRS in current year
         as taxable income.
         10.23.6.5. Refer to DoDFMR, Vol. 9 for appropriate tax tables and detailed instructions. The
         Base Staff Judge Advocate will be consulted if local tax rates are questionable. When state and
         local taxes are computed, either manually or automatically, add them back to the entitlement due
         the employee. When using the automated voucher computation you are advised to insert the cur-
         rent year ceiling to avoid FICA withholding. This figure is subject to annual changes. You will be
         advised when changes occur.
      10.23.7. Covered Taxable Reimbursements. Expenses actually paid or incurred and not allowable as
      a moving expense deduction by the RIT Allowance (see DoDFMR, Vol. 9).
      10.23.8. Tax Rates. The JTR provides annual revisions of the Federal marginal tax rates and the state
      marginal tax rates for use in the RITA calculation. Local tax rates must be provided and certified by
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                             127


   the employee for their locality. The Base Judge Advocate should be contacted regarding questionable
   local tax rates. The JTR provides detailed instructions for calculating the combined marginal tax
   rates.

10.24. Earned Income. Amounts paid as reimbursement to or allowances paid on behalf of each
employee for travel expenses (excluding Renewal Agreement travel) must be included in gross income
and included on TD Forms W-2 regardless if the allowance is taxable or non-taxable. For example, per
diem and mileage are included with real estate, miscellaneous expense, house hunting, and temporary
quarter’s subsistence. Amounts paid for Transportation of Motor Vehicle, transportation paid to a third
party such as TRs, and Non-Temporary Storage should not be included in earned income (Public Law
86-707). (See DoDFMR, Vol. 9 when reimbursements span more than one year.) Note: Earned income
includes spousal earned income if employee is filing a joint return. Excluding the spousal income does
not preclude a RITA payment to the employee, but may reduce the employee's entitlement.

10.25. Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW).
   10.25.1. The procedures for withholding are as follows:
       10.25.1.1. Collect FITW at the current percent of the taxable amount due on the travel voucher.
       Note: The current percentage and Gross Limitation can be obtained from the IRS Publication 15,
       Circular E.
       10.25.1.2. Collect Social Security at the current percent of the taxable amount due on the travel
       voucher, if a FERS employee, subject to the current Gross Limitation. CSRS employees are not
       subject to Social Security deductions.
       10.25.1.3. Collect Medicare at the current percent of the taxable amount due on the travel
       voucher.
       10.25.1.4. Collect Employer Contribution, Agency Matching, equal to the amount collected of
       Social Security and Medicare. Charge EEIC 421SS for the same amount.
       10.25.1.5. Credit these amounts collected to 57F3875.0010 (followed by ADSN of the paying
       FSO).
       10.25.1.6. Forward copy of civilian PCS paid claims to the servicing Field Site for issuance of TD
       W-2.
   10.25.2. Items Taxable. Under the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, part III, 4080.10, the fol-
   lowing allowances paid to employees are not subject to taxation:
       10.25.2.1. Movement of household good and personal effects including the cost of storage and
       insurance within 30 consecutive days; and,
       10.25.2.2. Travel including lodging but not meals between PDSs. The meals and incidental por-
       tion of per diem is taxable.
   10.25.3. Air Force Employees Paid by Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps
   disbursing officers making payments to Air Force employees issue TD Form W-2, and account for the
   funds directly with the IRS.
128                                                                  AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


10.26. State Tax Adjustment. An additional RITA allowance may be due an employee who moved after
January 1, 1987 to a state that does not allow a deduction for all or any part of the covered moving
expense reimbursements allowed as a Federal deduction.

                                                 Chapter 11

                            TRAVEL UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

11.1. Emergency Evacuation Allowances. (JFTR, Chapter 6 and JTR, Chapter 12 and Appendix
I.)
      11.1.1. Military Dependent Payments. A dependent or representative designated by the member on a
      DD Form 1337, Authorization/Designation for Emergency Pay and Allowances, may be paid evacua-
      tion allowance. Payment made en route to the safe haven or designated location is posted to the DD
      Form 1337. See DFAS-DE 7073.1-M, for procedures pertaining to DD Form 1337. Dependents who
      travel to a designated place are paid by the closest FSO servicing the designated location. To process
      payments, the member's unit commander furnishes the paying FSO the following information:
         11.1.1.1. Name and sponsor’s Social Security Number (SSN).
         11.1.1.2. Name of designated dependent or representative to receive payment.
         11.1.1.3. Names and ages of dependents and their relationship to sponsor.
         11.1.1.4. Dependent's mailing address at the designated place.
         11.1.1.5. Date transportation to the designated place was furnished or made available. When this
         information is received, the paying FSO sends a statement to the designated dependents to com-
         plete and return to the FSO with three copies of the evacuation orders. The unit commander
         advises the member's dependents that claims will be processed by the applicable FSO.
      11.1.2. Dependents who travel to a temporary (safehaven) location under JFTR, Chapter 6, are paid
      by the FSO servicing the safehaven area.
      11.1.3. Instructions for preparation of payment vouchers are in Chapter 8.
      11.1.4. Dislocation Allowance (DLA). An advance payment of DLA is authorized when evacuation
      of command-sponsored dependents is to a designated place. The payment is made to the dependent or
      representative designated by the member on evacuation order. The amount payable is prescribed in
      JFTR, pars. U5615-A, U5620, U6012, and U6059. The FSO servicing the member or dependent
      makes payment.

11.2. Dependent Movement Incident to Evacuation : Any member, who is on duty at a station desig-
nated by the Secretary of the Air Force as being within a zone from which dependents were evacuated for
military reasons must support his or her claim for dependent(s) travel with:
      11.2.1. Three copies of evacuation orders or citation to general authority if individual orders are not
      issued.
      11.2.2. Statement as to where dependents were located on date area was originally ordered evacuated.
      11.2.3. If the dependents were moved to a designated place in the United States, state the port of entry
      in the United States.
      11.2.4. If married overseas, place and date of marriage.
      11.2.5. If dependents performed transoceanic travel to United States at personal expense, see Chap-
      ter 5.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                141


11.3. Employee and Dependent Payments. Employees and their dependents are authorized to evacua-
tion travel allowances authorized under the JTR. These allowances are paid by the FSO servicing the
safehaven area. When the United States is designated as a safehaven, payment may be made by any FSO.
Payments must be supported by the appropriate form or by an acceptable certification (see DODFMR,
Volume 8, Chapter 3). Instructions for preparing travel vouchers are in Chapter 8, this instruction.

11.4. Travel to and from Officer Training School (OTS).
   11.4.1. Civilian Life to OTS. The Maxwell FSO processes these members into the Air Force upon
   arrival at OTS. The Maxwell FSO submits the transfer-out transaction using the graduation date as
   the departure date upon completion of OTS. The member's voucher will cover departure time from
   Maxwell through arrival at first PDS.
   11.4.2. Enlisted Member to OTS. When an enlisted member is ordered to OTS, the status at OTS is
   TDY en route. Exception is if the member will attend follow-on training at Maxwell which, when
   combined with OTS, will exceed 20 weeks, or if the new PDS will be Maxwell. Upon arrival at OTS,
   members not in the exception above submit a no-pay-due travel voucher. The Maxwell FSO uses this
   voucher to transfer the member in and settle member's leave account; this must be done before com-
   missioning. Upon completion of OTS, the Maxwell FSO submits the transfer-out transaction using
   the graduation date as the departure date. Upon arrival at the PDS, the member's voucher is prepared
   from departure time from the old PDS before OTS, through arrival time at the new PDS. The member
   is entitled to per diem as an enlisted member while attending OTS as TDY en route, and as an officer
   following commissioning and at TDY stations en route following OTS. The gaining FSO computes
   member's entitlement from the old PDS through OTS and any other TDYs en route to the new PDS
   and makes payment. The transfer-in transaction for DJMS covers the period beginning with departure
   from Maxwell through arrival at the new PDS. AF Form 985 is prepared to show leave charges begin-
   ning with departure from Maxwell.

11.5. Vicinity Travel.
   11.5.1. Claim Preparation:
       11.5.1.1. In and Around PDS. Claims for vicinity travel within or near the PDS are reimbursed on
       a SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditure of Official Business.
       11.5.1.2. In and Around TDY Locations. Commanders, or their designated representatives, may
       authorize in advance or approve after the fact reimbursement of transportation expenses covered
       in this section. Authority to perform such travel must be classified as a special authorization under
       AFI 65-103, Vol. I. The authorization for reimbursement of expenses incurred within and around
       a TDY station is normally included in the basic travel order and claim made on DD Form 1351-2.
       If reimbursement for such expenses is approved after the travel has been performed, use a SF
       1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business to show such approval.
       Note: Designated-approving officials may not approve their own vouchers for payment.
   11.5.2. Claim Submission:
       11.5.2.1. Transportation at Permanent Station. Submit claims within five workdays after the end
       of the month in which the transportation is procured.

       within and around TDY station on SF 1164, as a supporting document to the travel claim, or
142                                                                        AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


         include in item 5 of DD Form 1351-2, as applicable. Submit claims involving transportation
         within and around a TDY station within five workdays after completion of travel.
         11.5.2.3. When the final settlement voucher has already been processed, the SF 1164 may be used
         as the payment voucher in its own right. In these cases, cross-reference to the settlement voucher
         should be included on SF 1164.

11.6. Recruiting Duty.
      11.6.1. Claims:
         11.6.1.1. General. Member entitled to reimbursement presents the claim on a SF 1164, prepared

             11.6.1.2.6. Supporting Documents - Attach receipts for any single item of $75 or more.
      11.6.2. Approval Procedures. Squadron commanders, group commanders, and the director or deputy
      director of Recruiting Operations AETC/RSO, Randolph AFB TX 78150, have authority for adminis-
      trative approval of reimbursement vouchers for personnel assigned at their respective level. Approv-
      ing officials should:
         11.6.2.1. Review SF 1164 for completeness, reasonableness of items claimed, and accuracy. Line
         out and initial any expense items not reimbursable or items for which reimbursement is otherwise
         proper under provisions of other instructions.

         approve voucher.
      11.6.3. Reimbursable Expense Itemization. Expenses must be stated in enough detail to satisfy the
      requirements of JFTR, Chapter 7, and to fully support entitlement. Example: Show date, type of
      expense, names, number of, type of applicants (i.e., non-prior-service (NPS), nurse, officer trainee
      (OT)), and amount.

11.7. Witness Payments.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                              143


   11.7.1. Preparation. Witnesses use DD Form 1351 to request an advance of per diem, transportation,
   and fees. Advances for non-DoD civilian witnesses may be requested and certified on the DD Form
   1351 by the Staff Judge Advocate who has administrative responsibility for the proceeding in which
   the testimony is to be provided. DD Form 1351-2 is used to settle these travel claims. Instructions for
   preparation of DD Forms 1351 and 1351-2 are in Chapter 8. The Staff Judge Advocate certifies
   attendance or expert fees in block 18 of the DD Form 1351-2.
   11.7.2. Attachments. Military members and DoD employees perform witness travel using DD Form
   1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel. Three copies of orders are to be
   attached to the claim. Non-DoD civilians perform witness travel using DD Form 453-1, Court-Mar-
   tial Witness Travel Order (see AFI 65-103, Vol. 1). Three copies of each document are required to
   support claim. When professional advice or services are rendered by an expert and no travel is
   involved, payment for fees is accomplished using SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services
   other than Personal. The Staff Judge Advocate approving and certifying official certifies the amount
   to be paid. A copy of the order convening the court or commission and a copy of the summons, sub-
   poena, letter, or other document requiring the individual's attendance in the case must be attached to
   the SF Form 1034.

11.8. Reserve Component Members.
   11.8.1. Preparation. Reserve component members use DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-
   voucher, to claim travel allowances. Generally, the DD Form 1351-2 is prepared according to instruc-
   tions in Chapter 8. However, members performing ACDUTRA who commute daily only need to
   show departure from home and arrival at duty station on the first day and departure from the duty sta-
   tion and arrival at home on the last day. The voucher must contain the statement "commuted daily
   (date) through (date).” Exceptions: Reserve Components members, whose ACDUTRA travel orders
   specify “Will commute-corporate limit travel”, are not required to file a voucher. “All Air Force
   Reserve members who perform duty in a will-commute status, not within the corporate limits, and
   were not in per diem status, may submit their AF Form 938 with completed POV statement for claims
   for mileage only in place of a DD Form 1351-2.”

11.9. Emergency Leave.
   11.9.1. Preparation. Members traveling in emergency leave status to or from overseas must submit a
   travel claim on DD Form 1351-2.
   11.9.2. Attachments. Supporting documents required for overseas emergency leave travel are:
       11.9.2.1. Travel order (AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency Leave Travel).
       11.9.2.2. Military Transportation Authorization (MTAs).
       11.9.2.3. Government Procured Transportation (formerly called Transportation Request (TRs)).

11.10. Travel Claims of Dependents of Deceased Members or Members Officially Reported in a
Casualty Status. (AFI 36-3020 and JFTR, par. U5241.) Claims for dependent travel performed under the
provisions of 37 U.S.C. 406(f) or 554 must be supported by two copies of DD Form 1300, Report of
Casualty.
   11.10.1. If a claim is for travel to a member's home of record as shown on DD Form 1300, no further
   documentation is required.
144                                                                           AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


      11.10.2. If a claim is for travel to the official residence of a blood or affined relative, a statement to
      that effect showing the name and relationship of the person to whose residence travel was performed
      must be furnished.
      11.10.3. If a claim is for travel to a place other than those described in 11.10.1. and 11.10.2. above,
      evidence of approval by the nearest MAJCOM is required.

11.11. Travel Under Classified Orders
      11.11.1. General. If classification of a TDY order is necessary, the special order must be classified,
      marked, and handled according to DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401. Classified orders should only be dis-
      tributed to persons who have the proper clearance and that require a copy of the order. If an unclassi-
      fied extract from a classified order furnishes enough information, it may be used to support the
      payment voucher. This permits filing an unclassified travel voucher and does not require completion
      of AF Form 32, Certificate for Travel Under Classified Orders. Process the payment in the normal
      manner.
      11.11.2. Declassification. Classified orders that contain an automatic downgrading statement can be
      downgraded without asking the originating or other authority. If this statement is not included on the
      order and the need for classification no longer exists, a written request for cancellation or change
      under DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 must be sent to the originating or higher authority.
      11.11.3. Supporting Evidence Required. The traveler must complete AF Form 32 in duplicate and
      sign both copies and attach them to the travel claim. AF Form 32 supports the voucher in place of
      classified orders and the itinerary or other papers (including carrier receipts) that contain names or
      locations of ships or stations. The following information is required to process a classified travel
      claim:
         11.11.3.1. TDY location:
             11.11.3.1.1. If TDY location is classified and the FSO has knowledge of the location, have the
             traveler indicate in the itinerary of the travel claim the location by showing site 1, site 2, and
             so forth. The FSO can apply the per diem rate for the classified location.
             11.11.3.1.2. If the TDY location is classified and the FSO does not have knowledge of the
             location or the traveler insists on showing the location, process the travel claim using AF Form
             32.
         11.11.3.2. Availability of government dining facility and quarters.
         11.11.3.3. Whether or not field duty existed.
         11.11.3.4. Period of field duty (dates unclassified).
         11.11.3.5. Period of exercise (dates unclassified).
         11.11.3.6. Unclassified extract of the order or AF Form 32 if the order is classified.
      11.11.4. Information Not to Be Shown on Voucher. To eliminate the need for the FSO to classify
      vouchers covering travel performed under classified orders, vouchers should not:
         11.11.4.1. Show names or locations of ships or stations (instead, show classified location #1, clas-
         sified location #2, etc.).
         11.11.4.2. Have classified orders attached.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               145


   11.11.5. Distribution of AF Form 32, Certificate for Travel Under Classified Orders. The original AF
   Form 32 must be attached to the original DD Form 1351-2. The duplicate copy of the AF Form 32
   must be attached to the accounting copy of the settlement voucher. AF Form 32 supports the voucher
   in place of classified orders, itinerary, and supporting documentation that contains classified informa-
   tion. Copies of classified orders with the related classified itineraries must be stored according to
   DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401. If a classified order is declassified, copies of the order and itineraries
   must be attached to the accounting voucher copy that is maintained in the FSO.
   11.11.6. Citation to Classified Orders. All travel vouchers must contain a complete citation to classi-
   fied orders involved, with the exception of names or locations of ships or stations. For example: Spe-
   cial Order AA-1200 HQ USAF, 18 Jul 2003.
   11.11.7. Vouchers Covering Reimbursement for Dependent Transportation. To claim reimbursement,
   the claimant must:
      11.11.7.1. Complete the voucher in full, omitting all names and locations of ships and stations
      mentioned in the classified orders.
      11.11.7.2. Support the voucher with AF Form 32.

11.12. Foreign Exchange Officers (USAF Officers). (See AFI 16-107, Chapter 7.)

11.13. Members of the Armed Forces of Foreign Nations.
   11.13.1. When members of the armed forces of a foreign nation request advance of funds at an Air
   Force installation, the base contacts the Embassy of the country requesting the funds, with names and
   funds requested. See www.embassy.org for telephone numbers of the various embassies.
      11.13.1.1. The FSO obtains a listing of members of the foreign nation receiving advances, their
      home station, aircraft tail number, if applicable, and forwards the information to their servicing
      field site. The advances are paid from base operations and maintenance (O&M) funds. Additional
      information is in AFI 16-107. The field site prepares an AF Form 819, Invoice of Claim, attaches
      the supporting documentation and forwards it to DFAS-AYCFM/DE.
   11.13.2. Foreign Students. Foreign students are paid on DD Form 1351-2 according to instructions in
   Chapter 8. Entitlements are outlined in AFJI 16-105. Travel orders are required to support claim. A
   copy of each paid voucher must be forwarded to AFSAT/FAR, Randolph AFB TX 78150-5001. The
   student's master travel record (MTR) is forwarded to the next training location. Upon completion of
   all CONUS training, forward the MTR to the office listed above.

11.14. Payments Chargeable to Non-DoD Agency Funds.
   11.14.1. When Air Force or federally employed non-DoD personnel travel under competent orders
   and request travel payments which are chargeable to non-DoD agency funds, use following proce-
   dures:
      11.14.1.1. Use base operation and maintenance (O&M) funds to cover the advance, accrual pay-
      ments, or final settlement.
      11.14.1.2. Set up a refund receivable for the amounts disbursed. Where feasible, combine multi-
      ple payments in one billing. Prepare billing of SF 1080, Voucher of Transfer between Appropria-
      tions and/or Funds, when payments are made. Send the SF 1080 to the order-issuing official
146                                                                    AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


      stated in the order. Attach a copy of the travel order and a copy of the completed voucher. Mark
      the travel advance or accrual payment voucher “For deduction from final settlement of travel
      under this travel order”.
      11.14.1.3. When collection is received, collect the amount as an appropriation refund.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                    147

                                        QUESTIONABLE CLAIMS

12.1. Request for Advance Decision. The FSO prepares requests for advance decision on questions
involving the applicability of law. For further guidance see DoDFMR, Vol. 5, Chapter 25 and Vol. 9,
Chapter 8.
      12.1.1. General. An FSO, DoD disbursing officer or certifying officer is entitled to an advance deci-
      sion on any question involving a voucher presented for payment. Prepare and submit the request for
      decision according to this paragraph.
         12.1.1.1. Amounts of more than $100:
             12.1.1.1.1. Prepare the request in letterform addressed to: DFAS-HQ.
             12.1.1.1.2. State in the first paragraph that the request is made under authority in 31 U.S.C.
             3529.
             12.1.1.1.3. Give a clear and brief presentation of the question at issue, including all facts caus-
             ing doubts as to the validity of the proposed payment, without expressing the personal views
             of the FSO concerned. State that the request for a decision is made by a FSO, DoD disbursing
             officer or certifying officer and that the voucher submitted has been presented to the FSO for
             payment. Sign the request. If the requesting FSO does not, DFAS-HQ is not required or
             authorized to give a decision on the question. Attach to the letter of request a properly certi-
             fied and approved voucher extended to show the amount payable, covering the payment pro-
             posed and supported by copies of orders and applicable supporting information.
             12.1.1.1.4. Submit the original and two copies of the request for advance decision through
             MAJCOM channels to DFAS-HQ. The supporting DFAS Center reviews each request and
             contacts the disbursing officer to resolve any questions. Questionable claims, which require
             advance decisions by the OSD Office of the General Counsel for military members and the
             General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) for DoD employees,
             through DFAS-HQ, for submission to PDTATAC.
         12.1.1.2. Amounts of $100 or Less. Requests for advance decision for payment of $100 or less
         are prepared and processed the same as for amounts of more than $100, except address the letter
         to the DFAS-IN, Travel Pay Services, Travel Systems & Procedures, ATTN: DFAS/PTC-IN
         (Sheila Melton), 8899 East 56th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46249.
      12.1.2. Approval or Disapproval. If a decision is given that payment is proper, the original voucher
      is returned to the FSO for payment. If payment is disapproved, the FSO is notified and the original
      voucher, together with supporting documents is not returned.
      12.1.3. Processing for Payment. The FSO records the number and date of the decision on, or attaches
      a copy of the DFAS-IN decision to, each voucher approved for payment.
      12.1.4. Effective Dates. An advance decision in a particular case takes effect from the date that the
      decision is given. A delay by DFAS-IN or a MAJCOM in notifying an FSO of a decision does not
      defer the effective date of the decision.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                               149


   12.1.5. Agent Requests. An agent of an FSO is not authorized to ask for an advance decision. Any
   agent who believes that a decision is necessary sends the required documents and any related data to
   the principal FSO for preparation and submission.
   12.1.6. Restrictions. The following abstracts are from advance decisions and pertain to FSO actions
   regarding advance decisions.
      12.1.6.1. Subject Awaiting Decision. No action may be taken by a FSO toward payment of a
      voucher when the subject is being considered for an advance decision.
      12.1.6.2. Subject Pending in Court of Claims. It is not the practice to render an advance decision
      on identical matters pending in the Court of Claims.
      12.1.6.3. Reconsideration. Reconsideration of a former final decision cannot be conducted unless
      new material evidence is furnished or unless a mistake, fraud, or collusion is involved.
      12.1.6.4. Informal Opinions. The expression of an informal opinion by an officer or employee of
      the applicable board is not an official action and is not controlling in any matter that may come
      before the board for an official determination. Note: The Comptroller General rendered decisions
      prior to October 1996. To review any decisions prior to October 1996 see http://www.gao.gov/
      decisions/decision.htm. To review any decisions October 1996 forward see http://
      www.defenselink.mil/DoDgc/doha/claims/ for military claims and http://www.gsa.gov/gsbca/
      travel/travel2.htm for civilian claims.

12.2. Doubtful Travel Claims.
   12.2.1. General. If a traveler desires to contest a disbursing officer’s decision concerning an entitle-
   ment determination, the disbursing officer must assist in the submission of that claim. It is the trav-
   eler’s right to have the claim forwarded for reconsideration. The disbursing officer has the
   responsibility of informing the traveler of this right. A claim will not necessarily be denied because a
   part of the claim contains an element of doubt. Process the part not in question per instructions in
   applicable directives. When partial settlement is made, the FSO states, in writing, the amount of the
   partial settlement and that no further payments will be made except after certification in the name of
   DOHA/GSBCA.
   12.2.2. Claim Forwarding. FSO’s prepare the request in letterform addressed to:
      Military:       Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
                      Claims Division
                      PO Box 3656
                      Arlington, VA 22203


      Civilian:       General Services Administration (GSA)
                      Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA)
                      18th and F. Streets, NW
                      Washington, DC 20405
150                                                                         AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005


         12.2.2.1. Send three complete copies of a doubtful claim to MAJCOM/FMF for assistance. MAJ-
         COMs forward unresolved claims to DFAS-IN. The transmittal should contain a command anal-
         ysis of the claim, results of research, statement of policy affecting the claim, and
         recommendations for approval or denial. Send claims expiring within six years of the statute of
         limitations to DFAS-IN promptly for registration with DOHA/GSBCA. Give special handling to
         claims of this type and advise addressees that registration with DOHA/GSBCA may be necessary.
         (See 31 U.S.C. 3526 and 3702).
      12.2.3. Documentation. The claimant signs claims forwarded according to subparagraph 12.1.1.1.4.
      above. Send with the claim as applicable:
         12.2.3.1. The claimant prepares the documents necessary for submission. The claimant must
         include a statement over his or her signature specifically requesting DOHA/GSBCA review.
         12.2.3.2. DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher.
         12.2.3.3. Copies of special orders or chain of orders supporting the allowance claimed.
         12.2.3.4. DD Form 1351-5, Government Quarters and Mess, or other statements of non-availabil-
         ity of government quarters or government dining facility.
         12.2.3.5. An administrative report prepared by the FSO in letter format. Do not sign the adminis-
         trative report and do not list the supporting documents as attachments. Place tabbed blank sheets
         in front of each supporting document that is itemized in the body of the letter. See Figure 12.1. for
         an example of the administrative report.
         12.2.3.6. Any other related certificates or statements including documents corroborating unusual
         circumstances or events.
      12.2.4. Reservation of Funds. Vouchers recommended for payment must show amount of claim and
      the complete major accounting classification of the funds to be charged. To provide for the possibility
      of the claim being approved, the letter from the FSO must include a statement that the amount of the
      claim has been posted in the fund ledger as an accrued expenditure unpaid (AEU).
      12.2.5. For DOHA/GSBCA responsibilities, see DFAS-DE 7010.1-R

12.3. Retroactive Amendments to Travel Orders. Retroactive amendments to increase or decrease the
amount of money due the traveler must be fully justified (24 Comp Gen. 439 (1944)). Circumstances per-
mitting an amendment to authorize additional payment are so rare that claims based on them are seldom
allowed. The travel claim with the amended order should be submitted to DOHA/GSBCA through the
MAJCOM and DFAS-IN, with a statement of facts and circumstances. A written amendment confirming
an oral order is not included in this category provided the oral order was issued on or before the effective
date of the directed change. Support claims with a complete statement from the order-issuing authority
relating facts and circumstances that necessitated issuance of the amended order (24 Comp Gen. 439
(1944)). If necessary, DFAS-IN will forward the claim for a final determination. Orders may be in this
category even though the amended orders state the purpose is to correct an administrative error. Where
practical, pay locally that portion of a claim for the lesser of the entitlement accrued under the original
order or under the amended orders and submit the balance of the claim. In cases where the JFTR or JTR
provide for after the fact approval of miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, the order-issuing official may
approve such expenses. The claim is properly payable without the need to retroactively amend the order.
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                                 151


12.4. Claims Generated by Lost Government Procured Transportation (formerly called Transpor-
tation Requests (TR)) or Carrier's Tickets
   12.4.1. General. See JFTR, par. U5165. The FSO settles a member's or employee's travel account on
   the basis that the traveler used government transportation furnished on the original ticket, if the origi-
   nal is lost, stolen, or destroyed.
   12.4.2. Lost While in the Custody of the Traveler:
       12.4.2.1. Traveler Actions:
           12.4.2.1.1. The traveler must immediately notify the designated carrier and the issuing TMO
           and complete a lost ticket refund application or any report required by the designated carrier.
           The traveler must purchase transportation with personal funds when the TR or paper ticket is
           lost. If the traveler does not have sufficient funds, a cost charge TR must be issued according
           to AFI 24-101 and appropriate action as described below must be taken when the traveler's set-
           tlement voucher is processed.
           12.4.2.1.2. Upon return or arrival at the PDS, TMO must obtain from the traveler the informa-
           tion needed to complete an SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets. A copy of the SF 1170
           must be provided to the traveler.
   12.4.3. TMO Actions: The TMO takes the necessary actions as prescribed in AFI 24-101.
   12.4.4. DFAS Actions:
       12.4.4.1. Upon receipt of the initial SF Form 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets, from TMO,
       the servicing DFAS field site establishes a refund receivable, in the amount of the lost TR/Ticket.
   12.4.5. Case settlement:
       12.4.5.1. Refund received from the carrier through the TMO. Process collection according to
       DFAS-DE 7077.2-M, Chapter 30. Use the TR number as the document number.
       12.4.5.2. If the lost/stolen TR/paper ticket was purchased at Government expense, the traveler
       must not be reimbursed for purchasing a replacement ticket until the Government receives a
       refund for the original paper ticket.
       12.4.5.3. If the traveler purchased the lost/stolen paper ticket, reimbursement is authorized for the
       original paper ticket only. If the original paper ticket is recovered, refunded, and the government
       repaid, the traveler may then be reimbursed for the cost of the replacement ticket, NTE the cost of
       the original paper ticket.
   12.4.6. Reporting. All transactions involving refunds receivable establishment, collection, or
   write-off must be included in the RCS: HAF-ACF(Q)8108(DE), Report on Status of Accounts and
   Loans Receivable Due From the Public.

12.5. Lapsed Appropriations. FSOs must reimburse travel voucher claims that are free of law or fact
and are received within six years after the date the travel was performed. If a travel claim is received four
or more years after travel was performed and cannot be paid promptly, it is sent to DFAS-IN for register-
ing with DOHA/GSBCA. (See 31 U.S.C. 3526 and 3702 or DFAS-DE 7010.1-R).

                                       CROSS-DISBURSING

13.1. Cross-Disbursement Policies. Effective October 1, 1996, the Office of the Undersecretary of
Defense, Comptroller (OUSD/C) directed the elimination of cross-disbursement of individual travel pay-
ments. Cross-disbursing means one DoD component paying a traveler using another DoD Component's
funds. This policy contained six exemptions to the policy.

13.2. Exemptions embedded in the OUSD(C) policy:
   13.2.1. Travel funded by multiple funding sources, open (central) allotment, or by special centrally
   managed funds.
   13.2.2. Travel performed entirely outside the continental United States (OCONUS) or travel funded
   by an activity located OCONUS but performed in CONUS (Hawaii and Alaska are considered
   CONUS) for the purposes of this policy.
   13.2.3. Travel funded by special access (classified) programs.
   13.2.4. Travel required as the result of a deployment, an emergency, or a disaster.
   13.2.5. Accountable station has no disbursing capability (no Disbursing Station Symbol Number -
   DSSN).
   13.2.6. Travel transaction processed by a Reengineering Travel Transition Office (RTTO) pilot test
   site.

13.3. Each of the DFAS Centers, representing a DoD component, published guidance to clarify the
above OUSD/C exceptions. The exemptions are based upon who administers the funds. Department 21
is Army (DFAS-Indianapolis), Department 17 is Navy (DFAS-Cleveland) or Marines (DFAS-Kansas
City), and Department 97 is DoD. Department 97 is administered by each component. The ADSN and
limitation determines which exemptions apply, e.g., Department 97 with an Air Force limitation the
DFAS-DE exemptions apply. Note: For a complete listing of exemptions, see DFAS-DE Interim Guid-
ance on Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations.

Terms
Advance—Providing the traveler with funds to be used to meet travel-related expenses before travel has
been started or completed.
Allowable Travel Time—The number of days allowed for official travel, determined after travel has
been completed. Factors for determining allowable travel time are the itinerary of the member and/or
dependents, required reporting dates at duty stations, and transportation mode(s) used, as shown on the
travel settlement voucher. Members are in a duty status during periods of allowable travel time.
Carrier—Transportation facilities that are for hire to carry all persons who may apply for passage, so
long as there is no legal excuse for refusing.
Cardholder—Air Force personnel eligible for a government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card
under the guidelines of the government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card program. Includes
eligible or selected personnel declining to apply for or accept the government contractor-issued travel
card and personnel having their government contractor-issued travel card suspended or revoked because
of account delinquency.
Constructed Travel Time (CTT)—Time required to travel between two points of directed travel via a
usually traveled route according to common carrier schedules which most nearly coincide with the time of
departure and arrival required to perform the mission. Travel time to and from terminal must be included
in determining CTT.
Destination—For per diem purposes, the next location a member is TDY or has a stopover for the night.
DoD Standard Travel Advance Policy—Effective 30 September 1988, the Deputy Secretary of Defense
directed the implementation of the DoD standard travel advance policy. This policy requires the
implementation of the Office of Management and Budget-directed government-sponsored
contractor-issued travel card program and the reduction of cash advanced for authorized and allowable
travel expenses. The purpose of this policy is to improve the federal government's cash management
program without imposing a personal financial burden on the traveler.
Education and Training Fees—Fees incurred by the Air Force for formal training of Air Force or other
DoD personnel, both military and civilian. Includes expenses for tuition and other contractual expenses.
This training is designed to meet the needs of the agency rather than the individual. Fees chargeable to
EEIC 553.
Elapsed Time—The time spent between points of duty including the departure day through the arrival
day for duty. This is the unit to be considered in determining authorized time a member is required to
report to comply with the orders.
Estimated Travel Time—The maximum time that may be used for travel between duty stations as
determined in advance and shown in the travel order. The transportation mode actually used can result in
a lesser number of days of allowable travel time.
Field Duty—All duty by members serving with troops participating in maneuvers, war games, field
AFI65-114 26 AUGUST 2005                                                                             161


exercises, or similar types of operations, and
        a. The member is subsisted in a government dining facility or with an organization drawing field
rations, and is provided government quarters or is quartered in accommodations normally associated with
field exercises (everything normally covered by per diem is furnished without charge, except that officer
members are required to pay for rations at the discounted meal rate (basic meal rate), or


      b. Students are participating in survival training and forage for subsistence and improvise their
own shelter.


Members furnished quarters and subsistence obtained by contract may also be considered as performing
field duty when so declared by competent official.
Government-sponsored ATM Cash Advance Program—The program allows Department of the Air
Force cardholders with an authorized personal identification number to use their government-sponsored
contractor-issued travel card to obtain advance travel funds at participating ATM outlets worldwide for
official government travel. The program is to be used in conjunction with, and as a supplement to the
Government-sponsored Contractor-Issued Travel Card Program. Therefore, cardholders must limit cash
advances to out-of-pocket expenses (see below) and charge major chargeable expenses (see below) to the
government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card.
Government-sponsored Contractor-Issued Travel Card—A contractor-issued travel card issued to
eligible or selected Air Force personnel under the guidelines of the Government-sponsored
Contractor-Issued Travel Card Program. The government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card is only
for use on official government business.
Government-sponsored Contractor-Issued Travel Card Program—Department of the Air Force
Secretariat, Air Staff organizations, major air commands, separate operating agencies, and geographically
separated units must offer a government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card to Air Force members in
grades E-7 and above, Department of the Air Force civilian employees GS-9 and above plus WS/WG and
nonappropriated fund (NAF) employee equivalents who are likely to travel more than twice a year on
official government business. Commanders may make the government-sponsored contractor-issued
travel card available to responsible personnel below the grades specified who are required to travel.
Commanders must ensure applications are processed expeditiously for all personnel who request a travel
card. Commanders (or their designated representative) may make case-by-case exceptions to card
issuance for personnel known to have personal financial difficulties or other related problems. The
government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card is only for use on official government business.
NOTE: See definition of DoD standard travel advance policy for background information.
Major Chargeable Expenses—Travel expenses a cardholder is normally able to pay for using a
government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card, such as, commercial lodging costs, rental car costs
and common carrier transportation fares (in limited circumstances when authorized or approved by the
appropriate order-issuing official).
Meal Tickets—A request to a supplier to furnish meals and nonalcoholic beverages. They are used while
traveling when the cost of passage does not include meals in hotels, restaurants, or other eating
establishments.

Negligence—The failure to act as a reasonably prudent person would have acted under similar
circumstances. Failure to comply with existing laws or instructions may be considered as evidence of
negligence.
Out-of-Pocket Travel Expenses—Travel expenses that cannot be charged to a government-sponsored
contractor-issued travel card and are, therefore, paid using cash, personal check, or travelers check. The
following expenses are out-of-pocket travel expenses:


        a. Meals and incidental expenses covered by the per diem or actual subsistence expense allow-
ance;


        b. Miscellaneous transportation expenses such as local transit system fares; taxi fares; parking
fees; ferry fees; bridge, road, and tunnel fees; airplane parking, landing and tiedown fees;


       c. Gasoline and other variable expenses covered by the mileage for the use of a POC for official
business;


       d. Other authorized reimbursable expenses which cannot be charged using the government-spon-
sored contractor-issued travel card and for which a cost can reasonably be estimated prior to travel;


        e. Major travel expenses that could be incurred by personnel not eligible for a government-spon-
sored contractor-issued travel card, such as commercial or government-contract procured lodging costs,
rental car costs, and common carrier fares (in limited circumstances when authorized or approved by the
appropriate order-issuing official), and


        f. All expenses outlined in a. through e. above when the order properly states a cardholder will not
be able to use a government-sponsored contractor-issued travel card to charge major chargeable expenses
and will not be able to obtain a cash advance through the Government-sponsored ATM Cash Advance
Program.
Registration Fee—Fees and related expenses for participants whose presence is necessary for adequate
Air Force representation (information exchange) in technical conferences, seminars, private associations,
meetings and activities not convened for the purpose of formal training. The fee may be used to pay for
guest speakers and expenses associated with sponsoring the function. Fees chargeable to EEIC 409.
Transportation in Kind—Transportation provided without direct cost to the member. Included are: (1)
government aircraft, vessel, automobile; (2) AMC transportation; (3) use of TRs or warrants; (4) GSA
transportation--owned or contracted; (5) foreign government transportation if at no cost; (6)
Government-procured transportation via commercial carriers.

                           LOCAL SERVICING TERMINALS OVERSEAS
Local servicing terminals often are within the boundaries of the PDS. The servicing terminal could be dif-
ferent for bus, rail, and air, but an installation does not have to have a servicing terminal for each transpor-
tation mode. For PCS travel, the local servicing terminal determines if MALT PLUS per diem (mileage)
or only per diem is payable.
