 2                                                             932AWI34-601 25 JANUARY 2013


1. General. The 932d Force Support Squadron (FSS) Lodging Section issues guidance for
members in approved status to access lodging through the use of ALRS. The use of this system
is required for all reservations. Questions and comments may be directed to the member’s Unit
Lodging Monitor (ULM) or the 932 FSS Lodging Non-Commissioned Officer-in-Charge at
(618) 229-7562 or DSN 779-7562.
     1.1. Officers and enlisted personnel, Staff Sergeant and above, are authorized single quarters
     when possible. The 932d Mission Support Group Commander or deputy will determine if
     quarters will be shared during limited lodging availability for the following ranks not
     performing flying duty: Captain and below and SSgt through SMSgt. Quarters for enlisted
     personnel, Senior Airman and below, will be assigned on the basis of two members per room.
     Commanders at all levels, first sergeants, and chaplains are authorized and have priority for
     unshared on-base quarters with telephones. Shift work personnel requiring on-base quarters
     will be identified in the Unit Training Assembly Participation System (UTAPS) Lodging
     Roster.
     1.2. If on-base quarters are not available, members will be assigned contract quarters in
     accordance with (IAW) AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management.
     1.3. Commuting area is determined by the 932 AW/CC.
2. Entitlement: Members are entitled to quarters when:
     2.1. The unit commander requires the member to stay on base overnight for mission or
     safety reasons. A timely exception letter must be submitted to the 932 FSS Lodging Office
     (932 FSS/FSVL) prior to the member requiring lodging. This provision is not to be used
     repeatedly to circumvent the designated commute area.
     2.2. The nature of the duty, as determined by the unit commander, prevents the member
     from commuting. An exception letter is required.
     2.3. Members on annual tour (AT), special tour (Reserve Personnel Appropriation [RPA]),
     or school tour who are authorized quarters will make arrangements through the ALRS, pay
     for their lodging, and claim reimbursement on their travel voucher.
     2.4. Aircrew in Additional Flying Training Periods (AFTP). Quarters will be provided when
     required for crew rest, for show times prior to 0600L, or for personal safety as determined by
     the 932d Operations Group Commander.
3. Automated Lodging Reservation System Procedures.
     3.1. All 932 AW and 954 RSS members must use the ALRS by dialing (877) 875-9886,
     option 4 or the direct line at (618) 229-7579/7630 to obtain lodging.
        3.1.1. Every newcomer to the 932 AW or 954 RSS will be briefed on the process for
        obtaining lodging through the ALRS during wing’s Newcomer’s Orientation. Individuals
        exempted from attending the wing’s Newcomer’s Orientation will receive this
        information from their commander, first sergeant, or ULM.
     3.2. ULMs are the first contact for all lodging issues.
     3.3. Members can call ALRS up to 90 days in advance to schedule lodging for Unit Training
     Assemblies (UTA), however, upcoming UTA reservations must be made no later than
     (NLT) 1200 the Wednesday prior to the primary UTA.
932AWI34-601 25 JANUARY 2013                                                                    3


     3.3.1. Members may verify reservations by calling ALRS again to confirm reservations
     are on file.
  3.4. All lodging transactions will be managed through the ALRS: This includes making,
  cancelling, and inputting or correcting the duty status.
     3.4.1. Members must ensure they input the correct dates and the correct duty status for
     the required lodging period.
     3.4.2. Active Duty for Training (ADT) status is used when a member is on orders (AF
     Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Tour Duty) and
     will pay with a valid Government Travel Card (GTC). The member will be required to
     pay for lodging if ADT is entered. If ADT was mistakenly entered as the duty status,
     call ALRS immediately and change the duty status to Inactive Duty Training (IDT).
         3.4.2.1. Upon check-in at off-base hotels, members should ask the front desk for their
         contract lodging slip for all ADT status lodging . Members will file the contract
         lodging slip and receipt with their travel voucher for ADT lodging reimbursement.
         3.4.2.2. Members will only receive non-availability slips if the Scott Inn (375
         FSS/FSVL) and the contract lodging facilities are not available.
     3.4.3. IDT status is used during UTAs (including reschedules) and will be directly billed
     to the 932 AW. Each lodging facility will ask for a valid credit card to ensure payment
     for sundries, telephone calls, guest fees, pets, or damage to the room or property. 932
     AW units and 954 RSS are only responsible for room charges and taxes when a member
     is in IDT status.
         3.4.3.1. Members are only authorized use of the GTC for lodging when in ADT
         status. Under no circumstances are members authorized use of their GTC while in
         IDT status.
  3.5. Walk-ins are not permitted at any off-base lodging facilities. Members are required
  to check in at the Scott Inn prior to proceeding to contract lodging facilities if rooms on base
  are not available. Members walking in to off-base lodging facilities are financially
  responsible to pay the bill.
  3.6. Members in AT, RPA, or school tour status must present an AF Form 938 or an AF
  Form 40A, Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training, signed by the unit commander or
  unit commander’s representative.
  3.7. Aircrew members in AFTP, AT, or RPA status must present orders, flight orders, and
  designated forms signed by the operations officer to the Scott Inn. Aircrew members are
  authorized aircrew quarters when flight orders or a designated form is presented indicating
  the member is performing flying duties.
     3.7.1. When converting from one status to another, the Scott Inn will make every effort
     to allow aircrew members to remain in assigned quarters. Upon registration, aircrew
     members must coordinate with the Scott Inn if their duty status is going to change (i.e.,
     UTA to RPA), to prevent lodging payment problems.
     3.7.2. Aircrew members are entitled to quarters for pre-departure crew rest if the show
     time is prior to 0600L. They are also entitled to quarters for post-mission rest, but will
 4                                                           932AWI34-601 25 JANUARY 2013


        not necessarily be given aircrew quarters. NOTE: Aircrew quarters changes are based on
        a 24-hour day.
        3.7.3. Aircrew performing simulator training only during UTAs are not entitled to
        aircrew quarters.
        3.7.4. The 73d Airlift Squadron and 932d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron have
        specific unique requirements that mandate exceptions to this instruction and are
        addressed in internal policies.
     3.8. Check out time is NLT 1100. The 932 AW and 954 RSS are not responsible for late
     checkout charges, property damage, damage to the room or furnishings, food, beverages,
     Pay-Per-View TV or telephone calls. Members are responsible for these charges. Checkout
     can be made by physically going to the front desk. Express room check out is permitted.

        arrival.
     4.2. ULMs will prepare an after-action report for each first sergeant and unit commander on
