                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Introduction. Computer Security (COMPUSEC) is an IA discipline identified in AFI 33-
200, Information Assurance (IA) Management. Compliance ensures appropriate implementation
of measures to protect all Air Force Information System (IS) resources and information.
   1.1.1. The framework of the AF COMPUSEC IA program consists of a cyclic sequential
   security management model for risk management. This model is specific to information
   processed on AF computing systems and incorporates strategy, policy, awareness/training,
   implementation, assessment, remediation, and mitigation controls.
1.2. Applicability. This publication applies to all AF ISs and devices used to process, store,
display, transmit, or protect AF information, regardless of classification or sensitivity, unless
exempted in Para 1.2.3 or 1.2.4.
   1.2.1. AF ISs and devices include but are not limited to: Stand-alone systems, Platform IT
   (PIT) systems, IS components of systems where PIT interconnections (PITI) exist, Modeling
   and simulation systems/networks, ISs connected to external networks via authorized internet
   service    providers   (ISPs),     ISs  providing     the    management     infrastructure,
   Connections/interfaces with other ISs
   1.2.2. This publication is binding on all users, military, civilian and contract employees, that
   operate, connect, or interact with the ISs owned, maintained, and controlled by the AF.
   1.2.3. More restrictive Federal, DoD, and Director of Central Intelligence Agency directive
   requirements governing Special Access Program information take precedence over this
   publication. The latest version of all publications (e.g., Federal, Joint, DoD, AF) referenced
   within this publication must be utilized.
   1.2.4. This publication and implementation guidance identified within are not applicable to
   Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) ISs. For SCI systems, refer to the Intelligence
   Community Directive (ICD) 503, Intelligence Community Information Technology Systems
   Security Risk Management, Certification and Accreditation.
   1.2.5. Compliance with IA controls will be assessed, documented, and mitigated according
   to DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, and DoDI
   8510.01, DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), for
   inclusion in the AF IS Certification and Accreditation (C&A) package.
1.3. Objective. The objective of COMPUSEC is to ensure the employment of countermeasures
to protect and secure United States (US) government information processed by AF ISs by
protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and non-repudiation of ISs.

                                          Chapter 4

                     INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCESS CONTROL

4.1. Introduction. Every individual who has access to the Non-Classified Internet Protocol
Router Network (NIPRNET) or Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), standalone
systems, specialized ISs, and/or mission systems is an IS user.
   4.1.1. Access to AF ISs is a revocable privilege and will be granted to individuals based on
   need-to-know and according to DoDI 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation;
   NSTISSP No. 200, National Policy on Controlled Access Protection; DoD 5200.2-R,
   Personnel Security Program; and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI)
   6510.01, Information Assurance (IA) and Support to Computer Network Defense (CND).
4.2. Authorized Users. Authorized user account creation and administration must be
configured with role-based access schemes according to system policy requirements in DoDI
8500.2.
   4.2.1. All authorized users (e.g., military, civilian, contractor, temporary employees,
   volunteers, interns, key spouses, and American Red Cross personnel) complete DoD IA
   training prior to being granted access to an IS. IA training will be re-accomplished annually
   by the user and compliance maintained by the IAO according to DoD 8570.01-M.
      4.2.1.1. DoD IA training is located on Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS)
      accessible via the AF Portal. A publically accessible version of the DoD IA training is
      located on the Information Assurance Support Environment (IASE) website
      (http://iase.disa.mil/eta/ProductDownload/awareness_download.html).
      4.2.1.2. When a user requires a new/modification to his/her account (due to change of
      station or assignment, Temporary Duty [TDY], etc.), the gaining IAO will verify the user
      meets access requirements before granting access to the IS. Users are not required to
      retake the DoD IA training provided the user has a valid and current (within a year)
      course completion record. In emergency or deployment situations, the IAO may rely on a
      training record review or ADLS to validate course completion.
   4.2.2. For IS access, the IAO ensures the DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access
   Request (SAAR), is completed and signed. Document access requests, DoD IA training
   completion, and justification for access and clearance/background investigation verification
   as referenced by DoD 5200.2-R and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program. DD Form
   2875 signatures can be “wet” or digitally signed.
      4.2.2.1. All authorized IS (to include Mobile Computing Devices) users will sign the
      standardized AF Form 4394, Air Force User Agreement Statement-Notice and Consent
      Provision (See AFI 33-100, to become AFMAN 33-152) prior to initial IS access. See
      paragraph 6.12 for wireless mobile device requirements.
      4.2.2.2. Access to classified ISs also requires a Standard Form 312, Nondisclosure
      Agreement, according to AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
      4.2.2.3. IAOs, in coordination with the organizational security manager, verify user
      background investigation requirements according to DoD 5200.2-R.
AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                          11


  4.2.3. A user must obtain an approved hardware token according to current processes prior
  to obtaining NIPRNET (and SIPRNET when tokens are available) access.
     4.2.3.1. The locally appointed Contractor Verification System (CVS) Trusted Agent
     (TA) individual (e.g. organizational security manager) verifies contractor access against a
     valid contract in the CVS before approving the request for a contractor to be issued a
     Common Access Card (CAC).
  4.2.4. The ISO ensures methods are in place to verify user access requests before granting IS
  access.
  4.2.5. All user accounts are created using applicable TOs published by the 24 AF (e.g.
  MPTO 00-33D-2001, Active Directory Naming Conventions).
  4.2.6. Privileged User. A privileged user is an authorized user who has access to IS control,
  monitoring, or administration functions. Grant privileged access to unclassified and classified
  ISs based on the assigned duties and the position categories identified in DoDI 8500.2:
  Category IT-I (Privileged) and Category IT-II (Limited Privileged).
     4.2.6.1. Privileged users must meet all the requirements of an authorized user as
     specified in paragraphs 4.2.1 – 4.2.3.
     4.2.6.2. Privileged users are established and administered with a role-based access
     scheme according to the system policy and DoDI 8500.2.
     4.2.6.3. System access requires Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) access methods as
     specified in Chapter 5, Public Key Infrastructure.
     4.2.6.4. Privileged users access only data, control information, software, hardware, and
     firmware that they are authorized access and still have a requirement for “need to know.”
     4.2.6.5. To maintain separation of duties and least privilege, users maintain separate
     accounts, a user account for day-to-day or “non-privileged” functions, and a privileged
     account for administrative functions according DoD 8570.01-M and DoDI 8500.2.
     4.2.6.6. The system IAM tracks and maintains visibility over all privileged users
     according to AFI 33-200 and DoDI 8500.2.
     4.2.6.7. Prohibit sharing of privileged user accounts between users.
     4.2.6.8. Configure privileged user remote access according to the DISA Enclave STIG.
     4.2.6.9. Privileged users must be position-certified according to DoD 8570.01-M and
     qualified according to AFMAN 33-285, Information Assurance (IA) Workforce
     Improvement Program.
     4.2.6.10. Privileged users must complete a Privileged Access Agreement according to
     DoD 8570.01-M.
  4.2.7. Foreign Nationals/Local Nationals. A Foreign National/Local National (FN/LN) user
  is anyone who is not a US citizen or permanent resident, according to Title 8, Code of
  Federal Regulations, “Aliens and Nationality.” Before authorizing FN/LN access to
  unclassified and/or classified ISs, the ISO ensures compliance with the IS access
  requirements in paragraphs 4.2.1-4.2.3 and the following constraints:
12                                         AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


     4.2.7.1. Constraints. MAJCOM Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO) determines authorized
     and privileged need-to-know for the administrative access and control of information,
     software, hardware and firmware to include controlled unclassified information (CUI)
     and classified information, in accordance with DoD Manual (DODM) 5200.01, Volume
     4, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
        4.2.7.1.1. Base or Wing IA offices must consult the Host or MAJCOM FDO before
        authorizing access by FN/LN users to ISs processing, storing, or transmitting
        classified and controlled unclassified information. Note: Specific FN/LN access
        guidance can be found in the following publications: AFI 16-107, Military Personnel
        Exchange Program; AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology
        Transfer Program; DoDD 5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data from
        Public Disclosure; DoDD 5400.7, DoD Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
        Program; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program;
        AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program; DoDD 5230.11, Disclosure of Classified
        Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations; and
        DoDD 5230.20, Visits and Assignments of Foreign Nationals.
     4.2.7.2. Administrative Controls. Establish a process between ISOs, system IAMs, and
     the applicable MAJCOM FDO to determine classified or unclassified access. Direct
     conflicts in FN/LN access requirements to the MAJCOM FDO for resolution.
        4.2.7.2.1. Base or Wing IA offices maintain a list of FN/LN users from each
        subordinate organization within their assigned organizations. Provide specific
        documentation indicating FN/LN usage to the system IAM for inclusion in the IS
        C&A.
        4.2.7.2.2. The IAO tracks and maintains visibility over all FN/LN billets assigned to
        an IS and/or organization.
        4.2.7.2.3. Restrict FN/LN IS user access to IT levels defined in DoDI 8500.2.
        4.2.7.2.4. If privileged access is required to an IS, FN/LN user access must be
        restricted to IT II-level positions only and directly supervised by a U.S. Citizen
        according to DoDI 8500.2 and CJCSI 6510.01. Furthermore, document access in the
        IS C&A package. Pursuant to applicable host-nation agreements, FN/LN privileged
        users must be baseline computing environment (CE) certified according to DoD
        8570.01-M.
     4.2.7.3. IS Controls. System IAMs in coordination with privileged users ensure that
     applicable IA technical safeguards and controls are established and maintained according
     to CJCSI 6510.01 and DoDI 8500.02.
        4.2.7.3.1. Prohibit unlimited FN/LN access to “.mil” websites until specific host
        FDO and the MAJCOM FDO approval is accomplished.
        4.2.7.3.2. ISOs direct privileged users to setup permissions on ISs that allow for
        FN/LN account management in accordance with this publication.
        4.2.7.3.3. Establish proper     messaging      naming      conventions     (e.g.,
        <john.smith.uk@af.mil>) of FNs as non-US citizens according to CJCSI 6510.01.
AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                           13


         4.2.7.3.4. At the discretion of the ISO, system access requires PKI access methods as
         specified in Chapter 5, Public Key Infrastructure. See paragraph 4.2.6.3 MAJCOMs
         handle token requirements according to host nation agreements.
         4.2.7.3.5. IAOs validate implementation of appropriate safeguards (e.g. PKI, email
         accounts). Employ safeguards that adhere to DoD, Joint, and AF, and if applicable,
         locally created information security publications.
         4.2.7.3.6. Sanitize or configure classified ISs to restrict access by FN/LNs to only
         classified information authorized for disclosure to the FN/LNs government or
         coalition, as necessary to fulfill the terms of their assignments according to applicable
         host MAJCOM FDO requirements.
         4.2.7.3.7. For SIPRNET RELEASABLE (SIPR REL) IS specific configuration
         requirements, follow guidance in the DISA Embedded REL User Enclave Technical
         Implementation                             Instruction                  (TII)
         (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/net_perimeter/enclave_dmzs/rel.html).
         4.2.7.3.8. SIPR REL users do not need FDO approval to access .mil sites. DISA
         controls website access at the REL DMZ proxy.
     4.2.7.4. Other Considerations. Non-US citizens who are permanent legal residents and/or
     full time permanent employees of the DoD meet the requirements of any US citizen for
     access to the unclassified network or system.
  4.2.8. Grant only unclassified IS access to temporary employees and volunteer personnel in
  support of their assigned duties.
     4.2.8.1. A volunteer is any individual authorized to be DoD volunteers as defined in
     DoDI 1100.21, Voluntary Services in the Department of Defense. Restrict volunteers to
     IT-III level positions.
     4.2.8.2. Temporary employees and volunteers (including key spouses) must meet the
     requirements as specified in paragraphs 4.2.1 through 4.2.3.
     4.2.8.3. Temporary employees and volunteers require PKI access at the discretion of the
     ISO and according to IS requirements as outlined in Chapter 5, Public Key
     Infrastructure. See paragraph 4.2.6.3
         4.2.8.3.1. Eligible volunteers should contact their CVS TA to get their Volunteer
         Logical Access Credential (VoLAC).
         4.2.8.3.2. The VoLAC is used for logical access (network) and is replacing the
         Alternative Token for volunteers.
  4.2.9. Public users that access an IS intermittently (i.e. vendors, morale support, technical
  support, etc.) have only non-privileged access.
     4.2.9.1. The system ISO ensures adherence to applicable DISA STIGs (e.g., Web Server
     STIG) for private/public IS separation.
  4.2.10. All IS users have the responsibility to report suspected inappropriate use, both by
  authorized and unauthorized personnel, to supervisory chain of command, security manager,
  organizational IAO, or commander.
 14                                            AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


   4.2.11. (Added-934AW) Authorized users requiring access from outside the local area
   network must complete the 934th Airlift Wing Virtual Private Network memorandum with
   the 934th Communications Squadron Information Assurance (934 CS/IA) office. This
   memorandum will be validated by 934 CS/IA and maintained with the member’s Information
   System (IS) paperwork.
   4.2.12. (Added-934AW) Authorized users requiring access to a Digital Subscriber Line
   (DSL) to complete their mission must complete a 934 AW DSL User Agreement. This
   agreement will be maintained with the member’s IS paperwork.
4.3. Loss of Access. Access to an AF IS is a privilege and continued access is contingent on
personnel actions, changes in need to know, or operational necessity (see AFI 33-100, to become
AFMAN 33-152).
   4.3.1. Specific procedural information for account disabling is located in MPTO 00-33B-
   5004, Access Control for Information Systems.
   4.3.2. Failure to maintain DoD IA training results in immediate suspension of access to
   unclassified and classified ISs.
   4.3.3. Unintentional and/or intentional actions that threaten or damage AF ISs will result in
   immediate suspension of access to unclassified and classified ISs according to CJCSI
   6510.01.
   4.3.3. (934AW) Unintentional and/or intentional actions that threaten or damage AF ISs
   will result in immediate suspension of access to unclassified and classified ISs according to
   CJCSI 6510.01. See Table 4.2 for guidance.
       4.3.3.1. According to CJCSI 6510.01, suspend access to classified ISs if the user’s
       security clearance is suspended, denied, or revoked. If an individual’s clearance is
       suspended, denied, or revoked, the ISO coordinates with the organization commander and
       determines if unclassified network access can be maintained according to paragraph
       4.3.3.3.
       4.3.3.1. (934AW) According to CJCSI 6510.01, suspend access to classified ISs if the
       user’s security clearance is suspended, denied, or revoked. If an individual’s clearance is
       suspended, denied, or revoked, their IS access will be disabled until their security
       clearance has been reinstated.
       4.3.3.2. The IAO notifies the ISO and/or the organizational commander upon discovery
       or notification of user activity that is inconsistent with the terms of DoD IA training or
       inconsistent with approved IS security usage.
       4.3.3.3. At the direction of the organizational commander, the IAO suspends user access
       and the ISO provides reason for the suspension. The ISO identifies requirements required
       for account reinstatement (at a minimum, DoD IA remedial training, MAJCOM required,
       or USCYBERCOM CTO-directed requirements). Upon satisfactorily completing
       retraining and any other requirements, the IAO, on behalf of the ISO and/or
       organizational commander initiates reinstatement.
       4.3.3.3. (934AW) Upon suspension, denial, or revocation of the user’s security
       clearance, the IAO suspends user access and the ISO provides reason for the suspension.
       The ISO identifies requirements required for account reinstatement (at a minimum,
AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                              15


          security clearance reinstatement, DoD IA remedial training, MAJCOM required, or
          USCYBERCOM CTO-directed requirements). Upon satisfactorily completing retraining
          and any other requirements, the IAO, on behalf of the ISO and/or organizational
          commander initiates reinstatement.
          4.3.3.4. The ISO reviews all pertinent documentation relating to the justification for the
          suspension, the risk to the network, and operational requirements. The organizational
          commander makes a determination as to whether or not to suspend the individual's
          network access. See Table 4.1, Network Access Suspension Matrix, as guidance for when
          an individual’s security clearance is suspended, denied, or revoked, for whatever reason.
       4.3.4. If the user disputes IS access suspension, follow local command level legal guidance.

     4.4.1.1. Maintain the group account configurations according to the IS C&A
     documentation and according to DoDI 8500.2.
     4.4.1.2. Ensure assignment of individual accounts to privileged users. Group or shared
     accounts do not support nonrepudiation and least-privilege access controls.
     4.4.1.3. Notify privileged users to de-provision all user accounts from an IS whenever
     the user no longer requires access to the IS within 24 hours of notification (e.g., whenever
     the user is permanently transferred to another location, termination of employment,
     retirement).
     4.4.1.4. Substitute reusable IS user accounts on systems with frequent user-turnover
     (e.g., students, temporary employees, exercise accounts). For specific procedures, see
     MPTO 00-33B-5004, Chapter 3.
     4.4.1.5. Develop local procedures in coordination with privileged users to log off users
     manually if automatic log off functions are not technically feasible (e.g., SIPRNET
     clients, non-Windows based).
     4.4.1.6. Develop notification procedures for de-provisioning IS user accounts when an
     employee (e.g., military, civilian, or contractor) transfers, retires, separates, or is
     terminated, or for any other loss of IS access.
     4.4.1.7. Perform annual audit of user accounts to verify permissions/least privilege and
     ensure that de-provisioning of accounts has taken place according to DoDI 8500.2.
  4.4.2. Privileged User Account Actions. Specific procedural information is located in TO
  00-33A-1202, Air Force Network Account Management. Privileged users will:
     4.4.2.1. Configure all individual IS accounts with a unique identifier. For group or
     shared accounts see paragraph 5.7 for group accounts with PKI.
     4.4.2.2. Permit group accounts only for reasons of operational necessity on unclassified
     and classified systems and networks as determined by the organizational commander,
     reviewed by the system IAM, approved by the ISO, and fully documented in the C&A
     package.
     4.4.2.3. Associate each IS user identity with all auditable actions supporting
     nonrepudiation and accountability according to DoDI 8500.2.
     4.4.2.4. Incorporate electronic or paper tracking and reviewing methods to match
     individual users to generic usernames (e.g., user log sheet) every 30 days.
         4.4.2.4.1. Per direction of the IAO/IAM, disable user accounts once the users no
         longer require access (e.g., permanent change of station, separation, class graduation).
     4.4.2.5. Configure account lockout parameters according to the USCYBERCOM Public
     Key Infrastructure (PKI) Implementation CTO 07-015 and CJCSI 6510.01.
     4.4.2.6. Configure automatic log off functions due to user inactivity according to the
     minimum standards identified in according to DoDI 8500.2 and the applicable DISA
     OS/Database STIGs.
     4.4.2.7. Configure and implement automated IS controls to check and disable IS user
     accounts that have been dormant more than 30 days according to CJCSI 6510.01. AF
 18                                           AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


      CIO Exception: Disable National Guard and Reserve member IS user accounts only after
      90 days of inactivity.
          4.4.2.7.1. If an approved hardware token is used as the only IS’s account
          authentication method, user account access expires when the approved hardware
          token expires according to CJCSI 6510.01.
          4.4.2.7.2. For PK-enabled ISs using Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), disable
          or limit pin caching features according to the applicable DISA OS (e.g., Windows)
          and DISA Access Control STIGs.
      4.4.2.8. Delete unnecessary (to include service accounts) and/or default accounts and
      change all factory default or user-generated passwords included in a newly acquired
      system (software or hardware) according to the configuration information in the IS C&A
      package before allowing any user access to the system.
          4.4.2.8.1. Rename default accounts that cannot be deleted, according to applicable
          DISA STIGs.
          4.4.2.8.2. Do not execute root-level access in IS applications.
      4.4.2.9. Disable user accounts (do not delete) when users are unable to remotely access
      their accounts due to an extended absence or when a user is suspended from work, IS
      access is revoked for any reason, or the security clearance is suspended as specified in
      paragraph 4.3.
      4.4.2.10. Before unlocking the user account, a validated mechanism must be in place to
      validate the user’s identity with the IAO (e.g., in-person identification, digitally signed
      email).
4.5. Password/PIN Management. ISs must follow PKI requirements in USCYBERCOM
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Implementation CTO 07-015 and Chapter 5, Public Key
Infrastructure as an authentication means to the NIPRNET.
   4.5.1. Specific procedural information for password management is located in MPTO 00-
   33B-5004, Chapter 4.
   4.5.2. According to DoDI 8520.02,, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key (PK)
   Enabling, and the DISA STIG, Access Control in Support of Information Systems, all DoD
   networks required by DoDD 8500.1 to authenticate users will perform this authentication
   using certificates issued by DoD-approved PKI on hardware tokens. The CAC is the primary
   hardware token, but there are special instances where the CAC cannot be used to perform
   various missions. To accommodate these various missions, the DoD CIO has approved the
   use of the Alternate Login Token (ALT). See Chapter 5, Public Key Infrastructure.
   4.5.3. In addition to the AF-specific password guidance contained within this publication,
   configure IS password authentication according to the DISA Access Control STIG. DISA
   STIG and/or USCYBERCOM Tasking Order (TO) password requirements take precedence
   only if more restrictive than guidance in this publication.
   4.5.4. The ISO and system IAM will ensure where passwords are used for access to AF-GIG
   restricted assets (i.e., networks, workstations, or applications), at a minimum, passwords are
   created and changed in accordance with current USCYBERCOM CTOs and CJCSI 6510.01.
AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                        19


     4.5.4.1. Meet the minimum complexity requirements as specified in the applicable DISA
     STIGs and MPTO 00-33B-5004. See CTO 07-015 for additional guidance.
     4.5.4.2. One-time password generators or hardware token implementation must follow
     the guidance provided in the DISA STIG, Access Control in Support of Information
     Systems,.
     4.5.4.3. ISO and system IAM will establish a frequency based on mission, operational
     needs or IS technical feasibility if not able to meet this requirement (e.g., AF Reserve
     Components).
  4.5.5. Protect all passwords and PINs based on the sensitivity of the information or critical
  operations they protect (e.g., a password used to gain access to a SECRET network is itself
  classified SECRET).
     4.5.5.1. Classify passwords and PINs at the highest level of information processed on
     that system. As a minimum, safeguard passwords as “For Official Use Only” (FOUO).
     See Appendix 3 of DoD Regulation 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, for an
     explanation of FOUO.
     4.5.5.2. If necessary for mission accomplishment (i.e., pre-established accounts for
     contingency or exercise), place the password in a properly marked, sealed envelope or
     Standard Form 700, Security Container Information Form, and store in a General
     Services Administration (GSA)-approved container as specified in the DISA Access
     Control STIG.
  4.5.6. The ISO and system IAM ensure compliance with DoDI 8500.2 for shared/group
  passwords and PINs and obtain approval by the DAA according to CJCSI 6510.01.
  Implement system and physical auditing procedures in conjunction with these methods to
  support non-repudiation and accountability.
     4.5.6.1. Consider unauthorized sharing of passwords a security incident according to
     CJCSI 6510.01. See Chapter 7, Data Spillage and COMPUSEC Incident Reporting.
  4.5.7. In the event of a compromised password or PIN, the ISO and system IAM ensures
  procedures are in place to implement immediate password and PIN change activities. The
  IAO follows established reporting and investigation procedures according to AFI 33-138,
  Enterprise Network Operations Notification and Tracking (to become AFI 33-115, AF GIG
  Services). If the PIN is the access code to an approved PKI token, the compromise of the PIN
  warrants probable compromise of the certificates. See paragraph 5.8
  4.5.8. Protect all passwords and PINs during transmission using Federal Information
  Processing Standards (FIPS)-approved encryption according to DoDI 8500.2. If not
  technically feasible, require the use of a one-time password to access the IS.
  4.5.9. Privileged users will incorporate electronic or paper tracking methods to account for
  user activity when using shared passwords. Shared passwords will meet all requirements as
  specified in this publication.
  4.5.10. Institute automated procedures to reject rapid retries when entering a password
  incorrectly.
 20                                           AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013


   4.5.11. The ISO will ensure the establishment of procedures for manual or automatic
   password changes by users. The IS will require users to change the one time password at
   initial logon according to DoDI 8500.2.
       4.5.11.1. Configure IS user accounts to enforce password history in accordance with
       applicable DISA STIG. If ISs cannot support STIG requirements, configure to maximum
       and document in C&A package.
       4.5.11.2. IS privileged users implement policies enforcing a minimum seven-day wait
       before a user may optionally change the password.
   4.5.12. Upon a suspected or confirmed compromised or “cracked” password and/or PIN, the
   IAO must immediately take measures to lock down the account in question.
   4.5.13. Configure password cracking tools and procedures according to DoDI 8500.2. See
   MPTO 00-33B-5004 for password cracking specific guidance.
4.6. Biometric Management. The definition of biometrics is a measurable biological
(anatomical and physiological) and behavioral characteristic used for automated recognition. As
a process, biometrics is an automated method of recognizing an individual based on measurable
biological (anatomical and physiological) and behavioral characteristics.
   4.6.1. Biometrics is an important AF operational enabler that will be fully integrated to
   conduct the AF mission in support of joint military operations according to DoDD 8521.01E,
   Department of Defense Biometrics.
       4.6.1.1. Design biometrics programs to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
       biometrics activities throughout the AF by eliminating duplication and overlap of
       technology development and information management efforts.
       4.6.1.2. Configure biometric programs according to the DISA Biometrics Security
       Checklist (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/checklist/).
   4.6.2. At the discretion of the installation commander, the collection and use of biometrics
   may occur at any time when a person requests or requires access to systems, facilities, and
   networks under the responsibility of the AF or according to host nation and Status of Forces
   Agreement (SOFA) agreements.
   4.6.3. All biometrics activities shall be coordinated via the sponsoring AF functional
   organization through the Biometrics Identity Management Agency (BIMA) at
   http://www.biometrics.dod.mil/ and approved by DoD Biometrics Executive Committee
   (EXCOM) before acquisition.
   4.6.4. When used, biometrics will be collected, matched, transmitted, stored, shared,
   archived, and received according to AF procedures for each group as defined by the National
   Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Biometrics Glossary; AFI 63-101,
   Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management; and AFI 33-332.
   4.6.5. In accordance with Office of the DoD CIO disposition definitions, biometrics fall into
   two groups governing storage and retention.
       4.6.5.1. Group 1 consists of military, government civilians, and military dependents;
       indefinite storage and retention apply.
AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                         21


      4.6.5.2. Group 2 consists of contractors, visitors, and temporary workers; disposition of
      biometric data occurs at the end of the access period.
   4.6.6. All biometrics data and associated information collected as a result of DoD operations
   or activities will be maintained or controlled by the Department of Defense, unless otherwise
   specified by BIMA for DoD Biometrics at a later date.
4.7. Account Auditing.
   4.7.1. IS auditing events will be configured according to CJCSI 6510.01 and the applicable
   DISA STIGs (application, operating system, database, etc).
      4.7.1.1. Privileged users must ensure the IS audit trail function is enabled for accounts.
      Only privileged users have access to the audit trail file.
   4.7.2. The audit trail must not contain unencrypted (clear text) passwords, incorrectly
   entered passwords, or character strings, as this could expose the password of a legitimate
   user.
   4.7.3. All audit records must be maintained according to AFRIMS, Records Distribution
   System             (RDS),           Table            33-25,         Rule            8

                           PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE

5.1. Introduction. The DoD and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) PKIs
use asymmetric cryptography to identify and authenticate users to systems and networks for the
NIPPRNET and SIPRNET. PKI hardware tokens provides two-factor authentication for access
to DoD and AF ISs and networks for both NIPRNET and SIPRNET. Two-factor authentication
is a combination of something the user has and something the user knows.
5.2. NIPRNET PKI. The most commonly used unclassified PKI hardware token or smart card
is the CAC. On AF installations, the Air Force Military Personnel Flight (MPF) issues the CAC.
On non-AF locations, any Real-time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS)
issues CACs.
   5.2.1. The CAC is the primary hardware token for identifying individuals for logical access
   to NIPRNET assets and physical access to DoD facilities according to Directive-Type
   Memorandum (DTM) 08-003, Next Generation Common Access Card (CAC)
   Implementation Guidance (to be incorporated into DoD Manual 1000.13-M Volume 1).
   5.2.2. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) manages the issuance of CACs through Defense
   Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System/Real-Time Automated Personal Identification
   System (DEERS/RAPIDS).
       5.2.2.1. According to AFI 36-3026 IP. Volume 1, Identification (ID) Cards for Members
       of the Uniformed Services, Their Eligible Family Members, and Other Eligible
       Personnel, authorized users are issued PKI certificates on the CAC.
   5.2.3. The CAC provides a cryptographic certificate-based logon identity that is valid until
   expiration of the CAC (not to exceed three years).
   5.2.4. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Authentication certificates can be utilized on
   CAC’s to logon to additional accounts in the domain/AF GIG. See TO 31S5-4-7255-8-1,
   Configuration and Operations Guide for Air Force Certificate-Based Smart Card
   Logon/Next Generation Using Personnal Identity Verification (PIV) Certificate for further
   information on implementing this capability.
   5.2.5. DoD PIV Authentication certificates can be utilized on CAC’s for smart card logon to
   multiple accounts in the domain/AF GIG. See TO 31S5-4-7256-8-1, Configuration and
   Operations Guide for Air Force Certificate-Based Smart Card Logon / Next Generation
   Using Alternate Security Identification (ALTSECID) for further information on implementing
   this capability.
   5.2.6. The ALT is an unclassified PKI hardware token or smart card containing a computer
   chip with a certificate issued by the AF PKI Registration Authority (RA). Use of an ALT
   with DoD PKI certificates is authorized for specific cases when certificates issued on the
   CAC cannot be used by various groups of network users.
       5.2.6.1. The ALT standard operating procedure defines use categories. Standard
       operating procedures are available on the AF PKI System Program Office (SPO) site
       (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil.)

   5.2.7. The VoLAC is an unclassified PKI hardware token or smart card used for volunteers
   and issued by MPF for network access only. Request a VoLAC through the organization
   CVS TA.
5.3. SIPRNET PKI. SIPRNET currently uses two forms of access, username/password or PKI
hardware token/smart card and PIN. The SIPRNET PKI token is currently being implemented
with an estimated completion date of December 2012. During the deployment, the
username/password will remain as an option to authenticate to the SIPRNET as an alternative to
using the SIPRNET hardware token or smart card.
   5.3.1. The Local Registration Authority (LRA), normally residing at the supporting base,
   issues the SIPRNET hardware token or smart card with a computer chip. The SIPRNET
   hardware token or smart card provides authorized users with an identity certificate, digital
   signature certificate, and an encryption certificate. With appropriate network configuration,
   the SIPRNET hardware token or smart card provides user authentication and non-repudiation
   for network logon.
       5.3.1.1. The SIPRNET hardware token or smart card is a high-value unclassified item.
       Maintain the SIPRNET hardware token according to CNSSI Instruction for National
       Security Systems Public Key Infrastructure X.509 Certificate Policy, Registration
       Practice Statement (RPS).
       5.3.1.2. The token is classified SECRET when inserted into SIPRNET hardware token
       reader and PIN is entered (unlocked) and in use, and is considered unclassified when
       removed from its SIPRNET hardware token reader and not in use.
       5.3.1.3. Do not leave the SIPRNET hardware token unattended in computer network
       resources.
   5.3.2. Maintain the SIPRNET hardware token in the positive control of the authorized user,
   who is represented by the embedded certificates according to the applicable CNSS policy or
   RPS.
       5.3.2.1. Immediately report any suspected loss of control to the LRA. Positive control
       includes maintaining visual contact when in use. When not in use, the assigned user must
       maintain physical possession of the SIPRNET hardware tokenor it must be locked in a
       container that only the assigned user can unlock.
       5.3.2.2. Revoke SIPRNET hardware token certificates when there is suspected loss of
       positive control or unauthorized use of the token or a certificate. Return any token
       determined to be temporarily out of the positive control of the assigned user to the LRA.
       When returned, zeroize the private keys and revoke the certificates. If zeroizing and
       revocation is not possible or if there is evidence of tampering with the SIPRNET
       hardware token, the LRA will return the token to NSA for investigation and/or
       destruction. See paragraph 5.8 for key compromise guidance.
       5.3.2.3. If the SIPRNet hardware token is lost or stolen and not recovered, immediately
       report this information to the LRA to initiate the revocation process according to the
       applicable Certificate Practice Statement (CPS). See paragraph 5.8 for key compromise
       guidance.

   5.3.3. Permit only the latest version of domain-aware middleware on SIPRNET ISs where
   the SIPRNet hardware token is to be utilized. Configure the domain-aware middleware to
   activate only SIPRNet hardware tokens initialized for use on the SIPRNET. Remove all other
   middleware products from the IS. ActivClient is not authorized for use on SIPRNet.
   5.3.4. Ensure all SIPRNet networks utilize the National Security Systems (NSS) Root
   Certificate Authority (CA) and are current with all PKI security patches and configuration
   settings according to the applicable CPS.
   5.3.5. Prohibit the introduction of (operational) SIPRNET tokens on unclassified ISs.
   NOTE: This does not apply to testing cards on unclassified test beds.
       5.3.5.1. SIPRNET hardware tokens inserted into unclassified IS may result in a security
       violation and must be reported to the local network ISO through the IAO to determine if
       the incident is a security violation.
       5.3.5.2. If a SIPRNET hardware token incident occurs, report the incident to the local
       information system security officers, confiscate the SIPRNet hardware token and ensure
       the certificates are revoked. Follow the guidance in Chapter 7, Data Spillage and
       COMPUSEC Incident Reporting.
   5.3.6. Introduction of unclassified tokens (e.g., CAC, ALT, PIV, VoLAC, and or PIV-I) on
   SIPRNET ISs is NOT authorized.
       5.3.6.1. The SIPRNET domain aware middleware configuration must detect the
       NIPRNet token, block PIN entry, and block any service applets that do not require PIN
       entry.
       5.3.6.2. An unclassified hardware token inserted into a SIPRNET IS does not constitute a
       security violation unless the PIN prompt appears. Report the incident to the local
       network Information Security Officer through the IAO to determine if the incident is a
       security violation. Follow the guidance in Chapter 7, Data Spillage and COMPUSEC
       Incident Reporting.
   5.3.7. The connection of keyboards with built-in CAC readers and external USB CAC
   readers to classified ISs are not permitted. Connect only approved SIPRNET token readers
   (i.e. Omikey 3121) to SIPRNET ISs.
5.4. External PKI. Only rely on certificates that are issued by a DoD PKI or by an external
PKI that has been approved for use. DoDI 8520.02 outlines the policies for External PKI
approved for use with DoD relying parties.
   5.4.1. Before an organization can add any PKI Certificate Authorities (CA) into its website’s
   Certificate Trust List (CTL), the organization must coordinate with AF PKI Requirements
   Lead (AFNIC/EVAI, afnic.evai@us.af.mil).
       5.4.1.1. The IAO and/or IAM ensure access approval and validation by the external PKI,
       coordinating with AFNIC/EVAI prior to any configuration activities.
       5.4.1.2. The IAO implements access control measures to enable enforcement of need-to-

5.5. Escrowed Certificates. The CA provides automatic escrow of the e-mail encryption key
according to X.509 Certificate Policy for United States Department of Defense. Perform recovery
of escrowed encryption keys according to the CA associated practice statements.
   5.5.1. Changing of employment roles (i.e. contractor-to-government civilian, military-to-
   contractor, etc) may affect the users need-to-know and requires the users to request manually
   the escrowed encryption certificate. For additional guidance, see the AF PKI SPO website.
5.6. Software Certificate Issuance and Control.
   5.6.1. AF LRA and TAs must comply with the detailed policy and procedures in the United
   States Air Force (USAF) Local Registration Authority (LRA) Certification Practice
   Statement for Class 3 Assurance. Procedural and training material is available on the AF PKI
   SPO website.
   5.6.2. Software certificates are available for use on both unclassified and SIPRNET ISs after
   inclusion in the C&A package and DAA approval. If DAA approved, software certificates
   remain in use only for the minimum time according to the applicable DISA STIGs.
   5.6.3. Encryption software certificates for organizational e-mail mailboxes, to include
   portable electronic devices (PEDs), must have a designated sponsor appointed in writing to
   receive and manage the certificates using a standard memorandum. The AF RA or LRA, as
   appropriate, will maintain a file of requirement validation documentation. For organizational
   e-mail mailboxes on PEDs, follow the appropriate DISA STIG. For additional guidance, see
   the AF PKI SPO website.
   5.6.4. DoD PKI certificates and associated private keys are stored in a Public-Key
   Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #12 file on a removal storage medium. PKCS#12 files will
   NOT be left in on-line file systems, and must be properly installed into the cryptographic
   module on an IS for use. See paragraph 5.6.6.1 for more information.

   software certificate installation files (.p12 or .pfx) from hard drvies and other online storage
   devices weekly.
       5.6.6.1. Removal of software certificate files does not prevent usage of software
       certificates for web servers, group, or role-based functions. The process only requires
       removal of the “.p12” or “.pfx” transportable file object that contains the private key
       corresponding to the DoD trusted certificate from online accessibility after installation.
       NOTE: Some applications create files with extensions of “.p12” or “.pfx” that are NOT
       certificate installation files. Removal of non-certificate installation files from systems is
       not required.
5.7. Group Accounts Utilizing PKI. Group accounts (not to be confused with organizational
accounts) are special case accounts where more than one person may hold an ALT (private key)
to access the same account. Procedural material is available on the AF PKI SPO web site.
   5.7.1. Authorized users must request individual ALTs to access the group account; each
   token will contain an individual identification certificate. See paragraphs 5.2.6 and 5.2.6.1

   5.7.2. The IAM and/or the TA maintains an inventory of token serial numbers and their
   assignment at all times.
5.8. Key Compromise.
   5.8.1. The IAO immediately notifies the supporting TA, LRA, or the AF RA
   (afpki.ra@lackland.af.mil) directly by encrypted e-mail if an AF PKI certificate holder
   (software certificate or token) suspects a compromise of the holder’s private key. See
   Chapter 7, Data Spillage and COMPUSEC Incident Reporting.
       5.8.1.1. The AF RA must revoke certificates suspected of key compromise within 24
       hours or the next duty day (whichever is first) after notification.
   5.8.2. Certificate revocation is necessary to terminate a certificate’s use before its normal
   expiration date. Examples of reasons for revocations include private key compromise (e.g.,
   lost or stolen token), loss of trust in a user, changes in a user’s legal name, or departure from
   the DoD.
       5.8.2.1. Revoke all other certificates (e.g., encryption and digital signature) on the token
       if there is a revocation of a user's ID certificate. Enter the revoked certificates into a DoD
       Certificate Revocation List. All applications (i.e. web sites, etc.) should check validity
       (e.g., the trust path, expiration, and revocation status) of the presented certificate prior to
       allowing access based on PKI authentication.
5.9. Server Certificates.
   5.9.1. The AF RA will approve issuance of Medium-Assurance DoD PKI or NSS
   (SIPRNET) server certificates based on validation by a properly appointed LRA, or TA.
   Specific instructions to obtain and load DoD server certificates are available on the AF PKI
   web site.
   5.9.2. A server certificate must be reissued when the fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
   for the server changes or after three years.
   5.9.3. All private Air Force Web servers must be issued a DOD X.509 PKI Server certificate
   and have 128-bit encryption Secure Sockets Layer (SSL); this certificate must be enabled at
   all times according to DoDI 8520.02.
5.10. Code Signing Certificates. Code signing certificates are specially formatted certificates
used for digitally signing executable program code in any number of languages or formats.
   5.10.1. Submit these software certificates requests to AF PKI Requirements Leads office for
   issuance on a hardware token by the AF RA/AF PKI SPO. For additional guidance, see the
   AF PKI SPO web site.
5.11. Certificate Reissuance Prior to Expiration. Certificate owners needing continued PKI
services must ensure reissue of their certificates at least 30 days prior to the certificate expiration
date in order to prevent disruption in service.
5.12. Network Authentication. Enable all unclassified networks to use hardware tokens, DoD
PKI certificate-based authentication, and set authorized user accounts to require smart card logon
by selecting, “Smart card is required for interactive logon,” in Windows Active Directory
environments. Obtain exceptions to this policy from the AF DAA through the respective
MAJCOM PKI or IA representative. See paragraph 4.5

             DATA SPILLAGE AND COMPUSEC INCIDENT REPORTING

7.1. Introduction. An incident is defined as an assessed occurrence that actually or potentially
jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an IS; or when the information on the
system processes, stores, or transmits; or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of
violation of security polices, security, procedures, or acceptable use policies (See Committee on
National Security Systems Instruction [CNSSI] 4009).
   7.1.1. The ISO ensures the IS is monitored to detect and react to incidents, intrusions,
   disruption of services, or other unauthorized activities that threaten the security of DoD
   operations or IT resources, in accordance with CSCSI 6510.01, DoDI 8500.2, and the
   applicable DISA STIGs.
   7.1.2. The Incident Response Plan (IRP) for the IS defines reportable incidents, outline
   standard operating procedures, establish an incident response team, and is exercised at least
   every six months, according to DoDI O-8530.2, Support to Computer Network Defense,
   (CND).
       7.1.2.1. The IAO ensures reporting procedures identify user actions for reporting CAC
       removal screen lock malfunctions and violations of IA policy. See MPTO 00-33B-5007,
       Security Incident Management for Information Systems, Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4., and
       Table 2-1, for specific guidance.
       7.1.2.2. The IAO reviews and/or updates reporting procedures every six months or
       sooner, as mission dictates.
       7.1.2.3. The IAO/IAM documents the results of the exercise.
   7.1.3. When classified information is processed or maintained on an unclassified IS, the
   individual discovering the incident follows the procedures in paragraph 7.4 and initiates
   security incident procedures according to DoD 5200.1-R, AFI 31-401, Information Security
   Program Management, and reporting requirements from AFI 33-138 (to become AFI 33-
   115).
   7.1.4. The system/device in question must be confiscated if directed by the IRP chief and/or
   physically guarded and stored appropriately according to the suspected level of classification
   on the device until the orginal classification authority is contacted and/or appropriate
   Security Classification Guide is reviewed to determine if an incident has occurred.
   7.1.5. If the determination indicates contamination, the system/device is contaminated it
   must be sanitized or destroyed according to Chapter 8, Remanence Security.
       7.1.5.1. See paragraph 6.8.2 for confiscation guidance on privately owned ISs involved
       in a data spillage or CMI.
   7.1.6. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 6510.01, Information
   Assurance (IA) and Computer Network Defense (CND) Volume 1 (Incident Handling
   Program) provides Computer Network Defense (CND) processes to rapidly identify and
   respond to incidents that adversely affect AF ISs.
AFMAN33-282_934AWSUP_I 24 APRIL 2013                                                            41


   7.1.7. Specific procedural information for incident response is located in MPTO 00-33B-
   5007.
7.2. Data Spillage. Data spillage occurs when a higher classification level of data is placed on a
lower classification level system/device according to CNSSI 4009. For example, when a user
takes a file such as a word document and copies it to removable media (e.g. DVD or CD) from
SIPRNET and then the user takes that media and loads the data onto a NIPRNET computer.
   7.2.1. Data spillage should not be confused with a CMI. A CMI is a data spillage but a data
   spillage is not necessarily a CMI.
7.3. Classified Message Incidents. A classified message incident occurs when higher
classification level of data is transferred to a lower classification level system/device via
messaging systems according to AFI 33-138 (to become AFI 33-115, AF GIG Services).
7.4. Incident Response Flow. Incident response planning must include appropriate tasks to
secure the computing environment from further malicious activity and preserve computer
forensic evidence for analysis.
   7.4.1. User disconnects affected IS or media from the network (i.e. removal of network
   cable, turn off wireless capability, etc.). Do not turn off the IS. Protect the IS or media
   accordingly to its highest classification level of data involved.
   7.4.2. User notifies organizational or system IAO or other designated representative as
   outlined in local operating instructions such as the Unit Security Manager (USM), supervisor,
   security manager, servicing network control center, etc. The USM notifies the wing
   Information Protection (IP) office as soon as possible (preferably within 24 hours).
   7.4.3. IAO or other designated representative initiates containment, which may include
   notification of all affected parties.
   7.4.4. IAO or other designated representative begins reporting process such as the Wing IA
   office, unit leadership, affected server operations, all users affected to include owners of any
   affected mail accounts or network user accounts.
   7.4.5. IAO or other designated representative identifies key information for sanitization.
   7.4.6. IAO or other designated representative hands over sanitization process to Client
   Support Technicians (CSTs) who then follow local procedures (see MPTO 00-33B-5007) to
   eliminate the affected file(s).
   7.4.7. IAOs or other designated representatives at every level must understand this flow.
   IAO must educate users to this process. Basic incident response procedures are located in
   MPTO 00-33B-5007.

                                           Chapter 8

                                 REMANENCE SECURITY

8.1. Introduction. Remanence security is actions taken to protect the confidentiality of
information on ISs. Methods to protect confidentiality include sanitization, overwriting, and
destruction. Each method provides specific levels of information protection.
   8.1.1. Unless determined by mission or operational need and documented in the IS C&A
   package or directed by the IP chief, the destruction of any media is the preferred method for
   all rather than clearing or sanitizing. See USCYBERCOM CTO 10-084 and the DISA
   Removable Storage and External Connection Technologies STIG for higher risk data transfer
   requirements.
       8.1.1.1. In situations where a media sanitization plan of action is not clearly defined and
       governed by this guide, MPTO 00-33B-5008, Remanence Security for Information
       Systems, or the IS C&A package, exercise risk management procedures according to
       guidelines in DoDD 8500.01, CJCSI 6510.01, and NIST Special publication 800-88,
       Guidelines for Media Sanitization. Balance risk management decisions on information
       sensitivity, threats and vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness and potential impact of the
       decided action.
       8.1.1.2. Consider mitigation options (e.g., clearing, sanitization, destruction) based on
       operational risk management as approved within the IS C&A package before sanitizing
       IS media due to classified information spillages. Notify the wing IAO of the selected
       sanitization method.
   8.1.2. All unclassified IS storage media will be sanitized before leaving the control of the
   DoD, according to the Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Disposition of
   Unclassified Hard Drives, dated 4 June 2001.
       8.1.2.1. Track and dispose of unclassified IS storage media previously contaminated with
       classified data as classified media. Destroy according to the declassification procedures
       of NSA/CSA Policy Manual 9-12, NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual.
   8.1.3. Prohibit reuse of classified IS storage media in unclassified environments; destroy
   according to CJSCI 6510.01 and the declassification procedures of NSA/CSA Policy Manual
   9-12. Classified IS storage media can be reused in an IS environment at the same or higher
   classification level.
   8.1.4. Specific procedural information for remanence security is located in MPTO 00-33B-
   5008.
