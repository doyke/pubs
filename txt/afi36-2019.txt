1. Responsibilities. The USAFA offers cadet appointments to candidates with the strongest potential to
become successful career officers. USAFA offers appointments according to law and HQ USAF guid-
ance. The President may appoint candidates to become cadets; however, appointments are conditional

       bers of the Congress in selecting the best-qualified applicants for nomination.
      1.2.3. Advise qualified applicants to seek a nomination. Inform and encourage individuals whose
      evaluations reflect areas needing improvement to submit additional test scores or information in
      an effort to improve their qualifications.
      1.2.4. Schedule qualified applicants for a medical examination through the Department of
      Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DoDMERB) for military service eligibility. DoD-
      MERB will notify the student directly of his or her medical status.

       years.

      obligated service because of the acceptance of that appointment. If such cadets fail to complete
      the Academy course of instruction, or are separated from service as cadets for any reason other
      than appointment as a commissioned officer or because of a physical disability, they will revert to
      enlisted status to serve any prior service obligation under 10 U.S.C. 516. However, all service as
      a cadet is counted toward fulfillment of the remaining period of obligated service.

   her principal nominee and up to nine other nominees. HQ USAFA/RRS evaluates and ranks nomi-
   nees by order-of-merit. If the principal nominee is fully qualified, HQ USAFA/RRS will offer this
   individual the appointment; otherwise, HQ USAFA/RRS will offer the appointment to the fully qual-
   ified alternate nominee ranked the highest.

                            APPOINTMENT VACANCY SELECTION

This attachment provides instructions for charging appointments to the appropriate nominating source.

A4.1. HQ USAFA/RRS charges appointees on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force. HQ USAFA/
OL-C will audit all charges. Selection of the charged cadets from the nominees for each vacancy is
accomplished as follows:
   A4.1.1. Principal Nominee, Numbered-Alternate Method. If the Principal Nominee has accepted
   appointment, he or she is charged against their nominating source vacancy. Otherwise the highest
   ranked alternate accepting an appointment is charged. In instances where a candidate received princi-
   pal nominations from two different congressional sources, the principal is normally charged to the
   Member of Congress who submitted the nomination first.
   A4.1.2. Principal Nominee, Competitive-Alternate Method. If the Principal nominee has accepted
   appointment, he or she is charged against the nominating source vacancy. HQ USAFA/RRS evalu-
   ates alternates and ranks according to merit. If the Principal does not meet admission criteria, the
   highest ranking alternate accepting an appointment is charged.
   A4.1.3. Competitive Nominee Method. HQ USAFA/RRS evaluates the group of competitive nom-
   inees, ranks according to merit, and charges the highest-ranked nominee accepting an appointment.
   A4.1.4. Multiple Congressional Nominations. For candidates receiving numerous nominations,
   HQ USAFA/RRS normally charges the candidate to the congressional source. When a candidate is
   nominated by several congressional sources, HQ USAFA/RRS charges the candidate to the slate of
   the congressional member where the candidate ranks the highest, unless the candidate is the principal
   nominee or a numbered alternate.
   A4.1.5. Other Sources of Nomination. HQ USAFA/RRS charges all other candidates not nomi-
   nated by congressional, Vice-Presidential, or US Possessions to that nominating source (Presidential,
   AFJROTC, AFROTC, CODDV, Medal of Honor, etc.).
   A4.1.6. Qualified Alternates. To bring the Cadet Wing up to strength, the qualified alternates
   appointed according to paragraph 2.3.2. are charged to the Secretary of the Air Force. Those candi-
   dates having congressional, Vice-Presidential, or US Possessions nominations appear as a qualified
   alternate for that nominating source.
   A4.1.7. Multiple Congressional and Other Sources of Nomination. For appointees who have
   multiple nominations, HQ USAFA/RRS determines the appointment category to which they are
   charged. Normally a cadet with both congressional and noncongressional nominations is charged to a
   congressional authority. HQ USAFA/RRS notifies HQ USAFA/OL-C, of these assignments. HQ
   USAFA/OL-C audits and verifies the charges, then notifies the Vice-President, nominating authorities
   in the Congress, and US Possessions of their charged appointees and other nominees who win
   appointments.
