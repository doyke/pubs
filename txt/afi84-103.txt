Supersedes AFI 84-103, 3 January 2003.                                                                                      Pages: 93

This instruction helps implement AFPD 84-1, Air Force History and Museum Programs, by giving
requirements for the management of historical property and related museum activities.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1. This change replaces the USAF Museum Advisory
Board with the USAF Heritage Program Board of Directors (paragraphs 1.2. and 1.2.3.) and directs that
SAF/AA serve on the Board (paragraph 1.2.3.3.). It deletes the requirement that HQ USAF/CCC, all
CONUS MAJCOM CVs, NGB/CF, and the Deputy Director of the National Air and Space Museum
(ex-officio) serve on the Board. This change also strengthens inventory procedure language for historical
property on loan to heritage activities (6.14.) and increases the requirement for photographs of historical
property on loan from every four years to every two years (6.14.2.). The entire text of the IC is at the last
attachment.

                                                  Chapter 5

                               RESTRUCTURING USAFHP ACTIVITIES

5.1. Rationale. Temporary closures may occur for several reasons, including natural disasters, loss of
interest, contingency operations and professional deficiencies. In coordination with MAJCOM/CV, the
USAFHP Director may recommend to HQ USAF/CVA to temporarily freeze loan accounts of a heritage
activity until deficiencies are corrected (i.e., no historical property transactions will occur). In coordina-
tion with HQ USAF/HO, the USAFHP Director may permanently close an activity if it fails to meet the
minimum standards of this instruction.

5.2. Temporary Closures. The initiating authority coordinates all temporary closures with the MAJ-
COM/CV and HQ USAF/HO. Send an informational copy to the USAFHP Director. Include:
     5.2.1. Reasons for the temporary closing.
     5.2.2. Estimated time the activity will remain closed.
     5.2.3. Inventory at time of closure, certified by current staff.
     5.2.4. Temporary location of the historical property, whether it meets the requirements for security
     and conservation and who oversees the historical property during the inactive period.

5.3. Permanent Closures. The Air Force considers any closure of more than 180 days permanent. The
initiating authority coordinates all permanent closures with the MAJCOM/CV and HQ USAF/HO. Send
an informational copy to the USAFHP Director.
     5.3.1. Bring accessioning and cataloging up to date during this period and give a final inventory list
     to USAFM/MUC.
     5.3.2. The HPC and representatives of MAJCOM/HO and USAFM/MUC must conduct a joint inven-
     tory before an organization officially closes the activity.
     5.3.3. Resolve all property accountability issues before closing the activity.
     5.3.4. The organization which sponsors the closing heritage activity bears all expenses for closure,
     including the joint inventory, packing, shipping, transportation, and travel.
     5.3.5. The USAFHP Director provides instructions on disposing of the historical artifacts of the activ-
     ity being closed. Do not dispose of any artifacts until you receive these instructions.
     5.3.6. The commander of the organization which sponsors the closing heritage activity appoints an
     accountable officer to receive disposition instructions and fund citations, and to coordinate the ship-
     ment of the historical artifacts. The commander furnishes the USAFHP Director with this person's
     name, title, address, phone and fax numbers, and position.

5.4. Restructuring AFFMs.
     5.4.1. All restructuring actions initiated by the MAJCOM should be coordinated with all interested
     parties (i.e., USAFHP Director, installation commander, etc.).
     5.4.2. Bring accessioning and cataloging up to date during this period and give a final inventory list
     to MAJCOM/HO. Resolve all property accountability issues.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                              25


   5.4.3. The installation commander must decide what level of heritage activity will remain, and
   develop an appropriate Strategic Plan as outlined in Attachment 2. This plan will assist in the devel-
   opment of the historical property disposition plan if needed.
   5.4.4. The Director and representatives of MAJCOM/HO and USAFM must conduct a final joint
   inventory before an organization is officially restructured.
   5.4.5. The organization sponsoring the restructuring heritage activity bears all expenses for restruc-
   turing, including restoring aerospace vehicles to the standards in Attachment 6, the joint inventory,
   packing, shipping, transportation, and travel.
   5.4.6. The USAFHP Director, in coordination with the parent MAJCOM, provides instructions on
   disposing of the historical artifacts made excess by this action or for which stewardship can no longer
   be afforded. Do not dispose of any artifacts until you receive these instructions.
   5.4.7. The commander of the organization sponsoring the restructuring heritage activity appoints, in
   writing, an HPC to be responsible for the historical property remaining on-site, to receive disposition
   instructions and fund citations and to coordinate the shipment of the historical artifacts. The com-
   mander will furnish the MAJCOM/HO and USAFM/MUC with the HPC's contact information.

5.5. Base Realignments and Closure (BRAC).
   5.5.1. The USAFHP Director is responsible for all disposition and reutilization of USAF historical
   property at BRAC sites. USAF historical property at BRAC sites will not be considered personal
   property of the base or units for reuse screening by local communities.
   5.5.2. Disposition.
      5.5.2.1. Priority will be given to requirements of the USAF Museum, Wright-Patterson AFB. The
      USAFHP Director has authority to recall any item of USAF historical property to USAFM,
      including aerospace vehicles.
      5.5.2.2. Second priority will be given to critical material heritage needs of the services.
      5.5.2.3. IAW procedures established in DoD 4165.66-M, Base Reuse Implementation Manual, the
      USAFHP is exempt from rules pertaining to personal property. Only after determination by the
      USAFHP Director will excess USAF historical property be made available to the local community
      to support local heritage activities and initiatives.
   5.5.3. Planning. USAFM/MUC is the focal point for disposition planning. The Museum will work
   with the appropriate MAJCOM/HO and Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA) POC to
   develop disposition plans.
      5.5.3.1. Upon final determination of a closure action, all historical property accounts at that site
      will be frozen. No additional historical property will be placed on loan at the location, nor will a
      historical property be relocated or disposed of until a written disposition plan has been developed
      and approved by the USAFHP Director.
   5.5.4. Actions.
      5.5.4.1. The organization commander appoints an accountable officer to receive disposition
      instructions and fund citations, and to coordinate the shipment of the historical property. The com-
26                                                                         AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


        mander furnishes the MAJCOM/HO and USAFM/MUC with this person’s name, title, address,
        phone and fax numbers and position.
        5.5.4.2. The HPC will bring accessioning and cataloging up to date and give a final inventory list
        to the Command Historian.
        5.5.4.3. The HPC, MAJCOM/HO and a representative of USAFM will conduct a joint inventory
        and resolve all property accountability issues.
        5.5.4.4. USAFM/MUC will identify all property to be returned to meet USAFM requirements.
        5.5.4.5. MAJCOM/HO may identify from the remaining property items required for redistribu-
        tion within their own MAJCOM.
        5.5.4.6. MAJCOM/HO will initiate a survey to identify any items of unreported or unidentified
        historical property and report the results to USAFM. USAFM will determine if any of the items
        will be accessioned as USAF historical property and take the required actions.
        5.5.4.7. The Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA), in coordination with the local rede-
        velopment authority, will identify and prioritize items of interest to local heritage activities which
        may be made available after all other USAFHP requirements are satisfied. AFBCA will distribute
        qualification information. (See 5.5.5.)
        5.5.4.8. USAFM will develop the final disposition plans and lists, and distribute them to all
        affected parties. MAJCOM/HOs will be kept informed as the disposition plan is developed.
        5.5.4.9. The MAJCOM will execute the disposition plan. USAFM will coordinate the relocation
        of aerospace vehicles.
     5.5.5. Funding. The MAJCOM bears all expenses for closure, including restoring those aerospace
     vehicles which will be conveyed to other heritage activities to the standards in Attachment 6, as well
     as joint inventory, packing, shipping, transportation and travel.
     5.5.6. Qualifying civilian activities. IAW DoD 4165.66-M, the Director will make available those
     items of USAF historical property for which there is no service requirement to support local organiza-
     tions that wish take over the operation of an existing heritage activity, or wish to establish a new civil-
     ian museum.
        5.5.6.1. The loan of remaining historical property may be made to civilian museums or static dis-
        play sites; however, this is contingent upon the local organization meeting standards and qualifi-
        cations, established and distributed by USAFM, appropriate to each location. See Chapter 12.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                 27


                                                Chapter 6

                                 MANAGING USAFHP PROPERTY

6.1. Scope. Commanders are urged to preserve the material culture of the Air Force and enhance the mil-
itary educational and operational value of USAFHP activities, not only for himself or herself, but for his
or her successor as well. A commander who acquires and/or establishes a heritage activity acquires an
obligation under the law (16 USC 470) to preserve and interpret the collection in the interest of history,
the Air Force, and the American people.

6.2. Categories of USAFHP Property. There are seven categories of USAFHP property. Accountabil-
ity, control, and administrative responsibilities vary because of the differing sources of museum property.
   6.2.1. Historical Property. Items are designated as historical artifacts by the USAFHP Director. Gen-
   erally, such determinations are based on the item’s association with an important person, event or
   place; because of traditional association with an Air Force organization; because it is a representative
   example of military equipment; or because it represents a significant technological contribution to
   military science or equipment. HPCs report objects not formally designated but of obvious historical
   significance to the USAFHP Director for formal designation. The USAFHP Director controls all his-
   torical property.
   6.2.2. Historical Reference Material. Items are designated as historical reference material by MAJ-
   COM/HO. This includes photographic and printed material used for support of exhibits and educa-
   tional programming in AFFMs. Account for historical reference material through local inventories
   and finding aids.
   6.2.3. Heraldic Property. This includes the organizational flags of color-bearing establishments IAW
   AFI 84-105. Such flags, guidons and related streamers are inherently historical and, upon retirement,
   are sent to USAFM/MUC for conservation and storage. USAFM/MUC will return the heraldic prop-
   erty to the establishment if it is again activated.
   6.2.4. Unit Memorabilia.
       6.2.4.1. Includes emblems, insignia, patches, trophies, plaques, awards, sports trophies and other
       small mementos of significance to a specific unit or establishment. Memorabilia may also include
       photographs (with captions, names, dates and other identification) of significant events, equip-
       ment, facilities, commanders, mascots and so on. This category does not include historic property
       as included in 6.2.1. The USAFHP Director provides security and long-term storage for retired
       memorabilia.
       6.2.4.2. An inactivating organization forwards items in one 8115-00-935-6531 box, as listed in
       the GSA catalog. An equivalent triple-walled cardboard box with measurements of 43”x 31¾” x
       20½”, not to exceed 75 pounds in weight when full, may be substituted.
       6.2.4.3. Consult USAFM/MUC with questions regarding materials for retention.
       6.2.4.4. Upon reactivation of the organization or transfer of its lineage to another organization, the
       organization sends a request, including a fund cite, to USAFM/MUC for return of the items.
   6.2.5. Restoration Support Items (RSI). Are parts and accessories that you need to restore historical
   properties. (Examples: instruments, aircraft or missile components, propeller components, engine
28                                                                       AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     parts, tires, and canopies.) USAFHP activities are accountable for RSI materials, which they control
     using local methods. Maintain inventories and finding aids. Do not stock RSI materials that exceed
     your need; report such excesses to the MAJCOM/HO. The MAJCOM/HO reports command excess to
     the USAFHP Director for disposition. (See 6.2.1. )
     6.2.6. Museum Support Articles. Are nonstandard items such as dioramas, models, reproductions and
     special display furniture. They are neither original historical artifacts nor standard Air Force equip-
     ment as defined by AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Standard Base Supply Customer’s Proce-
     dures. They may, however, be items of significant monetary value. Account for them through local
     inventories and finding aids.
     6.2.7. Activity Property. Includes expendable and nonexpendable equipment and supplies received
     through normal supply channels for operational support. Account for activity property through normal
     supply procedures as required by AFMAN 23-110.
     6.2.8. Educational Support Items. Includes generic apparel, insignia and hardware items used in edu-
     cational programs. No weapons or radioactive items may be included in this category. Items may only
     be placed in this category after approval by USAFM/MU and the completion fo the deaccessioning
     process by USAFM personnel.
        6.2.8.1. All items must initially be accessioned into the historical property collection to establish
        accountability. Once accessioned, the HPC may recommend to the MAJCOM/HO that items be
        deaccessioned to the educational support item collection. The HPC sends an image, a one-para-
        graph justification statement and a copy of the original AF Form 3582, USAF Museum System
        Accession Worksheet, to the MAJCOM/HO for review.
        6.2.8.2. The MAJCOM/HO forwards the application, supporting information, and a recommenda-
        tion to USAFM/MU. USAFM/MU may either approve or deny the recommendation, or request
        more information. IF the recommendation is approved, USAFM/MUC will complete deaccession-
        ing procedures and notify the MAJCOM/HO of the object’s change in status.
        6.2.8.3. The HPC will locally account for educational support items. Items will be permanently
        marked with a local accountability number. Local accountability numbers will differ in format
        from historical property accountability numbers, to avoid confusing the two categories of prop-
        erty.
        6.2.8.4. Educational support items will only be disposed of through DRMO. Educational support
        items will not be donated, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of. Because the items were for-
        merly historical property, the HPC will maintain all disposition paperwork in the item’s original
        accession file.
        6.2.8.5. HPCs will ensure that appropriate sanitation and health safeguards are in place regarding
        the repeated wearing of educational support item apparel by museum visitors.

6.3. National Register of Historic Places . Historical property in the National Register includes the
physical remains of prehistoric or historic districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects significant in
American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or culture. USAF static display aerospace vehi-
cles will not be nominated for inclusion on the National Register. For guidance on the criteria used to des-
ignate and protect National Register properties, consult AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources Management,
and the Directorate of Environmental Quality, HQ USAF/CEVP.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                29


6.4. Loaning Historical Property. The USAFHP Director controls, allocates and distributes all histori-
cal property. Only the USAFHP Director may loan historical property to Air Force, Department of
Defense (DoD) and other Federal organizations, foreign governmental or military museums or civilian
museums for static display purposes. Heritage activities may not make third-party loans of historical
property.
   6.4.1. Do not loan historical property to support non-museum events. These include social occasions,
   parades, reenactments, retirements and change of command ceremonies. Do not use historical prop-
   erty merely to decorate clubs, recreation centers or similar facilities. Exhibits at locations on base
   other than the AFFM, under the control of the director or HPC, are not considered loans for the pur-
   pose of this instruction.
   6.4.2. When it complies with U.S. law and DoD Directives and serves the interest of the USAFHP,
   the Air Force, or the Government, the USAFHP Director may budget and pay for moving historical
   aerospace vehicles or other historical property for display or storage. (Example: an aircraft that cannot
   be moved to and displayed at the USAFM because of size, runway length, condition or logistical con-
   siderations. The Director may have it flown to another museum at USAFM expense for display rather
   than losing it from the historical collection.)
   6.4.3. The borrowing organization agrees to return said property to USAFHP on termination of the
   agreement or earlier, if the borrowing organization determines that the property is no longer required,
   at no expense to the USAFHP.
   6.4.4. USAF static display aerospace vehicles may be temporarily relocated to ceremony sites on base
   under the following conditions:
       6.4.4.1. MAJCOM/HO approval has been obtained, including schedule of movement and return.
       6.4.4.2. The aircraft do not require disassembly or removal from permanent mounts.
       6.4.4.3. Tire, wheels, bearings and struts are serviceable.
       6.4.4.4. Appropriate aircraft maintenance and erection manual (T.O. -2) procedures are followed
       and appropriate, serviceable towbars and tugs are used. Affirm that qualified personnel will per-
       form aerospace vehicle movement and will be present at the ceremony.
       6.4.4.5. All towing is across improved surfaces.
   6.4.5. Only the USAFHP Director may loan or donate historical property for static display purposes
   to domestic non-Federal, nonprofit, educational museums that meet the requirements of 10 USC 2572
   and DoD 4160.21-M. See Chapter 12.
       6.4.5.1. The USAFHP Director sets policy, qualification requirements and application procedures
       for loaning historical property to civilian museums. See Chapter 12.
       6.4.5.2. USAFM/MUC prepares standard loan agreements or conditional deeds of gift according
       to DoD 4160.21-M and AFMAN 23-110.

6.5. Acquiring Property. The USAFHP Director is the Air Force point of contact for all historical prop-
erty acquisitions to support USAFHP activities. All acquisitions, donations, purchases, loans and transfers
must fit the activity's collections policy.
30                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     6.5.1. Only the USAFHP has the authority to directly contact HQ USAF/XPPL and Air Force Mate-
     riel Command (AFMC) System Program Directors (SPD) on the availability and acquisition of histor-
     ical aerospace vehicles. According to AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
     Distribution, Accounting, and Termination, HQ USAF/XPPL may reallocate to the USAFHP aero-
     space vehicles that exceed the Air Force operational inventory, ground training, or other requirements.
     Aerospace vehicles from the existing USAFHP collection, private donations, other Air Force assets in
     storage, DoD excesses, the General Services Administration or the Drug Enforcement Agency may
     also be obtained for allocation within the System.
     6.5.2. USAFM/MUX maintains request lists for aircraft and missiles by mission, design and series
     (M/D/S) showing the requester and date of request. These lists will have been screened and approved
     by the appropriate MAJCOM/HO and MAJCOM/CV.

6.6. Requesting Aerospace Vehicles and Engines. Submit requests by letter, signed by the organiza-
tion commander, through the MAJCOM/HO to USAFM/MUX. In the letter, include:
     6.6.1. M/D/S, including the serial number, if you are requesting a particular airframe.
     6.6.2. Unit to which the airframe is assigned and years of assignment.
     6.6.3. Justification based on the activity's scope of collections statement.
     6.6.4. Any other data to support the request, including manner of display.
        6.6.4.1. The MAJCOM/HO forwards the request to USAFM/MUX with recommendations. If
        approved, USAFM/MUX adds the request to the consolidated request list and notifies the
        requester of its status.
        6.6.4.2. The USAFHP Director processes requests on a first-asked, first-served basis. When
        allocating scarce resources, however, the USAFHP Director considers factors such as historical
        significance, scope, size of collection, indoor display capability or the requester's capability to
        restore, maintain or relocate an item.
        6.6.4.3. USAFM will not allocate aerospace vehicles to the field without obtaining a written
        request from the gaining activity and MAJCOM/HO concurrence.
        6.6.4.4. USAFM/MUX coordinates the delivery of aerospace vehicles with the losing and gaining
        organizations and prepares the required accountability documents. USAFM/MUC will loan the
        airframe to the gaining heritage activity.
        6.6.4.5. Forward all aircraft operational records (AFTO 781 file, AFTO Forms 95, significant his-
        torical data, etc.) to USAFM/MUC upon delivery of the aerospace vehicle. Gaining units will pro-
        vide a copy of the unit’s termination message for aircraft being delivered from the AF operational
        inventory (AFOE) to the Command Historian and USAFM/MUC.

6.7. Losing Organization Preference (LOP). Requests for aerospace vehicles that are now serving with
the requesting organization receive priority. Priority also goes to requests for retired items if the request-
ing organization can show (by serial number) that the particular item was assigned to it.

6.8. Requesting USAFM Historical Property. The USAFM may loan historical property it does not
need to other USAFHP activities. Such loans permit the broadest use of historical resources.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                 31


   6.8.1. Send written requests through the MAJCOM/HO to USAFM/MUC, to include written assur-
   ance of meeting MAJCOM/HO security and exhibit criteria.
   6.8.2. A USAFHP curator reviews the list and decides whether to approve the loan of each item.
   6.8.3. Upon approval, the requester works with USAFM/MUC to complete an HPA, which states the
   conditions of the loan and responsibilities of the borrower. The requester sends a fund cite and a letter
   appointing an organizational HPC, including mailing information, to USAFM/MUC.
   6.8.4. USAFM/MUC ships the approved items with the HPA and DD Form 1149, Requisition and
   Invoice/Shipping Document. When the shipment arrives, the gaining organization’s HPC physically
   inventories all items. The organizational commander signs and returns one copy of the DD Form
   1149 and the HPA through MAJCOM/HO to USAFM/MUC.
   6.8.5. USAF historical property is loaned for display purposes only. Do not borrow historical prop-
   erty solely to store it. Display borrowed property within six months of receipt of the item(s).

6.9. Additional Sources. After coordination with MAJCOM/HO and approval by USAFM, heritage
activities may also acquire historical property through these channels:
   6.9.1. DoD Excess Items. Items for display may occasionally be available from DoD or the other ser-
   vices through the DoD supply system. Request USAFM/MUC to contact the appropriate item man-
   ager to determine whether a particular item is available. If DoD doesn't need the item, the item
   manager may transfer it to the USAFHP. To effect the transfer, USAFM/MUC sends DD Form
   1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, to the item manager. Upon completion of the transfer,
   USAFM/MUC loans the item to the requestor using a DD Form 1149.
   6.9.2. Supply. When no excess is available, use supply channels to obtain items. Heritage activities
   must budget and pay for such acquisitions. Upon receiving the historical property, report it to
   USAFM/MUC. It will then be accessioned into the USAFHP collection, placed on the HPA of the
   requesting activity, and loaned using a DD Form 1149.
   6.9.3. Transfers. According to this instruction and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 1, Standard Base
   Supply Customer’s Procedures, a heritage activity may transfer items on organizational equipment
   accounts (CA/CRL) to the USAFHP as historical property for display purposes at no cost. The
   requesting activity provides a DD Form 1348-1A with the National Stock Number (NSN), nomencla-
   ture, other identifying information and the organization's point of contact to USAFM/MUC. USAFM/
   MUC sends a DD Form 1348-1A accepting the item as historical property. The item is then added to
   the activity's HPA and loaned using a DD Form 1149.
   6.9.4. Tables of Allowance. Items acquired as historical property or RSI do not require authorization
   on the organization's Tables of Allowance. Activity property (i.e., slide projectors, video tape players,
   or air compressors that are used to construct or run exhibits and perform aircraft maintenance) does
   require authorization.

6.10. Gifts. Process offers of gifts of historical property according to AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Air Force.
Do not accept gifts that come with limiting conditions or high maintenance costs. Do not accept gifts that
incur some explicit or implicit responsibility (for example, an agreement to display or exhibit, or to retain
at one specific location). Inform potential donors that the donation is to the Air Force historical property
collection and not to a specific heritage activity.
32                                                                       AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     6.10.1. Use AF Form 3571, USAF Museum System Proffer of Gift Agreement, for gifts of histor-
     ical property (see 6.15.). Use the formats in AFI 51-601 for accepting or rejecting other types of prop-
     erty. Acknowledge all donations in writing. Keep the signed original in the item's accession folder.
     Give the donor a copy and forward a copy to USAFM/MUC.
     6.10.2. AFI 51-601 and professional museum ethics prohibit USAFHP activities from assigning a
     value to a donation for donor tax purposes. Activities may, however, value the item to determine the
     proper acceptance path according to AFI 51-601 and to determine the level of security required (see
     Chapter 8).
     6.10.3. Refuse donations that fall outside the scope of collection and mission statement. Refer donors
     of such materials to the MAJCOM/HO or to USAFM/MUC. When the items offered are of obvious
     military historical significance, accept the donation and process according to 6.15. If the heritage
     activity cannot store the donation, contact USAFM/MUC through the MAJCOM/HO.
     6.10.4. After acceptance at any level, title to historical property passes to the USAFHP.
     6.10.5. The Air Force does not authorize acquisition of historical property by a private organization
     acting as a surrogate or the operation of a separate holding account for historical property.
     6.10.6. Process gifts of real property according to AFI 51-601.
     6.10.7. Process gifts of personal papers or other historical documents not related to exhibits according
     to AFI 84-101.
     6.10.8. MAJCOM/HOs will notify USAFM/MUC when items of high intrinsic or commercial value
     are received within their commands.

6.11. Accepting Loaned Property. Acceptance of loaned property obligates the U.S. Air Force to pri-
vate individuals, groups and other governmental agencies. Loans should only be considered under
extraordinary circumstances for specialized short-term exhibit purposes. MAJCOM/HO must approve the
loan in writing. Loans may be for no longer than one year.
     6.11.1. Use AF Form 3572, USAF Museum System Loan Agreement, to document the loan. This
     form may be locally reproduced. Provide the lender with a copy of the form.
     6.11.2. AFHHs will not enter into any loan agreements for artifacts.
     6.11.3. AFFMs and airparks will not unilaterally enter into any loan agreements for historical aero-
     space vehicles with a third party.

6.12. Third-Party Loans of USAFHP Property. Third-party loans of Air Force historical property may
only be made with the express written approval of the USAFHP Director. Forward all requests for such
loans through MAJCOM/HO to USAFM/MUC. Such loans are strongly discouraged.

6.13. Air Force Museum Artifact Tracking System (AFMATS). The Air Force Museum Artifact
Tracking System (AFMATS) is the central accounting and management program for Air Force historical
property. AFMATS is administered by USAFM/MUC.
     6.13.1. All heritage activities with more than 100 items of historical property are required to use
     AFMATS. Activities with fewer than 100 items may use AFMATS, but are not required to do so.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                  33


   Activities that do not use AFMATS will report items of historical property to MAJCOM/HO, who
   will be responsible for ensuring that items are reported using AFMATS to USAFM/MUC.

6.14. Inventory Reporting and Control. Proper stewardship of USAFHP collections includes regular and
comprehensive inventories of all historical property. IAW RCS: HAF-HO(A)8801, Report of Historical
Property, USAFM/MUC must account for and report all USAFHP historical property biennially. For his-
torical property on loan to heritage activities, USAFM/MUC sends out the Report of Historical Property
(inventory) and a “Points of Contact” list to each MAJCOM/HO no later than 1 February of the appropri-
ate year. MAJCOM/HOs will in turn coordinate with the HPCs of their individual heritage activities to
accomplish a comprehensive wall-to-wall inventory of all historical property. USAFM/MUC staggers
this inventory schedule so that only half of all heritage activities submit their certified inventory lists in
any calendar year. MAJCOM/HOs will reply back to USAFM/MUC with completed inventories no later
than 1 May of the same year.
   6.14.1. To accomplish inventories, heritage activities will:
       6.14.1.1. Physically inspect each item and verify nomenclature and accession number against the
       inventory listing provided by USAFM/MUC. They will also note any discrepancies such as short-
       ages, damage or deterioration, and provide a brief explanation of the problem and recommended
       corrective action. Prior to submission, heritage activities will review the “Points of Contact” list
       sent with their inventory and annotate changes, corrections, etc. as needed. If a new HPC has been
       assigned, his/her appointment letter, signed by the Commander, must be included (see 6.16.).
       6.14.1.2. List any historical property received from sources other than USAFM for display pur-
       poses which do not appear on the inventory. Provide completed AF Form 3582, USAF Museum
       System Accession Worksheet (see 6.15.2.), photographs (see 6.14.5), AF Form 3571, Proffers of
       Gift (if appropriate) (see 6.15.1.), and all other accountability paperwork which accompanied the
       property. These items will be added to your loan inventory.
       6.14.1.3. Every fourth year, on a schedule established by USAFM/MUC, MAJCOM/HOs will
       include in their biennial reporting requirements color photographs of all historical property
       regardless of location. Photograph each item. Provide a standard 3x5 or 4x6 35 mm color print or
       digital image in “jpeg” format of each artifact on display (or in collection) in sufficient detail to
       permit positive identification. Insure the artifact’s accession number is in the photograph, or
       clearly marked on the back of the print. If photographs are digital form, the accession number
       must be in the image and also must be the image file name. Also provide standard 3x5 or 4x6 35
       mm color print or digital image in “jpeg” format of each aircraft and missile in sufficient detail to
       show the overall condition and serial number of the airframe. Insure the M/D/S (model, design,
       series), serial number, and USAFM accession number is clearly marked on the back of each print.
       If an aircraft or missile has been repainted to represent another airframe, label the print with the
       actual tail number shown on the DD Form 1149 for that airframe.
   6.14.2. When complete, HPCs will sign inventory lists certifying that all historical property has been
   physically inventoried and accounted for and any discrepancies noted (see 6.17. for guidance on lost
   or damaged historical property). Completed inventory packages will include the signed and certified
   inventory list (see 6.14.), an updated HPC “point of contact” list, one copy of the HPA signed by the
   organizational commander or vice commander, and photographs or digital images of all historical
   property on the loan inventory (if applicable).
34                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     6.14.3. Photograph each item. Provide a standard 3x5 or 4x6 35 mm color print or digital image in
     “jpeg” format of each artifact on display (or in collection) in sufficient detail to permit positive iden-
     tification. Insure the artifact’s accession number is in the photograph, or clearly marked on the back of
     the print. Also provide standard 3x5 or 4x6 35 mm color print or digital image in “jpeg” format of
     each aircraft and missile in sufficient detail to show the overall condition and serial number of the air-
     frame. Insure the M/D/S (model, design, series), serial number, and USAFM accession number is
     clearly marked on the back of each print. If an aircraft or missile has been repainted to represent
     another airframe, label the print with the actual tail number shown on the DD Form 1149 for that air-
     frame.
     6.14.4. When complete, HPCs will sign inventory lists certifying that all historical property has been
     physically inventoried and accounted for and any discrepancies noted (see 6.17. for guidance on lost
     or damaged historical property). Completed inventory packages will include the signed and certified
     inventory list (see 6.14.), an updated HPC “point of contact” list, one copy of the HPA signed by the
     organizational commander or vice commander, and photographs or digital images of all historical
     property on the loan inventory.

6.15. Accountability Records. All USAF heritage activities must ensure the accountability of historical
property.
     6.15.1. Establish accountability of historical artifacts within 24 hours of receipt by logging in the her-
     itage activity's accession register. Include the donor name or source, nomenclature, date and who
     accepted the property. Complete an AF Form 3571, USAF Museum System Proffer of Gift, for all
     donated historical property. All historical property in the custody of a heritage activity must be acces-
     sioned.
     6.15.2. Catalog each artifact within 30 working days using AF Form 3582, USAF Museum System
     Accession Worksheet, which constitutes the primary record of all historical artifacts (Detailed
     instructions for completing Form 3582 are available by request from USAFM/MUC).
     6.15.3. Every 120 days, report new acquisitions to USAFM/MUC using AFMATS database or AF
     Form 3582. Send informational copies to the MAJCOM/HOs. In the report to USAFM/MUC, include
     copies of AF Form 3571 or other transfer documents. Provide EOD inert certification statements and
     Radiation Safety Forms as required by the object. Include color photographs or digital images in AF
     standard format (See 6.14.). NOTE: The time requirement for reporting acquisitions will change after
     AFMATS becomes an Internet-based system.
     6.15.4. Maintain the following collections management accountability documents in six-part folders
     or other appropriate records management files:
        6.15.4.1. Accession register. A list of accessions by number. Source document for accession num-
        bers.
        6.15.4.2. Accession folder for each accession, containing the original AF Form 3571 or appropri-
        ate transfer documents, supporting documentation, correspondence, and AF Form 3573, USAF
        Museum Artifact Condition and Conservation Record, EOD inert certification statements and/
        or Radiation Safety Forms as required by the object. Historical property on loan from the USAFM
        retains the USAFM accession number.
        6.15.4.3. Historical property photographic negative files, if applicable.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                               35


       6.15.4.4. Current historical property agreement (HPA) and inventory provided by USAFM/MUC.
   6.15.5. Heritage activities with aerospace vehicles must maintain the following additional collections
   management accountability documents:
       6.15.5.1. Individual aerospace vehicle files organized by aircraft M/D/S. These contain transfer
       documents, radiation survey forms, AF Form 3580, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle Accep-
       tance, Condition, and Safety Certificate, all related correspondence, and AF Form 3581, Static
       Display Aerospace Vehicle Maintenance Log.
NOTE: Forward all aircraft operational records (AFTO 781 file, AFTO Form 95, significant historical
data, etc.) to USAFM/MUC. Retain copies in aerospace vehicle files.
       6.15.5.2. Use AF Form 3581 to record all maintenance, repair, and other actions. Such actions
       include painting, washing, RSI installation or removals, part removals, weapons uploads, repair,
       and bird and weather proofing. This form serves as an accountability document to show the dispo-
       sition of RSIs or historical property that was added to the vehicle. AF Forms 3580 and 3581 may
       be locally reproduced.
       6.15.5.3. Maintain aircraft files for as long as the airpark possesses the aerospace vehicle. Trans-
       fer the file with the aerospace vehicle or retire it to USAFM/MUC if the aircraft is disposed off.

6.16. Change in Historical Property Custodian or AFFM Director. Each time a new HPC or AFFM
director is appointed, the organization's commander:
   6.16.1. Advises the MAJCOM/HO in writing, within 90 days, of a change. MAJCOM/HOs forward
   notification and letter appointing new director or HPC (including mailing information) to USAFM/
   MUC and request a current inventory list.
   6.16.2. After USAFM/MUC sends the current inventory to the organization, directs the incoming and
   outgoing HPCs or directors to conduct a joint inventory. The incoming HPC or director signs the
   inventory list certifying that all historical property was physically inventoried and accounted for.
   Report any discrepancies. (See 6.17. for guidance on lost or damaged property.)
   6.16.3. If an outgoing AFFM director or HPC will depart before the arrival or appointment of a
   replacement, appoint an acting director or interim custodian to certify the inventory list.
NOTE: Failure to follow these instructions shifts liability for lost or damaged historical property to the
organizational commander.

6.17. Lost and Damaged Property. If historical property is suspected to be or confirmed as lost, dam-
aged or destroyed, the responsible activity must notify USAFM/MUC within 1 working day. If the
USAFHP Director deems it necessary, request the commander of the installation on which the subject
AFFM, AFHH, or airpark is located to initiate a DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of
Property Loss. Then the organizational commander appoints a surveying officer according to AFI
23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
   6.17.1. The Air Force does not relieve an organization of accountability for the historical property
   until it has completed this or subsequent investigations and made a finding on the disposition of the
   property.
36                                                                          AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     6.17.2. The surveying officer provides copies of all investigation reports through MAJCOM/HO to
     USAFM/MUC. Based on this report, and depending upon the circumstances of the loss and the value
     of the property involved, the USAFHP Director may authorize the deaccession of the item. USAFM/
     MUC will provide a copy of the deaccession voucher to the heritage activity, clearing them of
     accountability for the item.
     6.17.3. The USAFHP Director decides how to dispose of damaged or destroyed heritage assets.

6.18. Movement. The gaining organization and its parent MAJCOM must safely move USAFHP aero-
space vehicles and artifacts to, from, or between display, storage and restoration sites. Before moving his-
torical property, obtain written approval from the USAFHP Director.
     6.18.1. The gaining organization bears the expense of moving, reclaiming or demilitarizing historical
     property. In the case of civilian museums, this cost cannot be at the government's expense.
     6.18.2. Do not cut structural members or components to facilitate movement or relocation without
     getting the written approval of the USAFHP Director.
     6.18.3. Although USAFHP aircraft may appear to be flyable they will not be flown.
     6.18.4. Air Force Operational Excess (AFOE) Deliveries.
         6.18.4.1. The gaining organization provides MAJCOM/HO and USAFM/MUC with a copy of the
         unit’s termination message or arrival message within 24 hours.
         6.18.4.2. USAFM/MUC supplies the certification and loan documents.
         6.18.4.3. Reclamation requirements are provided by the appropriate System Program Director
         (SPD) at the request of HQ AFMC/AVDO.
         6.18.4.4. If the reclamation list (“save list”) has not been received within 30 days of flight deliv-
         ery, contact the MAJCOM/LG-AVDO through MAJCOM/HO for assistance (with an informa-
         tional copy to USAFM/MUC).
         6.18.4.5. The gaining organization sends safety certifications and verification of completion of
         reclamation through the MAJCOM/HO to USAFM/MUC within 60 days.
     6.18.5. Once delivered to a display site, additional flights of static display aircraft at that site are pro-
     hibited.
     6.18.6. Follow similar procedures for termination flights of aircraft being received from other govern-
     ment agencies or completed under contract by commercial firms. The gaining organization accepts
     control and accountability after the aircraft has landed.
     6.18.7. The USAFM does not accept accountability for a new acquisition from AFOE, other govern-
     mental agencies, or an exchange agreement until the delivery flight has safely landed, shut down, and
     chocked at the display location. The organization sponsoring the display location is responsible for
     ensuring all safety and demilitarization actions are accomplished.
     6.18.8. Large or unusual items such as aerospace vehicles being moved via surface movement are
     transferred for movement to the gaining organization. The gaining organization assumes accountabil-
     ity for mishaps. The gaining organization oversees security of the load, road clearances, qualifications
     of the drivers, special licenses and permits and all other considerations.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                  37


   6.18.9. The gaining organization properly packages the artifact for movement by commercial air or
   surface cargo. The gaining organization and its MAJCOM must contract with commercial or military
   agencies to safely move historical property. Use a mode compatible with the delicacy of the item
   being shipped.
   6.18.10. Ship sensitive, high-dollar value, and high value historical property (defined in 8.1.5.) via
   registered, return-receipt requested, US Mail (when within the U.S.), within Postal Service size and
   weight restrictions.

6.19. Disposing of Historical Property. Each AFFM director or HPC notifies the MAJCOM/HO of
excess property.
   6.19.1. MAJCOM/HOs, in coordination with USAFM/MUC, may authorize the transfer of property
   to other historical property collections within their command. Property excess to the Command
   (except activity property as defined in paragraph 6.17.) will be reported to USAFM/MUC for reallo-
   cation to other Commands, use in the USAF Civilian Museum Loan Program, USAF Static Display
   Program or use in the USAFM Exchange Program. Based on these requirements the USAFHP Direc-
   tor will issue a disposition plan to cover these alternatives. Property that is not going to be reallocated
   will be disposed of through the DRMS.
   6.19.2. Excess property will not be (a) given, sold or traded away; (b) returned to donors if it has been
   accepted as a donation and accessioned into the USAF Historical Property Collection; (c) transferred
   to civilian museums without approval of the USAFHP Director; or (d) transferred to other heritage
   activities without approval of the USAFHP Director and MAJCOM/HOs.
   6.19.3. USAFM/MUC will be responsible for preparing all transfer documents. The AFFM Director
   or HPC will be responsible for preparing all turn-in documents for property being entered into the
   DRMS. Provide copies of all turn-in documents (listing each item individually or by accession num-
   ber) to USAFM/MUC.
   6.19.4. Return to donors items that were offered to the USAFHP but not accepted or accessioned as
   historical property. If the donor cannot be located or refuses the return, turn the items over to the base
   security forces for disposition as lost and found property according to AFI 31-209, Air Force
   Resource Protection Program.
   6.19.5. If historical property has been declared excess and is being returned to USAFM, the agency
   disposing of the property bears the expense of moving, reclaiming or demilitarizing the property.

6.20. Managing Restoration Support Items (RSI). RSI, while not generally listed on the unit equip-
ment account, are nonetheless Government property and must be controlled. As a minimum, keep accu-
rate records of each item with an identifying RSI sequence number, its nomenclature, numbers on hand,
application and location. You may transfer RSI between system activities, but annotate local records to
show inventory adjustments.
   6.20.1. RSI will not be released to non-USAFHP activities.
   6.20.2. RSI must support present and planned restoration projects and must be justified against such
   requirements. You may also keep a limited number of items for future repair or replacement needs.
   These include canopies, windscreens and tires. Do not stockpile (hoard) items above justified needs.
   The individual activity and its MAJCOM control quantities. Accumulated RSI stocks cannot be
   exchanged outside the USAFHP.
38                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     6.20.3. If an RSI has been determined to be historical property for use in an exhibit, report the item to
     USAFM/MUC as historical property, drop it from the RSI register and accession it into the USAFHP
     collection.
     6.20.4. RSI sources include excess stocks from item managers, DoD reclamation activities, normal
     supply channels, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMOs) and transfers from other
     USAF heritage activities.
     6.20.5. An activity may submit a Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP)
     request for restoration or repair purposes to the Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Center
     (AMARC) through MAJCOM/LG channels. Provide the following information:
        6.20.5.1. M/D/S, serial number and USAFHP accession number of the historical property on
        which you will have the part or parts installed.
        6.20.5.2. Part number (PN) or National Stock Number (NSN).
        6.20.5.3. Technical Order (T.O.) reference including:
            6.20.5.3.1. T.O. number.
            6.20.5.3.2. Figure number in T.O. that shows the part.
            6.20.5.3.3. Index number of the part.
            6.20.5.3.4. Complete nomenclature of the part.
            6.20.5.3.5. Quantity requested.
        6.20.5.4. Shipping information including:
            6.20.5.4.1. Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC) number of the
            requesting heritage activity.
            6.20.5.4.2. Ship To and Mark For addresses.
            6.20.5.4.3. Point of contact, DSN telephone number, DSN fax number and electronic mail
            address at the requesting organization.
        6.20.5.5. The part or parts being replaced by items requested through MILSTRIP will be disposed
        of through DRMO channels.

6.21. Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC). All heritage activities except
USAFM use the DODAAC assigned to their parent organization in all supply system and DRMO transac-
tions.

6.22. DRMO Withdrawals. With prior approval of MAJCOM/HO, AFFMs, AFHCs and AFHHs may
obtain RSI, historical property for display, and operating supplies through DRMO. Airparks are limited to
RSI and those items or equipment needed to restore, repair and maintain historical aerospace vehicles and
ground support equipment. Obtain Table of Allowance authorization for equipment acquisition.

6.23. Aircraft Parts Removals. Other than items specified in reclamation lists provided by the AFMC
Program Managers, removal of parts from USAF static display aerospace vehicles for use on operational
aircraft, bench stock support, turn-in for BOS credit or any other purpose is prohibited, except when
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                              39


approved by the USAFHP Director on a case-by-case basis. Note: Aircraft destined for the USAF
Museum are exempt from reclamation actions.
   6.23.1. On a case-by-case basis, SPDs may request MICAP waivers. MICAP requests will be origi-
   nated by the unit LG, through MAJCOM/LG and MAJCOM/HO to the appropriate SPD. Send infor-
   mational copies to USAFM/MUC.
   6.23.2. SPD requests will be forwarded to HQ AFMC/LGI for review and recommendation to
   USAFM/MUC. Such requests must contain detailed documentation of SPD efforts to obtain the
   required assets from the supply system, lateral support and AMARC and the reasons those actions
   were not successful.
   6.23.3. Removals from USAF static display aircraft will be processed through standard supply chan-
   nels to ensure visibility of the demand and appropriate reimbursements.

6.24. Archaeological Materials.
   6.24.1. Archaeological materials and specimens recovered from Air Force-controlled lands are the
   property of the U.S. Government. AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources Management provides guidance
   regarding Air Force archaeological materials.
   6.24.2. Archaeological materials and specimens are not Air Force historical property. No USAFHP
   activity will be established for the primary purpose of displaying and caring for such materials.
   6.24.3. Archaeological materials and specimens recovered from Air Force-controlled lands may be
   displayed and cared for at heritage activities. However, heritage activities should refuse donations of

                                                 Chapter 7

                            CONSERVATION AND DISPLAY STANDARDS

7.1. Conserving Artifacts. Do not use any artifact accessioned as Air Force historical property to serve
its original function, no matter how sound its condition. Do not subject it to fair wear and tear through
consumptive use. Do not wear historical clothing or fly, operate, or fire any artifact.
     7.1.1. Protect all historical property from agents of deterioration. These include vermin, mold, mil-
     dew, mechanical stress, dust, pollution, vandalism, excessive heat and humidity, and visible and ultra-
     violet light extremes.
     7.1.2. To preserve museum objects and prolong their usefulness to the study of material culture, keep
     all artifacts in normal museum conditions. Protect rare examples of historical aerospace vehicles and
     support equipment from the weather and changing climates. Do not display aircraft of predominantly
     wood and fabric construction outside.
     7.1.3. Normal museum conditions are considered to be a stable environment that is free from repeated
     daily and seasonal extreme changes of temperature and humidity. Heritage activities should strive to
     maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity, with no more than a 5-degree temperature or
     5-percent humidity variation from the professional standard for exhibit and storage areas. The
     USAFHP Director may modify that standard if necessary. Failure to control temperature and humidity
     may result in the removal of items that are negatively impacted by climatic fluctuations.
     7.1.4. Protect delicate original fabrics, finishes and materials from deterioration by following gener-
     ally accepted museum conservation standards found in The Care of Antiques and Historical Collec-
     tions by A. Bruce MacLeish, published by the American Association for State and Local History,
     1717 Church Street, Nashville TN 37203-2991. All USAFHP activities will refer conservation mat-
     ters to the USAFM Conservator, USAFM/MUC.

7.2. Handling Artifacts. Within reason, display all artifacts in cases.
     7.2.1. When handling artifacts, wear white cotton gloves (vinyl or unpowdered latex may be substi-
     tuted) at all times.
     7.2.2. Use museum-safe materials to construct exhibit furnishings, whether in-house, by contract, or
     by purchase. Such materials prevent contact between artifacts and hostile surfaces or between artifacts
     of dissimilar materials.
     7.2.3. Mount all artifacts so that they are safe from movement, damage or theft. Do not use materials
     or methods of mounting that stress, damage or in any manner alter the artifact being displayed.
     7.2.4. Do not put screws, nails, escutcheon pins, single- or double-sided tape or other adhesives in
     direct contact with any artifact. Do not use aquarium cement, which emits acetic acid during curing
     time.
     7.2.5. All mat board, whether used as mounting, barriers or identification signs, must be 100 percent
     acid-free. Do not affix identification labels to artifacts.
     7.2.6. Place all photographic prints in chemically inert polypropylene, polyethylene or polyester
     archival sleeves. Place all negatives in protective archivally safe acid-free non-buffered paper sleeves.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                41


   Wear white cotton gloves (without nonskid grips) when handling unsleeved photographs, negatives
   and transparencies.
   7.2.7. Do not display original photographs, archival documents and records. Use photographic copies
   instead.
   7.2.8. Address questions on standard conservation methods of mounting artifacts for display to the
   USAFM Conservator, USAFM/MUC.

7.3. Preserving and Restoring Aerospace Vehicles and Support Equipment. When repairing and
restoring aerospace vehicles and support equipment, preserve their historical integrity. Use methods out-
lined in the appropriate Technical Order (T.O.) Dash 2 maintenance and erection manual and the T.O.
Dash 3 structural repair manual. Do not inflict any damage on the airframe unless MAJCOM/HO has
approved it for cannibalization. Make changes that compromise authenticity only to enhance the
long-term preservation of items displayed outdoors. You must be able to reverse all such procedures. Use
AF Form 3581, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle Maintenance Log, to record all preservation and res-
toration actions.
   7.3.1. At a minimum, keep items from deteriorating further. Perform limited disassembly of the vehi-
   cle and selected disassembly of components. Thoroughly inspect the aircraft or missile, and locate,
   identify, and remove all areas of corrosion. Make sure the item is clean and free from dirt, debris, car-
   bon and contaminants. Apply a corrosion-preventative chemical film as specified in the appropriate
   technical order to all surfaces, reassemble all components and items, apply final chemical coating, and
   protect it from the elements while it awaits restoration.
   7.3.2. Restore aerospace vehicles to original manufacturer's or operational appearance for the period
   depicted. Systems need not be operational. You may leave some interior areas unrestored but they
   must be as received. The work need not conform to airworthy standards. Repair all damage. Strip,
   clean, brighten, coat with a corrosion preventative and give a final finish coat to the airframe. Dam-
   aged or missing components may be remanufactured to less than original or airworthy standards.
   Note: Radioactive materials may have been used in the construction of aerospace vehicles. Follow
   the procedures in Chapter 9 for dealing with radioactive components before doing any work on an
   aerospace vehicle. Fulfill all local bioenvironmental requirements.
   7.3.3. MAJCOM/HO (or senior historian for DRUs and FOAs) approves color, markings and insignia
   (CMI) packages. The requesting unit will be responsible for development of a package that includes
   the current paint scheme, the proposed paint scheme and a justification for the change. All research
   associated with any proposed CMI packages will be conducted by the requesting unit. Units may paint
   aircraft to represent another aircraft of the same series and model with the written permission of the
   MAJCOM/HO.
   7.3.4. Do not compromise authenticity by adding spurious names, logos, nose art, or other identifying
   features that violate the historical accuracy of the CMI. Do not compromise CMIs for reasons of per-
   sonal edification. Do not mix markings from a variety of aircraft, i.e. using the nose art from one air-
   craft, the serial number of another and unit codes from a third. Ensure historical accuracy in the
   placement and style of markings being applied, keeping in mind the "window" or "moment" of history
   you are representing. Fully document the markings being applied to static display aircraft.
   7.3.5. Coordinate required periodic washing of static display aircraft to comply with all local environ-
   mental policies and regulations.
42                                                                       AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     7.3.6. Annotate the appropriate AF Form 3581, USAF Museum Aerospace Vehicle Static Display
     Maintenance Log, accordingly. Keep an aircraft's true tail number on all records.

7.4. Designing Exhibits. Exhibits must follow an approved storyline, be historically accurate, without
distortion and in good taste.
     7.4.1. Design exhibits to prevent visitors from casually touching or handling the artifacts, except in
     circumstances where visitor participation is the goal. Do not use radioactive materials in exhibits
     intended for visitor participation.
     7.4.2. Whenever in doubt on historical facts or interpretations, coordinate drafts of exhibit scripts
     with MAJCOM/HO.
     7.4.3. Because of the strong potential for irreparable damage to airframes over time, bombs, missiles
     and other equipment should not be hung on the wings of aerospace vehicles. For display purposes, use
     lightweight replicas of fiberglass or other inert materials instead. Contact USAFM for a list of vendors
     for such equipment.
     7.4.4. Comply with the exhibitry standards outlined in Attachment 4.

7.5. Programs.
     7.5.1. Heritage activities should support the Air Force and their mission statements through educa-
     tional programs and activities in addition to exhibits and group tours.
     7.5.2. Heritage activities should perform their educational mission through outreach programs and
     activities such as but not limited to lectures, guest speakers, school presentations and multimedia pre-
     sentations.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                   43


                                                 Chapter 8

                            SECURITY AND RESOURCE PROTECTION

8.1. Securing Property. Security within the USAFHP is broadly defined to include the physical security
of facilities and historical properties from theft (internal and external), fire, safety (employee and public),
and natural disaster. Security is a management responsibility executed in concert with the installation's
resource protection organization.
   8.1.1. Methods of meeting security needs must not alter or in any way harm the integrity of Air Force
   historical property.
   8.1.2. AFFM directors and HPCs, assisted as necessary by other base agencies, conduct a risk assess-
   ment to identify the most probable threats and hazards and those potential losses that would most crit-
   ically affect the USAFHP activity. HPCs of AFHCs and AFHHs occupying part of another facility
   may incorporate their requirements into those of the overall building custodian.
   8.1.3. The USAFHP Director may authorize exemptions to this instruction in writing as long as such
   exemptions do not compromise the safety of personnel or the preservation of artifacts.
   8.1.4. Historic aerospace vehicles, their components, and all other classes of property previously
   defined are Government property. When dealing with them follow all applicable directives for
   accountability, control and safeguarding. Do not sell, give away, trade or loan these items. RSI,
   though not historical property, remain Government property and must be controlled according to local
   methods and procedures.
   8.1.5. Protect historical property defined as high value historical property (HVHP) according to AFI
   31-209, Air Force Resource Protection Program.
   8.1.6. Other items of historical property may not meet the high cash value resource definition in AFI
   31-209 but, because of their historical provenance, require similar protection. The USAFHP Director
   and the AFFM director or HPC may designate this property as HVHP. The level of protection, which
   may include intrusion detection system (IDS) equipment, is based on the value as determined by the
   AFFM director or HPC and coordinated with base security police. Keep an appraisal value listing for
   HVHP and high cash value resources on display or in storage for such purposes.
   8.1.7. Keep HVHP and high cash value resources stored within the AFFM inside secure containers or
   safes. Use AFI 31-209 to determine security requirements for funds storage and to determine the type
   of container or safe to use. Use the museum's appraisal value listing to determine the dollar value and
   the appropriate requirements to follow in AFI 31-209.
   8.1.8. Display HVHP, high cash value resources, and all weapons in secure cases, built to the security
   case standards contained in Attachment 4. Provide such cases with IDS protection.
   8.1.9. AFHHs must contact USAFM/MUC for guidance in determining values and security require-
   ments for high cash value resources and HVHP before displaying them.

8.2. Safety. Do not use aeronautical components from USAFHP historical aerospace vehicles on loan
from the USAFHP collection in operational Air Force aerospace vehicles. These items include engines,
starters, pumps, actuators, radios, propellers, wheels, tires, and structural components. (See paragraph
6.23. )
44                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     8.2.1. Remove from historical aerospace vehicles all cartridge-activated or propellant-activated
     devices (CAD/PAD) after delivery and before display. Take similar safety actions for high-pressure
     air bottles, fire extinguishers, toxic oxidizers, spring-loaded devices, pyrotechnics, and other hazard-
     ous components of any item of historical property upon acceptance into the collection. Follow Instruc-
     tions for Preparation and Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles, HPA Attachment A, to ensure the safe
     display of the item. Certify these actions on AF Form 3580, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle
     Acceptance, Condition, and Safety Certificate. Keep the original in the activity's individual aircraft
     file and forward a copy to USAFM/MUC.
     8.2.2. During maintenance and restoration you may encounter hazards, such as asbestos and other
     toxic materials used in aircraft and missile manufacturing. Coordinate all maintenance and restoration
     actions with the installation bioenvironmental engineer to ensure visitor and staff safety. See Chapter
     9 for radiation safety.
     8.2.3. The safety and demilitarization of Air Force historical property on loan to heritage activities is
     the responsibility of the HPC.
     8.2.4. The USAF Museum may request nearby active, National Guard and Air Force Reserve units to
     inspect Air Force historical property on loan to civilian museums.

8.3. Planning for Emergencies.
     8.3.1. Provide fire detection in all locations where historical property is displayed or stored, and con-
     nect the central alarm to the installation fire department.
     8.3.2. Provide fire suppression systems, in addition to fire extinguishers, in all display, workshop and
     storage areas of the facility.
     8.3.3. You may install Intrusion Detection System (IDS) equipment instead of other security require-
     ments to supplement existing security measures. Provide after-hours IDS protection in all areas of the
     facility, including workshops and museum storage, with the central alarm connected to the installation
     security office. USAFHP activities without IDS must include a requirement for it in their submission
     to the organization's financial plan.
     8.3.4. Do not store hazardous materials near artifact storage, preparation or display areas.
     8.3.5. Be certain that the installation fire marshal inspects fire detection and suppression systems on a
     regular basis as required by applicable AFIs and local policies.
     8.3.6. Be certain that the installation fire marshal installs and inspects emergency, battery-powered
     lighting systems on a regular basis as required by applicable AFIs and local policies.
     8.3.7. Heritage activities with IDS equipment must develop an MOU with the installation security
     police to test this equipment on a regular basis.
     8.3.8. Heritage activities that are attended by and regularly host visitors must establish Operating
     Instructions (OIs), MOUs, and other procedures to meet minimum museum security and emergency
     response needs. Develop each of the following procedures in coordination with the appropriate base
     agency to ensure compliance with AFIs:
        8.3.8.1. Resource Protection. This includes opening and closing, anti-robbery and robbery
        response, bomb threat notification and evacuation, high cash value resource, HVHP and firearm
        inventories and confrontation management.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                   45


       8.3.8.2. Fire Emergencies. This includes notification and evacuation procedures, fire extinguisher
       checks, emergency lighting checks and procedures to respond to water and smoke damage to the
       collection.
       8.3.8.3. Disaster Preparedness. This includes plans to deal with tornado, severe weather, hazard-
       ous materials emergencies, and evacuations. Heritage activities must participate in base-wide
       disaster preparedness exercises and be included in the base emergency notification and recall
       plans. Disaster preparedness also includes post-emergency recovery actions and procedures.
       8.3.8.4. Radioactive Material Emergencies. Coordinate these procedures with the base radiation
       safety officer (RSO) or bioenvironmental engineer.
       8.3.8.5. Emergency Books. Develop emergency action books for the reception desk or another
       location that has good communications and access to the public areas of the facility.

8.4. Munitions. All USAFHP munitions (bombs, rockets, missiles, ammunition, flares, and other pyro-
technics) must be inert. Do not permanently mark or otherwise alter munitions. Qualified Explosive Ord-
nance Disposal (EOD) personnel must inspect all munitions and certify them in writing as inert.
Accession records must show what actions were taken by whom and when to make the item safe. Display
munitions with the normal INERT or EMPTY markings or decals.
   8.4.1. To inspect and store live or suspected live munitions, contact the EOD office serving the instal-
   lation. Develop procedures to render the item safe for storage or display and get written certification
   of those actions. Keep this certification in the accession folder for the item. Forward a copy to
   USAFM/MUC.
   8.4.2. All munitions received without a certification of inspection and verification of inert status are
   assumed to be live and are held in an approved separate, secured storage area until inspected. To
   remove munitions for inspection by EOD, use AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt. To recon-
   cile records, EOD provides a signed destruction certificate for any munitions it destroys because of
   safety considerations. Forward a copy to USAFM/MUC.

8.5. Display of Weapons. The USAFHP Director authorizes specific heritage activities to possess and
display actual weapons. Authorized heritage activities will keep all firearms and artillery in the collection
in a functional state in order to preserve their historical integrity and educational and aesthetic value. Ren-
der firearms temporarily inoperable by removing firing pins, internal mechanisms or parts. Removal of
parts must not alter the external aesthetic appearance or detract from the display value. Clearly identify
and securely store any parts removed. Do not cut, weld, deface or permanently alter any historical
weapon.
   8.5.1. Do not display functional weapons. Render display weapons temporarily inoperable. Excep-
   tions are allowed for:
       8.5.1.1. Antique weapons manufactured before 1898.
       8.5.1.2. Unique weapons whose disassembly might damage them or whose ammunition, links or
       drums needed for functioning are not available.
   8.5.2. The USAFHP Director decides whether a weapon is antique or unique (and therefore an excep-
   tion to the weapons on display rule). The local security officer, the AFFM director or HPC, and this
   instruction determine security needs for antique and unique weapons on display.
46                                                                      AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     8.5.3. Secure weapons on display to prevent their easy removal. Make security measures inconspicu-
     ous so they do not detract from the display's aesthetic appearance. Use security fasteners or discrete
     cable locks to secure weapons displayed as a component of a larger system (e.g., a turret or aircraft).
        8.5.3.1. Provide IDS protection for all cases displaying weapons.
        8.5.3.2. Attach larger portable weapons on open display to display stands, the floor or other fix-
        ture. Provide IDS protection to facilities housing crew-served and other large weapons.
     8.5.4. Do not display aircraft weapons under 30mm outdoors. Use replicas or non-receiver weapon
     components, barrels or barrel jackets to meet display requirements. Consult on a case-by-case basis
     with USAFM/MUC for security provisions and exhibit requirements for ground-mounted
     crew-served weapons (e.g., anti-aircraft batteries) displayed outdoors.
     8.5.5. Secure all weapons not on display, whether operable or inoperable, according to AFI 31-209.
     Follow structural standards in DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms,
     Ammunition, and Explosives, for new construction or modification of facilities for storage of museum
     weapons. Modify existing facilities accordingly. When upgrading buildings, comply with approved
     plans for future development and new construction programs unless the National Preservation Act of
     1966 precludes compliance.
     8.5.6. Deactivated war trophy weapons that are categorized as unit memorabilia are not considered
     historical property. Report war trophies in accordance with AFJI 31-217, Control and Registration of
     War Trophies and War Trophy Firearms, and AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, USAF Supply Manual.

8.6. Security Lighting. Place interior and exterior lighting in all museum buildings that contain histori-
cal property. Also place lighting in exterior display areas such as airparks to prevent vandalism and theft.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                               47


                                                Chapter 9

                                        RADIATION SAFETY

9.1. Program Direction. Radioactive materials can be present in a broad spectrum of domestic and for-
eign aviation artifacts produced as early as World War I. Materials made before the 1960s present a par-
ticular danger because of the wide use of radium at that time and the possibility of contamination due to
oxidation and breakage. The USAFHP Director develops and disseminates policies and procedures for
safely displaying, storing and handling radioactive historical property or components, including RSI, on
public display or in storage, in accordance with AFI 40-201, Management of Radioactive Materials in the
U.S. Air Force. Questions about handling these radioactive items are to be directed to the USAFM Radi-
ation Safety Office, USAFM/MUR.

9.2. Radiation Safety Officer (RSO). All AFFM directors must designate, in writing, an AFFM RSO,
who oversees the AFFM radiation safety program. For AFHCs, AFHHs and airparks, the commander of
the sponsoring organization appoints, in writing, a qualified individual (normally the installation RSO)
from the installation staff. The AFFM RSO or HPC must contact the installation RSO or Bioenvironmen-
tal Engineer (BE) to schedule initial and follow-up radiation surveys, as well as when anyone is to enter,
or perform work on, static display aircraft or missiles. In addition, the HPC must contact the RSO (BE)
when display cases containing radioactive artifacts are opened for any reason and whenever radioactive
historical property or RSI is first acquired or received.

9.3. Initial Radiation Survey. All USAFHP activities schedule an initial radiation survey and inventory
of items in or on all USAFHP historical aerospace vehicles and all other historical property on display or
in storage. Complete the initial survey no later than 12 months after the publication date of this instruc-
tion.
   9.3.1. Schedule detailed internal and external radiation measurements of all historical aerospace vehi-
   cle and other historical property. For each item you survey, document these radiation measurements
   on AF Form 3583, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle/Component Radiation Survey Log. Attach-
   ment 5 explains how to complete this log.
   9.3.2. Schedule a swipe sampling of each radioactive item, and the area directly below, to determine
   the extent of any removable contamination. For each item you survey, document swipe samples on
   AF Form 3584, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle/Component Radiation Swipe Log. Attachment
   5 explains how to complete this log.
   9.3.3. Removable radium contamination must not exceed 20 disintegrations per minute (DPM) per
   100-square centimeters of area swipe sampled, or 20 DPM per entire dial face. If swipe results indi-
   cate removable radium contamination in excess of this limit, contact USAFM/MUR for further guid-
   ance.
   9.3.4. Inconspicuously mark the radioactive item on the front face with a neat, 1/4-inch dot of red
   paint. Number each red dot to correspond to the item number on the AF Form 3584.
   9.3.5. At each point of entry to aerospace vehicles which contain radioactive materials, place a con-
   spicuous sign which states, “Contact Bioenvironmental Engineering Before Entering.”
48                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


9.4. Radiation Safety Records. Create historical radiation logs detailing the presence of radioactive
commodities for each historical aerospace vehicle or item displayed or stored. Include:
     9.4.1. PN (if available).
     9.4.2. Stock number (if available).
     9.4.3. Source strength.
     9.4.4. Radioactive element.
     9.4.5. Location by station number or other specific identifier.
     9.4.6. Surface reading.
     9.4.7. Swipe test results and date.
     9.4.8. Date of scheduled follow-on testing.

9.5. AF Forms 3583 and 3584. The AF Forms 3583 and 3584 used to record radiological measurements
required in 9.3. constitute the historical radiation log for each USAFHP historical aerospace vehicle or
item displayed or in storage and are the principal documentation in the radiation safety program.
     9.5.1. Keep historical radiation logs as follows:
        9.5.1.1. One copy in each item's accession folder or individual historical aerospace vehicle file.
        9.5.1.2. One copy in the USAFHP activity's radiation safety master file, with separate sections for
        historical aerospace vehicles and all other items.
        9.5.1.3. One copy to USAFM/MUC for inclusion in USAFHP loan files.
        9.5.1.4. One copy to the installation RSO (BE), if requested.

9.6. Periodic Monitoring. Update historical radiation logs for each radioactive item at least once every
3 years. Include new swipe samples to discover whether radioactive materials have leaked since the initial
survey and to document any radioactive components added. Contact the local installation RSO (BE) for
technical assistance during periodic monitoring.
     9.6.1. EXCEPTION: If the display aircraft or vehicle is sealed and has a survey documenting (within
     three years) no external radiation contamination is present, thereby documenting radiation exposure is
     under the public radiation exposure limits, the aircraft need not be entered for the purpose of a survey.
     Should the aircraft be moved, require maintenance, or need to be entered, the aircraft must then be sur-
     veyed in full compliance with this regulation before anyone enters or completes any work on the air-
     craft.

9.7. Personnel Exposure Levels. For all radioactive items, keep exposure levels to visitors and staff as
low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). Don't allow public and staff access to aircraft interiors and other
displays or items whose exposure levels exceed 0.5 milliRoentgens-per-hour above background. Bring
radiation levels within that limit by shielding or removing the radioactive components or by resituating
the radioactive items within the exhibit.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                               49


9.8. New Acquisitions. Any items added to a USAFHP collection must come with a historical radiation
log. If none exists for the new acquisition, immediately start a radiation survey. This includes creating a
historical radiation log (see 9.4.).

9.9. Maintenance of Radioactive Items. Don't perform mechanical work or maintenance on radioactive
items unless you are simply replacing an entire component according to a T.O. Don't use grinding,
machining, etching, drilling, or any other physical or chemical process that changes the form of the com-
ponent or produces respirable or ingestible particles. Don't open aircraft instruments, switches, circuit
breakers or other components that contain radioactive materials.
   9.9.1. Only contractors licensed by the appropriate state regulatory agency to perform such work may
   replace radium paint on instrument dials with non-radioactive substitutes. Coordinate proposed
   actions with USAFM/MUR.
   9.9.2. Immediately report any damage to radioactive items to the local installation RSO (BE) so that
   he or she can promptly assess the danger and determine cleanup requirements.
   9.9.3. Handle exposed radium-containing paint on items (as a result of an original specification, dete-
   rioration, vandalism or other damage) with great caution to avoid contaminating visitors, staff, arti-
   facts, facilities and equipment. Do not use unprotected radium painted items for “hands-on” exhibits
   (E.G, throttle/pitch quadrants, bombsights, gunsights, etc.).
   9.9.4. Forbid public and staff access to USAFHP historical aerospace vehicles or areas containing
   damaged or leaking radioactive commodities until the area has been monitored, assessed and decon-
   taminated if necessary. Document such occurrences in the item's historical radiation log. The installa-
   tion RSO (BE) must approve, in writing, the reopening of the display area to the public and staff.

9.10. Emergency Response Procedures. All USAFHP activities with radioactive USAFHP property
must create and enforce written emergency procedures. The local installation RSO or bioenvironmental
engineer must approve these procedures.

9.11. Shipment. You must contact the installation RSO (BE) for assistance in shipping radioactive mate-
rials. Any material identified as radioactive must be identified, packaged, labeled, and shipped according
to AFI 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment, and 49, CFR, Transportation.
AFI 40-201, Management of Radioactive Materials in the U.S. Air Force, states requirements for prepar-
ing and shipping unserviceable commodities identified as waste, explains how to handle, store, and iden-
tify radioactive material, and gives advice for handling magnesium-thorium, depleted uranium
components, lensatic compasses, nucleonic oil indicators and wrist compasses.

9.12. Exchange. To get approval for exchanging radioactive items (such as instruments and components)
or historical aerospace vehicles containing radioactive components, you must comply with this instruc-
tion.

9.13. Disposal. Within the United States, dispose of historical aerospace vehicles turned over from dis-
play through DRMO. This means you must first contact the installation RSO (BE) to have all radioactive
components removed for special disposal according to AFI 40-201. Use the same procedures to dispose of
individual radioactive components (such as excess RSI). If special conditions require other processes,
50                                                                  AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


coordinate them with USAFM/MUR have the installation RSO (BE) seek approval from the Air Force
Radioisotope Committee, HQ AFMOA/SGOR, 110 Luke Ave, RM 405, Bolling AFB DC 20332-7050.

9.14. Loan to Civilian Museums. Remove all radioactive items before loaning USAFHP property to a
civilian museum. Contact the installation RSO (BE) to have all radioactive items and contamination
removed from USAFHP property which is being loaned to a civilian museum.
     9.14.1. USAFM personnel must remove radioactive components of USAFHP property loaned to
     civilian museums before the Air Force published this instruction and return them to the USAFM.
     9.14.2. Civilian museums must not install radioactive components in USAFHP property.

                                    PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS

10.1. Purpose. Commanders may permit private supporting organizations (such as charitable founda-
tions) to be established to support USAFHP activities at their locations as prescribed by AFI 34-223, Pri-
vate Organization (PO) Program and by the additional requirements of this instruction. These
organizations support USAF heritage activities by:
   10.1.1. Raising funds to support command-approved capital construction of facilities.
   10.1.2. Raising funds in general support of USAFHP activities.
   10.1.3. Funding the acquisition of significant historical property to the supported USAFHP activity

       10.2.5.1. Limit the activities of the organization to support local USAFHP director-sanctioned
       projects of the USAFHP activity within the constraints of the activity’s mission statement.
       10.2.5.2. Require the transfer of acquired historical property to the supported USAFHP activity
       within the supporting private organization’s fiscal reporting year.
   10.2.6. The supporting private organization will provide the USAFHP activity, the MAJCOM/HO,
   and the USAFHP Director the following information:
       10.2.6.1. Annual Financial Statement.
       10.2.6.2. IRS Form 990.
       10.2.6.3. Annual report which includes names of all Officers and Board members, total number of
       members in good standing, membership fee schedule, and listing of significant projects during the
       reporting year.
   10.2.7. Create two MOUs and keep them current with any changes of signatories:
       10.2.7.1. One MOU shall clearly define responsibilities, limitations, terms, and working relation-
       ships between the private organization and the installation commander and states therein that the
       private organization will comply with this instruction. Figure 10.1. may be modified for local use.
       10.2.7.2. A second MOU shall clearly define the responsibilities, limitations, terms, and working
       relationships between the organization and the USAFHP activity. Figure 10.2. may be modified
       for local use.
52                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     10.2.8. Given the size, scope, and nature of private organizations supporting USAFHP activities,
     other additional requirements may be established by the installation commander, MAJCOM/HO, or
     the USAFHP Director in order to monitor activities and assure appropriate oversight.

10.3. Ethics and Conflict of Interest.
     10.3.1. Private organizations will conduct their operations in an ethical manner consistent with
     Attachment 3 of this instruction.
     10.3.2. Museum directors and the HPCs of other activities serve only as advisors on the managing
     boards of all supporting organizations. They may not serve in any elected position or become a voting
     member of the organization.
     10.3.3. Private organizations may use the name of a DoD component or installation in their organiza-
     tional name as long as they include a prominent disclaimer on all print and electronic media that
     clearly indicates they are not part of the DoD. Private organizations may not use seals, logos or insig-
     nia of any DoD component or installation in their organizational name.

10.4. Authorized Activities. Private organizations may do the following in support of museum or base
historical activities:
     10.4.1. Raise funds in general support of USAFHP approved activities. All solicitations and grant
     proposals for funding and/or gifts-in-kind greater than $5,000 in value must be reviewed by the instal-
     lation commander, or designee, and the MAJCOM/HO for compliance with organizational strategic
     planning. As the private supporting organization is representing the interests of U.S. Air Force activi-
     ties, all such grants and gifts must also be reviewed for consistency with the standards established by
     AFI 51-601, and fund raising activities must be carried out under proper and statutory procedures.
     10.4.2. Fund the acquisition of significant historical properties on behalf of the USAFHP for the
     museum or base historical activities.
     10.4.3. Collect funds by donation boxes, unless State or local laws prohibit it. Private organizations
     must make the boxes visible to visitors and to USAFHP activity staff members and label them to show
     the sponsoring organization and the intended use of the donations.
     10.4.4. Engage in other socially acceptable activities that promote the welfare of the USAFHP activ-
     ity.

10.5. Prohibited Activities. Supporting organizations may not:
     10.5.1. Act as surrogates for USAF organizations in the operation of USAFHP activities.
     10.5.2. Take any action that obligates the commander or the USAFHP activity to either current or
     future major actions or to significant financial burdens without the written concurrence of the installa-
     tion commander, the parent MAJCOM, the USAFHP, or HQ USAF/HO, as appropriate.
     10.5.3. Retain physical or legal possession, including acceptance or loans, of historical properties or
     artifacts. Any such materials obtained by either gift or purchase by the organization are inferred by
     charter to belong to the USAFHP activity. All rights and title pass to the USAFHP within the support-
     ing organization's fiscal year.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                53


   10.5.4. Do anything contrary to the intent, guidance, or purpose of this instruction or that would
   reflect improperly on the Air Force.
   10.5.5. Solicit or accept any historical property on behalf of the USAFHP activity without written
   approval from the USAFHP activity, the MAJCOM/HO, and the USAFHP Director.

10.6. Division of Responsibilities. The Air Force encourages the supporting organization representing
the interests of the community, citizens, and patrons to present advice, counsel, and suggestions to both
the commander and the USAFHP activity. Supporting organizations may not, however, administer or
manage the USAFHP activity or interfere in the supervisory relationships between USAFHP activity
employees, the installation commander, and the USAFHP.

10.7. Retail/Gift Shop Operations. Gift Shops managed by private or other organizations and associ-
ated with USAFHP activities perform multiple important functions. Primarily they are a convenience to
the visitor and provide the opportunity to acquire additional educational materials and information
(printed/electronic media and other learning materials) relating to the exhibits, topics, and broad subjects
associated with the USAFHP activity. They also provide an opportunity to acquire items that evoke
remembrances and associations with historic people, equipment, events, and locations. Gift shops can be
an important source of funding in the support of USAFHP activities. Gift shops are openly available to all
USAFHP activity visitors and the general public without sales restrictions.
   10.7.1. The operation of gift shops and other retail operations associated with the USAFHP activity
   are subject to existing Air Force guidance.
   10.7.2. Gift shops shall be operated so as not to interfere or compete with AAFES activities or inter-
   ests.
   10.7.3. Gift shop sales are limited to items that relate to the USAFHP activity’s area of interest or to
   military /aviation history, heraldry, and technology in general. Such items may include:
       10.7.3.1. Books, pamphlets, prints, maps, and other media items.
       10.7.3.2. Reproductions of military works of art, clothing, equipment, insignia, and other items
       that illustrate aspects of our military heritage.
       10.7.3.3. Scale models of military/aviation equipment.
       10.7.3.4. Souvenir items related to historic individuals, equipment, events, and locations.
   10.7.4. Not to be sold in gift shops are:
       10.7.4.1. Actual historical artifacts and objects (and which may typically be found in a museum
       collection) such as uniforms, insignia, decorations and awards, and weapons of any type.
       10.7.4.2. Items that could be considered in poor taste or may be objectively perceived as publicly
       offensive.

                             CERTIFICATION AND STAFF ASSISTANCE

11.1. AFFM Certification. AFFMs must obtain and maintain USAFHP certification. The USAFHP will
periodically evaluate and inspect AFFMs and will advise commanders and MAJCOM/HOs on acceptable
levels of professional standards for the museums. A heritage activity that meets the standards established
by this instruction will be certified as an official AFFM. AFFMs will be informed no less than 90 days in
advance of a certification visit.
     11.1.1. The certification process will include:
        11.1.1.1. An in-depth questionnaire (see Attachment 6) attested to by the commander on the sta-
        tus of the AFFM.
        11.1.1.2. An on-site inspection of the AFFM based on the requirements of this instruction by a
        USAFHP-appointed certification team. The team will consist of at least one USAFM representa-
        tive serving as team chief, one MAJCOM representative, one representative of a sister service and
        one museum professional from outside the Air Force.
        11.1.1.3. A written report of the findings and a recommendation by the inspection team to the
        USAFHP Director. The USAFHP Director will approve or disapprove certified status of the
        AFFM in question.
        11.1.1.4. If approved, the Secretary of the Air Force grants certification to the AFFM.
     11.1.2. The USAFHP will initiate the certification process within one year after the date of publica-
     tion of this instruction or establishment of the museum. The AFFM has one year to request scheduling
     of the initial certification visit. Any AFFM that has not met the minimum standards within two years
     after the initial certification visit may not acquire any further historical properties and is subject to
     downgrading or closure.
     11.1.3. An AFFM that does not meet the established standards as confirmed by the procedures out-
     lined above will be informed of the specific shortcomings and allowed 18 months to make corrections.
     11.1.4. If, following a certification reinspection, the defects have been corrected, the AFFM will be
     certified as an official AFFM.
     11.1.5. If the shortcomings have not been corrected after reinspection, the USAFHP may:
        11.1.5.1. Approve an additional 180 days maximum for the museum to complete corrections, if so
        warranted by the work in progress.
        11.1.5.2. After advising the MAJCOM/HO, decertify the museum’s status as an official AFFM
        and withdraw Air Force historical property from the facility.
     11.1.6. After the initial certification, the AFFM will be reevaluated every 5 years as outlined above.
     However, a museum may receive an earlier reevaluation if its level of professional performance or
     ability to care for its collection has substantially changed.
     11.1.7. Certified AFFMs are encouraged to seek accreditation by the American Association of Muse-
     ums (AAM).

11.2. Staff Assistance and Site Visits.
   11.2.1. USAFM personnel will conduct periodic visits to heritage activities to ensure proper steward-
   ship of Air Force historic property and compliance with the standards set forth in this regulation.
   11.2.2. MAJCOM/HOs should visit heritage activities within their commands to assess the progress
   of the activity and provide technical assistance. Personnel from USAFM may augment these visits as
   required and when requested by the MAJCOM/HO.
   11.2.3. Commanders will be briefed as to whether their USAFHP activities conform to this instruc-
   tion.
   11.2.4. Commanders may request staff assistance visits to address special concerns at any time.
   11.2.5. MAJCOM IGs, as required, will address heritage activities as part of IG compliance inspec-
   tions. MAJCOM/HOs or their representatives may augment MAJCOM IG teams at bases with
   AFFMs . Attachment 6 will serve as the basis for MAJCOM inspection guides.

                                                 Chapter 12

                               CIVILIAN MUSEUM LOAN PROGRAM

12.1. Authority. The USAF Museum has been delegated the authority and responsibility by the Secre-
tary of the Air Force to carry out the provisions of Title 10 USC 2572, Sections (a)(3) and (a)(4) regarding
the loan of Air Force Historical Property to legally and professionally qualified public and private muse-
ums.

12.2. Eligibility. The following organizations are eligible to apply for the loan of USAF historical prop-
erty from the USAFHP under this program:
     12.2.1. Any domestic museum, historical society or institution operated by a governmental entity.
     12.2.2. Any foreign museum operated as an official entity of the national government.
     12.2.3. Any domestic incorporated museum that is operated and maintained for educational purposes
     only and whose charter denies it the right to operate for profit.

12.3. Loan Conditions.
     12.3.1. The USAFM may loan aerospace vehicles (aircraft, missiles, and major components thereof)
     to qualified and certified museums. All loan requests are subject to the availability at USAFM.
     12.3.2. It is the policy of USAFM not to make loan of artifacts for long-term exhibits of a general
     nature. Artifacts may be loaned but only to support special exhibits of short duration (one year or
     less).
     12.3.3. All material is loaned at no expense to the government. The material is made available “as
     is-where is,” and all expense of movement will be borne by the requesting museum. Further, each
     requester will bear all costs associated with the care and maintenance of the loaned material. All
     repairs, restoration work, additions or upgrades performed on loaned material, in accordance with
     guidance provided by USAFM, become the property of the U.S. Government. All costs associated
     with recovery and disposition of loaned material due to museum closure or corporation disillusion-
     ment shall be borne by the requesting museum.
     12.3.4. Loaned aerospace vehicles will not be flown or restored to flying condition under any circum-
     stances. Failure to observe this condition will result in the immediate repossession of loaned material
     by the USAFM, at the requestor’s expense and possible criminal prosecution.
     12.3.5. USAFM loans only to established museums which have a demonstrated record of professional
     performance, institutional viability and the resources sufficient to ensure the security and conservation
     of federal historic property. USAFM cannot provide initial artifacts and aerospace vehicles with
     which to start a civilian museum. All loans, including that of aircraft, are for a specified time period
     and are not permanent in nature. All USAFM material on loan is subject to recall at any time to meet
     the needs of the Air Force.

12.4. Certification Process. Civilian museum loan certification is divided into two categories: adminis-
trative and operational. Requesting museums must meet requirements in both categories to be considered
for qualification.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                   61


   12.4.1. Administrative: The requesting museum must meet the legal requirements of 10 USC 2572.
   HQ AFMC/JAG will make a legal determination based on the museum’s incorporation documenta-
   tion within its home state, its current by-laws, and the tax-exempt determination from the Internal
   Revenue Service (IRS). Museums operated by governmental entities (domestic or foreign) must pro-
   vide documented proof of their official status as per the statute.
   12.4.2. Operational: 10 USC 2572 states that the Secretary of the Air Force may lend historical prop-
   erty to museums. For purposes of this policy, the definition of museum contained in the Federal Prop-
   erty Management Regulations [41 C.F.R. § 101.44.207(16)] is applied. This definition includes the
   requirement for a paid professional staff. It further requires a public or private non-profit institution to
   be organized on a permanent basis, own or use tangible objects, and exhibit them to the public on a
   regular basis.

12.5. Application Process.
   12.5.1. Requesting institutions will submit their request, in writing, for loan qualification to the
   USAFHP Director.
   12.5.2. Private applicants must provide the following documents:
      12.5.2.1. Articles of Incorporation and the organization’s Charter.
      12.5.2.2. Proof of incorporation (some states issue a separate charter while others affix a certify-
      ing stamp to the Articles of Incorporation).
      12.5.2.3. IRS tax-exempt determination.
      12.5.2.4. By-laws (with statement by corporate officer of currency).
      12.5.2.5. Photographs of buildings, exhibits, restoration facilities, storage facilities and any other
      physical assets of the museum
      12.5.2.6. A copy of the most recent IRS Form 990, the latest financial statement, and the organi-
      zation’s projected budget for the forthcoming fiscal year.
      12.5.2.7. A copy of the museum’s scope of collections statement.
      12.5.2.8. The curriculum vitae of paid staff members.
      12.5.2.9. A Disposition Plan
      12.5.2.10. A completed Museum Evaluation Checklist.
      12.5.2.11. Accreditation certification by the American Association of Museums (AAM) if the
      museum has been so accredited.
   12.5.3. Governmental applicants should submit documentary evidence of their official status.
   12.5.4. Following a favorable legal determination and completion of administrative certification, an
   on-site certification visit will be required. This visit will be made by a USAFM staff member and will
   be at the expense of the requesting institution. The visit, and a detailed assessment of the scope of col-
   lections statement and the Museum evaluation checklist will comprise the focus of operational certifi-
   cation. The USAFHP Director may waive the requirement for the on-site certification visit for
   institutions accredited by the American Association of Museums (AAM). Prior to the certification
   visit the following documentation must be provided:
62                                                                       AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


12.6. Availability and Condition of Property. Property is made available for loan to civilian museums
after the needs of official military requestors are met. Classified material, radioactive components or any
items that might pose a safety hazard to the public will be removed prior to loan. Certain components
needed to meet operational requirements of the Air Force will also be removed, however, the aircraft or
missile will be externally complete.

12.7. Responsibilities and Care Requirements.
     12.7.1. Detailed responsibilities and care requirements are contained in the Loan Agreement and
     attachments.
     12.7.2. Any loaned item will be restored/maintained to reflect favorably on the Air Force.
     12.7.3. Potential borrowers should recognize that in accepting an item for display, particularly an
     aerospace vehicle, they incur a significant maintenance responsibility including annual upkeep, peri-
     odic painting, repair of damage, day-to-day care, clean-up, to name but a few. These responsibilities
     collectively impose a cost to the borrower that must be considered when the request is submitted. If
     borrowers are located in harsh environments (i.e. salt air) and their request proposes exterior display,
     the condition of loaned items will be closely monitored by USAFM.

12.8. Insurance. The borrower will be required to provide proof of insurance to cover the repair or
replacement of any loaned property naming USAFM as the loss payee. Copies of the proof of insurance
and any renewals will be forwarded to USAFM upon initial approval of the loan request and prior to
release of any material.

12.9. Disposition Plan. The borrower will provide a written plan detailing the recovery and disposition
of loaned property in the event the museum should close. This plan should include, but is not limited to,
statements of assurance by municipal or corporate entities to underwrite all costs associated with recovery
and disposition of loaned property and that such actions will not be at the expense of the U.S. Govern-
ment.

12.10. Financial reporting and Loan Renewal. Current copies of IRS Form 990 and the most recent
annual financial statements are required as part of any loan extension or renewal.

12.11. Third-Party Loans of Air Force Historical Property. Third-party loans of Air Force historical
property may only be made with the express written approval of the USAFHP Director. Such loans are
strongly discouraged.

12.12. Failure to Maintain Standards. Museums that fail to maintain qualification standards or to meet
the requirements of the loan agreement are subject to de-certification by the USAFHP Director. De-certi-
fied museums will return all loaned items at their expense.

12.13. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 495, Swipe Container, AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue
Receipt, AF Form 3569, USAF Museum System Volunteer Application/Registration, AF Form 3570,

                                     STRATEGIC PLANNING

A2.1. Strategic Planning
   A2.1.1. MAJCOMs are required to have a comprehensive Strategic Plan for all heritage activities
   within the Command.
   A2.1.2. Installation Commanders are required to have comprehensive Strategic Plans for all AFFMs
   and AFHCs. AFHHs and Airparks only require mission statements and collections policies.
   A2.1.3. A strategic plan is a comprehensive document that drives:
      A2.1.3.1. Exhibit plans.
      A2.1.3.2. Collection plans.
      A2.1.3.3. Facility use and long-range development.
      A2.1.3.4. Financial plans.
   A2.1.4. Strategic plans are derived from the mission statement of the AFFM or AFHC, and consist of
   four major elements:
      A2.1.4.1. Exhibit Master Plan.
      A2.1.4.2. Collection Plan.
      A2.1.4.3. Facilities Utilization Plan.
      A2.1.4.4. Financial Plan.
   A2.1.5. Developing Exhibit Master Plans. All AFFMs and AFHCs will:
      A2.1.5.1. Develop a storyline, which is a clear, concise statement of what topics the heritage
      activity will discuss.
      A2.1.5.2. Develop a detailed exhibit script, which is the comprehensive exhibit text. This is the
      information you will convey to heritage activity visitors.
      A2.1.5.3. Develop a list of what artifacts, photographs, documents and exhibit property needed
      based on the exhibit script.
      A2.1.5.4. Draft the captions and headlines to accompany the script, artifacts, photographs and
      exhibit property.
      A2.1.5.5. Develop the layout of each panel or display based on the above information.
      A2.1.5.6. Determine the amount of space (linear, vertical and cubic) each exhibit or display
      requires.
      A2.1.5.7. Develop the layout or floor plan of the exhibit area.
   A2.1.6. Developing Collection Plans. All AFFMs and AFHCs will:
      A2.1.6.1. Based on a complete inventory and cataloging of the historical property on loan to the
      heritage activity, determine the significance of each item and its applicability to the Exhibit Plan.
68                                                                      AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


        A2.1.6.2. Review the inventory and catalog of the historical property on loan to the heritage activ-
        ity to see if you have the specific items you need for your Exhibits Plan. Determine the shortfalls
        and excesses. The list of shortfalls will form the basis of your Acquisition Plan. The list of
        excesses will serve as the basis of your Disposition Plan.
        A2.1.6.3. Coordinate with the MAJCOM/HO and USAFM/MUC to locate historic property
        within the USAFHP.
        A2.1.6.4. If the item cannot be located within the USAFHP, AFFMs only may advertise for dona-
        tions of specific items.
        A2.1.6.5. Work with the parent MAJCOM to determine the actions required to support the Dispo-
        sition Plan.
     A2.1.7. Developing Facility Utilization Plans. All AFFMs and AFHCs will:
        A2.1.7.1. Given the total amount of square feet available to you at any location on base, deter-
        mine what you need for:
            A2.1.7.1.1. Exhibit and Display (based on your Exhibit Plan).
            A2.1.7.1.2. Office Area (for the heritage activity and any Supporting Organization).
            A2.1.7.1.3. Exhibit preparation and fabrication and restoration areas.
            A2.1.7.1.4. Artifact conservation and artifact storage.
            A2.1.7.1.5. Reference materials.
            A2.1.7.1.6. Gift shop.
            A2.1.7.1.7. Special events.
            A2.1.7.1.8. General storage and shop areas.
        A2.1.7.2. Adjust the Exhibit Plan and Collection Plan as required to fit available space and fund-
        ing.
        A2.1.7.3. Determine long-range capital improvements to include new facilities, major repairs,
        environmental, security and resource protection improvements. Facility improvements and repair
        requirements become part of the Installation’s Financial Plan. New facilities drive the private Sup-
        porting Organization’s fund-raising efforts.
     A2.1.8. Developing Financial Plans. All AFFMs and AFHCs will:
        A2.1.8.1. Based on the outstanding requirements identified in your Exhibit Master Plan, Collec-
        tion Plan, and Facilities Utilization Plan, determine funding required for facility repair, improve-
        ment, modernization, exhibit construction, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) modifications,
        etc.
        A2.1.8.2. Determine which items can be accomplished by Base Civil Engineering (CE) and
        which will need to be accomplished through the PO.
        A2.1.8.3. Include Operations and Maintenance (O&M) requirements in the parent unit’s FIN-
        PLAN for submission to the MAJCOM in the format prescribed in the Command’s annual budget
        call.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                               69


     A2.1.8.4. Submit major construction requirements and plans to the (private organization) PO for
     inclusion in their financial and fundraising plans.
  A2.1.9. Mission and Collection Policy Statements.
     A2.1.9.1. All heritage activities must have approved mission statements. A mission statement
     concisely states, in writing, the purpose of the heritage activity and the aspect of Air Force history
     that the activity addresses.
     A2.1.9.2. The parent MAJCOM approves mission statements, or may modify them by assigning
     a secondary mission. Upon approval, mission statements are forwarded to the USAFHP Director,
     who uses them to guide the acquisition of historical property for the USAF.
     A2.1.9.3. The missions of all USAFHP activities collectively express the Air Force's heritage and
     preserve its material culture. MAJCOMs should plan mission statements to avoid unnecessary
     duplication, wisely using Air Force resources and scarce USAF historical property.
     A2.1.9.4. All heritage activities must also have collection policies. The collection policy is based
     on the mission statement. It outlines the type and amount of historical property required to support
     the mission statement and what will be accepted by the heritage activity.
         A2.1.9.4.1. These statements define what the heritage activity will collect and how each item
         (or commodity) is related to the mission statement.
         A2.1.9.4.2. These statements can be general (by class) or narrow (by specific type or model),
         depending on the space and resources available. They are to be defined by the classification
         categories used in the Data Dictionary issued to MAJCOMs by USAFM/MUC.
     A2.1.9.5. The USAFHP Director and MAJCOM/HOs rely on mission statements to ensure arti-
     facts and other resources go to the proper activity, and the USAFHP represents the full heritage of
     the Air Force.

                                     USAFHP ETHICS STATEMENT

A3.1. Introduction. This code of ethics is intended to identify those general parameters within which
USAFHP employees and volunteers should operate. The USAFHP exists to serve both the US Air Force
(USAF) and the public. It functions as an arm of the USAF and as such must comply with the Joint Ethics
Regulation (JER) DoD 5500.7-R, existing Air Force Instructions (AFIs), and established procedures in
such operational areas as financial management, personnel matters, and procurement of supplies, as well
as within established USAF requirements governing personal conduct. In the event any aspect of this code
conflicts with any of the above, the latter must take precedence. Otherwise, USAFHP staff should be
guided by the following:
     A3.1.1. Conduct business in a legal and moral manner, and avoid even the slightest appearance of
     impropriety such as the use of one’s position or access gained from that position for personal gain. We
     are subject to scrutiny not just by the USAF, but also by our professional peers and the public.
     A3.1.2. Be guided by both applicable regulations and ethics generally accepted among professionals
     within the museum community.
     A3.1.3. Never compete with the USAFHP or give the appearance of doing so. Do not pursue a col-
     lecting interest during leisure time if there is a potential for a conflict of interest with the employee’s
     official duties.
     A3.1.4. Do not accept gifts, discounts or other favors from parties seeking to do business with
     USAFHP. Exceptions to the above are set forth in the JER cited above.
     A3.1.5. Do not prepare appraisals for donors or potential donors. The only permissible appraisals are
     for internal use or for other non-profit institutions.
     A3.1.6. When speaking out on a public issue, do so as an individual unless authorized to speak offi-
     cially on behalf of USAFHP.
     A3.1.7. Recognize and strive to maintain the goal of service to the visiting public and the dissemina-
     tion of knowledge.
     A3.1.8. Manage all artifacts placed in the care of USAFHP in such a manner as to assure long-term
     preservation. The use of historical, irreplaceable artifacts in such a manner that promotes their degra-
     dation or consumption is inappropriate.
     A3.1.9. Maintain all collection records including disposition records in an accurate, thorough and
     orderly manner.
     A3.1.10. Keep the USAFHP collections policy in mind when determining whether to accept or reject
     a proposed donation.
     A3.1.11. Make the collections available for legitimate examination and research by people outside
     the USAFM within limitations of available resources, preservation of the items involved, purpose of
     the research and other considerations.
     A3.1.12. Ensure the integrity of reproductions and replicas and permanently identify those items as
     such.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                            71


  A3.1.13. Only acquire artifacts with clear title.
  A3.1.14. Appreciate the fact that the USAFHP is holding the national collection in trust for the bene-
  fit of future generations.

                                       EXHIBIT REQUIREMENTS

A4.1. Exhibit Design and Planning. Design concepts should pertain to the approved storyline, location,
and support facilities and respect the artifacts to be displayed. Overall design should be balanced, logical
and aesthetically pleasing. Address questions about exhibit design or construction through the MAJCOM/
HO to the USAFM Exhibits Division (USAFM/MUE).
     A4.1.1. Exhibit copy should cover a wide range of audience interest and sophistication.
     A4.1.2. Use clear, concise, and readable language.
     A4.1.3. Display artifacts that are in stable condition and of good overall quality.
     A4.1.4. Coordinate designs for artifact support mounts and mounting through the MAJCOM/HO with
     the USAFHP Conservator to ensure use of standard museum conservation methods.
     A4.1.5. Do not display original photographs, archival documents and records. Use photographic cop-
     ies instead.
     A4.1.6. Display artworks, graphic elements, photographs and exhibit cases at a height that can be eas-
     ily viewed by visitors of all ages, including visitors with disabilities.
     A4.1.7. Use electronic or typeset systems to letter exhibit titles, text, captions, labels, and signs.
     A4.1.8. Use lettering large and bold enough to be easily read from the visitor's viewing position.
     A4.1.9. Do not use handprinted, handlettered, typewritten, or calligraphy methods for exhibit titles,
     text, captions, labels or signs.

A4.2. Exhibit Case Requirements. Exhibit cases must be well constructed of inert, flame-retardant
quality materials and adhesives that inhibit entrance of vermin and dust.
     A4.2.1. Front-loading exhibit cases must incorporate a locking mechanism using security head
     screws or concealed access and a tight seal to ensure security and preclude dust and vermin.
     A4.2.2. Use quarter-inch ultra-violet (U/V) filtering acrylic glazing exclusively for viewing panels of
     cases. Use it also between the diffuser and light source. Where glazing surfaces join at an angle, bond
     and round the edges to prevent insertion of a pry tool, and secure them to the cabinet base or to the
     wall.
     A4.2.3. Install U/V sleeves on fluorescent lights.
     A4.2.4. Seal all interior surfaces of cases with a high quality, water-based polyurethane. In lieu of a
     polyeurethane, a high quality acrylic enamel paint may be substituted. Orange shellac may be substi-
     tuted. Allow freshly painted exhibit cases 2 to 3 weeks to ventilate harmful vapors before installing
     artifacts. If the case is already constructed of inert materials, the interior surfaces do not have to be
     painted.
     A4.2.5. Ventilate all exhibit cases with 1- to 3-inch diameter ventilation holes. All holes must have a
     louver and cotton baffle to filter dust and vermin. Install one 1-inch diameter hole per every 8 cubic
     feet of case space. Spaces larger than 8 cubic feet require one ventilation hole with up to a 3-inch
     diameter or several well-spaced 1-inch diameter holes.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                               73


  A4.2.6. Build cases for containing weapons, precious metals, high cash value resources or HVHP
  requiring IDS protection to the same specifications as standard cases with the following additional
  requirements:
     A4.2.6.1. Use security screws in locations inaccessible from outside the case. Cover them when
     possible, or locate them in such a manner that they cannot be tampered with unobserved.
     A4.2.6.2. Construct the tops, backs, sides, and bottoms of wall-mounted cases of 3/4-inch ply-
     wood or a material of equal or greater strength. Construct non-viewing surfaces of cases to pro-
     vide greater protection than the viewing surface.
     A4.2.6.3. Construct the viewing surfaces to the following specifications:
         A4.2.6.3.1. Construct viewing panels of at least 1/4-inch thick plate safety glass, transparent
         acrylic plastic, or transparent polycarbonate plastic.
         A4.2.6.3.2. Where glazing surfaces join at an angle, bond and round the edges to prevent
         insertion of a pry tool, and secure them to the cabinet base or to the wall.
         A4.2.6.3.3. Set the glazing for cases with cabinets in a channel that is at least 1-inch deep and
         screw it to the base from the inside of the case. It must not be possible to lift the glazing from
         the base or to slide anything beneath it into the case.
         A4.2.6.3.4. Secure the glazing for wall-mounted cases to the wall with screws that cannot be
         reached from the front of the case.
     A4.2.6.4. Fasten case tops securely to the glazing or to the cabinet base. It must not be possible to
     lift the top or to slide anything beneath it into the case.
     A4.2.6.5. Set hinges for case doors on the inside when possible. It must not be possible to reach
     the hinge screws from outside the case. Hinged openings must have all hinge butts concealed or
     pins spot welded, or use a comparable security measure.
     A4.2.6.6. Install locks on the doors to all cases. Doors over three feet must have a minimum of
     two locks.
     A4.2.6.7. Cases must have at least one alarm end device (such as a microswitch or magnetic con-
     tactor) between the artifact and its mount or the base of the case to detect tampering or removal.
     You may supplement this device with any one or a combination of the following to secure excep-
     tionally high-value or sensitive items: magnetic contact sensors on all case doors; microswitches
     or magnetic contact sensors under all glazing; or vibration sensors in each case, preferably on the
     glazing.
     A4.2.6.8. When possible, display alarmed cases so that guards or the museum staff can see them
     at all times. Do not mount partitions or other items in locations that would allow unobserved
     access or tampering.
  A4.2.7. Keep lighting in the general exhibit areas at a level that promotes the safety and well being of
  the artifacts. You may use fluorescent lighting with U/V filtering protection, or incandescent or Halo-
  gen lighting. Do not use incandescent fixtures or any heat-generating lighting for internal exhibit case
  lighting.
  A4.2.8. Keep lighting in exhibit cases at a level that protects the artifacts. Light level for pigmented
  or dyed textiles, artwork, and manufactured goods must not exceed 15 foot-candles or 150 lux.
74                                                                      AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


     A4.2.9. Construct and position ballast areas of fluorescent light fixtures in a manner to allow ade-
     quate ventilation of heat away from the case interior.

A4.3. Exhibit Maintenance. Establish standards, schedules, and procedures for cleaning and maintain-
ing exhibits that will best preserve the historic property on display.
     A4.3.1. Dust exhibit furniture and freestanding objects as required to keep a clean, professional
     appearance.
     A4.3.2. Examine artifacts on a scheduled basis "through the glass" for deterioration. Examine ques-
     tionable activity "behind the glass" if required.
     A4.3.3. Open exhibit cases on a scheduled basis. Dust cases and clean interior glass with housekeep-
     ing products and methods that do not harm artifacts. Inspect encased artifacts for evidence of deterio-
     ration or damage.
     A4.3.4. Remove deteriorating artifacts from display and request that the MAJCOM/HO contact the
     USAFHP Conservator.
     A4.3.5. Periodically inspect exhibit panels, cases, photographs, transparencies, signs and labels for
     any damage, wear and fading. Repair or replace them as needed.
     A4.3.6. Maintain exhibits with "working" parts (such as audio- or video tapes, laser disc or CD play-
     ers, interactive computer displays, technimation, electrical maps or other mechanical devices) in good
     working condition.

A4.4. Exhibit Documentation. Establish a project file for each exhibit, regardless of size. When com-
plete, file becomes historical reference material. Project files should include:
     A4.4.1. An exhibit script.
     A4.4.2. A list and accession numbers of artifacts displayed. Update if artifacts are added, changed or
     removed from the exhibit.
     A4.4.3. Photocopies with notes on reproduction specifications for photographs displayed.
     A4.4.4. All correspondence.
     A4.4.5. The preliminary design package, which may include:

                                               Attachment 5

                     COMPLETING RADIATION SURVEY AND SWIPE LOGS

A5.1. Radiation Survey and Swipe Logs.
     A5.1.1. This attachment assumes survey personnel have some knowledge and experience in basic
     radiation protection and the use of radiation detection instrumentation.
     A5.1.2. Aerospace vehicle/component radiation survey documentation consists of two forms, AF
     Form 3583, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle/Component Radiation Survey Log, referred to as
     Survey Log, and AF Form 3584, Static Display Aerospace Vehicle/Component Radiation Swipe
     Log, referred to as Swipe Log.
     A5.1.3. Complete the documentation accurately since these forms become the historical radiation file
     for the respective aerospace vehicle or item. See the basic instruction for additional information about
     radiation safety.

A5.2. Survey Log. Complete the Survey Log as follows:
     A5.2.1. Base. Self-explanatory.
     A5.2.2. Accession Number. The USAF Museum assigns this number as a tracking device for all his-
     torical property. To identify radioactive components installed on an aerospace vehicle, use the vehi-
     cle’s accession number. Obtain accession numbers from the DD Form 1149 used as a receipt for the
     item.
     A5.2.3. M/D/S (Mission/Design/Series). Enter the type of aircraft or missile being surveyed (such as
     F-105G, B-25B, C-130H).
     A5.2.4. Serial Number. Obtain this number from the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Ship-
     ping Document, used as a receipt for the vehicle. This number also appears on the aircraft or missile
     identification plate permanently affixed to the inside of the airframe.
     A5.2.5. Radiation Survey Instruments Used. Self-explanatory.
     A5.2.6. Item Number. For every vehicle surveyed, begin item numbers with the numeral 1. Number
     all radioactive components in sequence, beginning with 1. Place this number on the 1/4-inch red paint
     dot used to identify the item as radioactive.
     A5.2.7. Location on Aircraft and Missiles. Specify the radioactive component's location (for exam-
     ple, instrument panel, fuselage station number, wing station number).
     A5.2.8. Type. Describe the radioactive component (for example, compass, toggle switch, circuit
     breaker, counterweight).
     A5.2.9. Serial Number. Enter the serial number of the component if present and visible. The serial
     number is usually located on the back of the instrument. If the number is not readily available, omit
     the entry.
     A5.2.10. Part Number (PN). Enter the manufacturer's part number or model number. See the appro-
     priate Technical Order (T.O.) Dash 4, Illustrated Parts Breakdown, for assistance. For Mag-Thor
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                             77


   (magnesium thorium alloy) skin panels (such as those found on F-105s) use the panel number painted
   on them.
   A5.2.11. National Stock Number (NSN). Enter if available.
   A5.2.12. Condition. Enter a one-word description of the component's condition. Examples: "OK",
   "Broken", "Cracked", "Flaking."
   A5.2.13. Suspected Isotope. If the component is a skin panel, the isotope is probably Th 232 (tho-
   rium); the dials, gauges, circuit breakers, toggle switches, and so on are probably Ra 226 (radium);
   and the counterweights are depleted uranium (DU). If unknown, use a question mark (?).
   A5.2.14. Type of Radiation. Both radium and thorium are primarily alpha emitters but do emit beta
   and gamma radiation. Mark ABG (alpha beta gamma) in this column unless you know it to be other-
   wise.
   A5.2.15. Alpha (CPM). Enter alpha measurements in disintegrations per minute (DPM). Use this col-
   umn for recording measurements when using an alpha detection instrument. Take measurements at
   the surface or as close to the component as possible without damaging the instrument probe.
   A5.2.16. Beta/Gamma (mR/HR). Enter gamma measurements in milliRoentgens per hour (mR/HR).
   Take measurements at the surface.
   A5.2.17. Swipe. Take a swipe sample of all intact radioactive components. Enter a “y” or “yes” when
   the swipe has been taken, or “n” or “no” if for some reason the swipe was not taken at the time of the
   survey. Note: Do not take swipe samples from items containing unprotected radium paint. Such items
   include radioluminous circuit breakers, flight instruments with broken glass, and diluter-demand oxy-
   gen regulators from propeller-driven aircraft and some early jets. The reason for this is that
   swipe-sampling such items is presumed to indicate removable radium contamination, and may create
   additional contamination by dislodging the fragile paint. Refer questions on proper swipe submittals
   to the USAF Armstrong Laboratories, USAF AL/OEBA, 2402 E. Drive, Brooks AFB TX
   78235-5000.
   A5.2.18. Continue entries on the reverse side. Use additional forms as required and number pages
   sequentially.

A5.3. Swipe Log. Complete the Swipe Log as follows:
   A5.3.1. Heading.
   The Base and Aerospace Vehicle/Component Identification information must match the associated
   Survey Log.
   A5.3.2. Item Number. Item number 1 on the Swipe Log must correspond to item number 1 on the red
   paint dot placed on the component and to item number 1 on the Survey Log.
   A5.3.3. Base Sample Number. This is a sequential number assigned by the RSO for each item swiped
   and annotated on the AF Form 495, Swipe Container (see A5.4.). For example, in a base sample
   number of WW9300000:
      A5.3.3.1. WW identifies the number as a swipe sample, and begins base sample numbers.
      A5.3.3.2. 93 indicates the year the sample was taken (1993).
78                                                                     AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


        A5.3.3.3. 00000 is the sequential sample number, which is unique to each item swiped. Do not
        repeat this number since it indicates one swipe out of a progressive sequence of all swipes taken.
     A5.3.4. Isotope Swiped. Request alpha, beta, and gamma analysis (ABG), which will encompass any
     radioactive component located on the aircraft.
     A5.3.5. Radiac Readings Off Swipe. After you make a swipe of the component, measure it for gamma
     and note the measurement on the Swipe Log and the AF Form 495.
     A5.3.6. Date Swiped, Shipped, Received. Self explanatory.
     A5.3.7. AL/OEBA Swipe Analysis. USAF AL/OEBA assigns the swipe a number that corresponds to
     the Base Sample Number. Enter the AL/OEBA ID number and the swipe results on the Swipe Log as
     they were reported by USAF AL/OEBA. For example, in a swipe number of 49300000: 4 is a swipe
     sample (a constant), 93 indicates the year the sample was analyzed (1993), and 00000 is a sequential
     sample number.
     A5.3.8. Reverse Side. Continue entries on the reverse side. Use additional forms if necessary and
     number pages sequentially.

A5.4. AF Form 495, Swipe Container. Enter all required information properly and accurately to facili-
tate a quicker response time from USAF AL/OEBA. The approximate waiting time for analysis reports is
2 to 4 weeks, depending on the number of swipe samples shipped to USAF AL/OEBA at one time.

A5.5. Aircraft Diagrams. Use general arrangement drawings of aerospace vehicles to show the location
of Mag-Thor panels. Place the item number corresponding to the panel number from the Survey Log in
the appropriate area on the drawing of the aircraft. Use simple sketches to describe the location and
nomenclature of internal radioactive components, such as flight instruments, switches, and circuit break-
ers. Keep these document for future reference since the red dot and number on the panel may fade because
of weather or age.

A5.6. RSIs and Individual Artifacts. Although the Survey and Swipe Logs are designed for use with
aerospace vehicles, they can be adapted to document surveys of RSI holdings and historical property on
display or in storage.
     A5.6.1. Survey Log. You may list all radioactive RSI holdings or historical property on one or more
     forms, entering RSI or Historical Property on the Accession Number line.
        A5.6.1.1. Leave M/D/S and serial number blank.
        A5.6.1.2. For each group surveyed, begin item numbers with the numeral 1. Number all radioac-
        tive components in sequence, beginning with 1. Place this number on the 1/4-inch red paint dot
        used to identify the item as radioactive.
        A5.6.1.3. Enter the RSI inventory number or accession number for historical property in the
        Location on Aircraft/Missile column.
        A5.6.1.4. Complete the remaining entries as described in A5.2. and subparagraphs.
     A5.6.2. Swipe Log. You may list all swipes on one or more forms, entering RSI or Historical Property
     on the Accession Number line.
        A5.6.2.1. Leave M/D/S and serial number blank.
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                     79


     A5.6.2.2. Item number 1 on the Swipe Log must correspond to item number 1 on both the compo-
     nent's red paint dot and the Survey Log.
     A5.6.2.3. Complete the remaining entries as described in A5.3. and subparagraphs.
80                                                                        AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004

               IC 2004-1 TO AFI 84-103, U S AIR FORCE HERITAGE PROGRAM


27 OCTOBER 2004


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2004-1. This change replaces the USAF Museum Advisory
Board with the USAF Heritage Program Board of Directors (paragraphs 1.2. and 1.2.3.) and directs that
SAF/AA serve on the Board (paragraph 1.2.3.3.). It deletes the requirement that HQ USAF/CCC, all
CONUS MAJCOM CVs, NGB/CF, and the Deputy Director of the National Air and Space Museum
(ex-officio) serve on the Board. This change also strengthens inventory procedure language for historical
property on loan to heritage activities (6.14.) and increases the requirement for photographs of historical
property on loan from every four years to every two years (6.14.2.).


1.2. USAFHP Board of Directors. On behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), the USAFHP Board
of Directors (Board) provides strategic policy guidance, operations direction and management control to
the USAFM and USAFHP. The Board shapes, reflects and advocates the institutions’ values and goals.


1.2.2. The Board meetings will be facilitated by the Executive Secretary (HQ USAF/HO).


1.2.3. The Board will guide and assist the USAFHP Director in the accomplishment of the responsibilities
outlined in 1.1.2.1. It shall consist of five, permanent Government employees and active duty Air Force
personnel who exercise sole voting authority:


1.2.3.3. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA).


1.2.3.4. Air Force Material Command (AFMC) senior leadership.


1.2.3.5. The USAFHP Director (USAFM/MU).


1.2.3.6. DELETED


1.2.3.7. DELETED
AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004                                                                                   91


1.2.3.8. DELETED


1.2.4. The Board may consult an advisory group of retired Air Force, industry, or professional leaders as
it deems necessary to provide expert advice, ideas and diverse opinions on matters pertinent and essential
to the national museum and the USAFHP. These consultants serve in a non-voting capacity.


1.2.5. The USAFHP Board of Directors will meet at least annually at the call of HQ USAF/CVA. They
will report annually to the SAF the preservation and exhibition of the material culture of the U.S. Air
Force in compliance with 16 U.S.C. 431et seq. in accordance with the authority of the SAF under 10
U.S.C. 8013. The written report shall include the status and accomplishments of the USAFHP as well as
recommended changes in response to identified shortfalls and factors limiting the success of the program.
Additionally, the Board’s functions will be to:


1.2.5.1. Review progress on issues of concern to the national museum and the USAFHP.


1.2.5.3. Assist in locating individuals and organizations that can contribute to the work of the national
museum and the USAFHP.


1.2.5.4. Review current operating procedures and organizational structure; recommend new policies or
courses of action as needed relative to the operation of the national museum and the USAFHP.


6.14. Inventory Reporting and Control. Proper stewardship of USAFHP collections includes regular and
comprehensive inventories of all historical property. IAW RCS: HAF-HO(A)8801, Report of Historical
Property, USAFM/MUC must account for and report all USAFHP historical property biennially. For his-
torical property on loan to heritage activities, USAFM/MUC sends out the Report of Historical Property
(inventory) and a “Points of Contact” list to each MAJCOM/HO no later than 1 February of the appropri-
ate year. MAJCOM/HOs will in turn coordinate with the HPCs of their individual heritage activities to
accomplish a comprehensive wall-to-wall inventory of all historical property. USAFM/MUC staggers
this inventory schedule so that only half of all heritage activities submit their certified inventory lists in
any calendar year. MAJCOM/HOs will reply back to USAFM/MUC with completed inventories no later
than 1 May of the same year.


6.14.1. To accomplish inventories, heritage activities will:


6.14.1.1. Physically inspect each item and verify nomenclature and accession number against the inven-
tory listing provided by USAFM/MUC. They will also note any discrepancies such as shortages, damage
or deterioration, and provide a brief explanation of the problem and recommended corrective action. Prior
to submission, heritage activities will review the “Points of Contact” list sent with their inventory and
92                                                                         AFI84-103 27 OCTOBER 2004


annotate changes, corrections, etc. as needed. If a new HPC has been assigned, his/her appointment letter,
signed by the Commander, must be included (see 6.16.).


6.14.1.2. List any historical property received from sources other than USAFM for display purposes
which do not appear on the inventory. Provide completed AF Form 3582, USAF Museum System Acces-
sion Worksheet (see 6.15.2.), photographs (see 6.14.5), AF Form 3571, Proffers of Gift (if appropriate)
(see 6.15.1.), and all other accountability paperwork which accompanied the property. These items will be
added to your loan inventory.


6.14.1.3. Every fourth year, on a schedule established by USAFM/MUC, MAJCOM/HOs will include in
their biennial reporting requirements color photographs of all historical property regardless of location.
Photograph each item. Provide a standard 3x5 or 4x6 35 mm color print or digital image in “jpeg” format
of each artifact on display (or in collection) in sufficient detail to permit positive identification. Insure the
artifact’s accession number is in the photograph, or clearly marked on the back of the print. If photographs
are digital form, the accession number must be in the image and also must be the image file name. Also
provide standard 3x5 or 4x6 35 mm color print or digital image in “jpeg” format of each aircraft and mis-
sile in sufficient detail to show the overall condition and serial number of the airframe. Insure the M/D/S
(model, design, series), serial number, and USAFM accession number is clearly marked on the back of
each print. If an aircraft or missile has been repainted to represent another airframe, label the print with
the actual tail number shown on the DD Form 1149 for that airframe.


6.14.2. When complete, HPCs will sign inventory lists certifying that all historical property has been
physically inventoried and accounted for and any discrepancies noted (see 6.17. for guidance on lost or
damaged historical property). Completed inventory packages will include the signed and certified inven-
tory list (see 6.14.), an updated HPC “point of contact” list, one copy of the HPA signed by the organiza-
tional commander or vice commander, and photographs or digital images of all historical property on the
