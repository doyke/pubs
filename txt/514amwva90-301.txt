            The IG complaints program investigates violations of standards and provides redress or appeals where none already exist.

 You have the right to file an IG complaint, at any level, without fear of reprisal. First remember to verify the facts. Experience has shown
 that supervisors and commanders can best solve complaints, so the preferred approach is to first attempt to address your complaint within
 your chain of command. Again, although not required, we highly encourage you to discuss your problem with your immediate supervisor,
                     first sergeant, unit commander or next-level commander (as appropriate) before coming to the IG.

NO ONE may take adverse action against you, nor withhold favorable action, because you communicated with the IG. If you think you are
                    the victim of reprisal, because you communicated with the IG, inform your IG immediately
