1. Risk Assessment
     1.1. Explosives risk assessments effecting criteria in AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety
     Standards, other than Q-D waivers and exemptions, must be coordinated through the
     Installation Weapons Safety Office (75ABW/SEW). Written/documented risk assessments
     will be conducted when the risk cannot be mitigated to a low risk. The risk assessment must
     be signed by the responsible commander. A hot work permit (AF Form 592) when filled out
     can be used as a risk assessment. The permit must be signed by the fire department and the
     weapons safety manager and the risk must be determined as low.               Routine facility
     maintenance not involving a hot work permit does not require a written risk assessment.
2. Training
     2.1. All personnel requiring unescorted access to the Munitions Storage Areas (MSA) that
     are not assigned to the MSA must complete course CHPMAS0002400SU, Initial Explosive
     Safety Awareness, before a line badge is issued. This course is given every Monday at 1430
     in the host weapons safety training room
3. Fire Symbol Procedures
     3.1. All areas reporting fire symbol status for their location or structures will use the Hill
     AFB Fire Symbol Tracking System (FSTS).
     3.2. Supervisors must ensure there are enough trained personnel with the capability to
     change fire symbols and Net Explosive Weight (NEW) content, as required.
     3.3. Fire symbol reporting will include the correct fire symbol (or symbols) as required, and
     the current amount of NEW in the affected building, compatibility group or groups, critical
     item identification code, chemical hazard (if applicable), risk category, type of building,
     owning organization, owner (facility manager), and building number.
     3.4. FSTS will be updated each time the fire symbol and/or NEWs are changed.
     3.5. Organizations within the MSA must contact the Consolidated Munitions Control Center
     (CMCC) to make changes. Organizations without a representative in the CMCC may change
     FSTS without contacting CMCC (i.e. AFTC).
     3.6. Explosive facilities outside the MSA (1 or 2 areas), may make changes to FSTS without
     contacting CMCC. However, contact with the CMCC is highly encouraged.
     3.7. FSTS will be updated as soon as practical to comply with AFMAN 91-201, AFMC
     supplemental requirements.
     3.8. The fire symbol for 30260 will remain a 1 as deemed necessary by the Utah Test and
     Training Range (UTTR) fire chief. See Figure 3.1.
75ABWI91-201 2 DECEMBER 2014                                                             3


Figure 1. Fire Symbol Designation Facility 30260, Oasis MSA




   3.9. The backing for fire symbols must be of non-combustible material. The Hill AFB Fire
   Chief (775 CES/CEF) has determined that magnetic, Dura-lite and E-panel material may be
   used as a suitable non-combustible backing for fire symbol decals.
 4                                                         75ABWI91-201 2 DECEMBER 2014


     3.10. Posting of fire symbols on the exterior of licensed facilities is optional provided the
     Base Fire Chief approves this in writing. The Hill AFB Fire Chief has determined that
     posting of fire symbols on the exterior of licensed facilities is not required at Hill AFB.
     3.11. Half size symbols may also be used for individual bays on structures where full size
     symbols prohibit the proper functioning of the doors. Post full size symbols for the highest
     hazard and applicable chemical hazard sets to be visible from all approach roads.
4. Dull Sword Reporting Procedures.
     4.1. The host Weapons Safety Manager (WSM) will have an Air Force Safety Automated
     System (AFSAS) account for Dull Sword reporting. The account will be set up to ensure all
     Dull Swords reported are sent through AFSAS to the WSM via e-mail, for dissemination to
     the affected installation organizations. The account will also allow for reporting Dull Swords.
     4.2. When an incoming Dull Sword e-mail is received via AFSAS, the WSM shall
     coordinate with the affected organization.
     4.3. To initiate a Dull Sword, the units will contact the WSM, who will assist in determining
     if the discrepancy is Dull Sword reportable.
     4.4. Once it has been determined to be reportable, the owning unit will initiate a Dull Sword
     using AFSAS and coordinate it through the installation weapons safety office.
5. Munitions Transportation
     5.1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) transporting explosives on range: Use of DD
     626/836 “IS NOT” required when transporting explosives across/on public highways from
     one part of a base to another for short distances and /or in remote locations. For example,
     transporting explosives to the Thermal Treatment Unit (TTU) or South Range from Oasis as
     listed below.
     5.2. The requirement to use DD Form 836 and DD Form 626 “IS NOT” required for the
     following routes; between Oasis, the TTU and the south range (ALL USAF property):
        5.2.1. Between the Oasis Arctic Road Gate and the TTU via the Box Elder County Road.
        5.2.2. Between the Oasis and the north Gate of the south range via I-80 Clive Exit.
     5.3. Use of DD Form 626 and DD Form 836 “IS” required when transporting explosives to
     Dugway Proving grounds (U.S. Army property) via the Skull Valley route (Ibapah/Dugway
     Exit 77).
     5.4. This information is also included in the EOD transportation OI 32-3004.
     5.5. All munitions movements on Hill AFB proper will utilize established explosive routes.
     These routes can be located on GeoBase or contact the installation weapons safety office for
     information.
     5.6. Munitions movements at the Oasis are considered on the range; therefore, no explosive
     routes will be established. However, all explosive movements will avoid the built up areas as
     much as possible. For munitions movements, EOD will use the east MSA gate if solely
     conducting TTU operations. When conducting other operations, that require turn in of keys,
     EOD will stop in a location that presents the least exposure to the built up area and only for
     the time it takes to sign in/out keys.
75ABWI91-201 2 DECEMBER 2014                                                                    5


   5.7. Munitions movements, all hazard/class divisions, are prohibited from using Gate 112,
   adjacent to the CMCC. This also includes pick-up and delivery to licensed locations.
6. Explosive Safety Program Management

   hazard in all facilities equipped with fire suppression/automatic sprinkler systems.
   6.2. All ventilators on Earth Covered Magazines (ECM) will remain in the closed position
   regardless of serviceability. Those ECM’s without closable ventilators are exempt from this
   requirement. Ventilators need not be maintained in a serviceable condition due to the
   extremely diverse weather conditions at Hill AFB. Additionally AFMAN 91-201 para 5.58.2
   is not applicable per this instruction.
   6.3. Prior to conducting any new munitions process, base organizations and tenants will
   notify 75ABW/SEW. This includes development or manufacture of any equipment or
   fixtures that directly interface with a munition or explosives device. Systems Safety Project
   Officer (SSPO) in coordination with 75ABW/SES will determine if a safety analysis is
   required and what military standards are appropriate. Submit completed safety analysis to
   75ABW/SES for review and coordination.
   6.4. Solid propellant residue or explosive scrap will be stored and handled in accordance
   with assigned classification. If no classification has been assigned or determined, scrap will
   be handled as HC/D 1.1L until a hazard class/division can be obtained. Functioned or fired
   ordnance will retain the original hazard classification until certified empty according to T.O.
   11A-1-60.
   6.5. Each group, tenant, or staff agency offering munitions and explosives scrap residue to
   the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO), Hill AFB, will be responsible for
   the inspection and certification required by T.O. 11A-1-60. Qualified personnel will be
   appointed in writing by organization commanders. Qualification requirements are contained
   in T.O. 11A-1-60, paragraph 3-3. Organizations will send a copy of the commander’s
   appointment letter for inspection and certification personnel to DRMO. This letter will be
   updated as changes occur. Organizations not having assigned personnel who meet the
   qualification requirements may request support from any organization having a qualified
   inspector. Inspection procedures and equipment required to perform this task will be in strict
   compliance with T.O. 11A-1-60.
   6.6. CMCC will maintain, at a minimum, records of the last two fire drills.
   6.7. The use of barbecues (gas or charcoal) grills within the munitions storage area and any
   explosives operating location must be coordinated with 75ABW/SEW and approved by the
   fire department. Unit will provide 75ABW/SEW with a copy of approved letter.
   6.8. Semi-improved grounds are defined as vegetation maintained at 4”-10” per Air Force
   Grounds Maintenance Performance Work Statement (PWS) Template. Additional guidance
   or information may be requested from Base Civil Engineering, Grounds Maintenance

    (GBSs) and smoke grenades, must state in the remarks section of the AF Form 2047 and in
    the applicable OI, “FOR DURATION OF EXERCISE ONLY”. Munitions will be returned
    to the MSA at the end of each exercise. Licenses need not be rescinded at the end of each
    exercise.
    6.13. Upon approval, weapons safety sends copies of all licenses to the originator, security
    forces, base fire department, tenant unit safety office (if applicable) and the Munitions
    Accountable Systems Officer (MASO).
    6.14. Licenses will be reviewed annually as part of the annual weapons safety inspection.
    Annual review does not require re-accomplishing the AF Form 2047. Licenses will be re-
    accomplished whenever the certifying official (Commander) changes. All coordination will
    be accomplished prior to submitting to 75ABW/SEW for approval. If the annual review
    determines the license is no longer required, the certifying official will revoke the license and
    notify 75ABW/SEW, by letter, of this action. The 75ABW/SEW will forward copies of
    approved facility licenses to organizational explosives monitor, the fire department, and
    security forces. Annual reviews of licenses that do not change will be documented by the
    approving official changing the date on their signature block.
    6.15. If Electro-Explosive Devices (EED) are stored at the licensed location, ensure
    personnel handling and grounding requirements are met and included in the written local
    operating instruction and lesson plans.
    6.16. The 75ABW/SEW is the only unit that will prepare the AF IMT 943, Explosives Site
