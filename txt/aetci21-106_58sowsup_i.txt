                                            Chapter 2

                PAINTING AND MARKING OF AEROSPACE VEHICLES

2.1. General. This chapter implements the guidance outlined in AFI 21-105. It provides
guidance for applying and maintaining aircraft topcoats and applying command-approved non-
USAF standard aircraft markings as authorized in TO 1-1-8, applicable to Air Force aircraft,
applicable aircraft-specific TOs, and operational and ground trainer aircraft assigned to AETC.
(Note: Not applicable to static display aircraft. The owning unit’s history office manages static
display aircraft.)
2.2. Responsibilities. Wing commanders, group commanders, or equivalents and aircraft
structural maintenance element chiefs are responsible for complying with the provisions of this
chapter. (Note: For the purpose of this instruction, when only a group is assigned; the group
commander assumes the wing commander role.) Only aircraft markings specifically authorized
by TO 1-1-8, applicable aircraft-specific TOs, and this instruction can be applied to aircraft. The
AETC commander is the final approval authority for any paint scheme alteration on assigned
AETC aircraft to include tail flashes (tail stripe), nose art, or markings not authorized in the
applicable aircraft technical order. HQ AETC/A4MSS is the point of contact for all aircraft
painting and markings as specified in this instruction. HQ ACC/A4MS is the point of contact for
all aircraft unit designators. Note: Process waivers to this instruction according to paragraph
2.24.
2.3. Appearance Standards:
   2.3.1. All aircraft markings and basic paint schemes must be maintained intact and be
   legible, distinct in color, and present a professional appearance. Standardization of paint
   schemes and markings by MDS are of primary concern.
   2.3.2. Units must evaluate and document (score) the condition of aircraft topcoats twice a
   year to determine soundness for corrosion protection and appearance standards (see
   paragraph 2.4 for more information).
   2.3.3. Use touchup (sectional) painting to the maximum extent possible to maintain proper
   corrosion protection and appearance standards as opposed to full aircraft overcoats.
   2.3.4. Each unit must establish and manage an aircraft touchup program with the aim of
   maintaining a sound and serviceable topcoat. All command aircraft and helicopter units
   should plan to scuff, sand, and topcoat aircraft at least twice before considering a complete
   strip and repaint. Aircraft with predetermined paint cycles such as programmed depot
   maintenance (PDM), weapon-specific TO directives can base the paint cycle requirements
   according to those directives. Units should rely on touchup painting between scheduled PDM
   paint cycles for large aircraft, such as C-17, C-130, KC-135, and T-43. Only authorized
   coatings identified in TO 1-1-8 and/or weapon system specific directives can be used to
   touch up paint. (Note: Under no circumstances can spray paint in aerosol cans be used to
   topcoat aircraft or support equipment exteriors, unless authorized by specific directives
       2.3.4.1. Maintain ground instructional trainer aircraft (GITA) according to this
       instruction (excluding the requirement to strip aircraft and the mandatory use of coating
       systems specified in TO 1-1-8 or weapons system specific corrosion directives).
 14                                           AETCI21-106_58SOWSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011


      2.3.4.2. A unit option is to topcoat GITA with a commercial direct-to-metal (DTM)
      paint. DTM paint is an acrylic latex paint that is easy to apply and environmentally
      friendly. DTM paint can be applied using a standard paint roller or brush, and the aircraft
      does not require a painting facility. Note: Units that can maintain aircraft with current
      polyurethane paint are encouraged to do so, because DTM paint has a shorter service life
      and will require frequent touchups and/or repaints.
   2.3.5. Use polyurethane protective tapes for AETC aircraft when authorized as an option in
   the applicable aircraft -23 series TOs. EXCEPTION: C-130 belly tape.
   2.3.6. Do not base the decision to strip an aircraft on timeframe alone. Base the decision to
   media blast on the following criteria:
      2.3.6.1. Aircraft must be top-coated a maximum of three times before being stripped; this
      includes the original paint. (EXCEPTION: T-6 aircraft will not be fully scuff-sanded and
      overcoated without being completely stripped. The aircraft will not be stripped any
      sooner than the 8-year point unless approved by the T-6 SPM.)
      2.3.6.2. Strip aircraft as necessary to meet weight and balance requirements.
      2.3.6.3. Aircraft that have undergone or are scheduled for extensive structural
      modification and/or maintenance may be stripped at the discretion of the owning unit.
          2.3.6.3.1. Thoroughly inspect aircraft for structural defects at home station. Make
          every attempt to repair and/or document all structural defects before the aircraft
          departs home station.
          2.3.6.3.2. After stripping, regional facility personnel must accomplish minor
          structural repairs that can be accomplished within contract limitations. Aircraft found
          to have significant structural damage must be repaired at the expense of the unit or
          sent back to home station for repair.
      2.3.6.4. Do not strip aircraft within 3 years of programmed deactivation unless approved
      by HQ AETC/A4MSS.
   2.3.7. The responsibility for determining acceptable paint condition rests with wing
   commanders and fabrication branch chiefs ensuring the guidance set forth in AFI 21-105, TO
   1-1-8, applicable -23 series TOs, and this instruction is not violated.
2.4. Aircraft Paint Scoring Procedures:
   2.4.1. Semiannually score and rank order aircraft using a locally developed paint scoring
   form or automated program. As a minimum, document a complete description of what type
   and where the defect exists, (peeling, flaking, oxidation, discoloration, and staining of the
   paint), and measure the degree of paint degradation on a scale from 1 to 5; the number 1
   indicates a good paint coat and number 5 indicates the worst. The unit corrosion facility must
   keep these products on file until full strip and repaint is accomplished. Note: F-22 aircraft do
   not require semiannual paint scoring, but will be audited using the procedures in Attachment
   3.
   2.4.2. The corrosion control work center must document coating defects on the aircraft's
   AFTO IMT 95, Significant Historical Data; detail what type of paint deterioration and what
   areas of the aircraft need paint. Perform this action each time a major paint touchup (painting
AETCI21-106_58SOWSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                             15


   of more than 40 percent of an aircraft), complete scuff sand, overcoat, overspray, and/or
   complete stripping and repainting of an aircraft is accomplished.
2.5. Marking Application Methods. The following are approved methods for applying aircraft
markings to all AETC aircraft (refer to TO 1-1-8 for more information):
   2.5.1. Silk Screen Printing. Do not use this method on aircraft surfaces that are contoured
   or have protruding screws, rivets or bolts that will result in illegible or unprofessional-
   looking markings. When used, procure silk screen printing kits using local purchase
   procedures with organizational and maintenance funds. Local contracting offices can identify
   vendors.
   2.5.2. Decals. Units are responsible for procuring their own organizational decals.
   2.5.3. Stenciling. Apply markings using stencils. All colors must conform to applicable
   technical data.
   2.5.4. Vinyl. Apply markings using vinyl decals generated on computerized stencil
   machines instead of stenciling with paint. (Note: These vinyl markings tend to peel when
   applied to porous paints such as camouflage or on supersonic aircraft.) Ensure materials are
   properly adhered to and colors conform to those prescribed in applicable weapon system
   technical data.
2.6. Command Insignia. Application of command insignia on USAF aircraft is mandatory.
Fighter and trainer aircraft must apply full color insignias; helicopters and cargo aircraft must
apply subdued insignias, unless otherwise authorized. Specific application for each MDS is
located in Attachment 2. Note: Not applicable to special operations aircraft.
2.7. Organizational Insignia. Application of organizational insignias is optional; however, if
used standardize insignias throughout the wing. Apply organizational insignias to both sides of
the aircraft. If squadron insignias are not used, apply wing or group insignias to both sides of the
aircraft. Apply squadron insignias to the left side of the aircraft with the wing or group insignia
on the right side. Units not having organizational insignias may apply the next higher
organizational insignia. Specific application for each MDS is located in Attachment 2.
2.8. Tail Numbers. Aircraft tail numbers are mandatory. The tail numbers must be located
below the unit designator on the vertical stabilizer and or tail-boom pylon. Specific placement
for each MDS is located in Attachment 2.
2.9. Unit Designator. Unit designators are mandatory for all AETC aircraft unless otherwise
authorized by AETC/CC. HQ ACC/A4MS is the office of primary responsibility for the
assignment of unit designators. Submit all requests for approval of unit designators through HQ
AETC/A4MSS to HQ ACC/A4MS. Specific placement for each MDS is located in Attachment
2. Note: Not applicable to special operations aircraft.
2.10. Tail Flashes (Tail Stripe). Tail flashes are used to identify a specific wing, group,
squadron, or flight. Wing commander’s may develop a tail flash design and request AETC/CC
approval for application. The wing commander may choose a single wing tail stripe design or
distinctive tail stripes for each squadron or flight. Submit AETC Form 1236 to HQ AETC
A4MSS for AETC/CC approval. Apply the tail stripe to the vertical stabilizer and or tail-boom
pylon. It must be in the form of a straight stripe. The height must not exceed 15 inches for trainer
and fighter aircraft and helicopters, or 24 inches for cargo aircraft. In addition, the tail stripe
 16                                             AETCI21-106_58SOWSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011


must not contain more than four distinct colors. Variations in length, width, font size, font type,
and colors added to a previously approved tail strip are not authorized. Specific placement for
each MDS is located in Attachment 2. Note: AETC/CC is the final approval authority for any
paint scheme alteration on assigned AETC aircraft, to include tail flash (tail stripe), nose art, or
markings not authorized in the applicable TO.
2.11. Aircrew and Crew Chief Names. Unit options are to apply aircrew, crew chief, and
assistant crew chief names to aircraft. Aviator names are permitted for aircrew. Crew chief and
assistant crew chief names must consist of rank and name (first, last) only. Operations group
commanders (OG/CC) must approve or disapprove tasteful aviator names ensuring no discredit
is brought upon AETC, the Air Force, or the Department of Defense. Acceptable examples
include Captain William A. ―Smitty‖ Smith and Major Wayne ―Jonesy‖ Jones. Note: Tactical
call signs are prohibited.
   2.11.1. Lettering styles are unit options, but must not exceed 3 inches in height. All aircraft
   in the wing must be standardized by MDS with the exception of designated commander's
   aircraft, which may have different lettering that does not exceed 3 inches in height.
   2.11.2. A background block for the names may be used to encompass the names. The block
   must be in contrasting colors to the section applied and may be preceded by an eagle head,
   falcon head, tiger head, etc.
2.12. Commander’s Flagships. Commander’s flagships referred to in this instruction are those
aircraft selected to represent the commander’s position. Only numbered Air Force, wing,
operations group and flying squadron commanders are authorized designated flagships. (Note:
―Flying squadron commander‖ refers to a commander of a squadron with a flying mission.) If a
flagship is selected, only one aircraft is authorized per flying commander. Bases and units with
more than one type MDS assigned must select only one type aircraft for the wing and operations
group flagships. Flying squadron commanders may select one aircraft for designation as a
flagship. After selection, submit an AETC Form 1236 to HQ AETC/A4MSS for review.
AETC/CC is the final approval for all flagship selections. Apply flagship markings as follows:
   2.12.1. Numbered Air Force Flagship. When approved by AETC/CC, a numbered Air
   Force commander's flagship may be authorized at the base where the commander is assigned.
   The aircraft tail number may be replaced by the organization alphanumeric designator (such
   as, 19 AF), but must remain the same size as the original tail number. Move the tail number
   to another location on the aircraft, in a smaller size, on or as close to the vertical stabilizer as
   possible. Organizations may apply unit insignias to the aircraft. When used, place the
   numbered Air Force insignia on the right side of the aircraft with the wing insignia on the
   left. A collage of assigned wing insignias may be applied to the left side of the aircraft in
   place of a single wing emblem.
   2.12.2. Wing Flagship. When approved by AETC/CC, the tail number of the wing
   commander’s flagship number may be replaced by the organization alphanumeric designator
   (such as, 12 FTW), but must remain the same size as the original tail number. Move the tail
   number to another location on the aircraft, in a smaller size, on or as close to the vertical

                                           Chapter 3

      COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONICS, AND METEOROLOGICAL (CEM)
                   ACTIVITIES AND EQUIPMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides CEM units with procedural guidance for establishing an
effective corrosion prevention and control program (CPCP) for all CEM equipment.
3.2. Responsibilities:
   3.2.1. Units. Units must establish a local CPCP that stresses prevention and control of
   corrosion through equipment cleanliness and timely detection and maintenance of protective
   finishes. Use the Air Force Maintenance Quality Control Checklist 200-2 as a guideline for
   inspections. Units may use the base CPCP applicable to the equipment being maintained
   when practical. If the base has a CPCP control board, the unit CPCP functional manager
   must request membership and attend those meetings that have communications and
   electronic equipment related topics.
   3.2.2. Work Center Supervisors. Work center supervisors must ensure prevention or
   treatment actions are taken and documented on all equipment and systems under their
   control. Personnel assigned to the maintenance production work center are responsible for
   inspecting assigned vehicles (such as, trucks, vans, mobilizers, trenchers, tractors, back hoes,
   cable plows, trailers) for corrosion. Note: The base civil engineer (BCE) must be contacted
   before any maintenance is performed on conduits used with communication and electronic
   equipment circuits classified as real property and real property installed equipment (RPIE).
   3.2.3. Unit CPCP Functional Manager. The functional manager must:
       3.2.3.1. Assist in procuring needed materials for prevention and treatment of corrosion
       within each work center. A locally fabricated corrosion control kit may be used. The unit
       CPCP functional manager and work center supervisors can jointly determine kit contents.
       3.2.3.2. Ensure all maintenance personnel receive training on CPCP. The local
       environment must determine the level of training an individual must receive on assigned
       equipment.
       3.2.3.3. Work closely with BCE for support of the unit CPCP. Note: Support coverage
       should consider RPIE, vehicles, shelter equipment (including van interior and exteriors,
       undercarriages, and mobilizers, etc.) and equipment in storage waiting for projected
       installation.
       3.2.3.4. Obtain corrosion control and treatment beyond the unit's capability from the
       BCE, vehicle maintenance shop, respective Air Logistics Center, or Air Force Materiel
       Command.
       3.2.3.5. Ensure each work center adequately adheres to and participates in the unit
       CPCP. Periodically, but no less than annually, evaluate each work center’s CPCP.
       3.2.3.6. Ensure adequate quantities of referenced publications are available for the unit's
       needs.
AETCI21-106_58SOWSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                          21


3.3. Training Programs:
   3.3.1. Training is required upon initial assignment to a unit. Initial subject knowledge
   training must cover the causes, removal, control, and prevention of corrosion. Annual
   refresher training is also required.
   3.3.2. Follow-on training is conducted when new techniques are developed to identify,
   remove, or treat corrosion encountered by the unit. The unit CPCP functional manager,
   maintenance support personnel, and supervisors must be alert for applicable follow-on
   training subjects and cross feeds that may appear in other publications procurable through the
   unit publications personnel.

                             F-22 OUTER MOLD LINE AUDIT

A3.1. Audits. Low observable (LO) maintenance personnel will perform an F-22 Signature
Assessment System (SAS) and aircraft outer mold line (OML) audit to correlate aircraft damage
markings with defects in the SAS. A LO section supervisor proficient in OML inspection will
complete a minimum of one audit per aircraft each year. Scheduling aircraft for this audit will be
accomplished during the monthly/weekly shared resource scheduling meeting if possible. If
scheduling cannot be accomplished due to aircraft availability, all efforts will be made with the
owning organizations production superintendent to schedule aircraft audits concurrent with other
maintenance down time. All errors found during the audit must be accurately reflected in the
Integrated Maintenance Information System (IMIS)/SAS and briefed to all LO section personnel.
Units must establish a local SAS management policy that outlines the frequency of audits and/or
QA evaluations necessary to ensure SAS data is accurate. Note: There is an unacceptable risk to
aircraft radar cross section and/or aircraft survivability from substandard maintenance and/or
inaccurate signature assessment system data inputs. LO personnel with various proficiency levels
are performing LO maintenance and must verify that all work completed is according to
technical order data and documented properly in SAS.
A3.2. Equipment Required To Perform an SAS Margin Audit:
   A3.2.1. Militope or portable maintenance aid (PMA).
   A3.2.2. Sharpie.
   A3.2.3. Pen or pencil.
   A3.2.4. Fuselage station buttline chart.
   A3.2.5. Roll of tape (blue 3M 2090).
   A3.2.6. Booties.
A3.3. Steps To Perform Aircraft SAS Margin Audits:
   A3.3.1. Annotate aircraft margin for reference.
   A3.3.2. Access priority screen.
   A3.3.3. Highlight or circle all logistics control numbers (LCN) that are detailed in the
   priority screen on the LCN chart. Stand-alone LCNs are also annotated. Ensure seam filler
   LCNs are also annotated.
   A3.3.4. Access historical screen and compare each damage input of every
   highlighted/circled LCN with what is on the aircraft. If any differences in size, pay particular
   attention to existing damage for extended growth; if fuselage station or butt-line station are
   found, use the edit feature to correct and annotate action in supplemental data. Mark damage
   with a piece of blue 3M 2090 tape. This will make the following OML inspection easier.
   A3.3.5. If damage is not found on aircraft but resides in the history, annotate for removal
   later. This scenario is common due to previous maintenance or repair actions not being
   removed from SAS.

  A3.3.6. Remove the LCNs that do not have associated damage on the aircraft by a brush
  and/or roll repair.
  A3.3.7. Annotate damage found and any marked with the blue 3M 2090 tape. Sometimes
  damage is marked but does not get input into SAS. Input any new damage and any non-
  inputted damage found into SAS.
