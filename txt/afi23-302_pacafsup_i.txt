        support combat or tactical operations or training for such operations.
        1.1.1.3. Reportable Vehicle. ―Registered Equipment Management System‖ (REMS)
        reportable vehicles include passenger carrying, cargo and utility, special purpose, low
        speed vehicle (LSV), fire fighting, aircraft refueling, materiel handling equipment and
        base maintenance vehicles/ equipment of commercial or military design. Vehicular type
        equipment that meets any of the following general descriptions is included in this
        definition.
            1.1.1.3.1. Designed or used for military field training, combat or tactical purposes.
            1.1.1.3.2. Used principally within the confines of a regularly established Air Force

     1.1.2. Environment Protection Act of 1992/2005 (EPAct), Executive Order (EO) 13423, and
     Public Laws 107-107 and 105-388 reportable categories and vehicle definitions. NOTE: The
     General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Office of
     Management and Budget (OMB) have the right to change the types of vehicles that are
     reported each year based on Congressional and Executive office of the President
     requirements.
        1.1.2.1. Vehicle categories required for Energy Policy Act (EPAct) and Executive Order
        (EO) reporting purposes (i.e. Annual Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST), Office
        of Management and Budget (OMB) A11-33 reports and SF82, Annual Agency Report of
        Motor Vehicle Data). The Air Force has Commercial/GSA leased and Agency Owned
        Vehicles.

       comprehend English is a condition of employment. OIs not applicable to foreign national
       employees may be exempted from this requirement. If new OIs are introduced or when
       OIs are changed, foreign national employees may be verbally briefed on changes and
       briefings documented until written bilingual versions of these OIs are translated and
       available.
1.5. Use of Related Publications. See Attachment 1 for a list of referenced publications.
Management controls, records administration and forms documentation are described in many of
these publications.

Section 1B— Types of Maintenance

1.6. Base-Level Maintenance. Base-level maintenance includes both organizational and
intermediate levels of maintenance. Vehicle Management does not maintain everything on the
base with wheels and an engine. Upkeep of certain miscellaneous items of ground support
equipment or vehicle attachments is the responsibility of the unit that owns or uses it. Note: If
the attachment was originally purchased with the vehicle then Vehicle Management has
maintenance responsibility.
1.7. Organizational Maintenance. Organizational maintenance is accomplished by unit-level
vehicle operators in the various squadrons and activities across an installation. Operators use the
vehicle’s applicable Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report and applicable Technical
Orders (TOs) when accomplishing organizational maintenance. Specific organizational
responsibilities are outlined in paragraph 3.13
1.8. Intermediate Maintenance. Intermediate maintenance is accomplished by the base
Vehicle Management, including major and minor repairs. VFM or VMS determine shop
capability and decide which source of repair to use. Manpower, total cost, mission requirements,
Non Mission Capable (NMC) time, shop tools, equipment and technical capability influence the
decision making. Normally done in fixed shops, intermediate maintenance includes:
   1.8.1. Preventive Maintenance and Inspections (PM&Is) and Special Inspections.
       1.8.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . Crane load tests will be conducted In Accordance With
       (IAW) vehicle manufacturer T.O. In the absence of sufficient technical information from
       the manufacturer, refer to T.O. 36-1-191, Technical and Managerial Reference for Motor
       Vehicle Maintenance, paragraph 3.10.5.1 and AFOSH Standard 91-46, Materials
       Handling and Storage Equipment, paragraph 8.2.6.2.
   1.8.2. Repairing, fabricating or replacing unserviceable components.
   1.8.3. Refinishing, modifying (as directed by TO), repairing accessories and auxiliary
   equipment, and doing structural repair.
   1.8.4. Furnishing technical assistance to using organizations.
20                                               AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     1.8.5. When repair exceeds the base capability, maintenance may be performed:
        1.8.5.1. By a local off-base contract.
        1.8.5.2. At a nearby AF base. (Comply with AFI 25-201, Support Agreements, if
        personnel adjustments are needed.)
        1.8.5.3. Under Inter-Service Support Agreement (ISSA) at nearby military or other
        government shops. Affected commanders or equivalents concur on cost and vehicle
        disposition issues.
1.9. Depot-Level Maintenance. This level of maintenance provides technical aid (see TO 00-
25-4, Depot Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment) and overhaul of
specific vehicles (see TO 36-1-191, Technical and Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle
Maintenance).      Warner-Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) manages depot-level
maintenance for AF needs.
1.10. Mobile Maintenance. The nature of certain vehicle repairs requires maintenance support
away from the Vehicle Management Flight. The vehicle repair technician should debrief the
supervisor in charge or the vehicle operator concerning vehicle deficiencies. Review the
Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report for annotated maintenance problems.
     1.10.1. Mobile Maintenance can be used to perform PM&Is and Special Inspections on
     vehicles not easily brought to or unable to enter the maintenance shop due to size. Advance
     coordination is essential for proper planning and scheduling. Accomplish a complete
     inspection of the vehicle or equipment item at the time of the PM&I and Special Inspections.
     1.10.2. The Mobile Maintenance truck can be equipped with a tow attachment, a battery
     booster and power plant, per Allowance Standard (AS) 457. The truck should carry tools (AS
     403 and 457) and spare parts so that full PM&I and routine unscheduled work can be done.
     This truck should be two-way radio and/or cell phone equipped.
     1.10.3. The VFM or VMS has the option to expand Mobile Maintenance to include
     performing minor maintenance at selected units. It may be desirable to send a mobile
     maintenance truck to large organizations (Civil Engineering Squadron (CES), Security
     Forces Squadron (SFS), Aircraft Maintenance, etc.) on a scheduled frequency to perform
     minor repairs.
     1.10.4. The VFM or VMS determines, and then justifies, the number of Mobile Maintenance
     trucks necessary to be assigned.
     1.10.5. If the required repairs are beyond Mobile Maintenance capabilities, request wrecker
     assistance from Vehicle Operations. During other than normal operating hours, Vehicle
     Operations will deliver the disabled vehicle to the Vehicle Management parking area. The
     Operators’ Inspection Guide and Trouble Report will reflect the vehicle’s problem and must
     accompany the vehicle. During the next duty day, someone from the using organization must
     formally turn the vehicle in to Vehicle Management. Note: NMC begins when disabled
     vehicle is reported to Vehicle Management so if repairs cannot be completed in 2 hours or
     less open a work order to capture all NMC hours.
1.11. Scheduled Maintenance. Scheduled maintenance includes PM&I and Special
Inspections, at regular intervals to maintain a safe and serviceable vehicle fleet. The 18-Month
PM&I will be conducted using the AF Form 4354, Preventative Maintenance and Inspections, in
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         21


conjunction with applicable manufacturer maintenance requirements. Technicians must use AF
Form 4355, Vehicle Incoming Inspection, to verify a vehicle’s condition when accepting a
vehicle in to maintenance. The use of AF Form 4355 will satisfy the USAF’s obligation to
inspect a vehicle’s ability to operate safely, at least once within a 12-month period, IAW DOD
4500.36-R. TO 36-1-191 prescribes scheduled maintenance intervals and is used to establish a
scheduled maintenance plan. Using organizations will make vehicles available for PM&Is and
Special Inspections or arrange for a rescheduled time so they can be completed before their due
dates. Using organizations that exhibit a trend of failing to provide vehicles for scheduled
maintenance at the scheduled time should be reported to the next command level (i.e., Mission
Support Group Commander, Wing Commander, etc.) for corrective action. Do not delay PM&Is,
Special Inspections or any special scheduled maintenance actions.
   1.11.1. Consider seasonal needs, labor-hour availability, organizational need and fair
   apportionment of the 18-month requirement when developing a scheduled maintenance plan.
   All shops may use On-Line Vehicle Integrated Management System (OLVIMS) products or
   other automated listings to help complete work on time. Scheduled maintenance has priority
   and is not delayed. When necessary, resort to a two-shift operation, overtime or contract to
   fulfill this need.
       1.11.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . Excludes all vehicles assigned to the SFS. Vehicle
       Maintenance Manager (VMM) has authority to change additional Periodic Maintenance
       and Inspection (PM&I) intervals (must be more stringent) based on mission requirements
       (i.e., summer rebuild, seasonal equipment, extreme high use,). All local changes will be
       in writing stating justification and included in the applicable vehicle record jacket.
   1.11.2. Vehicles used as static training aids (not operated on-base or public highways or for
   driver training) are exempt from scheduled maintenance. Also, vehicles such as mobile
   communication vans positioned in a semi-permanent or permanent site are exempt. Ensure
   vehicle is safe to operate before operating over public roads.
       1.11.2.1. Ensure training aids are on equipment account list.
   1.11.3. (Added-PACAF) . War Reserve Material (WRM) assets that are overdue scheduled
   maintenance intervals will have an active work order opened on the first day of the month
   after they become overdue. The work order will remain open until all discrepancies affecting
   the safe and serviceable operation of the vehicle are corrected. Note: Vehicles placed in deep
   storage using Vapor-phased Corrosion Inhibitor (VpCI) technology will have scheduled
   maintenance intervals adjusted IAW procedures outlined in PACAF Handbook 24-3,
   Preservation and Storage of War Reserve Material Vehicles and Equipment.
   1.11.4. (Added-PACAF) . Crane Inspection.
       1.11.4.1. (Added-PACAF) . In addition to inspection criteria in T.O. 36-1-191 and
       vehicle manufacturer T.O., cranes will be inspected IAW AFOSH Standard 91-46,
       paragraph 8.2.4.4.
       1.11.4.2. (Added-PACAF) . Crane hooks will be inspected IAW vehicle manufacturer
       T.O. In the absence of guidance from the manufacturer, inspect IAW AFOSH Standard
       91-46, paragraph 9.4.1.1 and 9.4.1.2.
22                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        1.11.4.3. (Added-PACAF) . An annual nondestructive inspection (NDI) is required on
        all nuclear certified crane hooks IAW AFOSH Standard 91-46, paragraph 9.4.1.4. NDI
        lab results will be maintained in the vehicle historical record until a new test is
        conducted. The Vehicle Fleet Manager (VFM) or Vehicle Management Superintendent
        (VMS) can expand requirement to include non-nuclear certified crane hooks.
1.12. Transient Vehicle and Equipment Maintenance. Provide maintenance priority to
transient vehicles according to their mission or circumstance. Note: The procedures for vehicle
operators to have work done on vehicles in-transit are in Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 24-
306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver.

Section 1C— Items of Special Interest

1.13. Alternative Fueled Vehicles (AFVs). The EPAct of 1992 (Public Law 102-486), Title
VII of EPAct of 2005, (Public Law 109-58) and Executive Order (EO) 13423 ―Strengthening
Federal Environmental. Energy and Transportation Management," signed 24 January 2007,
direct Federal agencies to acquire specific minimum levels of AFVs, mandates the use of
alternative fuels 100 percent of the time in AFVs when appropriate, requires increasing our
alternative fuels consumption by 10% a year through FY 2015 using FY2005 as the baseline,
requires reducing total consumption of petroleum products by 2% a year through 2015 using
FY2005 as the baseline and requires the use of plug in hybrids (PIH) when vehicles PIH vehicles
are commercially available at a cost reasonably comparable, on the basis of life-cycle cost, to
non PIH vehicles. These mandates were established to improve the Nation’s air quality and
reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Our national strategy is to create a Federal fleet which
drives the country to commercialize AFVs and the infrastructure to support them. Department of
Defense Instruction (DODI) 4715.4, Pollution Prevention, 7 Jun 98, further requires that the
Secretaries of the Military Departments establish programs to purchase and operate AFVs IAW
EPAct.
     1.13.1. Acquisition. EPAct specifically applies to general purpose Light Duty Vehicles
     (LDVs) (less than or equal to 8,500 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)) based in
     Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) (cities, counties, or consolidated areas with a 1980
     population of more than 250,000). AFV requirements for each MSA installation in a given
     Fiscal Year (FY) are calculated by multiplying the number of LDVs procured (new
     acquisitions and long-term leases) times the EPAct percentage required for that FY. 75
     percent of all MSA-based LDVs acquired each year must be AFVs. Note: The Energy
     Conservation and Reauthorization Act of 1998 amended EPAct of 1992 to allow one AFV
     acquisition credit for every 450 gallons of pure biodiesel (B100) and one credit for every
     2,250 gallons of blended biodiesel that consists of 20 percent biodiesel (B20) fuel consumed
     in vehicles over 8,500 pounds GVW rating. ―Biodiesel credits‖ may fulfill up to 50 percent
     of our agency’s vehicle acquisition EPAct requirements.
        1.13.1.1. Exemptions. Section 303(b) (3) of EPAct of 1992 exempts most law
        enforcement vehicles, emergency vehicles and vehicles used for military purposes
        (exempt for national security reasons) from AFV acquisition requirements. VEMSO will
        serve as the clearinghouse for exemption requests, exemption data collection and
        exemption reporting. The following instructions are based on Deputy under Secretary of
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       23


     Defense (Environmental Security) memo, Guidance for Claiming Exemptions from the
     AFV Requirements of the EPAct of 23 Oct 97.
        1.13.1.1.1. A law enforcement vehicle may be:
           1.13.1.1.1.1. Any vehicle which is (1) specifically approved in an agency’s
           appropriation act for use in apprehension, pursuit, patrol or protection, or is
           routinely used for other law enforcement activities such as surveillance, or (2)
           covered by the current version of Item 17 or Item 17A, Federal Standard Number
           122, published by GSA.
           1.13.1.1.1.2. A leased vehicle equipped with at least the following components
           (1) for passenger automobiles, heavy-duty electrical, cooling and suspension
           systems, and at least the next more powerful engine than is standard for the
           automobile concerned, or (2) for light trucks, emergency warning lights or
           identification or markings such as ―police‖.
           1.13.1.1.1.3. An unmarked vehicle which is certified by the Secretary of the Air
           Force (SECAF) as essential for the safe and efficient performance of intelligence,
           counterintelligence, protective or other law enforcement duties.
        1.13.1.1.2. An emergency vehicle is any vehicle that is legally authorized by a
        government authority to exceed the speed limit to transport people and/or equipment
        to and from a situation in which speed is required to save lives or property, such as a
        rescue vehicle, fire truck or ambulance.
        1.13.1.1.3. Vehicles used for military purposes (exempt for national security
        reasons):
           1.13.1.1.3.1. Vehicles defined as ―tactical vehicles‖ are automatically exempt
           from EPAct AFV requirements and a national security exemption need not be
           claimed for them. LDVs similar to those driven by the general public are also
           automatically exempt as tactical vehicles if the vehicles have been modified (such
           as the addition of a 24-volt electrical system) to meet military specifications,
           unless the vehicle is normally used as an administrative vehicle.
           1.13.1.1.3.2. Administrative vehicles that may have to be deployed as part of a
           military operation will not automatically receive a national security exemption.
           Many vehicles can operate on alternative fuel when performing their
           administrative missions at home station and operate on a petroleum-based fuel
           when deployed as part of a military operation. A national security exemption
           should be claimed for such a vehicle only when there is substantial possibility that
           the vehicle will be deployed, and the vehicle could not be deployed if it was an
           AFV or the AFV attributes of the vehicle would negatively affect performance of
           its mission when deployed.
        1.13.1.1.4. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs are encouraged to acquire
        alternative fueled law enforcement and emergency vehicles if such vehicles are
        capable of meeting mission requirements. Such AFVs will be counted as credits
        toward the total AFVs required under EPAct.
24                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        1.13.1.2. MAJCOM and installation Vehicle Management Staffs are responsible for
        requesting and prioritizing through the vehicle buy program the appropriate number of
        new Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) AFV purchases to meet annual EPAct and
        EO 13423 requirements. Any shortages in OEM AFV acquisitions should be
        compensated through additional AFV long-term leases.
            1.13.1.2.1. When purchasing new vehicles, all units must first consider AFVs or
            LSVs (see paragraph 1.26 regarding purchase of LSVs). When considering AFVs,
            the decision should be based on availability of alternative fuel infrastructure, either
            on-base or in the local area. After AFVs or LSVs, a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)
            should be the next consideration. The final choice should be a conventional vehicle
            (diesel is preferable if biodiesel (B20) is available locally). When purchasing diesel
            vehicles, B20 capable vehicles must be purchased when available. When an AFV,
            LSV or HEV is available to fill a vehicle authorization and a conventional vehicle is
            chosen instead, documented justification for choosing a conventional vehicle will be
            retained for the life of the vehicle.
            1.13.1.2.2. When leasing vehicles, MAJCOM and installation Vehicle Management
            Staffs are also responsible for ensuring that long-term lease requests (paragraph
            4.31) meet EPAct and EO 13423 requirements for each requesting base. In most
            cases, AFV leases will require funding from installation Operations and Maintenance
            (O&M) sources. (For information on GSA AFV leases contact GSA Fleet Services at
            gsafleet@gsa.gov).
        1.13.1.3. Once procured, AFVs count as credits toward EPAct requirements regardless
        of whether they are assigned to an MSA. Nevertheless, MAJCOM Vehicle Management
        Staffs are encouraged to assign AFVs where infrastructure is available or the AFVs can
        be used to leverage potential infrastructure.
        1.13.1.4. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs must consider the vehicle’s engine
        configuration, ensuring they acquire the vehicle with the best fuel economy that meets the
        organization's mission requirements.
     1.13.2. Description of different types of AFVs and Electric Vehicles (EV). The Air Force's
     AFVs, whether purchased or leased, are bi-fuel, flex-fuel or a dedicated alternative fueled
     vehicle, i.e. CNG, propane, E85, etc. Electric Vehicles can either be dedicated or hybrid
     technology.
        1.13.2.1. Bi-fuel AFVs have two mutually exclusive fuel systems and are designed to
        operate on either gasoline or an alternative fuel such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
        or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), also known as propane, using one fuel at a time.
        1.13.2.2. Flex-fuel AFVs are capable of using gasoline, and an alternative fuel such as
        E85 (85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline), or a mixture of gasoline and alternative
        fuel through the same tank/system.
        1.13.2.3. Dedicated AFVs are vehicles that operate solely on an alternative fuel.
        1.13.2.4. EVs operate solely from power stored in a system of batteries.
        1.13.2.5. Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) combine the benefits of gasoline or diesel
        engines and electric motors. HEVs can be configured to obtain different objectives, such
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            25


     as improved fuel economy, increased power or additional auxiliary power for electronic
     devices and power tools.
  1.13.3. Infrastructure. Funding for development of on-base alternative fuel infrastructure is
  limited. The EPAct of 2005 mandates that agencies arrange for fueling of AFVs at
  commercial, federally and/ or publicly accessible facilities to the maximum extent practical.
  If such a station exists or is planned, AFVs are required to use a station if it is located within
  5 miles or 15 minutes from the installation IAW DOD 4500.36R. Locating alternative fuels
  for any location can be done using the DOE Alternative Fuel Site Locator:
  http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/index.html.
     1.13.3.1. If a commercial station proves impractical in terms of fuel costs, vehicle wear
     and manpower, a very advantageous means of acquiring fueling capability is through:
         1.13.3.1.1. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) funded infrastructure.
             1.13.3.1.1.1. DLA’s Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) is responsible to
             fund for new fuels infrastructure holding fuel capitalized by the Defense Working
             Capital Fund IAW DODD 4140.25, DOD Management Policy for Energy
             Commodities and Related Services.
             1.13.3.1.1.2. Vehicle Management will identify fuel requirements to Fuels
             Management Flight (FMF) by grade, expected annual consumption and total
             vehicle fuel tank capacity.
             1.13.3.1.1.3. The FMF will analyze the base infrastructure and submit an AF
             Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, to Civil Engineering (CE)
             establishing the requirement for additional infrastructure based on the requirement
             for the total storage required by grade and type of fuel IAW Uniform Fire Code
             (UFC) 03-04-01.
             1.13.3.1.1.4. The CE will assess parking, traffic, tankage and dispensing
             equipment identified by the FMF IAW UFC 03-460-01, Design, Petroleum Fuel
             Facilities and CE guidance. The CE will prepare cost estimates and programming
             documentation for submission through the MAJCOM Fuel Office to Air Force
             Petroleum Office (AFPET) and the DESC IAW DESC programming guidance.
     1.13.3.2. Contractor-owned/maintained equipment agreement. Negotiating agreements
     with commercial fuel providers for alternative fuel stations can be complicated.
     Installations are encouraged to obtain access to commercial alternative fuel infrastructure
     through their own efforts if possible, but are advised to seek expert help from MAJCOM,
     WR-ALC and Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (AFCESA). Pitfalls that may
     be avoided through seeking expert help include disadvantageous agreements that require
     DOD to pay exorbitant fuel prices for long periods or agreements that provide for
     exorbitant penalties in the event that DOD installations fail to reach specified alternative
     fuel usage levels.
  1.13.4. Alternative Fuel Usage. EPAct of 2005 Section 701 dictates that all bi-/flex-fuel
  vehicles must use their designated alternative fuel 100 percent of the time or submit a waiver
  if unable to meet this requirement due to lack of alternative fuel infrastructure or
  unreasonably high cost of alternative fuel compared to gasoline. Once the Department of
26                                             AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     Energy establishes the policy for submitting waivers, the VEMSO will work with the
     affected MAJCOMs to submit the appropriate paperwork. If alternative fuel infrastructure is
     in place and the cost of alternative fuel is not unreasonably high then the bi-/flex-fuel vehicle
     must operate on the alternative fuel system 100 percent of the time.
        1.13.4.1. If an AF-owned or leased AFV is within 5 miles or 15 minutes one way from a
        commercial off base alternative fuel station, the alternative fuel will be used 100% of the
        time. If on base alternative fuel E85 is available, AFVs will use ethanol 100% of the
        time.
        1.13.4.2. If an installation has a nearby public or private alternative fuel station but no
        formal agreement has been established for its use, the installation will establish an
        economically advantageous use agreement, as described in paragraph 1.13.3.2
        1.13.4.3. If an AFV is frequently driven off-base for substantial distances, it should be
        refueled at alternative fuel stations to the greatest extent practical. Such vehicles should
        always be equipped with a regional map or directory of appropriate alternative fuel
        stations.
        1.13.4.4. If the only available alternative fuel is on the commercial market, a DoD Fleet
        Credit Card will have to be used to refuel Air Force owned vehicles. If this scenario
        becomes necessary, establish procedures to ensure the fuel is uploaded into OLVIMS as
        an off-base fuels transaction. If the appropriate alternative fuel is available on base, the
        Vehicle Identification Link (VIL) key shall be coded so only the alternative fuel can be
        utilized IAW paragraph 4.5.1
        1.13.4.5. MAJCOM Fleet managers shall immediately implement a plan to clearly and
        conspicuously identify all flexible fuel vehicles to vehicle operators.
            1.13.4.5.1. This could be accomplished through the use of a sticker affixed near the
            fuel gauge or fuel tank filler neck combined with a yellow fuel cap or other noticeable
            methods of indicating that the vehicle should be fueled with the appropriate
            alternative fuel whenever practical. Note: Procedures for identifying E-85 GSA
            leased vehicles are currently being staffed by GSA for release. Until then, any
            identification of GSA leased E-85 vehicles should be accomplished in a manner that
            will not damage the vehicle in order to avoid potential bill back costs when the
            vehicle is returned to GSA.
            1.13.4.5.2. Vehicles that have not submitted for waiver under the EPAct 2005,
            Section 701 shall also have a map in the vehicle that indicates the location of all
            available alternative fueling infrastructure within five miles or 15 minutes of their
            normal operating location. There are several sources for such maps, including:
            http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/stations/find_station.php.
            1.13.4.5.3. The fleet manager’s implementation plan shall also include training to all
            operators to ensure they understand the requirement to use the appropriate alternative
            fuel and shall clearly indicate that the price of the alternative fuel is not a factor in
            deciding to use it. Fleet managers will periodically check the data available to them to
            ensure this policy is being followed and conduct at least a semiannual assessment for
            sources of alternative fuels on the economy. For suggestions on how to track
            alternative fuel consumption, contact the VEMSO.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                              27


1.14. Biodiesel (B20).
   1.14.1. B20 is not an alternative fuel but is classified by the DESC as a special fuel and aids
   DOD agencies to automatically reduce their dependency on foreign oil by 20 percent. B20 is
   a fuel blend consisting of 20-volume percent biodiesel and 80-volume percent diesel fuel
   (grades DL1/DL2 or LS1/LS2) that can be used in lieu of diesel fuel in compression ignition
   engines. The use of B20 not only provides an automatic 20 percent fossil fuel reduction, it
   also reduces air emissions and gives us credit towards the EPAct 75 percent AFV acquisition
   mandate. One energy credit can be obtained by the use of 2,250 gallons of B20 in diesel
   engine driven vehicles weighing more than 8,500 pounds.
   1.14.2. The use of B20 is essential in the Air Force's efforts to reduce its dependency on
   foreign oil. Regardless of the warranty implications, the Air Force mandates that B20 be
   used to the maximum extent possible. If a warranty condition develops due to the use of B20,
   then report the failure via the Air Force Vehicle Management Neighborhood so failures can
   be tracked and trends analyzed. Be sure to coordinate your failure reports with the local fuels
   management activity to ensure that no problems exist with the quality of B20 at the refueling
   station. Warranty repair costs that are not covered by the dealer will be absorbed by the local
   vehicle management activity.
   1.14.3. Additional information on B20 can be found in TO 42B1-1-1, Fuels for USAF Piston
   and Turbine Support Equipment and Administrative Vehicles and HQ AFPET Fuels
   Technical Letter 08-1, Handling of B20 Biodiesel Fuel Products.
1.15. Budget Guidance and Procedures. Host-tenant agreements identify responsibilities of
the host and tenant. The host base VFM or VMS assigns the priorities and services detailed in the
agreement. See AFI 25-201 for details on development of host-tenant agreements and AFI 65-
601v1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, for budget and reimbursement guidance. Each month
Vehicle Management and Analysis (VM&A) forwards the ? RAD6C (? = site code) disk to
Accounting and Finance or Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to generate the
Motor Vehicle Reimburse/Refunds Billing List, PCN SH069-V12. This list shows all labor and
materials expended on each vehicle repaired. The VFM or VMS uses this report to verify
reimbursable and/or refundable expenses to be recouped. Normally military labor is not
reimbursable. Note: The VFM or VMS acts as a technical advisor when host-tenant agreements
are being made.
1.16. Environmental Program. AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, provides overall policy
guidance associated with the AF’s Environmental Quality Program. As stated in this policy
directive, ―The Air Force is committed to: Cleaning up environmental damage resulting from its
past activities; meeting all environmental standards applicable to its present operations; planning
its future activities to minimize environmental impacts; managing responsibly the irreplaceable
natural and cultural resources it holds in public trust; and eliminating pollution from its activities
wherever possible.‖ All AF functions are required to comply with the AF’s environmental
quality program and as such, Vehicle Management activities incur certain environmental
responsibilities, to include, but not limited to:
   1.16.1. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 deal
   with atmospheric pollution and are implemented at the federal, state and local level. The
   major areas of concern for Vehicle Management under this legislation are vehicle exhaust
28                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     emissions and ozone depleting chemicals such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)-12 air
     conditioning refrigerant.
        1.16.1.1. The 1990 CAAA, states with non-attainment areas for transportation-related
        pollutants are required to implement inspection and maintenance programs (see Title 40
        Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 51). The purpose of inspection and maintenance
        programs is to identify and assure the repair of, in-use vehicles that are emitting
        excessive pollutants. Federal fleet vehicles, except for military tactical vehicles, are
        subject to inspection and maintenance requirements. A military tactical vehicle is one
        designed or modified to military specifications to meet direct transportation support of
        combat, tactical or relief operations, or for training of personnel for such purposes.
            1.16.1.1.1. The VFM or VMS should cooperate with the state to test Federal fleet
            vehicles and submit applicable reports. Exclude military tactical vehicles and any
            other vehicles exempted under state law. These may include, for example, emergency
            vehicles, AFVs and certain newer model years.
        1.16.1.2. Title 40, Code of Regulation CFR, Part 82, Subpart B, establishes standards
        and requirements for servicing Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners (MVACs). This rule
        requires that only certified technicians, using certified equipment which has been
        registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) service or maintain MVACs.
        Obtain technician certification through one of several EPA-approved mechanics-testing
        and/or certifying programs. Proof of certification must be available on site at all times.
        CFC-134A is the only authorized refrigerant when servicing vehicles unless you have in-
        house recovered CFC-12 which you can use. If contract repairs are needed for a CFC-12
        system they MUST be converted to CFC-134A. If MVAC repairs require purchasing
        CFC-12 it MUST be converted to CFC-134A.
        1.16.1.3. Vehicle emission control devices are maintained and inspected according to
        technical directives, manufacturer’s recommendations, and federal, state, local or host
        nation laws. All Vehicle Management activities use a program of regularly scheduled
        diagnostic tests to make sure that all engines comply with manufacturer’s specifications.
        This test is usually done as part of the PM&I or when a major tune-up is accomplished.
        Inspect emission control devices when a vehicle is in for PM&I and see that the
        necessary work is done to ensure proper operation.
     1.16.2. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and EO 13423, legislate and
     implement pollution prevention, recycling of solid and liquid waste and affirmative
     procurement of environmentally preferable products (manufactured from recycled materials)
     and services.
        1.16.2.1. EO 13423 and RCRA Section 6002 also require procurement of re-refined oil
        and retread or post-consumer content tires during acquisition and routine maintenance of
        vehicles, to include AFVs. DOD policy dictates that the DLA automatically substitute re-
        refined oil when activities order certain grades of commercial oil. DOD activities
        purchasing oil from sources other than DLA must comply with the legal requirements to
        use re-refined oil and activities are reminded that the central supply system is the
        preferred method of purchasing supplies. Do not purchase or arrange for purchase of, any
        virgin motor oil when a re-refined alternative is readily available and meets vehicle
        manufacturer recommended performance standards. NOTE: Model year 2007 and newer
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        29


     diesel engines with new emissions requirements should use virgin API CJ-4 motor oil
     until it is available as a re-refined product.
     1.16.2.2. Approved re-refined oil, which can be used in most AF vehicles, will meet
     current American Petroleum Institute (API) standards, evidenced by the "Starburst"
     symbol on the container.
     1.16.2.3. The DLA will submit the aggregate AF volume and cost of re-refined oil for
     each reporting period. Units not purchasing oils through the DLA will account for
     quantity purchased and dollar amount expended for locally procured oils.
     1.16.2.4. Consistent with Executive Order 13101 and RCRA section 6962, in acquiring
     and maintaining motor vehicles, agencies shall acquire and use retread tires, when such
     products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards.
  1.16.3. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 established that pollution should be prevented
  or reduced at the source; that pollution which cannot be prevented should be recycled in an
  environmentally safe manner; that pollution which cannot be prevented or recycled should be
  treated in an environmentally safe manner; and that disposal or other release to the
  environment should be employed only as a last resort and conducted in an environmentally
  safe manner. Conduct vehicle management operations in keeping with this hierarchy of
  actions.
     1.16.3.1. IAW Section 6014 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation
     Equity Act (SAFETEA): A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) it is the responsibility of
     Federal Agencies to purchase recycled/reclaimed coolant where it meets their
     performance needs and is available. Units are required to recycle their antifreeze.
     Additionally, Vehicle Management will assist other units on base who do not have the
     capability to recycle antifreeze where possible. If antifreeze cannot be recycled, a waiver
     must be requested from AF/A4LE with justification, coordinated through the respective
     MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. Recycled/reclaimed antifreeze can only be
     purchased after existing supplies of recycled antifreeze are exhausted unless one of the
     three below exemptions applies.
         1.16.3.1.1. When the need for total antifreeze replacement is required or deemed
         necessary (IAW TO 36-1-191), units must purchase and/or utilize existing
         recycled/reclaimed antifreeze stocks. Note: Recycled/reclaimed antifreeze is not
         always compatible with existing virgin coolants and the coolant system must be
         completely drained and purged prior to the use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. Be
         sure to check manufacturer's specifications prior to adding or replacing
         recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. The only exceptions to the rule are:
            1.16.3.1.1.1. Using recycled/reclaimed antifreeze would void the warranty.
            However, recycled/reclaimed antifreeze may be used when it meets the
            manufacturer's specifications. Note:    After the warranty period expires
            recycled/reclaimed antifreeze MUST be used exclusively.
            1.16.3.1.1.2. Some heavy equipment manufacturers do not recommend the use of
            reclaimed engine coolants, particularly in engines meeting the new Tier II and
            Tier III emissions requirements, e.g., the Halverson loader coolant requirement
            prevents the use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze. Be sure to check manufacturer's
30                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


               specifications on the use of recycled/reclaimed antifreeze.
           1.16.3.1.2. The USAF will only use reclaimed engine coolant. The coolant must
           either be purchased as reclaimed or the unit must reclaim their own coolant. Virgin
           coolant is authorized for use if required by the manufacturer during the warranty
           period. If reclaimed coolant is unavailable the unit must have an approved waiver
           from VEMSO. DLA’s Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) sells both
           reclaimed and virgin engine coolant. DSCR requires that reclaimed engine coolant
           contain a minimum of 50 percent reclaimed ethylene glycol. DSCR offers reclaimed
           engine coolants containing either 100 percent reclaimed ethylene glycol or 60 percent
           and 50 percent blends of reclaimed and virgin ethylene glycol. As shown in Table
           1.1, Reclaimed Engine Coolant Available from DLA, each blend is available in 1-
           gallon, 5-gallon and 55-gallon drum packaging, for a total of nine stock items. These
           products can be used in administrative vehicles, construction and material handling
           vehicles and equipment, and military ground combat tactical vehicles and equipment.
           DSCR currently contracts with Leeder Automotive for reclaimed engine coolant.

           1.16.3.1.3. Units must track all recycled/reclaimed antifreeze consumed and cost for
           the entire FY and report data IAW paragraph 4.75.5
        1.16.3.2. Oil analysis is a method to monitor actual contamination of oil. It helps to
        prevent unnecessary oil changes by providing the user the capability to determine when
        oil changes are needed based on the oil’s actual condition, not on the length of time the
        oil has been used. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs have the authority to
        implement oil analysis programs for all or specific segments of their assigned vehicle
        fleets at their discretion. Oil analysis is considered a waste stream reduction tool. It may
        increase the Vehicle Management activity’s workload.
        1.16.3.3. Use base Hazardous Material Pharmacy (HAZMART), in accordance with AFI
        32-7086, Hazardous Material Management, and in consultation with the base HAZMAT
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        31


      Management Process Team, to the maximum extent practical as a means to reduce waste
      of bulk Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) when their shelf life expires. Within the
      framework of the pharmacy program, ensure vehicle management processes are
      authorized by the Hazardous Material Management Process (HMMP) Team in
      accordance with AFI 32-7086, to enable establishment of a set amount of HAZMAT
      needed to perform their operation and receive measured amounts of this material on an
      as-required basis; as well as to ensure Environmental Safety and Occupational Health
      (ESOH) controls are established. Note: Vehicle specific HAZMAT not managed by the
      HAZMART will be controlled IAW pharmacy practices.
      1.16.3.4. Follow local directives and laws when hazardous waste disposal is required.
      The VFM or VMS establish a CE-coordinated OI on pollution prevention and on
      hazardous waste management.
   1.16.4. Only lead-free wheel weights are authorized for purchase. Lead wheel weights will
   no longer be purchased and will be replaced with lead-free wheel weights through attrition.
   See Table 1.2 Lead-Free Wheel Weights Available Through the Supply System.
1.17. Prohibited Vehicle Management Activities. What the Vehicle Management Flight Must
Not Do:
   1.17.1. Do not service, repair or garage the following vehicles in an AF appropriated fund
   facility:
      1.17.1.1. Vehicles disposed of to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service
      (DRMS). Exception: CAP vehicles as outlined in AFPD 10-27, Civil Air Patrol.
      1.17.1.2. Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) or non-appropriated fund motor vehicles.
      Exception: National Forest Service vehicles.
      1.17.1.3. Leased vehicles. This applies to both GSA and commercial leased vehicles.
      Exception: Those Vehicle Management activities authorized by HQ USAF/A4LE (see
      paragraph 4.34.3).
   1.17.2. Do not use government owned tools, equipment or supplies purchased from
   appropriated funds to service or repair non-appropriated fund or private vehicles. Exception:
   Those authorized by HQ USAF/A4LE.
   1.17.3. Do not park POVs in the Vehicle Management compound. Exception: Written
   approval of the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) Commander or equivalent.
1.18. Productivity Measurement. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has issued guidance
(DOD 4500.36-R) to measure and monitor labor hour productivity within Vehicle Management
and Vehicle Operations activities for the following purposes:
   1.18.1. To support vehicle repair decisions and develop budgets at base-level.
   1.18.2. To determine the number of delayed work-hours attributed to lack of personnel
   available to work on vehicles when needed.
   1.18.3. To identify training needs, job performance evaluations, shop equipment, tools and
   facility upgrades.
32                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     1.18.4. To determine the management efficiency of individuals, work centers, management
     activities and MAJCOMs.
        1.18.4.1. (Added-PACAF) . All Japan and Korea bases will delete all civilian labor
        transactions before submitting the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management System
        (OLVIMS) accounting and finance data file for reimbursement. Only parts transactions
        will be reimbursed for bases in Japan and Korea.
     1.18.5. To determine if AF Vehicle Management personnel are being used efficiently.
1.19. Serviceability Standards. Minimum serviceability standards for day-to-day operations
are determined by the VFM or VMS based on his/her experience and applicable technical
reference. Ensure AF vehicles are maintained in safe and serviceable condition.
     1.19.1. The AF accepts the idea that as vehicles age a certain amount of wear and tear will
     occur and that AF vehicles will not be maintained in a like-new condition. Example: The
     condition of a vehicle in its 6th year of use is not comparable with the condition of a new
     vehicle. To be serviceable, a vehicle must first be safe and function as designed. Deficiencies
     affecting safety are not acceptable regardless of whether the vehicle is old or new.
     1.19.2. Judge serviceability using the following factors:
        1.19.2.1. Age and mileage of the vehicle.
        1.19.2.2. Requirement for the type of vehicle and job it is designed to do.
        1.19.2.3. Remaining service life.
        1.19.2.4. Value of use returned in comparison with the cost of needed repairs.
1.20. Vehicle Abuse and Accidents. Vehicle abuse is normally considered damage caused by
willful or negligent acts of improper operation or care. Vehicle accident is basically a result of a
collision. The LRS Commander or equivalent establishes local reporting procedures and these
procedures must be fully supported by all commanders to be totally effective. Using
organizations fund for costs associated with government owned, lease and rental, vehicle abuse
and/or accident damage. Note: Publish these implementing instructions at wing–level or
equivalents.
     1.20.1. All Vehicle Management O&M funds expended for vehicle accident and abuse repair
     costs, including contract cost, will be reimbursed to Vehicle Management by the owning
     organization, or the organization responsible for the damage if not the owner.
     1.20.2. Where responsibility cannot be determined, the owning organization will be
     responsible for reimbursement. The using organization investigates all damage not
     attributable to fair wear and tear IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
     Property. Vehicle Management notifies the applicable commander or equivalent, and Vehicle
     Control Officer (VCO) or Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Control Officer (VCNCO) of
     the unit involved, along with Base Legal, Finance and Safety Office (usually by form letter)
     as applicable.
     1.20.3. In the event of a government owned vehicle accident, include a copy of the accident
     report for the Base Safety Office’s use if available. Vehicle Management commences repair
     within a locally established time frame unless notified otherwise by the using organization or
     Report of Survey (ROS) investigating official. Note: If a government owned vehicle caused
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           33


   a fatality or was involved in a fatality or an accident with private property the Base Legal
   Office must release the vehicle before repairs commence.
   1.20.4. Incidents are classified as damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters,
   mechanical failures or other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe
   operation or adequate vehicle care during non-use. Cases of incidents may also include
   damage resulting from normal use for the vehicle’s intended purpose (e.g., snow removal or
   heavy construction work). Using organizations are not required to reimburse for damage
   caused by incidents.
1.21. Vehicle Fleet Categorization. The AF owned vehicle fleet consists of a multitude of
makes, models, manufacturers and types. In order to better articulate the relationship of different
vehicle types to the AF missions, the categories below are provided to capture this relationship.
   1.21.1. Sortie Generation. Vehicles in this category are flight line assets associated with
   direct mission support. Representative examples include: Aircraft refuelers, aircraft cargo
   loaders, tow tractors, etc.
   1.21.2. Sortie Sustainment. This vehicle set includes vehicles required to operate an air base
   or installation, such as air crew and troop carrying vehicles, crash rescue and fire fighting
   trucks, emergency response vehicles, sweepers, etc.
   1.21.3. Tactical Vehicles. Tactical vehicles include all vehicles procured as military design
   (M-series) assets.
   1.21.4. Material Handling Equipment (MHE). This category encompasses all 463L and
   MHE vehicles and vehicular equipment: Forklifts, rollerized trailers, container handlers, etc.
   1.21.5. Base Maintenance/Construction Equipment. Included are vehicles and vehicular
   equipment used primarily by CE in the construction, maintenance and upkeep of an air base
   or installation.
1.22. Vehicle Fleet Growth Policy The AF vehicle fleet represents a tremendous infrastructure
investment for the corporate AF. The vehicle buy program provides funding for programmatic
replacement of assets, but is not funded to purchase new requirements for vehicles. MAJCOM,
FOA and DRU logistical support staffs must closely scrutinize any request to increase the size of
their respective vehicle fleets. Requests to increase vehicle fleet size must be supported by a
verifiable mission change, e.g., Operational Plan (OPLAN), Provisional Plan (PPLAN), etc. The
functional community requesting additional vehicle authorizations will fund the initial purchase
of the vehicles, and advocate additional funding in the out-years of the Program Objective
Memorandum (POM) for increased vehicle buy replacement dollars. Any non-mission change
increase will be offset by adjustments to other vehicle authorizations to preclude an overall
increase in authorizations. All adjustments to authorization quantities must be approved by
AFELM VEMSO or other AF/A4LE designated enterprise management authority.
   1.22.1. Non-cataloged vehicle request. Prior to requesting cataloging action, MAJCOM,
   FOA and DRU logistical support staffs will consider offsets, current authorizations and right
   sizing of the vehicle requirement. Staffs will also coordinate with the appropriate Item
   Manager/Equipment Specialist to determine if there is an AF stock listed vehicle to satisfy
   the requirement. If a requirement for cataloging action still exists after completing the
   considerations and coordination above, staffs will submit an AF Form 601 with item
34                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     specifications and justification to VEMSO. VEMSO will review and submit approved
     requests to the AF Allowance Standard (AS) Manager for cataloging action and AS
     inclusion.
     1.22.2. (Added-PACAF) . Request to establish new vehicle authorizations without a
     verifiable/programmable HQ Air Force/MAJCOM directed mission change; e.g., Operation
     Plan (OPLAN), Programming Plan (PPLAN), etc. must include an offsetting decrease from
     other wing/command authorizations of equal procurement value. All authorization increase
     requests submitted due to a mission change must have the mission change documentation
     attached.
1.23. Vehicle Validation Visit (VVV). The AF vehicle fleet represents a significant investment
for the corporate AF. Validated vehicle authorizations define the overall AF requirement for
vehicles and must be periodically revalidated to ensure that installation vehicle needs are
economically being met, at the least possible cost. VEMSO is responsible for performing a VVV
of each fleet every 3 to 5 years depending on established trigger points. Responsibility for VVVs
previously resided with the MAJCOM and it is anticipated there will be a 2 year transfer plan
implemented to migrate this requirement and its associated cost to VEMSO.
1.24. VEMSO. VEMSO acts as an adjunct staff to all the MAJCOM Vehicle Management
Staffs. VEMSO is responsible for all data collection and draft report generation required above
the MAJCOM-level. While they are responsible for the data collection and draft report
generation, each MAJCOM finalizes their own written narrative to those reports as required.
Responsibilities and procedures for VEMSO are provided in Chapter 8.
1.25. Wartime Readiness. It is AF policy to have motor vehicles, manpower, tools, facilities,
and shop equipment on hand to support the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).
Contingency operations are addressed in Chapter 2.
1.26. LSV. Each Air Logistics Center (ALC), MAJCOM, Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) and
base LRS will have the same ―cradle to grave‖ management of LSV as they do with the
conventional fleet. MAJCOMs, DRUs and the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW)
residing on military installations will replace existing general-purpose assets to the greatest
extent possible with LSVs. The goal is to replace 30 percent or more of all applicable LDVs
with more fuel efficient LSVs by FY 2012. However, all echelons are highly encouraged to
seize additional opportunities wherever possible. This will be a Unit Compliance Inspection
(UCI) checklist item to ensure enforcement of this new procurement policy. See Table 1.4 for
the new categories and applicable NSNs.

   1.26.1. For those LSVs purchased with unit funds prior to June 2006, organizations may
   continue to manage these assets as equipment, in which case they will be considered non-
   Registered Equipment Management System (REMS) reportable LSVs. However, if the
   owning organizations currently have vacant authorizations, the Base Fleet Manager will
   consider filling the authorizations with the available non-REMS reportable LSVs. The Base
   Fleet Manager and the owning organization’s VCO or VCNCO will coordinate these actions.
   1.26.2. The WR-ALC (580 CBSS) reclassified LSVs from ―equipment‖ to ―registered
   vehicles‖ to include creation of new NSNs for the seven sub-categories listed in Table 1.4
   LSVs are identified as budget code ―V‖ and classified as centrally procured vehicles, thus
   removing these assets from ASC 036 to 019. The current AF vehicle acquisition process
   now includes the procurement of these assets. Wings and bases are no longer authorized to
   purchase LSVs without first coordinating through the respective base-level and then
   MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs
      1.26.2.1. All conventional vehicle authorizations will be scrutinized to determine
      potential candidates for conversion to LSVs. Unit mission requirements and past
      utilization will be the key indicators along with the VFM/VMS recommendations
      when vehicle replacement decisions are made.
      1.26.2.2. Base/unit level Fleet Managers should use the following preferred approach
      when determining which general purpose vehicle authorizations can be converted to LSV
      authorizations. The goal is to convert 30 or more percent of the selected authorizations to
      LSVs.
          1.26.2.2.1. Begin by identifying general purpose vehicles, by registration number
          that meet the following criteria:
               1.26.2.2.1.1. Vehicle management codes B168, B170, B176, B178, B180, B200,
               B204, B211 or B227
               1.26.2.2.1.2. - Driven 7.5K miles or less over the past 12 months
               1.26.2.2.1.3. Load capacity of 1.5T or less
               1.26.2.2.1.4. Assigned organization, user and support area is on-base
               1.26.2.2.1.5. Operates on roadways with 35MPH maximum speed limit and may
               occasionally cross roadways with higher speeds
               1.26.2.2.1.6. Vacant authorizations not previously identified for vehicle
               procurement in your annual vehicle buy submission NOTE: Exceptions should
               be made for first responder and primary C2 vehicle authorizations
36                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


            1.26.2.2.2. Once target list of authorizations has been developed, group them by
            organizations and schedule interviews with unit VCO/VCNCOs and flight Chief. It is
            imperative Fleet Managers discuss changes with the units that will receive the LSVs.
            1.26.2.2.3. When conducting interviews, be sure to share the following with the unit
            representatives:
               1.26.2.2.3.1. In most cases, LSVs cost nearly 20 to 50% less to purchase than GP
               counterparts.
               1.26.2.2.3.2. LSVs get almost double the fuel economy of GP vehicles.
               1.26.2.2.3.3. LSVs are very economical to maintain and are reliable assets.
               1.26.2.2.3.4. LSVs are governed at 25MPH by federal law.
               1.26.2.2.3.5. LSVs meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety standards.
               1.26.2.2.3.6. LSVs are bare bones mission support assets with limited comfort
               elements such as extensive leg room or power steering.
            1.26.2.2.4. Once interviews are completed and a minimum of 30% of the
            authorizations from the management code list above have been identified for
            conversion, forward the results and authorization change request to your respective
            MAJCOM.
            1.26.2.2.5. MAJCOMs should publish instructions to ensure the changes are reflected
            in the FY08 vehicle buy program submission.
        1.26.2.3. WR-ALC centrally procures all LSVs and LSV management and maintenance
        is the responsibility of the local Vehicle Management Flight. All aspects of maintenance
        on non-REMS reportable LSVs will remain the responsibility of owning organizations.
1.27. Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) Authorizations. The following paragraphs establish Air
Force policy regarding SUV Authorizations.
     1.27.1. DOD 4500.36-R and this AFI requires we authorize only the minimum number and
     minimum size vehicles to meet mission needs.
     1.27.2. Conversion of any type of vehicle authorization to an SUV will not be approved to
     support AFV initiatives or to meet mandated fossil fuel acquisition requirements.
     1.27.3. Average purchase cost for an SUV is $7K higher than a sedan/station wagon and
     GSA lease cost is $1.6K more annually.
     1.27.4. SUVs are ―gas guzzlers‖ and each authorization awarded detracts from compliance
     with EO 13423 and EPAct 2005 guidance to reduce fossil fuel consumption.
     1.27.5. Sedans have historically provided adequate mission support for key operations and
     senior leaders. Example, MSG/CC On-Scene Commander (OSC) duties/responsibilities do
     not justify an SUV authorization.
     1.27.6. An occasional need for 4X4 capability does not support an upgrade to a fulltime
     SUV authorization (OSC duties considered here).
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       37


   1.27.7. Public perception: a vehicle authorization upgrade or conversion to SUV for senior
   leaders and group commanders can easily be viewed as a perk associated with rank or
   position.
   1.27.8. If a verifiable mission requirement warrants conversion to an SUV authorization then
   the SUV size will be limited to the minimum body size and maximum fuel efficiency.
   MAJCOM Fleet Managers must adhere to the maximum Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)
   restrictions listed in Table 1.3, Sedan to SUV Conversion. Note: MAJCOMs will identify
   SUV authorization, user assignment and utilization as UCI checklist item(s).
   1.27.9. For positions in the ranks of Lieutenant General and below, SUVs, minivans or
   crossovers will not exceed 5,400 lbs GVW. In addition, sedans will be limited to compact
   size as per Federal Regulations. Exceptions to this policy are limited. Medium sized SUVs
   and crossovers (GVW of 5,401 – 6,799 lbs) require SECAF approval before acquisition or
   lease is allowed. Large SUVs and crossovers (GVW of 6,800 lbs or higher) are strictly
   reserved for SECDEF, Service Secretaries and Four Star Officers. Note: Per SECAF
   memorandum dated 27 Mar 2009, the AF/A4/7 has been delegated the authority for Class III
   exceptions to policy.

                                           Chapter 2

              VEHICLE MANAGEMENT CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS

Section 2A— General Information

2.1. Introduction. This chapter establishes instructions for VFMs and VMSs tasked with a
deployment mission, Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) responsibility, War Reserve
Material (WRM) management, command levy contingency shipment and/or supporting Military
Operations Other Than War (MOOTW). Provisions of this chapter apply to steady state,
transition to surge, Major Theater War (MTW) and reconstitution operations. All Vehicle
Management personnel, regardless of rank, will be familiar with the contents of this chapter.
   2.1.1. This chapter is designed to be used in concert with AFH 24-320, Expeditionary
   Vehicle Management. This chapter contains guidance primarily for use prior to deployment
   and the handbook contains guidance for use during deployment. The handbook provides
   Vehicle Management specific information for combat environment operations and is
   designed to assist deployed Vehicle Management personnel of all grades to establish and
   operate shops in a contingency environment. Its use is mandatory.
2.2. AEF Process Overview. The AEF process is based on a 20-month rotation cycle. The
cycle is designed to allow for training, preparation and on-call deployment eligibility. The
process is designed to provide deployment predictability. Steady-State deployments equal the
capabilities of about two lead wings, one bomber group and associated units. The transition to
Surge Stage occurs when mission requirements start to exceed Steady State capabilities. Surge
may lead to the MTW phase if an established war plan is activated or if force requirements
exceed the amount contained in two full AEFs. Reconstitution is initiated after the MTW phase
ends. Reconstitution’s goal is to return forces and equipment to full Mission Capable (MC) as
soon as possible.

Section 2B— Overall Responsibilities

2.3. AF/A4RE. The AF will have sufficient motor vehicles, manpower, tools, facilities and
shop equipment on hand to support the USAF WMP, AEF operations and/or MOOTW.
   2.3.1. Adjudicate any vehicle sourcing reclama issues.
   2.3.2. Appoint specific MAJCOM A4, as determined by Area of Responsibility (AOR), as
   Point of Contact (POC) for logistical support for specific operation.
2.4. Air and Space Expeditionary Force Center (AEFC):
   2.4.1. Sources personnel after receiving OPLAN or AEF tasking request from parent
   MAJCOM.
   2.4.2. Adjusts or forwards personnel tasking shortfalls as appropriate.
2.5. WR-ALC
   2.5.1. Implements procedures to meet spare parts and TO shortfalls through emergency
   procurement actions to support surge and sustainment phases of contingency operations.
40                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        2.5.1.1. This does not relieve unit responsibility for maintaining duplicate, deployable
        printed or electronic copies of TOs for WRM or Mobility (Use Code (UC) ―A‖ on
        Vehicle Authorization Listing (VAL)) tasked vehicles.
     2.5.2. Sources vehicles after receiving OPLAN or AEF tasking request from parent
     MAJCOM. WR-ALC will work closely with MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs to
     identify potential sources for MC vehicles. Note: Since WR-ALC is not a force provider,
     Air Combat Command (ACC), as the air component to Joint Force Commander (JFCOM),
     will manage the scheduling and sourcing of forces (including vehicles) to meet the
     Combatant Commander’s (COCOM’s) requirements through the AEFC. ACC/A4XV will
     work directly with WR-ALC to coordinate with other MAJCOMs, where necessary, to
     source required vehicle assets. The same process will be followed by other MAJCOMs who
     have air component/force provider responsibilities in their respective AOR.
     2.5.3. Adjusts or forwards vehicle tasking reclamas as appropriate.
2.6. VEMSO. Provides support necessary to equip expeditionary Vehicle Management forces
with the best tools, equipment, parts, maintenance techniques, policy and general support for
deployed operations. This support is accomplished through research of available commercial
products, development of parts kits, capture and formalization of deployment lessons learned,
and policy change recommendations.
     2.6.1. Tools and equipment will be specifically chosen for transportability (light weight,
     small size); ease of use in the field (power requirements, etc.); and overall
     necessity/practicality for the type of maintenance performed.
        2.6.1.1. VEMSO approved tools and equipment for deployment will be formalized into
        appropriate Unit Type Codes (UTCs) for AEF and contingency tasking.
     2.6.2. Develops vehicle parts support kits such as Temporary Mission Support Kits
     (TMSKs), Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSPs) and Contingency High Priority
     Mission Support Kits (CHPMSKs) to support Vehicle Management activities in an
     expeditionary, deployed environment.
        2.6.2.1. TMSKs, MRSPs and CHPMSKs will be standardized for AF use by vehicle
        make, model and type. A TMSK Library Link is located on the AF Vehicle Management
        Neighborhood Community of Practice (VM CoP), AF Portal website, for AF-wide use:
        https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AF-66.
     2.6.3. Researches and develops management techniques, procedures and guidance necessary
     to guide Vehicle Management operations in an expeditionary, deployed environment. Tips
     and lessons learned will be captured, developed and distributed to enhance knowledge level
     of personnel subject to deploy.
     2.6.4. Develops vehicle deployment condition standards to ensure maximum reliability in
     field conditions with minimal investment. Monitors condition of vehicles deployed through
     collection and dissemination of "lessons-learned" and other means to institutionalize
     readiness and maximize return on investment.
     2.6.5. Refer to Chapter 8 for additional VEMSO guidance.
2.7. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs:
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           41


  2.7.1. Develop supplemental guidance specific to theater-unique operations.
  2.7.2. Ensure Vehicle Management activities are equipped and trained to fulfill wartime and
  AEF mission requirements.
  2.7.3. Program for manpower, facilities, shop equipment, technical manuals and tools
  necessary to support organizational and intermediate management concepts for all vehicles
  committed to wartime and AEF missions.
  2.7.4. Participate in MRSP reviews and validations to ensure sufficient spare parts are
  available to support contingency operations for a minimum of 30 days. Specifically address
  spare parts support concept for initial and follow-on parts support to the theater of operations.
  2.7.5. Coordinate establishment of CHPMSKs with Materiel Management personnel.
  2.7.6. Manage WRM vehicle assets according to AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM)
  Program Guidance and Procedures, as supplemented.
  2.7.7. Contact WR-ALC for vehicle repair assistance above MAJCOM capability.
  2.7.8. Assign primary WRM vehicle management function within the headquarters.
  2.7.9. Establish minimum reporting requirements to identify on-hand vehicle assets and
  ensure shortages, vehicle MC rates and materiel management support problem areas are
  identified.
  2.7.10. MAJCOMs with host base responsibilities are required to provide Vehicle
  Management and spare parts support for inbound forces identified in OPLANs.
  2.7.11. MAJCOMs with host base responsibilities may direct Individual Toolkits (ITKs) for
  all Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) be left in place during rotations. If this happens, the
  host base and MAJCOM should notify inbound forces that ITKs are not required for that
  operating location.
  2.7.12. Where appropriate, tenant MAJCOMs assist the host MAJCOM to source their
  command’s vehicle-specific and peculiar spare parts. The host base Vehicle Management
  organization is responsible for follow-on spare parts support.
  2.7.13. Serve as Functional Area Managers (FAMs) on MAJCOM Crisis or Contingency
  Action Teams (CATs) or equivalent. Identify, source and track deployment actions. Provide
  personnel, vehicle and vehicle-related cargo In-Transit Visibility (ITV) to MAJCOM
  leadership as required. Refer to paragraph A2.2 for additional guidance.
  2.7.14. Contact WR-ALC for additional vehicle requirements to support OPLAN and AEF
  taskings.
  2.7.15. Adjust or forward vehicle tasking reclamas as appropriate.
  2.7.16. Transfer accountability for vehicles that have been deployed from home station. The
  shipping MAJCOM transfers vehicle accountability to the combatant MAJCOM. The

   2.8.15. Refer to VFM pre-contingency checklist, Figure A2.1, for guidance on thorough
   pre-deployment planning.

Section 2C— Steady-State Operations

2.9. Training:
   2.9.1. Repair Operations: Although difficult to predict the actual operating environment at a
   contingency location, it is possible to exercise personnel in a simulated or practice
   deployment. Personnel selected to fill AEF and mobility positions will receive annual
   refresher training at the unit level to ensure an adequate proficiency level is maintained.
      2.9.1.1. Deployable personnel need to be prepared for flexible operations under adverse
      conditions. They must also be well-trained in the use of all tools and shop equipment.
      2.9.1.2. Mandatory training must be completed on OLVIMS and Automated Fleet
      Information System (AFIS), metalworking, re-supply procedures and maintenance of
      unique deployed vehicles for personnel assigned to an upcoming AEF. Training
      completion will be documented on AF Form 1098. See Figure A2.4 for specific
      guidance.
   2.9.2. Contingency Environment: Operations in a contingency environment will expose
   vehicle maintainers to many situations and problems not encountered in normal peacetime
   operations. Personnel selected to fill AEF or mobility positions will receive annual refresher
   training at the unit level on basic survivability techniques.
      2.9.2.1. Examples include Air Base Survivability, Unexploded Ordnance procedures,
      Self-Aid/ Buddy Care, etc. Refer to AFMAN 10-2602; AFH 32-4014, Vol 4, USAF
      Ability to Survive and Operate Procedures in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC)
      Environment; and AFH 24-320 for additional training guidance.
2.10. WRM Vehicle Storage. WRM vehicles are authorized to bridge the gap between
peacetime and wartime requirements. These vehicles are authorized and maintained separately
from the active peacetime vehicle fleet and are normally preserved in storage. MAJCOMs
develop specific storage concepts for vehicles identified against OPLAN taskings.
44                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     2.10.1. Vehicles are stored in active (ready to roll) or inactive (deep stored) categories.
     MAJCOMs determine the mix of active and inactive stored vehicles. For basic planning, the
     following guidance applies:
        2.10.1.1. Active stored vehicles: Vehicles stored outdoors, under partial cover or
        vehicles required to support initial incoming forces are preserved to Level C as described
        in TO 36-1-191 or as specified by the MAJCOM.
        2.10.1.2. Inactive stored vehicles: Vehicles will be stored in an enclosed building and
        preserved to Level A storage as described in TO 36-1-191 or as prescribed by MAJCOM
        guidance. Note: Dense packing vehicles in an enclosed building does not constitute
        inactive storage.
        2.10.1.3. (Added-PACAF) . Additional guidance is published in PACAFH 24-3.
     2.10.2. Vehicles are controlled according to AFI 25-101, as supplemented.
     2.10.3. Accomplish lubrication at least every 18 months on active stored vehicles. An oil
     and filter change is accomplished every 3 years.
     2.10.4. WRM vehicles are rotated into the active peacetime fleet (where like-vehicle
     peacetime authorizations exist) to ensure equipment dependability/life cycle management
     and to equalize utilization.
     2.10.5. Develop a parking plan for each storage location.
     2.10.6. Fire extinguishers and chocks are mounted to or located in each vehicle, or
     positioned in the vehicle storage area.
     2.10.7. When inside storage cannot be provided, outside storage areas are well lit, have
     adequate drainage and are secured by a chain link or equivalent fence.
     2.10.8. Exceptions to Storage Policies. Fuel servicing, fire fighting, aircraft cargo loaders
     and certain other vehicles are equipped with systems that must be exercised more frequently.
     To the maximum extent practicable, fully exercise operational systems on these vehicles
     every 30 days.
2.11. WRM Manpower Determination. Vehicle Management and Manpower Office consider
the following factors when developing manpower requirements supporting vehicle storage:
     2.11.1. The quantity and complexity of vehicles to be stored (vehicle equivalents).
     2.11.2. The storage level (active storage requires more manpower than inactive storage).
     2.11.3. Frequency of inspection and the average amount of time required for each inspection.
     2.11.4. Age of the Fleet. Older vehicles may require more maintenance than pre-positioned
     new vehicles.
     2.11.5. The degree and frequency of vehicle fleet involvement in exercises (that is, used to
     support Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), intra-theater or local exercises).
     2.11.6. Rotation.   This will affect the number of Limited Technical Inspections (LTIs)
     required.
     2.11.7. If applicable, the amount of time required for vehicles to be placed in or removed
     from storage.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          45


   2.11.8. Hours of operational coverage, e.g., 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
   2.11.9. Material handling and surface movement of cargo to, from and between operating
   locations in support of surge and sustainment operations at bare base versus fixed facilities.
   2.11.10. Fleet size for management and dispersed locations.
   2.11.11. Contractor Operated Storage. Contractor operated storage is the AF Standard.
   Explore the use of military personnel only if local environment and political conditions
   prevent contract establishment. Vehicle Management and Manpower Office also consider
   manpower ceilings, contractor availability, cost, location, and duration of storage as
   governing factors. Assign technically competent (7-level personnel in AFSC 2T3) AF
   vehicle repair technicians as Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) and ensure QAP-specific
   training is provided. See Chapter 9 for additional information on QAP.
2.12. WRM Pre-Positioned Support. MAJCOMs identify the types of items and appropriate
quantities to develop WRM MRSP and TMSK. Spares for pre-positioned vehicles will be
identified, maintained and accounted for. Normally, MRSP and TMSK are designed to support
30 days of operations. Go to VM CoP for comprehensive TMSK content listings.
   2.12.1. Ensure MRSPs, TMSKs and CHPMSKs are adequate to support increased wartime
   usage. Each WRM vehicle identified for deployment to an un-established operating location
   will be equipped with an MRSP, TMSK or CHPMSK. An un-established operating location
   is defined as a base without bench/working stocks capable of supporting the out-loaded
   vehicle.
      2.12.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . Collocated Operating Base (COB) locations will ensure
      the development of TMSK lists identifying the types of items and appropriate quantities
      for the vehicle fleet.
      2.12.1.2. (Added-PACAF) . Mission Support Readiness Parts (MSRP) kits will only be
      initiated with the approval of PACAF/A4RV.

Section 2D— Transition to Surge/Deployment Preparation

2.13. Personnel:
   2.13.1. Closely review all deployment tasking MISCAPs and line remarks. Also, review
   AOR reporting instructions found on the AEFC web page under deployment requirements.
   Current MISCAP information can be obtained from the Unit Deployment Manager (UDM).
   Contact the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) for assistance if UDM is unavailable.
      2.13.1.1. The MISCAP describes the performance level required by the tasked UTC. The
      tasked unit is responsible for ensuring deploying personnel can meet all MISCAP
      requirements.
   2.13.2. If the unit cannot support the tasking, forward a shortfall request through appropriate
   channels immediately.
   2.13.3. Personnel with AFSCs 2T3X1, 2T3X2A, 2T3X2C, 2T3X5 and 2T370 will deploy
   with a complete ITK of standard and metric hand tools unless specifically directed to deviate
   by the host MAJCOM. ITK should also include any AFSC-specific tools required to fulfill
   MISCAP requirements. See Figure A2.6 for recommended items.
46                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        2.13.3.1. Personnel with AFSCs 2T370, 2T390 and 2T300 will deploy with publications
        and forms listed in Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3 Ensure all publications and forms are
        the most current versions. Electronic copies (floppy disc, CD, data stick, etc.) are
        preferable if computer support capable of reading media is confirmed.
     2.13.4. Personnel with AFSC 2T3X7 will deploy with an ITK consisting of laptop, all-in-one
     printer/ scanner/fax, 30 days of administrative office supplies and current versions of
     electronic publications and forms listed in Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3, unless specially
     authorized to deviate by host MAJCOM.
        2.13.4.1. The 2T3X7 ITK will consist of a functional, fully tested and modern laptop
        computer. Software will include current versions (AF standard) of Microsoft® (MS)
        Outlook®, Word®, Excel® and PowerPoint® as a minimum. Laptop will have internet,
        floppy disk and CD-RW/ DVD capability. It will be loaded with the most current and
        fully functional version of OLVIMS and AFIS. A compatible printer with extra ink or
        toner cartridges will accompany the VM&A laptop. Ensure laptop can read electronic
        publications. Laptop will be exercised before departure to ensure full capability. See
        Figure A2.7 for additional guidance.
        2.13.4.2. The deploying unit should send an in-use OLVIMS computer and printer.
        Replacement computers can be easily sourced for home station use. It is imperative the
        deploying members be able to establish and operate OLVIMS at the deployed location as
        soon as practical.
     2.13.5. Material Control personnel will deploy with an ITK for materiel control operations
     consisting of laptop, printer, fax machine, 30 days of administrative office supplies and
     current versions of electronic publications and forms listed in Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3,
     unless specially authorized to deviate by host MAJCOM.
        2.13.5.1. The ITK supporting materiel control will consist of a functional, fully tested
        and modern laptop computer. Software will include current versions (AF standard) of
        MS Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint as a minimum. Laptop will have internet,
        floppy disk and CD-RW/DVD capability and any appropriate software needed for
        conducting Materiel Control functions. A compatible printer with extra ink or toner
        cartridges will accompany the Materiel Control laptop. Ensure laptop can read electronic
        publications. Laptop will be exercised before departure to ensure full capability. See
        Figure A2.8 for additional guidance.
        2.13.5.2. The deploying unit should send an in-use Materiel Control computer, printer
        and supplies. Replacement items can be easily sourced to backfill for home station use. It
        is imperative the deploying members be able to establish and operate Materiel Control
        functions at the deployed location as soon as practical.
     2.13.6. ITKs will be limited to 70 pounds and 62 linear inches (length + width + height) to
     ensure commercial air transportation capability. Some domestic flights may have a 50-pound
     weight limit. Ensure excess baggage allowance is authorized on deploying member’s orders
     if the member is deploying with an ITK.
     2.13.7. The combatant MAJCOM may direct ITKs for all AFSCs to be left in place during
     rotations. If this happens, the combatant MAJCOM should notify inbound forces that ITKs
     are not required for that operating location.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           47


   2.13.8. Units are responsible for ensuring each deploying member has all required individual
   equipment. Items such as steel toe boots, safety glasses/goggles, reflective belts and hearing
   protection are mandatory. See Figure A2.5 for other mandatory and recommended items.
2.14. Command Levy Vehicle Tasking:
   2.14.1. MAJCOM forwards WR-ALC command levy request to tasked base. MAJCOM also
   provides shipping information based on TPFDD.
   2.14.2. Tasked units send reclama requests back to MAJCOM as soon as possible. This
   enables better decision-making and prevents short-notice taskings to the same or other units.
   2.14.3. Funding. Tasked units fund all costs to place vehicles into TO 36-1-191 plus
   condition and build TMSKs from their O&M budgets, unless otherwise provided in the
   shipping instructions. Units document and retain all expense data associated with the
   preparation of vehicles for shipment for possible reimbursement.
   2.14.4. Preparation for Shipment: Units ensure that only their best (newest/most serviceable
   and maintainable) vehicles are shipped to meet OPLAN, AEF or command levy shipment
   taskings. Rotate vehicles as necessary within the wing to satisfy home station priority needs.
   Leasing may be required. The following steps will be accomplished prior to vehicle
   shipment:
      2.14.4.1. Perform an LTI.
      2.14.4.2. Place vehicle in TO 36-1-191 plus condition. Repair or replace components
      and subassemblies, which do not meet TO 36-1-191 plus standards.
      2.14.4.3. Service vehicle fluid systems or perform PM&I and Special Inspections if due
      within 90 days of shipment date. Complete all Time Compliance Technical Orders
      (TCTO), Service Bulletins (SB), One-Time Inspections (OTI), Manufacturer Recalls and
      delayed maintenance prior to deployment. Contact the MAJCOM for guidance if unable
      to comply before the shipment date.
      2.14.4.4. Vehicle Historical Data. A copy of pertinent historical data is required along
      with a spare set of keys for the vehicle. Secure data and spare keys in cab or operator’s
      compartment for shipment. If shipped data and/or keys are not readily visible, identify
      location with a prominently placed label.
      2.14.4.5. Each tasked 60K-loader will deploy with one air transport configuration tool.
      2.14.4.6. When deploying aircraft refueling vehicles the losing organization will contact
      the gaining organization for specific fuel type, filters and/or additives used at the
      deployed location. LRSs will install appropriate filters prior to aircraft refuelers being
      shipped.
      2.14.4.7. Ensure each deployment-tasked vehicle deploys with an assembled spare
      wheel/tire, all applicable TOs , a complete TMSK, if required (see paragraph 2.15) and
      spare key(s). In addition, each commercially designed light and medium duty vehicle
      (see paragraph 1.1.2) and military designed prime mover must also be equipped with
      lug wrench(es), jack and jack handle.
      2.14.4.8. Ensure vehicle deployment TCNs are generated and tracked IAW guidance in
      paragraph 2.17
48                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


2.15. Pre-deployment Parts Kit Development:
     2.15.1. TMSKs:
        2.15.1.1. Each vehicle identified for deployment to an un-established operating location
        will be shipped with a TMSK. Vehicle-specific TMSK listings are available for
        download on the VM CoP. If a listing is not available on the website, download the
        template and refer to paragraph A2.4 for a list of items to include when building one.
        Provide a copy of the competed listing to VEMSO for posting on the VM CoP.
        2.15.1.2. Unless otherwise required by the MAJCOM, TMSKs are packages of common
        and high-use items developed and purchased for vehicle sustainment when no MRSP is
        available for this vehicle type. TMSKs are designed to sustain a vehicle operating in
        adverse conditions for 30 days.
        2.15.1.3. Kits are individually assembled, boxed, and shipped within the cab, trunk, and
        truck bed or on the forks of each vehicle, if physically possible. Kits will be packed in
        reusable cabinets for ease of inventory, access and security at the deployed location. If
        more than one vehicle of the same type is deploying to the same location, those kits can
        be consolidated into a larger kit. When consolidating kits, quantities and breadth of the
        kits should be increased. Each small general purpose vehicle and military designed prime
        mover needs to deploy with lug wrench(es), jack and jack handle so operators are self-
        sufficient to change out a spare tire; especially, in remote or hostile locations. This
        ensures availability of items if vehicles are redistributed, diverted or forward deployed.
        2.15.1.4. Every effort should be made to ensure the TMSK is affixed to the vehicle to
        prevent separation. If this is not feasible, consider placing the most critical items (TO
        and critical parts) in the cab or other vehicle compartments. Any over-sized kits should
        be shipped IAW paragraph 2.17.1.6 to ensure the kit arrives at the same location with
        the vehicle.
           2.15.1.4.1. If items shipped inside the vehicle are not readily visible (e.g., inside high
           reach or telephone maintenance truck compartments), identify location with a
           prominently placed label.
        2.15.1.5. Mobility (UC ―A‖ on VAL) and deployment-prone vehicles can have TMSKs
        pre-built if authorized by the MAJCOM. The unit will have emergency acquisition
        procedures in place for any kits that are not pre-assembled.
        2.15.1.6. Mark each TMSK exterior with vehicle make, model, registration number,
        shipping unit, gaining unit (if known) and shipping unit POC with Defense Switch
        Network (DSN) phone number. Each TMSK item inside the kit will be individually
        labeled with part number, NSN, description, vehicle type and model year.
        2.15.1.7. Ship current printed or electronic copy of TO and any other necessary technical
        data for maintenance with each vehicle, unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM.
        When several vehicles of the same make/model/type are deployed as a package, each
        vehicle should be accompanied with a complete TO set. This ensures availability of
        technical data if vehicle is redistributed, diverted or forward deployed. If a unit is tasked
        to deploy a vehicle and has only one TO for the vehicle, the unit ships that TO or a photo
        copy with the vehicle.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                     49


   2.15.2. MRSPs:
      2.15.2.1. Each mobility UC ―A‖ vehicle listed on the VAL should have an MRSP
      established if authorized by materiel management guidance or develop a TMSK list for
      each asset.
      2.15.2.2. Deploying units and MAJCOMs ensure that if an MRSP is authorized and built
      to support a number of vehicles, each vehicle deploys with its assigned MRSP in the
      event vehicles are shipped to separate locations. Ensure local materiel management
      personnel are notified when a vehicle with an MRSP is being deployed. If an MRSP is
      not available, develop a TMSK list for each tasked vehicle IAW paragraph 2.15.1
   2.15.3. CHPMSKs:
      2.15.3.1. CHPMSKs can be established to support mission-critical vehicles. CHPMSKs
      can provide lateral support to multiple bases. They should be developed and deployed to
      locations that can best serve the entire theater if possible. Kit consists of NSN items
      requested by owning/maintaining unit and approved by MAJCOM. The CHPMSK is
      maintained in the materiel management warehouse and is deployed with the vehicle.
      Ensure local materiel management personnel are notified when a vehicle with a
      CHPMSK is being deployed.
      2.15.3.2. Contact the applicable LSC and MAJCOM for additional guidance.
   2.15.4. (Added-PACAF) . Follow-on spare parts support will be provided from the
   deploying base or other commercial sources as necessary. Contact PACAF/A4RV for
   guidance upon vehicle deployment.
2.16. Tools and Equipment Deployment:
   2.16.1. VFMs and VMSs at all levels must be aware of their UTC taskings. This information
   is available from the UDM, base-level Readiness Flight or the MAJCOM Logistics Plans and
   Readiness function.
   2.16.2. Tasked units build and deploy tool and equipment kits from host Vehicle
   Management shops as necessary to meet wartime taskings. Figure A2.9 provides mandatory
   items for UTC UFMXK, Transportation Vehicle Management Support Kit. UTC UFMXK is
   designed to support Vehicle Management operations for 30 days.
   2.16.3. Transformers may be required for some overseas locations. Contact MAJCOM if
   specific guidance is required.
   2.16.4. Deliver kits in air transportable tool storage cabinets to facilitate shipping and
   secured storage at pre-positioned and contingency locations.
2.17. Vehicle Deployment:
   2.17.1. Process:
      2.17.1.1. No vehicle will be deployed from an installation without coordination through
      the host VM&A activity. Units deliver vehicles to Vehicle Management Customer
      Service Center (CSC) for an LTI to ensure suitability for deployment. The VFM, VMS
      or designated representative will inspect and approve each vehicle and documentation
      package prior to shipment to ensure suitability and compliance with TO 36-1-191.
50                                       AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     Unsuitable vehicles are either repaired or replaced with another vehicle. Note: VM&A
     will contact parent MAJCOM to validate unit directed vehicle shipments.
        2.17.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . All vehicles deployed to contingency locations will
        be shipped in ―T.O. 36-1-191‖ Plus condition (see PACAFH 24-3, Attachment 4).
     2.17.1.2. Upon satisfactory completion of LTI, VM&A prepares a deployment package
     consisting of: Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report; Waiver Card; DD Form
     518, Accident Identification Card; AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt; Standard
     Form (SF) 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report; copy of LTI; Vehicle Historical Record
     and DD Form 1348-1A. See paragraph A2.3 for more specific guidance.
        2.17.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . Ship a copy of the applicable T.O. with the
        deploying vehicle. Do not ship duplicate copies for like vehicles deploying to the
        same location.
     2.17.1.3. Prepped vehicles are delivered to the Cargo Deployment Function (CDF) or
     Traffic Management Flight (TMF) as directed by local policy. Vehicle Management may
     be responsible for transporting TMSKs if they are not affixed to the vehicle. The
     Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) should provide additional guidance on air and surface
     shipment standards and deploying unit UDM responsibilities.
     2.17.1.4. Any vehicle or equipment shipped against a TPFDD tasking will have a
     contingency TCN automatically generated from the Logistics Module (LOGMOD). The
     UDM or IDO should be able to determine if a vehicle is tasked against the TPFDD. The
     TCN for a TPFDD shipment will start with ―FF‖ if generated correctly.
        2.17.1.4.1. If LOGMOD is unavailable, use the following guidance to ensure correct
        TCNs have been manually generated: The TCN for each vehicle is built using the
        ULN from the TPFDD. Contingency TCNs are identified by ―$‖ symbols in the 7th
        and 8th position of the 17-character data element. Refer to DOD 4500.9-R, Defense
        Transportation Regulation, Part II, Cargo Movement, and Part III, Mobility, for
        additional guidance.
     2.17.1.5. Any vehicle or equipment not shipped against a TPFDD tasking will have a
     standard TCN created. Do not have a standard TCN created for a TPFDD-tasked vehicle
     shipment.
     2.17.1.6. Vehicle Management will closely coordinate with deploying unit UDM when
     the TMSK is not affixed to the vehicle. TMSKs shipped with, but not attached to,
     vehicles are moved as multi-piece shipments. Ensure they are correctly marked (i.e., item
     2 of 2) against shipment’s contingency TCN. Also, ensure the proper priority and
     Required Delivery Date (RDD) is assigned to all TMSKs that are shipped separately.
     This ensures the kit will arrive in time to support the vehicle.
     2.17.1.7. This data is entered into the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) or
     Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) and initiates ITV through the
     Global Transportation Network (GTN).
     2.17.1.8. Document and retain all TCNs for deploying vehicles and related cargo.
     Monitor all shipments and provide all data to MAJCOM and gaining unit.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         51


   2.17.2. Surface Movement: Do not move vehicles to sea port until contacted by Surface
   Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) with a call forward date. SDDC replaced
   Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) as of 1 Jan 04.
   2.17.3. MAJCOM staff tracks TPFDD deployment actions and operates MAJCOM CATs or
   equivalent. See paragraph A2.2 for specific guidance.
2.18. Home Station Survival. Deployment and AEF taskings can impact home station
operations beyond sustainability. The following paragraphs give VFMs and VMSs possible
options to mitigate the impact of heavy deployment taskings. Refer to the VM CoP for additional
survival tips and examples. Ensure leadership is informed and approves implementation of any
operational changes.
   2.18.1. Manpower:
       2.18.1.1. Augmentation. Explore the use of civilian over hires, or ANG and AFR
       backfills. Contact Base Civilian Personnel Office for guidance on civilian over hires.
       Contact nearest ANG or AFR base for possible augmentation. Also, contact MAJCOM
       POC for Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) support. Manning Assistance can
       also be requested through the MAJCOM. Requesting unit is responsible for funding
       Temporary Duty (TDY) costs. A contingency Emergency and Special Program (ESP)
       code may be available for reimbursement.
       2.18.1.2. Training. Prior to deployment, accelerate 3-level training while the majority of
       your trainers are still available. Compensate for reduced capability by training non-
       deploying members in critical shop operations. This should help maximize shop
       productivity during heavy deployment periods.
   2.18.2. Shop Operations:
       2.18.2.1. Develop and implement a vehicle parking plan. Identify serviceable, non-
       essential vehicles to be parked. Identification method could be from across the base,
       focused on deploying unit’s vehicle fleet, commander’s or equivalent’s option or by
       number/type of mechanics deployed. If the last option is selected, compute the total
       number of vehicle equivalents earned by the deploying mechanics, then park the proper
       fleet mix based on the total vehicle equivalents. Extensive coordination with base
       leadership must occur before implementing any type of parking plan. The following
       guidance should be used if a parking plan is implemented.
          2.18.2.1.1. The vehicles should be stored in a controlled and monitored environment.
          They should be parked for the duration of the deployment. A parking plan and map
          are recommended.
          2.18.2.1.2. Ensure parked vehicles are preserved to the appropriate storage level
          IAW TO 36-1-191.
          2.18.2.1.3. Do not cannibalize from parked vehicles. This will cause increased
          workload before vehicles can be returned to using organizations.
       2.18.2.2. Focus on quality of maintenance performed. Use the approved vehicle
       Minimum Essential Levels (MEL) and paragraph 3.29 as a gauge to develop
       maintenance priorities and establish in-house MC rate goals. Established goals should be
       thoroughly briefed and approved by the commander.
52                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        2.18.2.3. Contract Maintenance. Preplanning potential contract maintenance is crucial.
        Contact local Contracting Office to set up Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) or short-
        term maintenance contracts. Maximize use of ESP codes for funding support.
        2.18.2.4. ISSA. If available, contact local DOD components or government maintenance
        operations in your area. Discuss establishing an ISSA for Vehicle Management support
        during contingencies and/or AEF rotations. Ensure any ISSAs address AF unique
        requirements for priority, types of maintenance and quality of services.

Section 2E—Deployed Location Operations:

2.19. Handbooks:
     2.19.1. Personnel will deploy with and use AFH 24-320.
     2.19.2. Personnel will deploy with and use the Vehicle Maintenance Safety Handbook.
     2.19.3. Personnel will deploy with and use AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual.
2.20. VFM and VMS. After the initial phase of all contingencies, the deployed VFM and/or
VMS implements responsibilities outlined in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 of this instruction at the
deployed location. When the deployed LRS does not have a VFM or VMS assigned, the senior
ranking military member with AFSC 2T3XX assumes those duties.
2.21. Qualification Training. Initiate immediately if needed. The senior deployed 2T3XX
ensures personnel are qualified on available shop equipment, local safety procedures, emergency
response actions and assigned vehicle fleet.
2.22. Mission Critical Vehicle List. Each deployed Vehicle Management operation employs a
maintenance priority system which considers current battle conditions and requirements. The
deployed VFM or VMS assigns priorities as necessary.

2.23. Materiel Control. A Materiel Management Specialist (AFSC 2S0X1) may be assigned to
Vehicle Management to perform Materiel Control functions as specified in Chapter 5.
   2.23.1. Materiel Control personnel will follow standard supply procurement procedures and
   utilize the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) when procuring repair parts and supplies.
   Material Control personnel can also coordinate with the servicing Contracting Office to
   establish vehicle parts procurement via local purchase. Innovations in information
   technology, worldwide commercial delivery and government reforms have made internet
   parts sourcing through commercial vendors with BPAs and the Government Purchase Card
   (GPC) a viable alternative to traditional parts acquisition methods. Aggressive use should be
   made of commercial style transportation parts delivery alternatives.
   2.23.2. The combatant MAJCOM specifies how to accomplish follow-on spare parts support
   to the theater of operations. An LSC will be in place to support contingency operations.
   Other support systems will be identified in theater-unique supplements.
       2.23.2.1. The LSC Ground Support Flight provides service for Vehicle Management
       activities. They manage Mission Impaired Capability Awaiting Parts (MICAP) and NSN
       items. The LSC will also have a local purchase element to handle non-NSN requirements.
   2.23.3. Aggressively follow up with local ELRS Materiel Management function, NAF or
   combatant MAJCOM to establish contact with the appropriate LSC.
54                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     2.23.4. After initial deployment, vehicle parts support may be improved by establishing a
     CHPMSK. A CHPMSK is established through coordination with the LSC and approved at
     the parent MAJCOM-level.
        2.23.4.1. CHPMSKs support mission-critical vehicles and consist of parts requested by
        owning unit (after approval by combatant MAJCOM). Once established, they are stored
        at the deployed location in the LSC warehouse. Parts are issued when a supply demand is
        levied. LSC personnel automatically requisition replacements. CHPMSK requisitions
        receive a much higher priority than regular bench stock. CHPMSKs can provide lateral
        support to multiple bases. They should be developed and deployed to locations that can
        best serve the entire theater if possible.
        2.23.4.2. Contact local LSC personnel and combatant MAJCOM for additional guidance.
     2.23.5. Refer to AFH 24-320, for supply sources and additional guidance.
2.24. VM&A:
     2.24.1. A 2T3X7, or qualified vehicle maintenance technician, is responsible for AF Form
     1823/ 1823-1, (computer generated) Vehicle and Equipment Work Order, preparation and
     ensuring vehicle repairs are accomplished consistent with priorities established by the VFM
     or VMS.
     2.24.2. If a 2T3X7 is not available, use checklists in AFH 24-320 to establish and operate
     OLVIMS. Contact NAF or MAJCOM for additional assistance if required.
     2.24.3. All maintenance performed on vehicles requires documentation IAW procedures
     established by the combatant MAJCOM. OLVIMS is implemented and used as soon as
     practical, normally within 30 days. See Figure A2.2 and Figure A2.3 for publications, TO,
     and forms needed to operate at a deployed site.
        2.24.3.1. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicle management personnel will maintain hand written
        records until OLVIMS support is established. Every effort will be made to establish
        OLVIMS support at the earliest possible date. Upon implementation of OLVIMS, all
        data, previously hand written, will be entered into OLVIMS using the applicable dates.
     2.24.4. Establish a vehicle control point upon arrival at a forward operating location. The
     vehicle control point’s primary function is to establish and maintain accountability for the
     base vehicle fleet as soon as possible. Vehicle fleet size is controlled by AS 019 and/or
     vehicle sets identified in the ―Force Module Construct‖.
     2.24.5. Establish a VCO program. Generate VCO/VCNCO list with 24-hour contact
     information. Brief VCOs/VCNCOs (in mass or individually as mission permits) on official
     use, accident and abuse procedures, use of DD Form 518 and SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident
     Report, accountability, host nation/local use restrictions, weather/geographic related
     conditions, drivers license requirements, discrepancy reporting, add-on equipment requests,
     other vehicle management procedures, and vehicle related items listed in AFI 24-301,
     Vehicle Operations (mainly drivers license requirements), AFJMAN 24-306 and Chapter
     10.
     2.24.6. Ensure all fleet data is accurately entered into AFIS. AFIS is implemented and used
     as soon as practical, normally within 30 days. Reconcile AFIS with OLVIMS. Generate
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          55


   hand receipts for unit VCOs and/or VCNCOs to review and sign. A VAL may not exist but
   hand receipts are used to establish accountability.
   2.24.7. Create and maintain a tracking system for all commercial leased vehicles. At a
   minimum, the system will contain: License/tag number, lease date, lease length, using
   organization, monthly lease cost, monthly miles traveled, fuel consumption by fuel type,
   PM&I and Special Inspection intervals.
   2.24.8. Create a contingency vehicle MEL and Vehicle Priority Recall Listing (VPRL) if not
   already established. If both listings are already in place, review for accuracy and update if
   required. Route vehicle MEL and VPRL to Expeditionary MSG Commander for final
   approval. Brief vehicle MEL and VPRL purpose and procedures to VCOs and VCNCOs, and
   to Unit Commanders as needed.
   2.24.9. Destroyed/Contaminated Vehicle Replacement. Vehicles may be destroyed or
   rendered unusable by conventional, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons
   during combat operations. Rotate vehicles from lower to higher priority units to maintain
   base operations. Leasing may be required to fill shortages. Contact NAF or MAJCOM to
   obtain replacement vehicles if necessary. Note: Contaminated vehicles can be considered
   serviceable. Do not abandon or stop reporting items contaminated. Follow guidance in
   paragraph 2.30
2.25. Reporting Requirements. Host MAJCOMs and other AF agencies require information
for decisions necessary to support a deployed unit.
   2.25.1. During the deployment phase, report capability to NAF and MAJCOM weekly or as
   directed. Send information copies to the main operating base and tenant organizations.
   Ensure Vehicle Management personnel at NAF and MAJCOM are aware of Situation Report
   (SITREP) inputs.
      2.25.1.1. During the first 30 days, the following information is required at weekly
      intervals or as directed. It will be provided by classified message or e-mail to the
      combatant MAJCOM Commander, with information copies to the main operating base
      and tenant organizations.
      2.25.1.2. Total priority 1 and priority 2 vehicles assigned, total vehicle losses, and total
      vehicles Non Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) and Non Mission Capable Maintenance
      (NMCM).
      2.25.1.3. Facility, equipment, tools, technical data and part shortfalls.
      2.25.1.4. Personnel and skill shortages.
      2.25.1.5. For specific materiel management support difficulties requiring MAJCOM
      assistance, list vehicle registration number and type, part number, date parts ordered,
      requisition number, and status. MAJCOMs develop procedures for reporting vehicle
      status when repairs exceed local capability (including other military and contract
      sources).
   2.25.2. After the initial 30-day period, initiate reporting from AFIS. Required documents
   are: Ship, Salvage and Rotate Report; Newly Received Vehicle Report; and Host Base
   Transmit/Receive Report. Reports are due to the combatant MAJCOM No Later Than (NLT)
   the 10th of each month.
56                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     2.25.3. The combatant MAJCOM Commander establishes additional reporting requirements
     and timelines.
     2.25.4. Reports Control Symbol. MAJCOMs and other AF agencies assign a reports control
     symbol to recurring and one-time reporting requirements.
2.26. Facilities:
     2.26.1. Facilities at forward operating locations may consist of host nation buildings,
     expandable structures, tents, or other appropriate mobile units. Vehicle Management
     facilities support PM&I, Special Inspections, unscheduled and intermediate levels of
     maintenance. Care needs to be taken in planning to include ample electrical service, wash
     facilities, exhaust ventilation, compressed air source and explosion-proof utility systems for
     refueling vehicle shops. For planning purposes, shop working areas must accommodate
     approximately 5 percent of the fleet at one time in addition to ancillary functions. Refer to
     AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, for exact space authorization.
     2.26.2. WRM mobile facility authorizations are outlined in AS 157 (Basic Expeditionary
     Airfield Resources (BEAR)) and AS 158 (Harvest Falcon).
        2.26.2.1. The Vehicle Management Facility is a component of the AS 157 BEAR
        Industrial Operations (B-IO) Set (UTC XFBRC) and a component of the AS 158 Harvest
        Falcon Industrial Operations (IO) Set (UTC XFBTD). It is designed specifically for
        Vehicle Management operations. It contains a large structure for repair operations and a
        smaller shelter for administrative support. The kit also comes with AM-2 matting for the
        large shelter only. VFMs or VMSs need to request and monitor shipment of UTC
        XFBRC in BEAR or UTC XFBTD in Harvest Falcon when operating at an austere
        location without dedicated repair facilities.
     2.26.3. Facilities should be accessible to the key functions supported, e.g., sortie-generating;
     consider placement of repair facilities in close proximity to flight line and Aerial Port
     Operations Center (ATOC). It may be necessary to establish dispersed Vehicle Management
     locations.
     2.26.4. A separate facility for refueling trucks is highly desired. Some contingency locations
     may not have the capability to establish a separate refueling maintenance facility. Those
     operating locations may be driven by necessity to combine with Vehicle Management
     operations. Combined maintenance operations can only be conducted under strict adherence
     to the following guidelines:
        2.26.4.1. Applies only to vehicles transporting diesel or Jet Propulsion (JP)-8.
        2.26.4.2. Properly train all assigned personnel in fuels management safety procedures.
        2.26.4.3. Maximum of one fuel truck inside shop at any time.
        2.26.4.4. Properly ground vehicle with ground reel IAW TO 00-25-172, Ground
        Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding.
        2.26.4.5. No smoking within 50 feet of vehicle or shop area.
        2.26.4.6. No spark or flame within 50 feet.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         57


       2.26.4.7. A truck or trailer mounted refueling system will not be opened inside the main
       shop. Repairs and service will be limited to the actual prime mover only (chassis,
       exterior, drive train, etc.). Refueling system repairs must be accomplished in designated
       area/shop and will not be accomplished inside a combined Vehicle Management shop.
       2.26.4.8. Drain refueling system fuel storage tank as much as possible prior to entering
       shop to reduce mass spill potential. If the storage tank/system cannot be drained, ensure
       fuel system is completely closed and there are no leaks before entering shop. Comply
       with all installation spill containment procedures.
2.27. Tools and Equipment:
   2.27.1. UTC UFMXK, Vehicle Management Support Kit, is designed to support
   maintenance operations at a bare base location in the 1-30 day range. It is a light, lean, air

from one forward operating location to new or captured bases. The unit may have minimal
response time to meet forward deployment taskings. New or captured bases will be operating
with minimal support functions. It is imperative that the best vehicles and equipment are forward
deployed. To ensure full MC; the following vehicle shipment standards apply:
   2.28.1. Perform an LTI and service all fluid systems. Vehicle must be safe and serviceable.
   Vehicle must be able to perform assigned mission with no or very minimal support. Vehicle
   will be shipped with an assembled spare wheel/tire and all applicable TOs. Commercially
   designed light and medium duty vehicles and military designed prime movers should be
   equipped with lug wrench(es), jack and jack handle.
   2.28.2. Assemble TMSK with 30-day supply of available working/bench stock items. If time
   permits, purchase any vital parts or supplies not readily available. Include TOs (may require
   copying manual or shipping only available copy). See paragraph 2.15 for TMSK shipment
   guidance.
   2.28.3. Secure OLVIMS data and spare keys in cab or operator’s compartment. Shipping
   base should maintain copy of historical data until gaining location accepts and loads vehicle.
   If shipped data and/ or keys are not readily visible, identify location with a prominently
   placed label.
   2.28.4. Contact NAF or MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs for guidance if unable to
   meet the above standards by the shipment deadline.

        3.10.38.2. When validated by losing MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff (losing and
        gaining MAJCOM when applicable), the losing unit, including contracted vehicle
        maintenance units, are obligated to reimburse gaining unit for unserviceable conditions
        and damage not caused by shipping.
     3.10.39. Stay abreast of all environmental matters associated with Vehicle Management.
     3.10.40. Promote safety, occupational health and fire prevention. As a minimum:
        3.10.40.1. Refer to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, for
        Vehicle Management safety standards, practices and procedures.
        3.10.40.2. Maintain an AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, for all
        assigned personnel as required by AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and
        Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program.
        3.10.40.3. Schedule meetings to discuss safety and hazards at least twice a year.
        3.10.40.4. Ensure surveys of shop noise levels, lighting, fume, and exhaust, paint booth
        and welding extraction systems are performed by the Base Bioenvironmental Engineering
        Section as required (i.e., quarterly, annual, etc.) by regulation, or whenever a major
        change in shop operations occurs that creates a hazardous condition.
        3.10.40.5. Ensure at least two people are in the work center when repairing vehicles.
        When repairs are required after duty hours and/or by mobile maintenance, a qualified
        operator for the type of vehicle being repaired satisfies the two-person requirement when
        the mechanic is a five skill-level or higher.

       checklist in the Vehicle Management Flight’s safety handbook and retain for 1 year. In
       addition, reference other applicable AFOSHSTDs as identified in AFOSHSTD 91-20.
   3.10.41. Prepare seasonal equipment for use at the start of the operating season. Any local
   procedures must comply with MAJCOM guidance.
   3.10.42. Ensure VM&A updates tenant units in OLVIMS annually with reimbursement
   distribution code 3 or 4.
       3.10.42.1. (Added-PACAF) .      Every effort should be made to ensure all
       reimbursements for vehicle management go directly back into the RC/CC from which
       they were expended.
3.11. Primary Responsibility for Vehicle Management. Vehicle Management provides the
AF with safe and serviceable motor vehicles, watercraft and railroad equipment to meet the war
fighter’s requirements. Vehicle Management is responsible for the management, repair and
accountability of the AF vehicle fleet.
   3.11.1. Organizations procuring non-REMS equipment (i.e., OGMVCs, All-Terrain Vehicles
   (ATVs), mowers, etc.) will coordinate with the VFM or VMS to ensure parts, facilities,
   manpower, funds, etc. are available to support the equipment prior to acquisition.
   Organizations must first consider purchasing a maintenance agreement to support the
   equipment. As a minimum, Vehicle Management will be reimbursed by owning
   organizations for O&M expenditures to equipment maintained by Vehicle Management.
   VM&A will load non-REMS equipment in OLVIMS as refundable/reimbursable (R/D Code
   3 or 4). For vehicle equivalents being calculated for manpower or funding, equivalents will
   be excluded for "X" registration equipment. Maintenance negotiated prior to the release of
   this publication for organizational equipment will be determined by the VFM or VMS for
   O&M reimbursement.
       3.11.1.1. When Vehicle Management is responsible for the non-registered item:
          3.11.1.1.1. Master records are loaded into OLVIMS.
          3.11.1.1.2. Vehicle equivalents are added according to the information in the "Help
          Function" in OLVIMS.
          3.11.1.1.3. Vehicle Management schedules all required inspections, to include PM&I
          and Special Inspections.
          3.11.1.1.4. Using organizations bring equipment to Vehicle Management for
          inspections or repair, or arrange for servicing by mobile maintenance. Information on
          gains or losses is provided to VM&A by the using organization. If units refuse or fail
          to comply with scheduled maintenance requirements for unit-purchased equipment,
          notify the unit VCO or VCNCO, Unit Commander or equivalent, and the host Base
          Safety Office in writing that the equipment is no longer considered safe to operate
          until maintenance requirements are met.
       3.11.1.2. Special tools designed for operator preventive maintenance shipped with a
       specific piece of equipment are transferred with the equipment to the using organization.
       3.11.1.3. Where no repair criterion is established by the Item Manager (IM), the one-
       time repair limit is the lesser of:
68                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


            3.11.1.3.1. 75 percent of the acquisition cost or.
            3.11.1.3.2. Multiply the replacement cost by two and divide the result by the
            expended age in years.
        3.11.1.4. Attachments that originally come with a vehicle or registered piece of
        equipment, for which Vehicle Management has prime responsibility, are maintained or
        replaced by Vehicle Management. If the using organization purchases additional
        attachments for the same vehicle or piece of equipment, it is the using organization's
        responsibility to maintain or replace them unless the VFM or VMS agrees to do so.
        Associated O&M costs are paid by the owning organization.
        3.11.1.5. Maintenance on major specialized systems mounted on standard vehicle chassis
        is the responsibility of the using organization. Specialized systems include, but are not
        limited to, communications equipment, munitions maintenance systems, environmental
        systems, special hoists and sensitive test equipment. Using organizations arrange for in-
        house or contract repair of the equipment. Vehicle Management is only responsible for
        maintaining the basic vehicle body, chassis and power train.
        3.11.1.6. Paint and mark vehicles following guidance in TO 36-1-191, Chapter 2.
        3.11.1.7. Use TO 36-1-191, Chapter 5 to determine the logistics supportability of
        obsolete vehicles. Perform an LTI and make a repair decision when logistics
        supportability is in question.
3.12. Assistance Responsibility for Vehicle Management. When requested, and when within
its capabilities, Vehicle Management will assist organizations owning the vehicles and
equipment listed in the "Help Function" of OLVIMS. Maintenance and parts support for this
equipment will be on a reimbursable basis if deemed necessary by the VFM or VMS. Note: If
recurring maintenance is done on any of these vehicles or equipment by Vehicle Management,
they will be loaded into OLVIMS using the management code in the "Help Function" of
OLVIMS. Scheduled maintenance dates, miles/hours/kilometers, etc., are loaded for all powered
equipment.
3.13. Organizational Responsibilities. Vehicle operators and using organizations are
responsible for and will perform at a minimum the following inspections, servicing, and
maintenance:
     3.13.1. Using the applicable AF Form (AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and
     Trouble Report or AF Form 1807, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report (Fuel
     Servicing)), using organizations will perform a vehicle serviceability/functional check of
     vehicles under their control at least weekly. Fire Trucks, Refuelers and 463L equipment will
     be checked daily, if used, or at least weekly. MAJCOM Vehicle Management staff may
     increase the frequency of serviceability/functional checks at their discretion.
        3.13.1.1. Check all fluid levels IAW applicable TOs. General-purpose vehicle operators
        will check and service fuel, engine oil, and the windshield washer reservoir. All other
        fluid levels, i.e., coolant, automatic transmission, power steering, brake and batteries are
        checked by the vehicle operators and reported to Vehicle Management for servicing when
        required. Vehicle Management checks manual transmissions and differential fluid levels
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        69


     at PM&I intervals. Additionally, for special purpose vehicles, vehicle operators check
     and service hydraulic fluid reservoirs on special units or attachments.
     3.13.1.2. Tire pressure checks/adjustments will be accomplished by the 10th of each
     month and documented on the applicable AF Form 1800 or 1807. Refer to Section 7B—
     Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report Forms for further guidance.
     3.13.1.3. Keep vehicles clean at all times to include the interior. Operators will not
     steam clean engines or engine compartments. Wash vehicles as needed and IAW TO 36-
     1-191, Table 6-3. Wax vehicles often enough with a manual application type wax to
     preserve the painted finish (prevent oxidation), but do not wax vehicles with flat or
     Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) finishes. Vehicle management will not
     accept dirty vehicles. If excessively dirty vehicles are towed in, the using organization
     should clean the vehicle prior to being accepted in the CSC.
     3.13.1.4. Keep tires properly inflated and change flat tires. Operators may request
     assistance from Vehicle Management for mounting and demounting outsized tires.
     3.13.1.5. Operators assist tire shop personnel in the removal and installation of tires on
     vehicles when vehicles are taken to Vehicle Management for tire-only repair work.
     3.13.1.6. Unit VCOs and VCNCOs ensure adequate assembled spare wheels/tires and
     tools are on hand to support their requirements. Spare wheel/tires received with new
     vehicles will be given to the using organization. If no spare is included with a vehicle as
     original equipment and a unit requires a spare, or if a unit requires more spares, then the
     unit purchases the initial requirement, and vehicle maintenance covers the cost of
     replacement tires after the original purchase.
     3.13.1.7. Tighten loose nuts, bolts and screws, replace light bulbs and windshield wiper
     blades.
     3.13.1.8. Special purpose vehicle operators purchase and replace wire ropes/cables on
     assigned vehicles so equipped. They will immediately notify VM&A of any wire
     rope/cable replacement and provide VM&A with copies of all certification paperwork.
     They also make adjustments to mechanisms affecting operating characteristics of the unit
     (for example, crane and dozer clutches and brakes, power control units, shoes, deflectors,
     etc). Inspect and grease vehicles as required by the TO or manual, and report any
     problems to vehicle management.
     3.13.1.9. Fire truck operators maintain and replace accessory fire fighting equipment
     such as power saws, air breathing apparatus, smoke extractors, ladders, portable fire
     extinguishers, pike poles, prying or cutting tools, nonattached hoses, rescue and first-aid
     equipment, and portable lights or lighting systems, even if they are shipped as part of the
     vehicle purchase.
     3.13.1.10. Medical personnel maintain and replace non-vehicular medical equipment
     such as life sustaining or support equipment, oxygen systems, rescue, and first-aid
     equipment, even if they are shipped as part of the vehicle purchase.
     3.13.1.11. Organizations assigned tracked vehicles procure and replace track shoes.
70                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        3.13.1.12. Base communications or contract maintenance (arranged for by the using
        organization) repairs two-way mission radio and intercom systems, even if they are
        shipped as part of the vehicle purchase.
        3.13.1.13. Maintenance of locally procured vehicle-mounted equipment and attachments
        costing under $10,000. Note: Organizations must coordinate with the VFM or VMS to
        make sure facilities and manpower are available to support any equipment before it is
        acquired. Associated O&M costs are paid by the owning organization. This topic will be
        briefed at VCO meetings.
        3.13.1.14. Include maintenance and parts publications in the request to locally purchase
        equipment to be supported by Vehicle Management. Send the publications to Vehicle
        Management after the equipment is received. The VFM or VMS do not assume
        management responsibility for locally purchased equipment without the necessary
        technical data if, in their opinion, inspection, servicing, adjustment or repair work cannot
        be performed properly.
        3.13.1.15. Buying jacks, jack handles, lug wrenches, wax, highway warning kits, spare
        tires, wheels, tire chains, fire extinguishers, wheel chocks, placards, shoring, dunnage,
        lubricants, lubrication equipment, starting fluid, windshield washer fluid, special tools,
        and accessories to meet operating requirements. Note: When equipment operators are
        responsible for lubricating equipment before and during use, Vehicle Management may
        advise operators regarding the lubricant to be used, tools needed and frequency of
        lubrication. The using organization procures required tools and lubricants, and is
        responsible for replacing equipment and special tools lost, worn or damaged beyond
        economical repair.
        3.13.1.16. (Added-PACAF) . Using organizations will accomplish initial or diagnostic
        weight testing after major organizational, intermediate, or contractor maintenance is
        performed on assigned cranes, in coordination with Vehicle Management. Using
        organizations will ensure annual weight testing of all nuclear-certified cranes, high-reach,
        derrick, or other boom-equipped vehicles with personnel baskets is accomplished.
        Coordinate with Vehicle Management when performing any weight tests on assigned
        vehicles. Refer to vehicle technical orders and AFOSH Standard 91-46, paragraph 8.2.4.
        for detailed requirements.
     3.13.2. Vehicle Discrepancies. Using organizations ensure delayed discrepancies do not
     affect the vehicle safety or mission. Refer to paragraph 4.10.1
        3.13.2.1. Vehicle operators record maintenance discrepancies as they perform
        inspections, or when discovered. Operators record discrepancies in the appropriate
        section of the applicable Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, to be reported
        to Vehicle Management within one normal workday.
        3.13.2.2. Operators do not delay discrepancy reporting on systems or devices adversely
        affecting the safety of personnel or the operation of vehicles/equipment. When any of the
        discrepancies listed below are identified, the operator will discontinue use of the vehicle
        and report the discrepancy to Vehicle Management as soon as possible. Note: If the
        discrepancy occurs outside Vehicle Management duty hours, discontinue vehicle use and
        notify Vehicle Management of the discrepancy the next duty day.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         71


          3.13.2.2.1. Tires or brakes.
          3.13.2.2.2. Steering mechanisms.
          3.13.2.2.3. Operating levers controlling power transmission, hoisting, dumping and
          tripping devices. Warning lights such as turn signals, brake lights, emergency and
          rotating flashers.
          3.13.2.2.4. Headlights, reflectors and clearance lights (unless the vehicle or
          equipment is not used during hours of darkness and restrictions are identified by a
          decal).
          3.13.2.2.5. Windshield wipers and defrosters (when weather conditions require them
          to be operated).
          3.13.2.2.6. Other similar safety and warning equipment and devices peculiar to
          special purpose units.
          3.13.2.2.7. Any other condition reasonably considered to be a safety hazard.
   3.13.3. CES Responsibilities. CE personnel will:
       3.13.3.1. Rewrap or change the broom, filter bags, skid plates and deflectors on all
       sweepers. Maintain correct adjustment of brooms, deflectors and caster wheels on all
       sweepers. Change the moldboard cutting edges and shoes on earth-moving and snow-
       removal equipment. Sharpen and change blades and deflectors on grass-cutting
       equipment. Conduct or arrange for weight and dielectric tests and provide documentation
       to VM&A. Replace wire ropes/cables on assigned equipment. They will immediately
       notify VM&A of any wire rope/cable replacement and provide VM&A with copies of all
       certification paperwork. The user and Materiel Management Flight ensure these
       requirements get requisitioning priorities according to the mission being supported. Note:
       The using organization funds for and buys these items and associated hardware such as
       nuts and bolts.
       3.13.3.2. Maintain installed equipment related to the normal CE function, such as stoves,
       refrigerators, heaters, air-conditioners, sanitary facilities, similar CE items mounted in
       government-owned trailers (including house trailers) and truck cargo compartments.
       3.13.3.3. Fund for and maintain real and non-real property equipment assigned on the CE
       Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) and tenant equipment assigned to CE

     3.14.1. Follow procedures in AFI 24-301, paragraph 8.21.
     3.14.2. Personnel will retain a copy of the most current completed and signed AF Form(s)
     171 when transferring to another unit and give to new supervisor.
     3.14.3. (DELETED) . NOTE: ―Maintenance Purposes Use Only‖ vehicle operator
     certification will not satisfy local law enforcement licensing requirements if vehicles are not
     properly licensed for off base/site use. Check with local law enforcement authorities to
     ensure compliance with local laws if vehicles are tested off base/site. All personnel who
     operate AF vehicles must have a valid AF Form 2293, USAF Motor Vehicle Operator
     Identification Card. Contractor employees must follow procedures in AFI 24-301, paragraph
     8.10.

Section 3C— Organization

3.15. Organization of Vehicle Management. Organize the Vehicle Management activity IAW
AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. Follow the guidance in AFI 38-101 if directed to contract
Vehicle Management (See Figure 3.1 for a typical shop organization chart). All Vehicle
Management functions are consolidated under the VFM and VMS. HQ USAF/A4LE is the
approval authority for requests to deviate from consolidation. Exception: Mobile units with
organic maintenance capability, having separate Vehicle Management facilities, sufficient
manpower and an organizational structure, usually including VM&A and Materiel Control,
maintain their own equipment when in garrison. These units may be consolidated under the
installation VFM; however, they do not require HQ USAF/A4LE approval to operate
independently.
3.16. Maintenance Work Centers. Establish work centers as focal points for the labor, parts,
and tools needed to do the job. Determine the number of work centers by the type and quantity of
vehicles to be serviced and the location of shop buildings. The work center supervisor is
responsible for all work done in the work center.
3.17. Administration Section. If applicable, the administration section performs administrative
functions as directed by the VFM or VMS.
3.18. Battery Service Center:
     3.18.1. Maintain an adequate stock of batteries to give quick service.
     3.18.2. Test, fill and charge all batteries.
     3.18.3. Keep all batteries under lock and key to prevent theft.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           73


Figure 3.1. Sample Vehicle Management Organization Chart.




Note :
*1. Except where approved by HQ USAF/A4LE, consolidate all Vehicle Management functions
under the VFM or VMS. Exception: Mobile units with organic maintenance capability.
2. The VFM or VMS typically establishes minor maintenance, lubrication, mobile maintenance,
tire repair and battery shop work centers under CSC.
3. The total number of work centers required depends on facilities, staffing and type of vehicles.
4. If needed, the VFM or VMS can place other work center supervisory responsibilities under
VM&A.
   3.18.4. Keep all assigned equipment, such as battery chargers, tools and safety equipment in
   good operating condition. Comply with all applicable safety standards.
   3.18.5. Use an AF Form 1827, Minor Maintenance Work Order, work order number J9998,
   to account for direct labor hours spent in battery servicing that cannot be accounted for
   against a specific vehicle (see Chapter 7 for documentation procedures).
   3.18.6. Refer to AFOSHSTDs 91-20, 91-66 and 91-501, Air Force Consolidated
   Occupational Safety Standard, for additional guidance.
3.19. CSC. CSC is the POC between the vehicle user and Vehicle Management. CSC
technicians debrief vehicle operators and perform incoming inspections on vehicles for the
purpose of determining maintenance requirements. Note: The VFM or VMS determines (in an
OI) the extent of completed work to be inspected, what types of repairs and services are
inspected, and by whom. The skill level of personnel, the vehicle complexity and critical mission
support are determining factors. Generally, all completed PM&I, steering and brake repairs
receive an outgoing inspection. The technician in charge of this section is well experienced in all
aspects of Vehicle Management. In this section, consideration of the needs of the using
organization is given to avoid unnecessary vehicle downtime and increase MC time by providing
74                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


service within the shortest turn-around time possible. Quality and service is the byword of this
section; it must be readily accessible and recognizable to the customer. VFM and VMS ensure
this section provides timely service. When necessary, personnel from other sections are used
during peak workload periods. Specific responsibilities of CSC include the following:
     3.19.1. Provide fast and dependable service to the user.
     3.19.2. Debrief vehicle operators.
     3.19.3. Verify malfunctions and perform a complete inspection using diagnostic test
     equipment when required. Use AF Form 4355, Vehicle Incoming Inspection, to document
     vehicle’s condition. Note: Using AF Form 4355 to validate vehicle’s safe operating
     condition, whenever a vehicle is turned in for maintenance or at least annually, will satisfy
     the annual safety inspection requirements listed in DOD 4500.36R.
     3.19.4. Determine if the malfunction is a result of suspected accident or abuse, and if so, take
     proper action. Waiver only non-essential work. Using the appropriate series Operator’s
     Inspection Guide and Trouble Report as a permanent waiver card is optional at the discretion
     of the VFM or VMS. Alternatives for tracking waivered items can be established through the
     use of a computer listing, card file index, etc.
        3.19.4.1. (Added-PACAF) . In the interest of standardization throughout the command,
        all vehicle management functions will use an Automated Waiver Program (AWP) or the
        appropriate 1800 series AFTO Form as a means of documenting permanently waivered
        items. If the AFTO Form is used, the words ―Permanent Waiver‖ will be written at the
        top of both the front and back of the AFTO Form to be used. ―X‖ out the AFTO Form
        from opposing corners on the front and back of the form. All markings on the outside of
        the form are accomplished in red. Only those individuals designated in writing by the
        VFM/VMSs are authorized to waiver maintenance. Personnel waivering maintenance
        must print and sign their names to all discrepancies for which they are waivering
        maintenance to include the date waivered. When using the automated program, quarterly
        updates will be provided to the unit Vehicle Control Officer (VCO).
     3.19.5. Delay work when necessary, only when safety defects are not involved and when
     deficiencies will not cause further damage to or problems with the vehicle. Complete
     delayed/deferred work as soon as is practical, i.e., parts are on hand and vehicle is in the
     shop.
     3.19.6. Perform minor maintenance as required. Portable test equipment and a small
     working/bench stock enhance the CSC operation. The CSC and outlying work centers use AF
     Form 1827 for repairs that take no more than 2 total labor hours time for all jobs required and
     requires only the installation of low-cost stock parts. Do not use the AF Form 1827 for
     PM&I, Special inspections, TCTOs, SBs and OTIs. The AF Form 1827 will not be used
     when the total repair time (including awaiting maintenance, awaiting parts and actual labor)
     exceeds 2 hours. A normal work order will be processed to capture NMC downtime
     exceeding the 2-hour limit. The AF Form 1827 will not be used to record multiple jobs on the
     same vehicle during the same repair time frame. Each line on the AF Form 1827 is
     interpreted as a separate work order in OLVIMS.
     3.19.7. Vehicle and Equipment Work Order and Vehicle Processing (Main Shop). When the
     vehicle operator reports to the CSC/shop with the vehicle inspection guide, the operator stays
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           75


   with the vehicle until the inspection and debriefing are complete. Operators will perform
   required operator care, to include interior and exterior cleanliness, before turning the vehicle
   over to the CSC. Processing steps essentially follow the pattern below (the VFM or VMS
   may adjust procedures for vehicle in-processing as necessary to meet local conditions and
   mission):
      3.19.7.1. Using the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form along with the
      AF Form 4355, the inspector makes a complete inspection to verify the vehicle's
      malfunctions, validate waived items and to ensure repairs that effect safe vehicle
      operation are addressed. CSC personnel use the proper diagnostic and test equipment to
      identify and isolate the malfunctions when required.
      3.19.7.2. The CSC determines if there are any delayed/deferred or scheduled inspections
      due. Install delayed parts that have been received, workload permitting.
      3.19.7.3. The CSC will initiate an AF Form 1823/1823-1 if the vehicle requires any one
      of the following:
          3.19.7.3.1. PM&I, Special Inspections, TCTO, SB or OTI are required/due.
          3.19.7.3.2. Repair action takes two or more hours to complete.
          3.19.7.3.3. Vehicle/equipment NMC downtime has been longer than two hours. See
          paragraph 3.31
          3.19.7.3.4. If required part used is other than low-cost bench/working stock.
      3.19.7.4. The CSC enters the actual/suspected malfunctions on the AF Form 4355, to
      include all tests that have been performed, and the direct labor-hours spent to perform the
      inspections and tests, and forward (and AF Form 1823/1823-1 if processed in the CSC) to
      VM&A.
      3.19.7.5. The "look phase" of PM&I, lubrications, and oil filter changes may best be
      performed by the CSC section. Enter labor-hours for this work on the AF Form
      1823/1823-1.
      3.19.7.6. The VFM or VMS determines which outgoing quality inspections will be done.
          3.19.7.6.1. (Added-PACAF) . As a minimum, 10% of all unscheduled maintenance
          and 100% of all PM&I’s, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), Service
          Bulletins as well as all other scheduled maintenance will have a Quality Control
          inspection conducted.
      3.19.7.7. Perform road tests as needed. Ensure road test locations are approved in
      advance through SFS and wing safety.
3.20. Lubrication Center:
   3.20.1. VFM or VMS may request adjustment of lubrication intervals, and engine oil and
   filter change intervals (PM&Is) when justified by local operational conditions. Changes to
   intervals in TO 36-1-191 are supported by written justification and approved by the
   MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff.
76                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     3.20.2. Inspect vehicles by the visual and feel method during lubrication. Report deficiencies
     noted during this inspection to VM&A. Assign a qualified technician to the lubrication work
     center to ensure the quality of inspections during the lubrication process.
3.21. Shop Facilities:
     3.21.1. The AF has a large investment in Vehicle Management shops because the majority of
     intermediate maintenance is done in these fixed facilities. Productivity is increased by using
     new methods and procedures to get the most out of personnel, tools and space. For example,
     to have good workflow, locate VM&A and the CSC in places that are easy for customers to
     reach. Ideally, related work centers are located close together.
     3.21.2. Use AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements, as a guide to compute total space
     needs to provide adequate facilities, to identify deficiencies in the shop, and as the basis to
     initiate corrective action.
     3.21.3. Send requests for real property construction, modification or changes to the CE on
     AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request.
     3.21.4. Send requests for maintenance or repair of real property facilities to the CE.
     3.21.5. Activities that do not have standard AF shops develop a plan to use the shop areas to
     gain the most efficiency and productivity. The VFM or VMS consider the following in their
     plans:
        3.21.5.1. Type, size and number of vehicles to be worked on.
        3.21.5.2. Type of work and service to be done.
        3.21.5.3. Time needed to do a job.
        3.21.5.4. Space required for each type of repair.
        3.21.5.5. Locations of water, air, electrical outlets and exhaust fume ventilators.
        3.21.5.6. Location of shop tools, such as hydraulic floor jacks, transmission jacks,
        portable lubrication equipment, etc.
        3.21.5.7. Locations of COPARS, VM&A, CSC and Materiel Control are as close to each
        other as possible. Be sure that the CSC section is easy for vehicle users to find.
        3.21.5.8. Size of the shop parking area.
        3.21.5.9. Location of vehicle publications.
3.22. Tire Repair Section:
     3.22.1. Repair all vehicle tires.
     3.22.2. Maintain all assigned tire repair and servicing equipment in a safe operating
     condition.
     3.22.3. Ensure strict compliance with safety standards.
     3.22.4. The vehicle operator has primary responsibility for removing and installing mounted
     tires; however, Vehicle Management personnel remove and install mounted tires once the
     vehicle has been accepted into the shop, unless it has been previously agreed upon that the
     operator will provide assistance.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          77


   3.22.5. Use an AF Form 1823/1823-1 to cost new or recapped tires that are put on vehicles
   (see Chapter 7 for documentation).
   3.22.6. Use an AF Form 1827, work order number J9998, to account for direct labor hours
   spent in tire repair that cannot be accounted for against a specific vehicle (see Chapter 7 for
   documentation).
   3.22.7. Personnel assigned to the Tire Shop will be thoroughly trained in all aspects of tire
   inspection and repair procedures. Document training certification in appropriate military and
   civilian training records. Copies of TOs 36-1-191 and 36Y32-1-142, Organizational, Direct
   Support, and General Support Maintenance Care, Maintenance and Repair of Pneumatic
   Tires and Inner Tubes, will be available in the Tire Shop. Personnel must be familiar with the
   instructions outlined in these publications. Exercise extreme caution when working with
   split-rim wheels. Refer to AFOSHSTD 91-20 for additional guidance.
3.23. Training Leader. The Vehicle Management Training Leader sets up and administers a
training program as outlined in Chapter 6 and AFI 36-2201 V3, Air Force Training Program
On The Job Training Administration.
3.24. VM&A. VM&A is the focal point for determining repairs and authorizing the expenditure
of manpower and material through the work centers. It is also the focal point for the movement
of vehicles and equipment to and from the work centers and for commercial contract repair
activities. VM&A ensures the efficient and economical operation of the base vehicle fleet.
VM&A oversees the Vehicle Control Program (VCP), Fleet Analysis and REMS functions.
Specific responsibilities are outlined in Chapter 4.
3.25. Work Center Supervisors. Are responsible for:
   3.25.1. Coordinating with VM&A to ensure priorities are met and maintenance tasks are
   completed on time.
   3.25.2. Assigning work to personnel commensurate with their skills.
   3.25.3. Ensuring that proper tools and equipment are readily available and serviceable, and
   that subordinate personnel are properly trained in their use. The supervisor reports shortages
   and deficient equipment to the VFM or VMS.
   3.25.4. Ensuring technicians comply with safety procedures and technical data. Note:
   Complying with technical data does not mean an open book reference for each repair task. It
   does require the technician to be familiar with the procedures for each job. Complex repair
   tasks, performance specifications, torque ratings, special tolerance adjustments and so forth,
   do require reference to technical data, and, in some cases, repeated reference at the job
   location. Technical data for vehicles or vehicular equipment, including nuclear certified
   assets, must be current. Any of the following data sources, in printed or digital form, are
   acceptable: TOs; commercial manuals, printed material, microfilm or software provided by
   or procured from the asset manufacturer; commercially procured after-market parts and
   repair manuals, such as Chilton® Manuals; or digitized technical data such as Mitchell1® or
   its equivalent.
   3.25.5. Inspecting incoming vehicles and equipment not processed through CSC. The
   supervisor coordinates with VM&A if additional repairs not listed on the AF Form
   1823/1823-1 are required and revises the Estimated Time In Commission (ETIC) as needed.
78                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     3.25.6. Inspecting repaired vehicles and equipment to ensure all vehicles are in a safe
     serviceable condition.
     3.25.7. Briefing newly assigned personnel.
     3.25.8. Assigning personnel to duty positions to ensure full use and progression
     opportunities.
     3.25.9. Determining the most efficient and economical means of returning vehicles to
     service. The supervisor will carefully consider the repair or replacement of individual
     assemblies or subassemblies and components to make effective use of resources. In addition,
     adhere to any safety and serviceability standards, and avoid ―over-maintaining‖ the vehicle.
     3.25.10. Informing VM&A of the requirement for more work so that maximum productivity
     may be obtained from assigned personnel.
     3.25.11. Checking with Materiel Control on parts requirements and availability.
     3.25.12. Accounting for labor hours for work center.
     3.25.13. Setting up training needs, sending training requirements to the VFM and VMS, and
     assisting in OJT.
     3.25.14. Ensuring parts received for vehicles during the work phase are properly protected
     and not improperly stored on the vehicle’s seat or other soft trim.
     3.25.15. Ensuring vehicles are properly prepared and maintained for storage when placed in
     NMCS status (see TO 36-1-191).
     3.25.16. (Added-PACAF) . All deadlined vehicles will be preserved at storage level ―C‖ as
     prescribed in T.O. 36-1-191, Chapter 8, Storage and Shipment, unless stored inside. All
     vehicles stored outside, exposed to the elements while awaiting parts, will be preserved in
     accordance with the above reference and inspected for condition every 30 days. Battery
     ground cables will be disconnected at the battery on vehicles down for parts longer than five
     days. All disassembled components are to be tagged and stored in such a manner as to
     prevent deterioration. A placard will be readily displayed on, or in, deadlined vehicles.
     Units will use the NMCS informational ―placard‖ produced by OLVIMS or a locally
     fabricated placard containing OLVIMS info at a minimum.

Section 3D—Principles

3.26. Cannibalization Rules. The VFM and VMS use cannibalization primarily to meet
mission goals. Cannibalization action is documented according to Chapter 7 and proper cost
accounting will be done.
     3.26.1. MAJCOM or WR-ALC may direct the repair of critical vehicles pending disposition.
     Cannibalization of the major components or assemblies of critical vehicles (as identified in
     the VMIF https://sevpgm.robins.af.mil/vehicle/vmif ) pending disposition instructions must
     be approved by the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff.
     3.26.2. The AFEMS (C001) provides an on-line query, with the exception management code
     ID (IIEM), to determine the vehicle criticality. A critical vehicle is identified by the
     exception management code ―C‖.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            79


   3.26.3. The VMIF also identifies vehicles as critical or non-critical.
3.27. Contract Operated Vehicle Management Activities. All Performance Based Work
Statements (PWS) for vehicle management should be performance-based. Vehicle management
functional managers at all levels should use AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Services
Acquisitions (PBSA) and this AFI (citing specific chapters and/or paragraphs) as the basis for
developing a performance-based PWS. Also, Chapter 9, Quality Assurance Personnel should be
reviewed for additional information concerning contract activities. Note: It is not mandatory to
rewrite PWS' completed prior to the publication of AFI 63-124, dated 1 Aug 05. However, once
those contracts expire, AFI 63-124 and its requirements will have to be followed when
developing new PWS’.
3.28. Deficiency, Warranty and Unsatisfactory Reporting. Reporting deficiencies, warranty
repairs and unsatisfactory conditions for vehicles and equipment is mandatory. See TOs 36-1-
191 and 00-35D-54 for policy and reporting procedures.
3.29. Maintenance Priorities. Each Vehicle Management activity applies priorities to support
the mission and customer needs. The MSG Commander or equivalent approves these priorities,
which are set as follows:
   3.29.1. MEL for vehicles are developed and verified each year between using organizations
   and the LRS. The MEL shows the number of vehicles, by authorized type, any substitutes,
   that can be in the shop at one time and not seriously affect the user's mission.
       3.29.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . A current Minimum Essential Level (MEL) list will be
       located in VM&A for reference. VM&A will notify the VFM/VMS when an
       organization’s MEL is exceeded. The automated MEL function in OLVIMS should not
       be used as the sole determinant for establishing RED priority maintenance for vehicles.
   3.29.2. The VFM and VMS review the vehicle MEL for maintenance priorities and for
   backfilling primary vehicles when vehicles are in Vehicle Management. Questions on the
   proposed vehicle MEL and any problems in maintaining the levels are resolved with the
   using organization before the final publication of the list. Normally, it is not possible to have
   100 percent of any vehicle type in an organization listed as MEL. Allowance must be made
   for scheduled maintenance, normal breakdowns, etc. The vehicle MEL is presented to the
   MSG Commander or equivalent for approval. This list serves as the vehicle maintenance
   priority repair list.
   3.29.3. Vehicle Management assigns a "routine" priority to all vehicles, regardless of type or
   use, unless one of the conditions in the following paragraph applies.
       3.29.3.1. Use a RED priority when one or more of these conditions exists:
           3.29.3.1.1. A unit is below the minimum essential vehicle level, further loss of
           vehicles will degrade mission support and other base assets cannot fulfill the need of
           a particular vehicle.
           3.29.3.1.2. A special project requires a certain type of vehicle in service.
           3.29.3.1.3. Severe weather or other natural circumstances create a need for certain
           types of vehicles.
80                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     3.29.4. Vehicle Management ensures that minimum essential vehicle levels and mission
     needs are met. This may require withdrawing vehicles from organizations currently above
     their MEL or with lower priorities. Within Vehicle Management, it may be necessary to
     consolidate the work force, work overtime, cannibalize parts, delay work or make temporary
     repairs to return priority vehicles to service.
     3.29.5. Installed emergency warning lights, military radios or other such accessories do not
     automatically cause a vehicle to be a higher priority. Like and possibly dissimilar vehicles
     without such accessories are generally sufficient to perform the mission until the equipped
     vehicle is returned to service.
     3.29.6. When a replacement vehicle is temporarily given to a user, the prime vehicle
     receives a routine maintenance priority.
3.30. Modification Policy. Process major modifications to vehicles and equipment as follows:
     3.30.1. Change configuration only when the customer needs cannot otherwise be met. Note:
     Secondary restraint systems (airbags) will not be disabled unless approved by the National
     Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). Wing-level, and MAJCOM
     Safety and Vehicle Management areas, prior to submission to the NHTSA, will validate
     requests for such action.
     3.30.2. Adding special equipment or a commercial optional part or accessory to meet certain
     operational needs is not considered a modification if the vehicle is still used for its original
     purpose. Requesting organizations send written add-on equipment justification to Vehicle
     Management. If approved, when workload and resources permit, Vehicle Management may
     elect to install these items. Requests to add special equipment (add-ons) to nuclear certified
     assets must be coordinated with Vehicle Management and Base Safety Office prior to
     installation IAW AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program. File
     written authorization to install equipment in the permanent portion of the vehicle record
     jacket. Comply with established safety standards when installing these items. Note: Using
     organizations budget for initial and replacement items, such as air conditioners, camper
     shells, hydraulic tailgate lifts, cargo covers, bed liners, light bars, radios and special
     equipment needed to meet special operational requirements. The using organization provides
     necessary funds for the installation of these items at the time of purchase. Likewise, the using
     organization funds for damages from installation of such items when the vehicle is identified
     for rotation and redistribution. In addition, the add-on equipment will be retained by the
     original organization.
        3.30.2.1. Requesting organizations send written change justification to Vehicle
        Management for add-on equipment/changes to government leased vehicles. If approved,
        VM&A will submit to leasing agency (i.e., GSA) to obtain approval for installation of
        add-on equipment or changes to vehicle. Leasing agency's concurrence or non-
        concurrence will be maintained in the requesting organization’s vehicle control records in
        VM&A.
        3.30.2.2. Add-on equipment will be assigned vehicle equivalents and captured in
        OLVIMS for government owned assets. Vehicle Fleet Managers should take the
        following guidance into consideration when deciding whether or not to claim additional
        equivalents for locally added or factory-installed optional equipment:
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        81


         3.30.2.2.1. Items are only claimed once, regardless of how many are on the vehicle.
         Examples are pintle hooks on bobtails, roof mounted air conditioning units on buses,
         etc.
         3.30.2.2.2. Some examples of items not to count as add-on equipment are standard
         (original equipment) shelving, bins, flashing lights, additional wiring on ambulances,
         standard plows and blades on snow plows and graders, standard AM/FM radios, anti-
         lock brakes, air bags, mud flaps and electronic fuel injection systems.
         3.30.2.2.3. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicles enhanced with addition of a pintle hook
         will be permanently marked with the maximum towing capacity stenciled
         prominently in the general area to the pintle hook as practical.
  3.30.3. Bases must get MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff approval prior to modifying
  vehicles. MAJCOMs must get approval for modifications from the prime ALC. The prime
  ALC ensures the configuration changes to special mounted equipment is documented in
  appropriate technical data and that necessary adjustments are made to logistics support plans.
  Permanent local modifications to special mounted equipment are usually not approved unless
  required to correct isolated problems. Controlled vehicles are: aircraft and ground support
  equipment tow tractors, major crash fire rescue vehicles, 463L MHE, aircraft refuelers,
  compressed gas servicing equipment, special aircraft and missile cranes, personnel lifting
  mechanisms on high reach trucks or cranes, M-series tactical vehicles, support equipment in
  the W-series USAF management codes and munitions MHE. Additional guidance is provided
  in AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program, for nuclear certified
  assets.
3.31. NMC Hours:
  3.31.1. NMC hours start at the time the customer signs in at the Vehicle Management CSC
  shop. The date and time is also entered on the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble
  Report as the date/time that the discrepancy is reported to Vehicle Management. The CSC
  adjusts the start time to account for actual downtime beginning with any preliminary wrecker
  service or mobile maintenance support. Adjustments should be coordinated with VM&A and
  Vehicle Operations Dispatch to confirm the operator’s original request for repair assistance.
  Upon VFM or VMS request, VM&A provides a NMC report reflecting hours controlled by
  Vehicle Management (in-house) and repair hours not controlled by Vehicle Management
  (contract, warranty, etc.). NMC time ends after completion and verification of all
  maintenance actions.
  3.31.2. To support MAJCOM management programs, separate MC percentage goals can be
  established to apply as a metric (management indicator). This may be by major vehicle type
  or overall fleet. Note: The MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs may exclude reporting
  NMC hours for excess vehicles awaiting disposition instructions, vehicles in depot and
  seasonal equipment during the off season such as snow removal, deicing equipment and
  lawnmowers. Additionally, MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs may exclude reporting
  NMC hours for vehicles owned or under the control of the Advanced Power Technology
  Office (APTO) located at Robins AFB. These vehicles are placed in fleets around the AF to
  collect O&M data in an effort to develop and perfect new technologies for AF use.
  Significant NMC hours are expected during these tests. Vehicle downtime begins when the
  vehicle is turned in for maintenance or when a request for maintenance support (wrecker,
82                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     mobile, etc.) is received. Vehicles awaiting accident, abuse and repair decisions/repairs will
     draw downtime. This includes those awaiting repair decisions by MAJCOM, WR-ALC or
     local.
     3.31.3. NMCS vehicles are not normally repaired until all the parts have been received,
     unless approved by the VFM or VMS. For example, an engine received for a crash fire
     fighting vehicle may be installed even though a required converter has not been delivered.
     After the engine is installed, the status of the vehicle reverts to NMCS. The supply priority
     for the converter is not downgraded. Note: Vehicles on NMCS status should be prime
     candidates for corrosion control repairs. Remove the vehicle from NMCS status in OLVIMS
     only until the corrosion repairs are completed, then return the vehicle to NMCS status until
     the parts are received.
     3.31.4. Use MC data to support manning, shop equipment, vehicle replacement criteria, new
     vehicle buy budgets and reliability and deployment programs.
3.32. Reclamation Procedures:
     3.32.1. Accomplish reclamation to the extent necessary before or after processing to DRMS.
     VM&A coordinates with using organizations for removal of organizational equipment prior
     to transferring a vehicle to DRMS. Document removed parts on AFTO Form 91. MAJCOM
     Vehicle Management Staffs establishes policy regarding retention of DRMS-bound vehicles
     for purposes of parts reclamation or for training purposes.
        3.32.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . PACAF vehicle management flights are authorized to
        retain vehicles for parts reclamation within the following guidelines:
        3.32.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) VM&A will place vehicles retained for reclamation in
        status code "E", ASC code 048 (excess). Establish a 180-day suspense.
            3.32.1.1.2. (Added-PACAF) . Do not retain vehicles longer than 180 days after
            receipt of disposal instructions.
     3.32.2. Withdraw vehicles from DRMS for special projects or an authorized need upon
     written MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff approval. VFM and VMS provide technical
     assistance in selecting vehicles to be withdrawn. Requirements for withdrawing vehicles
     from DRMS are in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 2.
     3.32.3. VFM or VMS will monitor the repair and turn-in of vehicle parts to ensure
     serviceable parts with a foreseeable need are not turned in for disposal. To reduce the
     potential for fraud, waste and abuse, inventory and store serviceable, non-credit turn-in parts
     for which there is a projected need, as work order residue.
3.33. Staff Assistance. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs provide staff assistance to the
base Vehicle Management activity. A visit is made when required by the MAJCOM or requested
by the senior commander or equivalent, and approved by the MAJCOM.
3.34. Shop Publications. Necessary technical literature, including TOs and service manuals
will be available at all times. Technical data for vehicles or vehicular equipment, including
nuclear certified assets, must be current. Any of the following data sources, in printed or digital
form, are acceptable: Current TO or commercial manual; printed material, microfilm or software
provided by or procured from the asset manufacturer; commercially procured after-market parts
and repair manuals, such as Chilton® Manuals; or digitized technical data such as Mitchell1®.

When conflict occurs between technical data sources, or questions arise about the accuracy of
any technical data, repair procedures or replacement parts, other than AF-directed inspection
criteria, the final decision authority lies with the representative or dealer for the manufacturer of
the vehicle or equipment item in question. Rationale being the manufacturer or their
representative should have the latest procedures and parts information available.
   3.34.1. Set up a central publication file accessible to all work centers.
       3.34.1.1. Geographically separated work centers will have current publications such as
       TO 36-1-191, AFOSHSTDs, etc., available in printed or digital form to prevent wasted
       travel time to the central library. The work center supervisor, with VFM or VMS
       approval, determines which publications are needed in their work center.
   3.34.2. Order commercial books or TOs when new vehicles are received without
   publications, using the emergency ordering procedures in TO 00-5-1, AF Technical Order
   System.
   3.34.3. (Added-PACAF) . In locations where foreign nationals are employed, publications
   will be maintained in English and the host country language as locally determined by vehicle
   management to be feasible. In locations where local national supervision is fluent in English
   and can perform translating functions, only critical information areas of listed publications
   are required to be maintained in a bilingual format. Critical information can be defined by
   the VFM/VMS.
3.35. Technical Publications. Report deficiencies on AFTO Form 22 IAW TO 00-5-1. Return
all excess copies of new vehicle or equipment TOs promptly to the appropriate ALC as required
by TO 00-5-1.
3.36. The VCP in the Using Activity. Provide vehicle status to the using organization’s VCO
or VCNCO. VM&A maintains a complete and current list of these individuals, to include:
   3.36.1. Name, grade, telephone number and email address of the person(s).
   3.36.2. Name of the organization, its assigned code and mailing address.
   3.36.3. Reference Chapter 10 for further information regarding VCO and VCNCO
   requirements.
3.37. Vehicle Redistribution. Ensure vehicles and equipment designated for shipment meet
serviceability standards. Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding
the transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-201, Cargo Movement,
Chapter 3. Unless directed by the parent MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff for intra-
command shipments, for shipments between commands, vehicles are not redistributed when they
reach replacement eligibility as outlined in TO 36-1-191. The VFM or VMS certifies on an
AFTO Form 91 that the vehicle being shipped meets serviceability standards.
3.38. Vehicle Improvement Working Group (VIWG). The VIWG is established to improve
the communications between MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs and the Vehicle System
Manager located at WR-ALC. The VIWG meets annually, or as directed, to review deficiency
and unsatisfactory reports, and to discuss technical matters. TO 36-1-191 stipulates the
responsibilities of the VIWG.

4.3. VCP. VM&A personnel will develop a training plan and thoroughly train newly appointed
VCOs and VCNCOs on their duties. Additionally, a knowledge test will be administered that
will be rated pass/ fail to ensure VCO/VCNCOs attain an acceptable knowledge level during
training. A sample test can be downloaded from the VCF Program folder within the AF Vehicle
Management                                                                         Neighborhood
(https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AF-66).
VM&A personnel may modify or add to the questions on the test to meet local requirements. All
new VCOs and VCNCOs will be administered the test and must attain a satisfactory grade of 70
percent or higher to assume their new duties. Associate units will participate in and support the
host VCP. Associate unit VCPs are subject to assessment by the host command Inspector
General (IG). Note: AFOSI) vehicles leased through GSA in Continental United States
(CONUS) are exempt from inspections and staff assistance visits.
4.3. (PACAF) VCP Vehicle Management and Analysis will provide orientation training to all
newly appointed VCO/Vehicle Non-Commissioned Officer (VCNCO) on Air Force vehicle
management policies within 15 days of receiving appointment letters.
   4.3.1. A VCP assistance visit will be conducted annually. The results will be documented to
   include the topics discussed, noted discrepancies, and noteworthy comments, and provided to
   the Unit Commander or equivalent within 14 days after the visit. Copies may be provided to
   tenant command staff assistance teams and IG teams upon request. The VCO and VCNCO
   are provided the following information during each visit:
       4.3.1.1. An analysis of vehicle utilization as it compares to AF goals.
       4.3.1.2. Issues such as operational problems, vehicle rotations, utilization, requirements,
       security, operator training, licensing, lesson plans and misuse will be discussed.
       4.3.1.3. A computation of O&M cost per mile for each unit vehicle.
   4.3.2. Utilization/Rotation Analysis. Rotate vehicles when practical and economical to help
   ensure they will reach their programmed life expectancy. The OLVIMS Fleet Module will be
88                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     used to determine how well the fleet compares to established AF and base mileage averages
     and other Vehicle Management objectives. AF goals listed in the VMIF are used as the basis
     for utilization/rotation analysis. Analysis and summary of actions need to be documented.
     Authorization deletions, changes and rotation need to be considered for under-utilized
     vehicles. Consider utilization data, mission requirements and the cost of moving equipment
     when determining if rotation actions are necessary. Results of this analysis must be
     documented to include rationale for action(s). Note: GSA or other leased assets are exempt
     from this analysis.
        4.3.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . Annual Vehicle Utilization and Rotation Analysis: All
        vehicle types or assets with a utilization goal identified in the Vehicle Management Index
        File will be evaluated during the annual utilization/rotation analysis. The analysis will be
        reviewed and approved by the MSG/CC. The analysis will address the following at a
        minimum:
            4.3.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . Monthly utilization averages (use 12 months of
            historical data) by management code. When the fleet average for a specific
            management code is less than 50 percent of the AF goal, consideration should be
            given to reducing vehicle requirements.
            4.3.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) . Evaluation of severely under-utilized assets (those
            producing less than 25 percent of AF goal) will be prime candidates for elimination.
            When it is determined an asset meeting this criteria will not be eliminated, the
            justification must be documented and approved during the MSG/CC’s annual review
            of the effectiveness of the local vehicle utilization program.
            4.3.2.1.3. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicles in replacement code‖K‖ and above will be
            evaluated annually for rotation. Management code and year group will determine the
            average accumulated mileage. At local discretion, one-of-a-kind vehicles within a
            specific year group may be exempted from the rotation analysis.
            4.3.2.1.4. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicles will be evaluated for rotation when the
            accumulated mileage/hours is/are plus or-minus 20 percent of the fleet average for
            like assets within the same year group. Once the assets meeting the criteria are
            identified, the monthly utilization data will be evaluated to determine if rotation is
            warranted. When it is determined an asset meeting this criteria will not be rotated,
            the justification must be documented and approved during the MSG/CC’s annual
            review of the effectiveness of the local vehicle rotation program.
     4.3.3. Perform Semiannual Wing Assessment Vehicle Inspections. At a minimum, conduct
     inspection of at least 25 percent of each unit’s AF owned or leased vehicle fleet every 6
     months using the vehicle assessment inspection checklist at Attachment 8. If 25 percent of
     unit’s assets are not scheduled for maintenance in a 6-month period, establish a schedule to
     accommodate the remaining vehicles needed to reach the 25 percent mark using the vehicle
     assessment inspection checklist at Attachment 8. An emphasis should be placed on operator
     care and maintenance of leased vehicles since AF vehicle maintenance personnel do not
     maintain these assets. Any vehicle found to be in operation with a documented (noted on AF
     Form 1800 or 1807) safety discrepancy is an automatic failure for that vehicle (score
     recorded as zero). After completing all vehicle inspections for a unit, the individual vehicle
     scores will be averaged to produce an overall assessment score. For example, a unit had
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          89


   three vehicles inspected: vehicle A received 80 points, vehicle B received 70 points and
   vehicle C received 90 points, equaling an overall assessment score of 80 percent (80 + 70 +
   90 = 240 points/3 vehicles = overall assessment score of 80 percent). Inspection results will
   be provided to the Unit Commander or equivalent within 14 days after 25 percent of their
   vehicle fleet has been inspected. A consolidated report will be provided to the MSG
   Commander or equivalent after each semi-annual inspection cycle.
   4.3.4. The VCF will conduct a VCO meeting at least twice a year. Topics will include:
   preventative maintenance, official use guidance, safety, operator care and any other
   information deemed necessary by the VCF.
4.4. DOD Fleet Credit Card System. The DOD Fleet Credit Cards are used to obtain fuel and
services from off-base commercial service stations. Services are limited to those which are
needed in order keep a USAF vehicle in (or return to) serviceable condition when the vehicle is
operating outside of the using organization’s Permissible Operating Distance (POD). Each
registered AF motor vehicle authorized for off-base use may be assigned a DOD Fleet Credit
Card, if the vehicle is normally operated outside of the base’s POD or if an authorized DOD or
AF base refueling facility (that utilizes the Vehicle Identification Link Key) is not available.
DOD Fleet cards are not to be used in place of an organization’s Government Purchase Card
when purchasing items required to support field operations or fleet maintenance support. DESC
is the Program Manager and policy oversight for the DOD Fleet card, however units will
develop, and ensure execution of, local programs and procedures IAW with the DESC sponsored
fuel charge card guidelines and this AFI. To facilitate multi-vehicle fuel purchases, each Vehicle
Management activity is authorized to obtain generic cards. Generic cards should reflect unit
descriptions, i.e., 96th Vehicle Management. Keep in mind that the Vehicle Management
community should maintain as few credits cards as possible to ensure mission accomplishment.
CAMs or unit Agency Program Coordinators (APC) may restrict Fleet card purchases to fuel
only. Car wash purchase amount limits may also be set by CAMs or unit APCs, i.e. $10 per car
wash.
   Notes:
   1. LRS Commanders or equivalents have the option of establishing alternative off-base
      refueling programs, using the Fleet Credit Card, when alternative fuel requirements
      cannot be met by local fuels management agencies and/or supported by other federal
      agencies (refer to paragraph 1.13.4.). When Fleet Credit Cards are authorized for this
      use, APCs will ensure that funds for fuel purchases of non-UDI vehicles are reimbursed
      to the Fleet Credit Card account fund code. Additionally, APC will restrict purchases to
      fuel only.
   2. Air Force Material Command (AFMC) and AFOSI activities with indigenous assets
      assigned are exempt from this policy.
   3. As a rule, vehicle operators should obtain approval from the host base VM&A office
      before using the fleet credit card to obtain off-base maintenance or towing services.
      Vehicle Management function may waive POD requirements if individual purchase or
      service procured with the DOD Fleet Credit Cards are more advantages to the
      government.

     4.4.1. Unit Level Program Management Positions. Normally, the Vehicle Management
     activity is responsible for administration of the DOD Fleet Credit Card Program. Appropriate
     personnel within controlling activity/flight should be appointed to the following positions:
        4.4.1.1. APC.
        4.4.1.2. Accountable Official (AO).
        4.4.1.3. Certifying Official.
        4.4.1.4. In-depth responsibilities for the positions above can be found on the DESC
        website at: http://www.desc.dla.mil/default.asp.
            Note:
            1. The APC position would normally be held by the VFM, VMS or flight OIC,
               however small units/functions with limited supervisory personnel authorizations
               may combine the APC and AO position/responsibilities.
            2. Certifying Officials may be the unit Resource Advisor.
            3. All program management position appointments should be made by the unit
               commander or appointing authority utilizing a DD Form 577,
               Appointment/Termination Record – Authorized Signature. Signed DD Form
               577(s) must be forwarded to the DESC Account Manager and maintained in unit
               program file. AOs also require completion of the Fleet DoD/DESC AO
               Nomination Form, this form is also forwarded to DESC and maintained in a
               program file. Alternates should also be appointed for each position and have the
               same appointment form requirements as stated above. All responsibilities of the
               positions, as outlined in the DESC policy, must be adhered to.
     4.4.2. Establishing DOD Fleet Credit Card Account. Units should contact the AF
     Component Program Manager (AFCPM) and/or visit the DESC website for details.
     4.4.3. Non-Fuel Purchase Funding and Payment Procedures. Specific payment procedures
     must be established at each host base when accounts are established. Make all payments
     directly to the authorized vendor. Provide the Accounting Liaison Office (ALO) an estimate
     of non-fuel purchases to be made against all DOD Fleet Credit Cards each fiscal year or
     quarter as required. This can be accomplished by preparing the appropriate funding
     document, i.e. AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/ Reimbursement Document, and
     forwarding the original and one copy to ALO for approval at the beginning of each year
     and/or quarter. The approved copy is authority to cite funds for purchases. A separate DOD
     Fleet Card Program funding file will be maintained for each account for each fiscal year. The
     file will include:
        4.4.3.1. Copies of the current FY funding documents (i.e. AF Form 406 and DD Form
        250).
        4.4.3.2. Fund cite authorization.
        4.4.3.3. Requests for additional or supplemental funds.
        4.4.3.4. Copies of current FY vendor monthly invoices, to include all purchase and other
        transactions receipts. Note: The current Fleet card vendor, Wright Express, only
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          91


     produces monthly invoices for download using the WEX Online Account Management
     System if non-fuel purchases were made during the billing cycle (first calendar day to last
     calendar day each month). The ―balance due‖ amount on the monthly invoice will only
     reflect the amount due to non-fuel purchases.
         4.4.3.4.1. All purchase receipts must have the following associated information
         documented:
             4.4.3.4.1.1. The full name, grade, unit and duty phone number of purchaser.
             4.4.3.4.1.2. Description of purchase. If fuel, type of fuel and gallons. If service,
             part or repair, provide full description.
             4.4.3.4.1.3. Vehicle registration number and odometer/hour meter at the time of
             purchase. NOTE: All vendor invoices and transaction receipts must be
             maintained for three years.
  4.4.4. Administration and Management Controls. The AO will maintain a control file to
  account for the DOD Fleet Credit Cards. The control file will contain, but not be limited to:
  local program policies/procedures, appointment letters and training certificates, a receipt for
  on-hand credit cards to include list of PIN numbers (PINS must be secured at all time),
  copies of documents certifying loss, investigation, destruction, turn-in, semiannual validation
  and credit card register. The register will be valid for one FY. All cards must be reissued on
  a new register by the 1st of October each year. Develop a local credit card control log to
  document use. Store unused cards in a suitable locked container. MAJCOM Account
  Managers (CAM) and unit level AOs must establish on-line account management access with
  the credit card vendor (WEX Online). On-line account management will allow CAMs
  transaction oversight and AOs the ability to retrieve monthly statements, set-up ―alert‖
  emails, quickly view status of account(s), card(s) used and to verify transactions against their
  account(s). Other duties of the APC, AO and Certifying Official include, but are not limited
  to, the following:
     4.4.4.1. Developing a local card user/training guide.
     4.4.4.2. Acquiring the minimum amount of DOD Fleet Credit Cards to meet installation
     requirements.

92                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        4.4.4.9. Forwarding invoice and delivery tickets for non-fuel purchases to the ALO.
        4.4.4.10. (DELETED) .
        4.4.4.11. Ensuring all card users sign a Statement of Understanding prior to initial use,
        and annually thereafter, that outlines card user responsibilities and authorized purchases.
        This may be accomplished by preprinting AF Form 1297 with the following statement:
        ―By signing this form, the above named individual acknowledges their responsibilities for
        Fleet card use and authorized purchases‖.
        4.4.4.12. Notifying DESC, AFCPM, CAM and card contractor immediately of changes
        to your account including telephone numbers, addresses, POCs, AOs, Certifying
        Officials, Department of Defense Activity Address Codes (DODAACs), etc.
        Subsequently, if your unit is disbanded or relocated, the AO responsible for the fuel card
        account is required to provide the card contractor with a forwarding address where any
        unpaid invoices can be sent. Further, if the unit is disbanded, the unit is responsible for
        proper disposition of the cards and personal identification numbers (PIN) to prevent
        unauthorized use or fraudulent activity.
        4.4.4.13. Ensuring the PIN associated with each DOD Fleet card is different and unique
        and that steps are taken to ensure PINs are not divulged to unauthorized personnel. When
        a PIN has been compromised, the cardholder shall contact the contractor immediately for
        card cancellation or resetting of the PIN.
        4.4.4.14. Establish reimbursement policy/procedure for units/individuals that purchase
        unauthorized items or car washes that are over AO directed policy limits.
        4.4.4.15. Ensuring complete documentation (specific item/service purchased and rational
        for purchase) of all non-fuel purchases are maintained on file.
     4.4.5. Disposition of the DOD Fleet Credit Cards. Destroy credit cards no longer required,
     authorized or expired. Maintain a record of DOD Fleet Credit Card destruction for 1 year
     after the expiration date of the card. Channel request to activate or permanently deactivate
     (cancel) account card(s) to the Fleet Credit Card vendor, CAM, AFCPM or DESC. Notify
     Fleet Credit Card vendor of all lost and/or stolen cards.
        4.4.5.1. Lost or stolen account numbers and cards must be reported immediately to the
        Fleet Credit Card vendor. Refer to account control files, account statements, or the back
        of a Fleet Credit Card for vendor contact information. Notification is mandatory whether
        or not the fuel card is to be replaced to enable the contractor to update the data file.
        4.4.5.2. Fuel cards that have been replaced for any reason, including those reported as
        lost and subsequently found, shall be destroyed immediately.
     4.4.6. DOD Fleet Card Training.
        4.4.6.1. Training is mandatory for CAMs and local account APC/AO. New APCs, AOs
        and alternates must complete required training within 30 days of appointment and
        annually thereafter. The mandatory AO training can be found on the DESC website,
        http://www.desc.dla.mil/default.asp. CAMs will maintain current contact in formation
        for all AOs under their MAJCOM hierarchy.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           93


      4.4.6.2. All card users must receive initial training prior to using the DOD Fleet fuel card
      and annually thereafter. A mandatory card user training presentation can be locally
      developed or downloaded from the DESC website, http://www.desc.dla.mil/default.asp.
      A list of trained card users will be maintained at the point of issue.
4.5. Fuel Issues. The FMF is responsible for the Automated Fuel Service Station (AFSS)
equipped for Vehicle Identification Links (VIL).
   4.5.1. VIL. VM&A will provide the FMF a quarterly, or as required, master list depicting
   all assigned vehicles and organization codes to include a break out of all vehicles that have
   changed since the previous list. This list must include the vehicle registration number, unit,
   all grades of product that will be used (e.g., MUR, MRR, DL1, DL2, CNG, LNG, etc.), and if
   it is an alternative fuel capable vehicle. FMF will use this list to encode the VIL with a UC.
   A system will be developed between the FMF and VM&A to ensure notification of vehicle
   deletions, assignments, rotations, nontaxable and alternative fuel use. VIL keys will only be
   encoded with the appropriate alternative fuel code when the required alternative fuel type is
   available. Local procedures will be developed to ensure alternative fuels are used to the
   maximum extent possible in vehicles equipped to use them (see paragraph 1.13.3). Failure
   to use reasonably available alternative fuels in AFVs may be considered as vehicle abuse.
   Some vehicles, like bi-fuel CNG, require a minimum amount of gasoline to be used
   periodically. In this case, VIL keys for those types of vehicles may be encoded with all fuel
   types required, provided fuel requirement documentation is maintained in the vehicle’s
   Vehicle Historical File.
   4.5.2. Recording Taxable Fuel Consumption. Current Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
   guidance identifies fuel for government vehicles operated solely on government installations
   as exempt from Federal and some state levied taxes. In order to ensure the DOD obtains
   appropriate tax credit for the fuel consumed by these vehicles the following procedures must
   be followed. Note: If any vehicle uses a county, state or federal highway one or more times
   during a fiscal quarter, fuel consumed by that vehicle is taxable for that period. Crossing over
   a county, state or federal highway at an intersection does not count as use. All off-road
   vehicles, e.g., graders, forklifts and K-loaders, qualify. DESC is responsible to issue
   guidance clearly outlining taxable and non-taxable guidelines for DOD fuel use. Additional
   information can be found on the DESC website at http://www.desc.dla.mil/.
      4.5.2.1. VCOs and VCNCOs, in conjunction with VM&A, must verify and list all
      vehicles designated for travel off the installation during the upcoming quarter.
      4.5.2.2. Once finalized, VM&A then forwards the list of vehicles expected to travel off
      the installation to the FMF IAW paragraph 4.5.1 The FMF then verifies each vehicle’s
      VIL is encoded to properly reflect taxable status of fuel to be consumed by the vehicle.
   4.5.3. Fuel Tax Refund Requests. The AF is not authorized to seek reimbursement for DLA-
   owned fuel or fuel purchased under a GSA lease as they are purchased under standard
   pricing. For information on obtaining reimbursement of fuel taxes on non-DLA-owned fuel
   or fuel purchased under a GSA wet lease, contact the local Accounting and Finance office.
4.6. Scheduling Maintenance. VM&A uses good judgment and exercises flexibility in
scheduling work into the shop. Parts availability, work center manning and the needs of the
customer are considered when VM&A plans, schedules and adjusts the shop workload.
94                                            AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     4.6.1. The VM&A work center should be accessible and recognizable to its customers.
     4.6.2. Monitor workload status and control work flow through the work centers.
     4.6.3. Schedule vehicles for needed inspections, services and repairs. An appointment
     system is recommended.
     4.6.4. Ensure work is authorized before it is started and notify the VFM or VMS of any
     estimated repair costs that exceed the one-time repair limit for the vehicle.
     4.6.5. Assign work priority. Notify the VFM or VMS when the total NMC or number of
     mission essential vehicles NMC exceeds acceptable levels. PCN SB004-008 can be used to
     aid in this requirement.
     4.6.6. Inform the work center supervisor of scheduled work, TCTOs, SBs, OTIs,
     Manufacturer Recalls, completed defers and other needs.
     4.6.7. Initiate and route AF Form 1823/1823-1 to the work centers. Process using at least 90
     days of OLVIMS vehicle historical data.
     4.6.8. Update the workload control board with vehicle and personnel status as required by
     the VFM or VMS.
     4.6.9. Consider maintenance in progress, backlog maintenance and work awaiting shop
     when an ETIC is requested. The VM&A Workload Controller and the applicable work center
     supervisors jointly determine the ETIC to be assigned.
     4.6.10. Delay work when needed.
     4.6.11. Check the delayed workload and schedule vehicles for work when the shop
     capability and needs of the customer permit.
     4.6.12. Recommend, in coordination with the work center supervisor, contract repair action
     when repair work or the workload becomes too excessive. Initiate contract documents after
     approval is received from the VFM or VMS.
     4.6.13. Ensure that vehicle and parts warranties are used.
     4.6.14. Monitor cannibalization and vehicles on NMCS.
     4.6.15. When applicable monitor contract repair funds and advise the VFM or VMS and
     Cost Center Manager as appropriate.
     4.6.16. Assist work centers in preparing LTI forms and deficiency reports.
     4.6.17. Ensure repairs for TCTOs, SBs, OTIs and Manufacturer Recalls are scheduled,
     tracked, accomplished and recorded.
     4.6.18. Establish and control Vehicle Management labor hour reporting in OLVIMS as
     prescribed by AFCSM 24-1.
     4.6.19. Process OLVIMS Maintenance data as prescribed by AFCSM 24-1.
4.7. Repetitive Maintenance, Warranty and Authorized Repairs. Before sending an AF
Form 1823/ 1823-1 to the shop, the VM&A Workload Controller:
     4.7.1. Reviews the AF Form 1823/1823-1, Vehicle Historical Record and the OLVIMS
     repetitive maintenance screen for repetitive maintenance.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          95


   4.7.2. Estimates repair costs (for major repairs and repairs that may cause the one-time repair
   limit to be exceeded) and ensure repairs are authorized according to TO 36-1-191.
   4.7.3. Decides whether the repair is covered by a new vehicle warranty or a previous
   contract, COPARS or other parts warranty.
4.8. Vehicles in Replacement Codes A Through J. VM&A identifies vehicles that will be
tentatively replaced by new vehicle gains by registration number. Perform only minimum
essential repairs on these vehicles to keep them in service until replacements are received.
Process requests for disposition instructions IAW TO 36-1-191. Process requests for repair
authority and disposition instructions for vehicles assigned to tenant organizations using the
OLVIMS Automated LTI function to the owning MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff.
4.9. Work Order and Vehicle Processing for Outlying Work Centers. The operator
debriefing and incoming inspection is done in the work center. Repair needs are validated. The
de-briefer gives the information to initiate the AF Form 1823/1823-1 to the VM&A Workload
Controller and makes sure any scheduled maintenance and delayed requirements are known. The
work center supervisor (or a designated technician) accomplishes final inspections, which will be
shown on the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
4.10. Work Order Control for Delayed Maintenance.
   4.10.1. Delayed maintenance is work that may be put off without damage to the vehicle or
   equipment and without compromising safety standards. Delayed maintenance codes are in
   AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4, and on the OLVIMS help screen.
   4.10.2. When delayed work is entered on a closed AF Form 1823/1823-1, OLVIMS
   generates a delayed maintenance AF Form 1823/1823-1 for the delayed items and maintains
   delayed work by work center.
   4.10.3. A copy of the new (delayed) AF Form 1823/1823-1 and parts requisition document is
   sent to Materiel Control when parts are required. Another copy of the AF Form 1823/1823-1
   is retained by VM&A in a delayed maintenance file.
   4.10.4. VM&A uses the delayed maintenance report to verify shop backlog, maintain NMCS
   status, make sure parts are installed after receipt, and catalog identified malfunctions and
   discrepancies until repaired. Routine delayed maintenance is accomplished during the next
   scheduled/unscheduled work occurrence, workload and mission permitting. Delayed
   maintenance can be accomplished as workload allows or be done by mobile maintenance.
4.11. Work Order Number Control. OLVIMS controls and assigns work order numbers to
AF Form 1823/1823-1. VM&A can assign blocks of work order numbers to outlying work
centers. The PCN SB004-018 is used to monitor work order number assignment.
4.12. AF Form 1823/1823-1Processing for Vehicles NMCS. These procedures apply when
needed parts are not readily available through Materiel Control and the vehicle cannot be
returned to the user.
   4.12.1. The work center supervisor ensures that all necessary parts are annotated on the parts
   requisitioning form or worksheet accompanying the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
   4.12.2. Materiel Control selects the supply source and processes the parts request. If the
   parts are not available from normal sources (including bench/working stock, work order
96                                           AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


     residue and delayed parts in stock), Materiel Control, together with the work center
     supervisor and VM&A, checks whether parts are available from a vehicle approved to be
     sent to DRMS. If all other attempts to locate parts are unsuccessful and the NMCS vehicle
     would seriously affect the user’s mission, Materiel Control and the work center supervisor
     may consider cannibalization.
     4.12.3. When parts are not immediately available, the AF Form 1823/1823-1 is taken to the
     VFM, VMS or designee, who reviews each possible NMCS condition to make sure all
     attempts have been made to return the vehicle to service and approves placing the vehicle in
     NMCS status.
     4.12.4. Once a NMCS condition is approved, the AF Form 1823/1823-1 is taken to the
     VM&A Workload Controller who places the vehicle on NMCS. The work order is then sent
     to Materiel Control and the work center supervisor is advised to prepare the vehicle for
     NMCS storage.
     4.12.5. Materiel Control obtains parts according to Chapter 5.
     4.12.6. As soon as the parts are received, Materiel Control sends the work order to VM&A.
     VM&A will take the vehicle off NMCS status and schedule it for work.

Section 4B— Procedures

4.13. Procedures for Processing Contract Maintenance Work Orders.
     4.13.1. VM&A keeps active and inactive files on contract maintenance work order
     correspondence, coordinates with the VFM or VMS and the work center supervisor, plans the
     workload, monitors the funding status and keeps files on work specifications.
     4.13.2. VM&A initiates the AF Form 1823/1823-1 and funding documents, i.e. AF Form 9
     and GPC, for all work done commercially. They include work specifications and other data
     as needed. The completed documents are sent to the VFM, VMS or designee for review and
     signature. Note: Vehicle down time for contract work orders, including awaiting contract
     action, is NMCM time.
     4.13.3. After the funding documents are signed, one copy is retained.
     4.13.4. VM&A arranges to send the vehicle to the vendor.
     4.13.5. VM&A monitors the downtime of vehicles being repairs and informs the VFM or
     VMS if corrective action is needed.
     4.13.6. When work is completed, the work is inspected for compliance with agreement,
     estimate and/ or industry standard requirements. The VFM, VMS or designee checks the AF
     Form 9 (if used) and the vendor’s invoice for accuracy against the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
     Warranty provisions are programmatically entered during ―JZ‖ transaction processing.
     Additional warranty information may be entered in the remarks area of the closed AF Form
     1823/1823-1.
     4.13.7. A ―JZ‖ transaction is accomplished in OLVIMS to input the repair cost. If an actual
     vendor's invoice is not received with the vehicle, use the price on the contract document.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         97


       4.13.7.1. Upon receipt of the vendor's invoice, compare the cost to the agreed price and
       change OLVIMS if necessary. (Not applicable if using the GPC).
   4.13.8. The ALO develops and certifies SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and
   Services Other Than Personal, (original and three copies) to pay the vendor. The ALO
   reports discounts for prompt payment or other changes to the original invoice cost to VM&A
   for adjustment to the original input to OLVIMS (not applicable if using the GPC).
   4.13.9. The original invoice is attached to the original voucher for submission by the ALO.
   A copy of the invoice is attached to the ALO’s copy of the voucher and another copy
   returned to the vendor with the payment. (Not applicable if using the GPC).
4.14. Procedures for Distribution and Processing COPARS Sales Slips. The Vehicle
Management activity establishes filing and retention procedures for COPARS sales slips as it
pertains to the tracking of expenditures, warranties and vehicle historical repair documentation.
   4.14.1. Distribute sales slips as follows:
       4.14.1.1. Copy one is retained by the contractor, attached to the invoice, and sent to
       Contracting, and Accounting and Finance, in turn.
       4.14.1.2. Copy two is sent to the QAP for verification, and then forwarded to VM&A, in
       batch sequence, for processing into the OLVIMS and filing.
       4.14.1.3. Copy three is attached to the filed copy of the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
       4.14.1.4. Other copies are distributed according to documentation needs.
   4.14.2. Sales Slip Processing. Materiel Control checks for the following data elements on
   sales slips each duty day for obvious errors:
       4.14.2.1. Date.
       4.14.2.2. Work order number.
       4.14.2.3. Nomenclature.
       4.14.2.4. Quantity.
       4.14.2.5. Charge code ("M," "N" or "D").
       4.14.2.6. Category of part (new or rebuilt).
       4.14.2.7. No changes have been made on the slip.
       4.14.2.8. Vehicle registration number.
       4.14.2.9. Part number.
       4.14.2.10. RC/CC Code.
       4.14.2.11. Unit price, discount and total price by line item.
       4.14.2.12. Warranty (if applicable).
       4.14.2.13. Sales slip is "Z'd" out after the last entry.
       4.14.2.14. Bin number when charge code "D" is used.
98                                             AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


        4.14.2.15. Total of sales slips on adding machine tape or other printed media, and
        attached to sales slip.
     4.14.3. Each person authorized to sign for parts is responsible for seeing that the data
     elements listed above are present on each sales slip before signing for the parts. Upon
     completion of the sales slip, the recipient signs the sales slip using the same signature as the
     sample signature on the COPARS authorization list. Materiel Control ensures that discounts
     have been figured accurately and provides them to VM&A along with the adding machine
     tape or other printed media, of the total of all sales slips on a daily basis. Sales slips for the
     day are numbered consecutively, to include copies of voided slips.
     4.14.4. Process COPARS transactions through OLVIMS each duty day.
        4.14.4.1. VM&A processes the sales slip cost data by line item (except L9999) into
        OLVIMS.
        4.14.4.2. VM&A verifies the sales slip line items with PCN SB004-005 and makes
        corrections as necessary. These sales slips are then returned to Materiel Control for filing.
        4.14.4.3. Input all discounts or charges such as premium communications and
        transportation, and COPARS overtime, to OLVIMS, as identified by Materiel Control.
        4.14.4.4. VM&A adjusts cost data in OLVIMS, as identified by the ALO for such things
        as prompt payment discounts or other financial adjustments.
     4.14.5. When a part costing more than $100 comes with a warranty VM&A records the
     provisions in OLVIMS on the "PZ" transaction, which can then be monitored using the PCN
     49. Specific warranties are noted on the COPARS sales slip. VFM or VMS determines if
     warranty tracking is accomplished for parts costing less than $100.
4.15. Procedures for Processing AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice, and DOD
Fleet Credit Card.
     4.15.1. Process AF Form 15 cost into OLVIMS for all vehicle-related services. If the ALO
     notifies VM&A of changes to the AF Form 15, such as discounts for prompt payment,
     VM&A will process the change into OLVIMS.
     4.15.2. Process the Fleet Credit Card cost after VFM or VMS certification. After VM&A
     enters and validates the data in OLVIMS (reference AFCSM 24-1), the Fleet Credit Card
     receipts are processed IAW paragraph 4.4
4.16. Control of TCTOs, SBs and OTIs. TCTOs are managed differently than regular TOs.
They must be requisitioned individually and as a series they must be identified for automatic
distribution. TCTOs, SBs and OTIs are managed according to these procedures:
     4.16.1. VEMSO is notified by WR-ALC concerning newly released TCTOs, SBs and OTIs.
     VEMSO will provide MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs a list of vehicles requiring the
     TCTO, SB or OTI for forwarding this information to units in their command for action. Upon
     receiving new TCTO release notification, these units ensure the TO Monitor places the unit
     on distribution for the specific TCTO.
        4.16.1.1. Units must ensure they are on distribution for each TCTO series. These series
        are listed in the ―-36‖ index for the type of vehicle they pertain to. The TO monitor
        should review the ―-36‖ index on receipt and ensure that for each type of vehicle
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       99


       assigned, if there is an applicable TCTO series that it is on distribution. This ensures
       TCTOs published under that series are sent to the unit. The system is not foolproof;
       however, as new TCTOs are sometimes issued for which a series has not been
       established. That is why a manual notification is usually made.
   4.16.2. VM&A should date stamp each TCTO, SB or OTI once received (electronically
   dated e-mail/ message traffic is sufficient); determine TCTO, SB or OTI action and/or parts
   kit requirement by reviewing the TCTO, SB or OTI cover page for affected vehicle
   registration numbers; and notify Materiel Control to order required parts kits after
   determining and verifying base requirements. Note: Use the ―T‖ prefix for work order
   numbers when a TCTO will be completed on that work order. Use the ―S‖ prefix for work
   order numbers when a SB will be completed on that work order.
       4.16.2.1. WR-ALC requires verification of correct TCTO or SB ordering before kits are
       released for shipment. Contact the appropriate IM or Equipment Specialist for the
       affected vehicle type by telephone, fax or electronic mail, provide vehicle registration
       numbers and requisition due-in document numbers, obtained from Materiel Control, to
       enable kit release.
   4.16.3. Take continuous supply follow-up action until kits are received.
   4.16.4. Schedule TCTOs, SBs and OTIs as soon as possible. See the "when work will be
   done" part of the specific TCTO, SB or OTI. A TCTO, SB or OTI that is not completed by
   this date is an "outstanding" TCTO, SB or OTI and places the affected vehicles’
   serviceability in jeopardy. When directed by the WR-ALC, VEMSO and/or MAJCOM, these
   vehicles are removed from service until the outstanding TCTO, SB or OTI is accomplished.
   The VFM or VMS advises VEMSO and the MAJCOM within 24 hours after a TCTO, SB or
   OTI becomes outstanding.
   4.16.5. Record the completion of the TCTO, SB or OTI on the computer-generated Vehicle
   Historical Record (OLVIMS PCN SB004-828). VEMSO will collect completion/compliance
   reporting via LIMS EV monthly data files for completed TCTOs and SBs. Urgent action
   TCTO and SB completion reporting will be included with all others, however they may
   require manual completion reporting depending on time constraints and fleet safety concerns.
   VEMSO will notify applicable units as the need arises.
       4.16.5.1. When closing TCTO/SB work orders, VM&A activities must ensure the
       TCTO/SB number entered into OLVIMS exactly matches the TCTO/SB Number shown
       in LIMS EV TCTO view for that registration number.
   4.16.6. Maintain active master TCTO, SB and OTI files. A rescinded file may be maintained
   when needed for special programs and projects. When a rescinded TCTO is needed, it can be
   obtained by following the procedures in TO 00-5-1.

Section 4C— Policy

4.17. Vehicle Abuse Repairs. Local procedures are established for reporting suspected vehicle
abuse. Usually, damage not attributable to fair wear and tear (acts of nature) or accidents is
characterized as abuse. Note: Wind damage to the door is not an act of nature.
100                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


4.18. Accident Repairs. When the shop receives a vehicle with accident damage, CSC
personnel will initiate an AF Form 1823/1823-1 estimating the cost of repair. When computing
estimated cost for repairing accident damage, indirect cost is included only to determine one-
time repair limitations.
   4.18.1. Document accident repairs separately from normal work.
   4.18.2. Prepare an AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement, when required
   by local policy or requested by the Surveying Officer. Note: Both military and civilian
   Direct Labor charges computed by OLVIMS are used for determining labor cost for in-house
   repairs of vehicles/equipment on the AF Form 20.
4.19. Excess Vehicles. Redistribute excess vehicles to base activities having open vehicle
authorizations or reassign them to replace less serviceable and/or maintainable (usually older)
vehicles eligible for replacement. Do not assign excess vehicles to organizations waiting
approval for additional vehicle requirements. VM&A will control excess vehicles pending
MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff action.
   4.19.1. If reassignment to another base activity is not possible, change the vehicle status
   code to ―I‖ and place in an excess detail using ASC ―048‖ and applicable base code and user
   org code (e.g., 048CNEG). Accomplish an AFTO Form 91 and send the LTI requesting
   disposition instructions to the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff within 60 calendar days
   from the date the vehicle becomes excess on the Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt
   Listing (CA/CRL).
   4.19.2. Initiate follow-up action after 60 calendar days from the date the LTI was sent to the
   MAJCOM.
   4.19.3. Asset becomes excess once it is rotated from a valid authorization into an excess
   detail.
   4.19.4. Excess assets may not be used for deployments or special projects.
4.20. AF LSV and OGMVC. Slow moving conveyances (e.g., neighborhood EVs, golf cars,
scooters and other small low-speed utility vehicles, etc.) will be managed in several different
categories with a prime NSN for each category. This guidance does not include non-appropriated
funded LSVs and OGMVCs.
   4.20.1. Vehicles, whose maximum speed is not greater than 25 MPH will be categorized as a
   LSV and assigned the appropriate prime NSN based on the categories listed in Table 1.4
   This item will be loaded in AFEMS AS 010 and managed as a registered vehicle. This
   category must meet Title 49 CFR 571.500 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).
       4.20.1.1. For those LSVs purchased with unit funds prior to June 2006, organizations
       may continue to manage these assets as equipment until the vehicle has reached its life
       expectancy. This category of LSVs will be assigned prime NSN 2340-00-540-3900, AS
       036 and will be considered as non-REMS reportable LSVs.
   4.20.2. Self-propelled assets providing a basic passenger and/or light cargo carrying
   transportation capability (i.e., golf carts, ATVs, quad-runners, snowmobiles, etc.) not
   meeting specifications of Title 49 CFR 571.500 FMVSS will be categorized as OGMVCs
   and assigned prime NSN 2340-00-585-7495 in AFEMS, AS 036. Note: Skid steer loaders
   and mini-excavators made by Bobcat or other manufacturers are classified as registered
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                    101


  vehicles and will be managed            as   vehicles   under   the   category   of   Base
  Maintenance/Construction Equipment.
  4.20.3. OGMVCs will be procured and managed as equipment items. Non-REMS
  reportable LSVs will no longer be procured, but existing assets will be managed as
  equipment items.
     4.20.3.1. As equipment (refer to AFMAN 23-110, chapter 22 for policy on equipment),
     OGMVCs and non-REMS reportable LSVs will be loaded in AFEMS (NF3) and
     managed on the CA/CRL (R14). MAJCOMs may track OGMVCs and non-REMS
     reportable LSVs on the VAL. The serial number (or other unique identification number),
     part number and cage code must be recorded in the AFEMS in-use serialized asset
     screen.
     4.20.3.2. OGMVCs and non-REMS reportable LSVs will be maintained IAW
     manufacturer recommended intervals or standards in TO 36-1-191 for a comparative
     asset, and at a minimum will have a complete serviceability inspection, to include all
     safety related systems, at least annually. Owning organizations will fund and manage all
     aspects of the maintenance program. Vehicle Management will provide technical
     assistance as requested.
        4.20.3.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . The decision to maintain non-registered Low Speed
        Vehicle (LSV) and Other Government Vehicle Conveyances (OGMVC) through
        contract, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), GPC, or through unit self-help will be
        made locally. If utilizing self-help, Vehicle Management facilities will not be used.
        Only LSV and OGMVCs owned by LRS units may be maintained in LRS Vehicle
        Management facilities as mission needs dictate. Owning units desiring to perform
        their own maintenance via self-help will use their own shop or make arrangements
        with the Base Automotive Skills Development Center. To ensure maintenance is
        adequate and the assets are safely maintained, owning organizations are required to
        have an annual (safety) inspection performed by a civilian automotive maintenance
        firm (via contract, BPA, etc.). This inspection will not be completed through self-
        help. Safety discrepancies identified during the inspection will be repaired prior to
        use.
        4.20.3.2.2. (Added-PACAF) .     For all non-registered LSV and OGMVC
        maintenance performed through contract, BPA, GPC, or through unit self-help, the
        owning unit must supply VM&A with proof of annual safety inspection.
        4.20.3.2.3. (Added-PACAF) . Operation checks will be performed on the same
        basis as those for General Purpose Vehicles using an AF Form 1800, Operator’s
        Inspection Guide and Trouble Report.
  4.20.4. OGMVCs will be purchased IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),
  Defense FAR Supplement, AF FAR Supplement, related AFIs and AFPD 64-1, The
  Contracting System, and managed IAW AFMAN 23-110 and AFI 91-207, Air Force Traffic
  Safety Program. Purchase requests for OGMVCs will be processed through the Base Ground
  Safety Office (coordination), Contracting (coordination),Vehicle Management Flight
  (coordination) and LRS Equipment Accountability Office (approval).
102                                       AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      4.20.4.1. Wing/Installation Ground Safety will review each purchase IAW AFPAM 91-
      210, Contract Safety, paragraph 7.1.4.
      4.20.4.2. The Vehicle Management Flight will review and forward purchase requests to
      their MAJCOM for clarification to ensure the desired asset is an equipment item and not
      a vehicle. Vehicle Management will load and track any scheduled inspections on
      OGMVCs and non-REMS reportable LSVs in the OLVIMS for the purpose of notifying
      owning organizations pending maintenance actions due and ensuring inspections are
      accomplished (tracking purposes only). OGMVCs and non-REMS reportable LSVs will
      be assigned X-registration numbers. Request X-registration numbers from VEMSO.
      MAJCOMs may authorize bases to utilize a separate site code for tracking OGMVC and
      non-REMS reportable LSV inspections only. Owning organization will provide to
      VM&A, the original warranty documents and specifications prior to the assets being
      loaded into OLVIMS.
         4.20.4.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . All non-REMS reportable LSV and OGMVC assets
         will be issued an X registration number. Use management code 8299 for all LSV
         assets and use the National Stock Number (NSN) as prescribed in the basic
         publication. Use management code 8499 for all OGMVC assets and use the NSN as
         prescribed in the basic publication. For LRS owned assets being maintained in LRS
         Vehicle Management facilities a maximum of 0.3 equivalents will be applied to LSVs
         and OGMVCs.
         4.20.4.2.2. (Added-PACAF) . PACAF authorizes use of separate OLVIMS site
         code to track non-registered LSV and OGMVC inspections.
      4.20.4.3. (Added-PACAF) . Owning organizations of non-registered LSVs and
      OGMVCs must maintain documentation showing coordination with Wing Ground Safety
      Office, Vehicle Management Flight, and approval from the Equipment Management
      Section with the Management Systems Flight for each asset owned which was procured
      after 1 December 2004.
         4.20.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) . All requests for approval of an authorization or
         procurement of a LSV or OGMVC which requires Command Equipment
         Management Office (CEMO) approval must be accompanied by documentation of
         coordination with Wing Ground Safety Office and the Vehicle Management Flight, a
         listing of the requesting unit’s currently authorized and assigned LSVs and
         OGMVCs, and a listing showing the requesting unit’s light duty general purpose
         vehicle authorizations as described in paragraph 4.20.5.1.
   4.20.5. Installation Commanders or equivalents should set a ceiling on the number of
   OGMVCs while reducing the current fleet when OGMVCs are purchased based on
   guidelines provided by their respective MAJCOM.
      4.20.5.1. (Added-PACAF) . The ceiling on the number of non-registered LSV and
      OGMVC authorizations will be set at 10 percent of the light duty general purpose vehicle
      authorizations, 1.5 ton and below, excluding ambulances, trailers, and Special Purpose
      (Management Code C) telephone maintenance trucks, identified on the unit’s Vehicle
      Authorization List (VAL). For units with no vehicle authorizations, the number of non-
      registered LSV and OGMVC authorizations is capped at a maximum of 1ea. Unit Type
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       103


      Code (UTC) tasked OGMVC requirements/authorizations are exempt from the 10 percent
      ceiling restriction.
   4.20.6. LSVs and OGMVCs programs will be an UCI checklist item(s) to ensure all
   management and maintenance requirements are being met. During VVVs, OGMVCs and
   non-REMS reportable LSVs will be considered as an element of a unit’s total motor vehicle
   capability when assessing vehicle fleet size adequacy.
      4.20.6.1. Specialized OGMVCs such as Bobcats, quad-runners and ATVs will not be a
      consideration for reducing existing general purpose or passenger carrying vehicles
      authorizations.
   4.20.7. Salvage Procedures. Owning units will process OGMVCs and non-REMS reportable
   LSVs in the same manner, as local procedures dictate for disposal of other organizationally
   owned government equipment. License plates provided by Vehicle Management will be
   turned in as accountable items and assets will be removed from the OLVIMS database.
   4.20.8. (Added-PACAF) . LSVs and OGMVCs will only be operated on military
   installations or government property/roads unless waivered by Wing Safety.
   4.20.9. (Added-PACAF) . All non-registered LSVs and OGMVCs will be procured,
   accounted for, and maintained according to guidance provided in AFI 23-302 and this
   instruction. However, prior to 1 December 2004, numerous assets were procured as
   equipment items which exceeded established maximum speed criteria for LSVs. The
   following guidance applies to those LSVs acquired prior to 1 December 2004 which exceed
   established LSV criteria:
      4.20.9.1. (Added-PACAF) . Non-registered LSV and OGMVC assets exceeding
      established speed criteria and procured prior to 1 December 2004 may remain in use until
      they are no longer economically repairable. These assets will continue to be accounted
      for as non-registered LSV and OGMVC on unit equipment accounts under ASC 036.
      4.20.9.2. (Added-PACAF) . All non-registered LSVs in this category must have a
      placard placed in the asset, visible to the operator, which states ―LSV – Do not exceed 25
      mph/42 kph‖.
4.21. Withdrawing Vehicles from DRMS. The following procedures apply for withdrawing
vehicles from DRMS:
   4.21.1. Vehicles may be considered for withdrawal from DRMS only when an open
   authorization exists or when the vehicle in DRMS is in better condition than the vehicle
   assigned. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff must approve vehicles withdrawn from
   DRMS to be placed in the AF inventory. Vehicle Management must certify a vehicle as
   economically repairable and warrants withdrawal action.
   4.21.2. Vehicles previously identified as REMS reportable can be withdrawn for use in AF
   training courses as a Vehicle Management training aid for non over-the-road use with
   approval from MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. Submit request through the LRS
   Equipment Liaison Office (ELO).

Section 4D— Vehicle Authorization

4.22. Vehicle Requirements. Federal law controls the purchase of vehicles for government use.
Congress authorizes the purchase of government vehicles through the Appropriations Act and
sets statutory price limitations for purchasing of certain vehicles. Quantities listed in
authorization documents for vehicles determine budgetary requirements and must not include
additional assets for in-maintenance replacements, pipeline or vehicles in depot maintenance.
Meet peak workload and unusual requirements for vehicles by borrowing from other government
agencies, renting or leasing vehicles from GSA or commercial sources. POVs may be used on a
reimbursable basis according to the JTR.
   4.22.1. Limousines. Restrict the use of Class V sedans (see Figure 4.1) to these DOD
   officials and visiting foreign officials of comparable rank (Title 41 CFR, Chapter 101,
   Subpart 101-38.1 and 101-39.2):
       4.22.1.1. The Secretary of Defense.
       4.22.1.2. The Deputy Secretary of Defense.
       4.22.1.3. The Chairman, JCS.
   4.22.2. Large Sedans. Restrict the use of Class IV sedans to these DOD officials and to
   visiting foreign officials of comparable rank:
       4.22.2.1. The Secretaries of the AF, Army and Navy.
       4.22.2.2. The Chiefs of Staff of the AF, Army, Chief of Naval Operations and the
       Commandant of the Marine Corps.
       4.22.2.3. The Under Secretaries of Defense.
       4.22.2.4. All four-star officers.
       4.22.2.5. Directors of Defense Agencies.
       4.22.2.6. (DELETED) .
   4.22.3. Class III midsize sedans or SUV equivalent. Public Law stipulates that Class I or
   Class II vehicles be used to meet daily mission requirements. When Class I or Class II
   vehicles clearly do not meet mission requirements, Exception authority to authorize the use
   of Class III AFV or Hybrid vehicles must be fully justified and coordinated through the Base
   & MAJCOM/CC or equivalent. Once coordination is approved all requests for exception to
   policy will be submitted to HQ USAF/A4LE for AF/A4/7 consideration. MAJCOM, wing
   and unit commanders will heavily scrutinize any exceptions to policy that are not in line with
   the SECAF, CSAF and OSD policy.
   4.22.4. Class I or II. Passenger sedans, station wagons, mini-vans and SUVs acquired for
   support, other than those specified in paragraphs 4.22.1., 4.22.2. and 4.22.3 will be Class I
   or II.
       4.22.4.1. Wing commanders, equivalents or higher are no longer authorized an upgrade
       to a Class III AFV or non-AFV, sedan or SUV equivalent (refer to Table 1.3) since they
       are not required as a mission essential upgrade. With regulatory mandates to purchase,
       and the increased availability of AFVs, Class II AFVs must be used to the fullest extent
       possible. See paragraph 1.27 for further guidance.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      105


      4.22.4.2. Law Enforcement Sedans. The size of sedans authorized for use for law
      enforcement shall be the minimum size available with the equipment modifications
      necessary to meet mission requirements. Since the size of police-equipped vehicles
      varies by model year, fleet management activities may authorize sedans larger than Class
      II when the HQ USAF A4/7 has authorized procurement prior to acquisition if that class
      of vehicle is not factory equipped to perform the law enforcement mission.
   4.22.5. AF vehicle management activities are required to acquire (procure, rent and lease)
   and use the most fuel efficient vehicle to meet mission requirements in order to support the
   National Strategy for Energy Security, DOD 4500.36-R and this AFI. Refer to paragraph
   1.13 and 4.22.3 for AFV acquisition requirements.

Figure 4.1. GSA Sedan and Station Wagon Classifications.




4.23. Vehicle Authorization Review Authority. IAW Title 40 United States Code (USC)
Section 491, only the minimum number of vehicles necessary to support the mission should be
authorized. The wing MSG Commander or equivalent is the vehicle authorization review
authority for the installation. The MSG Commander or equivalent:
   4.23.1. Reviews and validates vehicle requirements and vehicle change requests.
   4.23.2. Recommends increases or decreases in vehicle authorizations.
   4.23.3. Reviews and approves the annual base vehicle buy submission.
   4.23.4. Approves the VPRL and vehicle MEL annually.
   4.23.5. Reviews the vehicle distribution and sourcing plan to support the Emergency War
   Order (EWO) and/or other contingency tasking during the BSP process.
   4.23.6. Evaluates effectiveness of the local rotation program using data in the annual
   utilization and rotation report.
   4.23.7. Considers the following to address additional vehicle authorizations:
      4.23.7.1. Use of vehicles from the U-Drive It (UDI) fleet to satisfy short duration or
      sporadic mission requirements.
106                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


       4.23.7.2. Types and quantities of vehicles must be clearly the minimum number to
       accomplish the mission.
       4.23.7.3. Do not authorize vehicles for reasons of grade, prestige, personal convenience
       or to individual persons except as previously stated.
       4.23.7.4. Review vehicles that do not meet AF or base utilization goals for possible
       authorization, deletion or rotation actions.
       4.23.7.5. Services staff engaged in direct administrative support may use general purpose
       vehicles acquired with appropriated funds. Do not acquire vehicles with appropriated
       funds justified either partially or wholly for transportation support of Morale, Welfare
       and Recreation (MWR) activities. See AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support for
       Morale and Recreation and Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for additional
       guidance.
4.24. AS. AS 010 identifies core AF owned vehicle allowances. Core allowances are those
allowances common to all AF commands. AS 012 identifies core AF leased vehicle allowances.
If a Basis of Issue (BOI) does not exist, a request to establish a BOI must be sent to the
MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. If approved by the MAJCOM, the request will be sent to
WR-ALC for final approval and inclusion in the applicable AS. ASs prescribe the required
authorizations for vehicles to accomplish functional and organizational missions. ASs constitute
authorization and approval authority for vehicles.
   4.24.1. ASs are identified in AFMAN 23-110v2. The ASs most commonly used in VM&A
   are:
       4.24.1.1. 048 – Excess: Unauthorized equipment on hand.
           4.24.1.1.1. (DELETED) .
       4.24.1.2. (DELETED) .
       4.24.1.3. (DELETED) .
       4.24.1.4. 051 - Contractor support (not AF replaced): Use when AF vehicles are
       Government Furnished Property (GFP) to a contractor and will not be replaced by the
       government (USAF). VM&A will not rotate vehicles to/from a contractor
       authorized/assigned under ASC 051. Authorizations under this allowance will be
       reduced/deleted upon final disposition of the vehicle.
       4.24.1.5. 054 - Special project: Use to report authorizations supporting a MAJCOM or
       USAF approved special project/program. 054 authorizations should not exceed 1 year.
       If the authorization is needed beyond the termination date, MAJCOMs will establish
       permanent authorizations using another AS or the authorization will be deleted.
       4.24.1.6. 076 - Base closure: Reports authorizations at installations projected for closing.
       4.24.1.7. 987 - A temporary authorization not to exceed 179 days: Use for short-term
       vehicle requirements or projects. A numeric Julian date will be used at the end of the AS
       (e.g., 9878014) to identify when the authorization expires. Consecutive 987
       authorizations for the same requirement or project are not authorized.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            107


       4.24.1.8. 034 - Contingency:      Reports authorizations at contingency locations (non-
       normalized) worldwide.
       4.24.1.9. 037 - Contractor support (AF replaced): Use when AF vehicles are GFP to a
       contractor and will be replaced by the government (USAF).
       4.24.1.10. 024 DEPOT specific support assets: Reports authorizations at DEPOT
       locations.
       4.24.1.11. 049 Research and Development Equipment (Vehicles) support assets.
4.25. Vehicle Justification Requests. Use MAJCOM approved format to justify adjustments to
vehicle requirements. Use the same form to justify vehicles if they are the same type, they
perform similar functions or they fall under the same ASC in the ASs. The AS is the allowance
document for validating vehicle authorizations and is not an authorization document. Initiate
follow-up disposition action after 60 calendar days.
   4.25.1. Authorization Analysis. VM&A will conduct an authorization analysis on all vehicle
   authorization requests. The objective of the analysis is to validate the requirement and
   determine whether a more effective avenue, such as short-term leasing or co-utilization of
   assets, can satisfy the requirement without adding additional authorizations. The VFM or
   VMS will use the conclusions of the analysis to make approval/disapproval
   recommendations through the LRS Commander or equivalent prior to submission to the
   MSG Commander or equivalent.
   4.25.2. Justification Requirements. Each of the following questions must be addressed and
   answered in the affirmative before the request can be sent to the applicable MAJCOM for
   disposition:
       4.25.2.1. Does the justification indicate the current VAL using activity or the proposed
       user?
       4.25.2.2. Does the justification cite the directive, project or publication that generated the
       request, if appropriate?
       4.25.2.3. Does the justification fully explain the proposed use of the vehicle?
       4.25.2.4. Does the justification identify expected utilization information (miles, hours,
       passengers, equipment, supplies, materials, number of trips, etc.)?
       4.25.2.5. Does the justification list the number of vehicles currently authorized and
       assigned to the requesting unit and justify why co-utilization will not meet mission
       requirements?
       4.25.2.6. Does the request justify why transportation support from Vehicle Operations
       (taxi or UDI) cannot satisfy the vehicle requirement (OLVIMS data must substantiate
       lack of support)?
       4.25.2.7. Does the justification include a mission impact statement on the organization,
       base or wing if the request is denied?
       4.25.2.8. Does the justification cite any actions taken to realign other authorizations to
       accommodate the requirement?           Note: The MSG Commander or equivalent
       signs/approves the justification package.

4.26. Control Numbers. Assign a control number to the vehicle justification package using
OLVIMS Fleet Module. For example; a 9-digit code like ―V91250001‖ where:
   4.26.1. ―V‖ denotes vehicle request.
   4.26.2. ―9125‖ denotes the Julian date the request was submitted to higher headquarters for
   action.
   4.26.3. ―0001‖ denotes the next available control number from the log for that Julian date.
4.27. Processing of Returned Vehicle Justification Requests. Requests returned will be
processed as follows:
   4.27.1. Update the OLVIMS Fleet Module control log approved or disapproved.
   4.27.2. Update the SBSS and VAL if approved.
   4.27.3. Notify the unit of approval or disapproval action.
   4.27.4. Maintain approved and disapproved justifications for 3 years. VFM or VMS may
   determine a longer retention period.
   4.27.5. Retain requests for special authorizations (048, 054, 987, etc.) for as long as the
   requirement exists.
4.28. Vehicle Allocations and Due-In Listing. Each MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff is
provided vehicle procurement allocation and delivery information from WR-ALC. The
MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff provides shipping information, to include add-ons such as
special paint, air conditioning, towing package, pintle hooks, heavy duty alternator, etc., to the
IM, and notifies each base VM&A of allocations they can expect to receive with delivery dates if
available. Changes affecting allocation or status information are provided to each installation
when they become available. Vehicle allocation listings (due-ins) should be updated as required.
This data is also used to validate annual vehicle buy requirements and as a source for vehicle
repair decisions. Note: MAJCOM MAFIS and base AFIS systems must be updated with current
vehicle due-in information.
4.29. Repair Authority and Disposition. Guidelines for determining repair allowances and
approval levels are in TO 36-1-191. Repair approval or disposition request is documented on an
AFTO Form 91 and routed through the VFM or VMS to the LRS Commander, equivalent
commander of equivalent or designee who has authority to exceed one-time repair limits.
   4.29.1. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicle disposition authority rests with the LRS/CC at Main
   Operations Base (MOB), and 607 ASUS/LGT for the COBs in Korea. The only exceptions
   to this policy are for those vehicles listed as AF critical in Vehicle Management Index File.
   Disposition requests for AF critical vehicles will be forwarded to OL-A PACAF/LGR at
   olahqpacaf.lgr.uc@robins.af.mil for action.

Section 4E— Vehicle Rental and Leases

4.30. Vehicle Rental and Lease Administration.
   4.30.1. DOD components may rent or lease motor vehicles when any of these conditions
   exist:
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      109


     4.30.1.1. An Economic Analysis (EA) verifies a cost benefit to the government.
     Reference AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, for EA requirements and procedures.
     4.30.1.2. Unforeseen requirements demand vehicles prior to acquisition through normal
     procurement.
     4.30.1.3. Local laws or Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) prevent using government
     vehicles.
     4.30.1.4. Normal REMS procedures or resources cannot fill the authorization.
  4.30.2. The leasing or rental of passenger sedans, station wagons, mini-vans and SUVs shall
  be limited to those designated as Class I and II by GSA. Class III and Class IV will not be
  rented or leased unless filling a valid Class III or Class IV requirement. Refer to paragraph
  4.22.3
  4.30.3. The requester may accept the next larger size vehicle (if rented/leased less than 60
  days) without obtaining SECAF approval if the rental agency does not have the authorized
  size vehicle. This does not apply to Class III and IV sedans.
  4.30.4. The LRS Commander or equivalent will coordinate on all lease requests prior to
  submission to contracting.
     4.30.4.1. VM&A validates all requests for rentals and leases for installation activities.
     Coordinate with contracting to ensure vehicles are not rented/leased without prior
     validation regardless of who funds for the rental/lease. Lease or rental may be executed
     with an AF Form 9 or, where guidance allows, GPC. A copy of the validated AF Form 9
     or related GPC documents will be retained in VM&A.
     4.30.4.2. VM&A will maintain a log of all leases/rentals. The log should list each
     purchase request in numerical sequence and the reason for its initiation. Note: CE
     occasional leases accomplished IAW paragraph 4.30.4.5 are not exempt from this
     requirement.
     4.30.4.3. Requesting units/users provide funds for each lease. Note: All requests for
     leases exceeding 60 days are justified using the MAJCOM-approved vehicle justification
     request format and forwarded to the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff for action
     before entering into a lease agreement through contracting. Approved requests must
     remain on file until the lease is terminated.
     4.30.4.4. Upon termination of a vehicle rental or lease, VM&A verifies and certifies
     charges.
     4.30.4.5. CE Special Purpose Equipment Leasing. Special consideration should be given
     to base-level CE activities concerning lease on demand of base maintenance and
     construction vehicles and vehicular equipment. The intention of offering this special
     consideration is to reduce AF infrastructure costs.
         4.30.4.5.1. VM&A personnel should jointly review the vehicles authorized for the
         CES with the unit VCO, VCNCO or other personnel as deemed appropriate focusing
         on vehicles with low utilization or open vehicle authorizations.
110                                        AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


          4.30.4.5.2. Open authorizations, vehicles with low utilization, or vehicle types with
          multiple assets assigned, should be considered for coding of the vehicle authorization
          for lease, with the assets assigned in those authorizations processed for disposition.
          4.30.4.5.3. In-turn, CES should enter into a lease on demand agreement with local
          vendors through use of BPAs or other firm fixed price contractual arrangements to
          provide required vehicle support on demand, without first processing the request
          through the base-level LRS. This arrangement accommodates charging the cost of the
          lease of construction and base maintenance vehicles and vehicular equipment to the
          specific project for which the vehicles are required, and expedites the lease process
          for the CE community.
          4.30.4.5.4. The special consideration described above is applicable to construction
          and base maintenance vehicles and vehicular equipment only. Under no
          circumstances will passenger-carrying vehicles be leased under the occasional use
          lease program.
      4.30.4.6. Fuel servicing vehicle lease requests will be coordinated with the MAJCOM
      Fuels Management Staff, AFPET and WR-ALC to ensure commercially available
      vehicles meet the compatibility, safety and servicing requirements of AF systems.
      Contact AFPET for baseline requirements for leasing aircraft fuel servicing vehicles.
   4.30.5. (Added-PACAF) . Leased vehicles will be loaded in OLVIMS in the following
   manner:
      4.30.5.1. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicles will be loaded under management code 8299.
      4.30.5.2. (Added-PACAF) . The word "Lease" will be entered in the NSN block.
      4.30.5.3. (Added-PACAF) . For Government Services Administration (GSA) vehicles
      use the GSA license plate number. For all other leases, request registration number
      through VEMSO.
4.31. Vehicle Lease Procedures.
   4.31.1. Short-Term Lease. LRS Commanders or equivalents may rent or lease vehicles to
   meet peak workloads and unusual or emergency requirements for periods not to exceed 1
   year (provided organizational O&M money is available) without established authorizations.
   For any rental or lease of vehicles exceeding 60 days, request written approval from the host
   MAJCOM identifying the vehicle type, quantity and duration of the lease. Use GSA vehicles
   if they are available. Confirm non-availability from the MAJCOM before executing a
   commercial lease exceeding 60 days for general purpose vehicles. Keep non-availability
   certification documents for 1 year. Do not use this authority to provide transportation for
   normal or routine purposes, when vehicles are available. Rentals or leases that exceed 1 year
   must have a valid authorization. Leases that exceed 18 months have to be coordinated with
   contracting and should be justified IAW DFARS Part 207.401. Concurrent leases are not
   authorized.
   4.31.2. Long-Term Lease. Leasing over 1-year is generally to fill open authorizations not
   filled through normal acquisition procedures.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        111


       4.31.2.1. Requests must be sent to the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff for
       approval. The MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff approves all lease requests and
       coordinates on all "lease with option to buy" clauses.
       4.31.2.2. VM&A reviews and validates all vehicle lease requests. VM&A will process
       requests to the MSG commander or equivalent for approval or disapproval
       recommendations. Forward the justification requests to the MAJCOM Vehicle
       Management Staff for processing.
           4.31.2.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . All vehicle order requests for GSA leased vehicles
           authorized on the PACAF VAL, regardless of the organization funding the vehicle
           lease or the Build Office Address Code (BOAC) the leased GSA vehicles fall under,
           will be coordinated with Vehicle Management prior to submission to GSA.
   4.31.3. Use short-term leases under 60 days to satisfy emergency requirements pending
   receipt of long-term lease approval.
4.32. Funding for Long-Term Leased Vehicles. Vehicle leases are funded by unit O&M
funds. When executing a long-term lease, contracts with option to buy require prior approval by
WR-ALC (see paragraph 4.33).
4.33. Lease with Option to Buy. Lease with option to buy is the preferred method of entering
into long-term vehicle leases per the FAR, Sections 7.401 and 7.402 and DFARS 207.401. WR-
ALC must approve all leases with an option to buy clause. In a lease with option to buy contract,
the cumulative lease costs and the cost to exercise the purchase option must not exceed the
purchase cost unless fully justified in writing.
   4.33.1. Once the lease asset is purchased, the authorization must be changed to budget code
   ―V‖ and a vehicle registration number must be requested through the MAJCOM Vehicle
   Management Staff.
4.34. Insurance Coverage and Maintenance for Rented or Leased Vehicles.
   4.34.1. ―For Hire‖ solicitations and resulting contracts provide insurance coverage as
   prescribed by applicable portions of the FARs. Unless the rental company requires
   purchasing insurance, rented or leased vehicles are obtained with the AF providing self-
   insurance.
   4.34.2. Vehicle operators conduct daily operator care on rented or leased vehicles unless
   otherwise specified in the contract.
   4.34.3. GSA approved local vendor performs all maintenance on rented or leased vehicles,
   unless a prior agreement is made showing it is more economical for the AF to perform
   maintenance, or a matter of military necessity. All waivers must be submitted and approved
   by AF/A4LE prior to any maintenance action taken on the vehicle fleet. AF/A4LE will only
   approve waivers based on the lack of a commercial maintenance facility within the local area
   or within the normal travel distance from the base.
   4.34.4. (Added-PACAF) . Only Andersen and Eielson have obtained a waiver to maintain
   GSA vehicles. No other VM activity will provide maintenance to GSA leased vehicles.
4.35. Installation of Radio Equipment in Rented or Leased Vehicles. When two-way radio
sets are required, hire vehicles having radio equipment already installed. Install radio sets in
112                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


government-owned, rented or leased vehicles when it is not economical to rent or lease
equipment. Use portable or non-fixed radios when feasible.
4.36. Exceptions for Acquiring, Renting or Leasing Foreign Made Buses. Federal law
requires the armed forces to use US manufactured buses to satisfy requirements, unless their use
is not economical or not in the best interest of the US. The rule applies when you purchase,
lease, rent or make contractual arrangements for transportation services. These are exceptions to
the Federal Law:
   4.36.1. When US manufactured buses are not available to meet requirements that cannot be
   postponed; foreign manufactured buses may be used temporarily. However, this time must
   not exceed the lead time required for acquiring and delivering US manufactured buses.
   MAJCOMs can submit a waiver request to AF/A4LE if it is not economically feasible to
   lease US manufactured buses.
   4.36.2. To meet a special but nonrecurring requirement or where a recurring requirement is
   sporadic and infrequent. The time of use must not exceed the time needed to meet the
   nonrecurring or recurring infrequent requirement.
   4.36.3. Where foreign manufactured buses are available at no direct or indirect acquisition
   cost to the US Government.

Section 4F—Identifying, Marking and Registering Motor Vehicles

4.37. Prescribed Identification. Except for vehicles hired for 60 days or less, vehicles acquired
for official purposes are identified by specific markings (Title 40 USC 491). Specific marking
instructions are in TO 36-1-191. Identification consists of three parts:
   4.37.1. Title of DOD component.
   4.37.2. The registration number.

      registration numbers canceled by the losing IM and new registration numbers assigned by
      the gaining IM.
      4.40.4.2. The responsible IM obtains registration numbers for vehicular support
      equipment from WR-ALC.These numbers must have an alpha "W" in the third position.
      They are not reportable in REMS.
   4.40.5. The VCO or VCNCO submits a request for a registration number to VM&A. The
   VFM or VMS forwards approved recommendations through the MAJCOM Vehicle
   Management Staff to the appropriate IM at WR-ALC for any vehicle that does not have a
   registration number but meets the above criteria. If doubt exists, VFM or VMS will request a
   registration number. The IM either assigns the number or advises VFM or VMS to request an
   X-registration number from the VEMSO.
114                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


       4.40.5.1. Registration number requests will include NSN, description, model year or year
       of manufacture, and chassis serial or VIN of the vehicle. AF Form 86, Request for

       date. Note: Specifications will not be ―gold-plated‖ with ―nice-to-have‖ items or
       capabilities.
4.48. First Article Testing (FAT). When required, a PWS should state that the
vendor/contractors must develop at least one first article vehicle for full testing. Commands may
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        117


observe and participate in these tests. VEMSO will observe and participate in tests with the lead
command. WR-ALC is the liaison in this effort.
   4.48.1. Test Parameters. When specified by the PWS, contractors define the test parameters
   for in-plant FAT. When possible, WR-ALC will provide a copy of the parameters to the lead
   command 15 days prior to the test. WR-ALC can address questions about the test parameters.
   4.48.2. Test Procedures. For tests in the factory, the manufacturer normally accomplishes the
   tests and the Defense Contract Administration Service (DCAS) monitors those tests.
       4.48.2.1. WR-ALC can require a second first article vehicle. Commands may assist in
       making that decision. Request a second prototype at the same time the specification
       review response is made. The lead commands provide recommended user test parameters
       and pass or fail criteria. Send the second prototype to the AF base designated by WR-
       ALC and the lead command.
       4.48.2.2. AF personnel and the manufacturer conduct tests at a base. The lead command
       ensures the primary users of the vehicle participate in the tests.
       4.48.2.3. The lead command forwards a report of the test results to WR-ALC 15 days
       after the test is complete.
       4.48.2.4. WR-ALC makes the final decision on specifications, revisions, user test
       parameters and pass or fail criteria.
   4.48.3. Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). Use OT&E procedures on major 463L
   MHE, aircraft tow vehicles, large refueling vehicles and most crash fire equipment. The lead
   command and the Vehicle System Program Manager coordinate the use of OT&E on vehicle
   types within 6 weeks after the Annual Buy Budget Review.

Section 4I— Performance-Based Work Statement Government Furnished Property (GFP)
Requirements

4.49. Policy. IAW FAR 45, contractors are provided GFP when it is clearly demonstrated that it
is in the Government’s best interest, that the overall benefit to the procurement significantly
outweighs the increased cost of administration, including ultimate property disposal; that the
assumption of risk by the Government is not substantially greater if property were not provided;
or that Government requirements cannot otherwise be met. The contactor(s) will assume sole
responsibility for all associated utilization costs of the GFP vehicles, including operations,
maintenance, repair and replacement. The contractor(s) will determine replacement based on best
business practices/replacement criteria.
   4.49.1. Activities must obtain MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff approval prior to
   including any government-owned vehicles as GFP in a PWS.
   4.49.2. If GFP includes government vehicles, consult FAR Part 45.3 and AFFARS Part
   5345.304.
       4.49.2.1. Use AS 037, Appropriated Funded Vehicles for Contractors, when AF vehicles
       are provided as ―agency-peculiar‖ GFP to a contractor and the AF is responsible for
       providing replacements.
118                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   4.49.3. When a contract requires AF vehicles be provided as GFP to a contractor and the
   vehicles will not be replaced by the government, ensure the vehicles are identified and
   retained on the contract GFP listings. As identified in FAR 45, the contractor will be
   accountable for the GFP vehicles, eliminating the requirement for SBSS reporting in REMS.
   4.49.4. GFP assets will be accounted for by coding ASC 051, Contractor Support and on
   GFP contract listings. Appropriate coding establishes assets will not be replaced by the
   government and allows quick review and accountability of GFP assets. VM&A will not
   rotate vehicles to/from a contractor authorized/assigned under ASC 051. The installation
   contracting officer, or designee, may authorize disposal of GFP vehicle assets through
   DRMS or other available options. The installation contracting office will coordinate with
   Vehicle Management for possible redistribution prior to any disposition actions. The
   government identify if the contractor(s) is responsible for obtaining replacement vehicles. At
   the end of a given contract, all GFP vehicles with residual value will be transferred as GFP
   vehicles on subsequent contracts. The number and type vehicles proposed for transfer to the
   contractor should be included in the PWS. A memorandum stating the equipment will be
   available prior to or on the contract start date is to accompany the PWS. Authorizations under
   this allowance will be reduced/deleted upon turn in of the asset to DRMS.
   4.49.5. AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, Chapter 9, provides direction
   pertaining to furnishing existing government property. Units should apply the decision matrix
   in Table 6-1 to determine the potential advantage of providing GFP.
      4.49.5.1. If after applying the matrix, the host unit determines government furnished
      vehicles are potentially advantageous to the Government and the host Financial Analysis
      Office will perform a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) to substantiate the cost advantage of
      providing vehicles.
          4.49.5.1.1. The CBA will include a Certificate of Satisfactory EA stating the analysis
          follows AFI 65-501 and AFMAN 65-506, Economic Analysis, guidance. The
          Certificate of Satisfactory EA will include signed coordination with base Finance,
          Contracting and Vehicle Management.
          4.49.5.1.2. Vehicle leases in support of a contract will be the responsibility of the
          contractor.
          4.49.5.1.3. Vehicles owned or provided by the contractor are not subject to the
          management policies contained in this instruction. In very rare instances, Vehicle
          Management may provide maintenance support on a reimbursable basis only, if
          approved by the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff.
          4.49.5.1.4. The Government procurement process may not be used to purchase
          replacement vehicles for contractors. If the Government pays the contractor the
          purchase price of a vehicle, that vehicle becomes a Government asset.
   4.49.6. If the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) is the successful bidder, assets will revert
   to the original authorizations under the respective AF and MAJCOM AS. However, there is
   potential for MAJCOMs to direct reductions based on MEO bid proposals.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                     119


  4.49.7. GFP vehicles will not be used on any contract other than for which the vehicles were
  provided, unless approved by the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff. Submit all requests
  through the applicable MAJCOM or DRU Vehicle Management Staffs.
  4.49.8. The procedures for managing the allocation, use, operation and maintenance of AF
  motor vehicles are applicable to assets furnished to contractors, except as exempted in
  paragraph 4.44.1.2
  4.49.9. IAW Title 41 CFR 101-38.301 1., government furnished vehicles are for official use
  only.

   4.63.8. VMIF (https://webapps.robins.af.mil/vehicle/vmif/). This file is the source
   document for several data elements used in VM&A for management of the vehicle fleet.
   Section II of the file provides NSNs, management codes, replacement criteria and standard
   pricing information for all vehicles. Use of this section helps correct programming of
   OLVIMS vehicle master records and communications compatibility between VMIF and
   SBSS functions within the LRS. This file provides information for identifying suitable
   substitutes for similar vehicle types.
       4.63.8.1. (DELETED) .
4.64. The Importance of Analysis.
   4.64.1. Effective vehicle management includes continuous process improvement by
   constantly assessing customer needs, analyzing services and monitoring efficiency, economy,
   utilization and cost of the vehicle fleet. The VFM and VMS are responsible for ensuring the
   analysis for evaluating fleet performance is accomplished. Recommendations from an
   analysis must be validated and documented.             Fully document decisions, process
   improvements or corrective action taken as a result of analyst recommendations. Monitoring
   and controlling performance indicators (metrics) are usually done by exception when
   requested by VFM or VMS; however, the following indicators will be monitored monthly:
       4.64.1.1. NMC rates.
       4.64.1.2. Costs (per mile, per vehicle, and total).
       4.64.1.3. Maintenance (scheduled, delayed, and unscheduled).
       4.64.1.4. Labor-hours (direct, indirect productive and indirect non-productive).
       4.64.1.5. Authorization analysis.
       4.64.1.6. Utilization/rotation analysis.
   4.64.2. VM&A is the focal point for collecting, accumulating, storing and analyzing vehicle
   data.
4.65. Degree of Analysis. Circumstances will dictate varying degrees of analysis. VFM or
VMS makes the call as to what performance indicator will be analyzed, charted, plotted or
otherwise trended, and sets the frequencies for such analysis. OLVIMS product control number
SB004-115 should satisfy the data display requirements.
   4.65.1. The level of performance achieved or the symptomatic condition of the indicator
   dictates which analysis action to follow.
       4.65.1.1. An indicator well within a set standard may not need any more analysis for that
       reporting period.
       4.65.1.2. An indicator just barely within a standard may need some analysis for that
       reporting period; it may need some analysis to find out why, whether corrective action is
       needed or other areas it may affect.
       4.65.1.3. An indicator that points to poor performance, worsening trends or unfavorable
       effects that may go on if not stopped, calls for in-depth analysis. In-depth analysis is
       "analysis that shows a performance deficiency or failure to reach a goal, explains why,
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           123


       shows the effect of the deficiency or substandard performance and outlines action that
       will help reach the goal‖.
   4.65.2. Analysis of the areas set by commanders or equivalents, MAJCOM, VFM and VMS
   make up most of the analysis effort by VM&A. The analyst must be aware of the savings in
   manpower and material cost, and the greater mission capabilities that may be gained by a
   more detailed analysis. During an in-depth analysis, certain factors perceived as the primary
   cause of the problem may not be the root of the problem. The scope of the analysis, then, is
   expanded, the true cause determined and corrective action identified.
   4.65.3. Independent studies and analyses may not provide a definite conclusion when viewed
   alone. There are times when a larger base of data will be needed; a sampling may need a
   longer span of time; a first look shows nothing significant is expected to result; or when the
   end can be confidently predicted without doing a formal study.
   4.65.4. Studies and analyses may take the analyst out of the office. The analyst goes where
   the data is or where the process is conducted; this may require reviewing vehicle records
   jackets and vehicle historical records in VM&A, material cost data in Materiel Control, and
   sometimes working with a supervisor in the work center.
4.66. Using Analysis Products. The use of analysis helps management project existing
capabilities into plans and schedules and institute controls against variation. The results of the
review and analysis of collected data are needed in all successful planning phases. To be of
benefit, analyses and recommendations are used as soon as possible after completion.
Presentations are brief, factual, easily understood and must show the picture as it presently
exists. Most effective analysis is in response to VFM or VMS requests for special studies.
   4.66.1. HQ USAF, MAJCOMs or individual installations may impose standards or develop
   goals for performance measurement.
       4.66.1.1. Standards or goals developed by a MAJCOM are tempered with considerations
       such as geographical location, seasonal peculiarities, military and civilian staff mix, fleet
       age or composition, and parts availability.
       4.66.1.2. A large part of resource management is based on comparing a computed
       average to set standards that allow the significance of a bulk of data to be understood in a
       single value. An average may be the usual amount, rate, quality or time.
   4.66.2. A goal is a measure taken by general consent to be a basis for comparison. A
   standard may be based on analyzing past data alone, past data weighed with known values or
   on expert opinion. In any event, the criterion for making a valid standard or goal is founded
   on objectivity, suitability and reality. Some sources from which realistic goals may be set
   are: Existing programs, maintenance reports, historical reports and records, and unit plans
   and needs.
   4.66.3. The analysis process addresses two distinct phases that may or may not be used
   together. They are production analysis and deficiency analysis.
       4.66.3.1. Through data gathering and surveillance, production analysis is used to identify
       problems, highlight any that need additional study and identify areas that may represent a
       standard of excellence.
124                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


       4.66.3.2. The real troubleshooting is done through deficiency analysis as a key part of
       the analysis process. Perform deficiency analysis to whatever degree is needed to
       highlight and bring undesirable performance to an acceptable level.
4.67. Method of Presentation. For standardization, a way to present each performance
indicator is given as part of that indicator. For each of the indicators, the level of performance
achieved needs to be graphically displayed in chart form.
   4.67.1. If an indicator does not meet the established standard or goal, the VFM or VMS
   should be informed to determine if an in-depth analysis is needed.
   4.67.2. The analysis or study narrative addresses such things as the primary cause of the
   problem, factors that affect it, recommendations for correcting the deficiency and anticipated
   time required for correction. A narrative may be required on all standard indicators each
   month by the VFM or VMS.
4.68. Presentation of the Analysis.
   4.68.1. Some general presentation rules are:
       4.68.1.1. Understanding that the value of management information lies in its being used
       while it is still valid and current. Strive for its use by the appropriate personnel.
       4.68.1.2. Use flexible rules and techniques. There are circumstances when it may be
       impossible to show a result properly if forced to conform to a rigid method. When
       possible, comply with the rules, but deviate if it allows better analysis.
       4.68.1.3. Make a briefing which covers the collected data in a professional way.
       Briefings address such things as "what, where, how, when and why", and suggest
       corrective or preventive actions. Briefings are concise, clear and easily understood by
       those to whom they are directed.
       4.68.1.4. Set up a program to coordinate analysis findings with the VFM or VMS before
       the formal presentation to the LRS Commander or equivalent each month or as
       scheduled.
   4.68.2. Show statistical or narrative data in some usable form. Properly tabulate and arrange
   data for analysis or projection. Data credibility suffers when shown in a confusing or
   unfamiliar way. Keep it simple and key the presentation to those who will review it. The
   following aids in making graphic presentations:
       4.68.2.1. Plan the construction in advance; keep it simple, honest and accurate. Do not
       give the wrong impression.
       4.68.2.2. Start scale values at zero or bracket the reference point, and keep the
       background clear of unnecessary gridlines.
       4.68.2.3. Name the presentation fully and accurately; use one subject at a time to keep
       from crowding the material.
       4.68.2.4. Use short but complete notes where necessary and be sure the presentation is
       informative.
4.69. Performance Indicators (Metrics). Standard indicators have been developed to provide
a basis for measuring the performance of each level of Vehicle Management. The VFM, VMS,
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                            125


LRS Commander or equivalent, or MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs make use of these, or
develop their own indicators to meet their own circumstances. Indicators are analyzed as
prescribed by the VFM or VMS and recommended actions provided if the performance does not
meet minimum standards. Standard performance indicators have been automated and can be
obtained each month by producing PCN SB004-115 (OLVIMS Automated Analysis).
4.70. Specific Performance Indicators. Unless otherwise stated, goals or standards for
performance measurement are set by MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs, VFMs or VMSs.
They also set the rules for charting or trending the indicators that can be tracked as either "Fleet"
or "Registered Vehicles.‖ See AFCSM 24-1 for explanations and examples of performance
charts that are part of the OLVIMS PCN SB004-115, Automated Analysis Report. The
remainder of this paragraph covers the standard indicators and MAJCOM Vehicle Management
Staffs, VFMs or VMSs optional indicators.
   4.70.1. Cost Analysis. O&M analysis is required to ensure that money and manpower are
   not wasted. The analysis should identify unfavorable cost trends and prime vehicles or
   groups of vehicles using large amounts of labor or material. O&M costs are combined and
   shown as a single cost.
       4.70.1.1. Average cost Per Unit is Indicator #1 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 1 through
       31, Attachment 6, for analysis procedures.
       4.70.1.2. Average cost Per Mile (Administrative Fleet) is Indicator #2 on PCN SB004-
       115. See rules 1 through 31, Attachment 6, for analysis procedures.
   4.70.2. NMCM Hours to Direct Labor-Hours Percentage. A shop’s ability to respond to
   workload may be measured by use of this indicator. It checks the percentage of direct
   productive labor-hours in relation to the number of NMCM hours on AF Forms 1823/1823-1.
   The intent is to keep the spread of these two factors to a minimum.
       4.70.2.1. NMCM Hours or Direct Labor-Hour Ratio (Closed Work Orders) is Indicator
       #3 on PCN SB004-115. See rule 32, Attachment 6, for analysis procedures.
   4.70.3. Indicator #4 on PCN SB004-115 is no longer valid and should be disregarded.
   4.70.4. Number of PM&Is Overdue is Indicator #5 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 66
   through 71 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   4.70.5. Number of Work Orders Opened is Indicator #6 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 12
   through 14 and 31 through 46 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   4.70.6. Number of Hours in Delay Code "C" is Indicator #7 on PCN SB004-115. See rules
   61 through 65 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. As a minimum, these shops will
   manually accumulate the total backlog hours and track, chart, or analyze at least two
   categories, hours with parts on hand and other delayed hours. Over a 12-month period, these
   shops should be able to develop an acceptable level of backlog hours, which will result in
   efficient shop management.
   4.70.7. Percent Direct Labor is Indicator #8 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 54 through 58 of
   Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   4.70.8. Percent Indirect Labor Productive is Indicator #9 on PCN SB004-115. See rule 59 of
   Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
126                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   4.70.9. Percent Indirect Labor Nonproductive is Indicator #10 on PCN SB004-115. See rule
   60 of Attachment 6 for analysis procedures. VM&A personnel may use rules 54 through 60
   in Attachment 6 and the data in OLVIMS PCNs SB004-028, SB004-029 and SB004-032 to
   check on labor usage by work center.
   4.70.10. Percent of Fleet NMCM is Indicator #11 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 31 through
   46 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   4.70.11. Percent of Fleet NMCS is Indicator #12 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 47 through
   53 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   4.70.12. Percent of Fleet NMC is Indicator #13 on PCN SB004-115. See rules 31 through
   53 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   4.70.13. Percent Hours NMC by Vehicle Group or Category is Indicators #14 through #22
   on PCN SB004-115. See rules 31 through 53 in Attachment 6 for analysis procedures.
   When there are enough vehicles in each category, a graph is printed for:
       4.70.13.1. General Purpose Vehicles. USAF Registration Numbers that contain a "B" or
       a "K".
       4.70.13.2. Construction and base maintenance vehicles and equipment. USAF
       Registration Numbers that contain a "D" or "M".
       4.70.13.3. Registered non-reportable Vehicular Equipment.             USAF Registration
       Numbers that contain a "W".
       4.70.13.4. 463L MHE. USAF Registration Numbers that contain an "E‖.
       4.70.13.5. MHE (non-463L). USAF Registration Numbers that contain an "E", with
       selected USAF management codes.
       4.70.13.6. Fire Trucks. USAF Registration Numbers that contain a "C" or "L".
       4.70.13.7. Refueling Vehicles and Equipment. USAF Registration Numbers that contain
       a "C" or "L" with selected USAF management codes.
       4.70.13.8. Special Purpose Vehicles and Equipment. USAF Registration Numbers that
       contain a "C" or "L" (other than fire trucks and refuelers) with selected USAF
       management codes.
       4.70.13.9. Non-registered Vehicles and Equipment. USAF management codes that begin
       with a numeric character. Note: VM&A personnel may use rules 31 through 53 in
       Attachment 6 and the data in OLVIMS’ PCNs SB004-008 or SB004-032 to see which
       vehicles or groups of vehicles have abnormal NMC rates on a scale other than the groups
       seen above.
4.71. Other Indicators. There is a continuing need to check and measure motor vehicle related
statistical and historical data beyond that outlined in this chapter. There is almost no end to the
material to be reviewed, just as there is no end to the need to improve customer service and save
resources. While some of the following areas may well be used as a part of a major analysis, they
also lend themselves to independent tests and analyses. In some way, each of the areas affects the
outcome of the total vehicle management effort. They are not listed in priority order, nor can
any one be singled out as being more important than the other. The analyst must weigh each on
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          127


a basis of what the goal is at a given time. The remainder of this paragraph covers "other
indicators" that can be monitored at the direction of the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs,
VFM or VMS, who may set goals to gauge the effectiveness of these indicators.
   4.71.1. Repeat Maintenance. This is often found to be one of the main causes of high costs
   and low MC rates. A high occurrence of repeat maintenance may indicate improper
   scheduling, inadequate quality control, failure to use test equipment to diagnose malfunctions
   or the need for training. Use OLVIMS PCN SB004-032, particularly Part 10, to see which
   vehicles or equipment items are in and out of the shop too often. Also, see rule 14 in
   Attachment 6 for analysis guidance.
   4.71.2. Contract Maintenance and Other Government Agency costs. By analyzing these
   costs, it may be possible to identify inadequate manning, skill levels, shop layout, tools and
   equipment, and the extent to which in-house capabilities may be improved. It may be best to
   check these indicators in major vehicle categories. See OLVIMS PCN SB004-032 for the
   data to be used in this review. See rules 35 and 36 of Attachment 6 for analysis guidance.
4.72. Areas to Monitor. The following areas do not need to be charted, but should be checked
by VM&A:
   4.72.1. Vehicle and Equipment Work Order Status. Remove appropriate AF Forms
   1823/1823-1 from the Work Order Master File Status Report (PCN SB004-018) on a timely
   basis. Validate AF Forms 1823/1823-1 on the list 45 days or longer.
   4.72.2. Transient Vehicles. Mail, fax or electronically transmit the vehicle repair transaction
   (PCN SB004-019) report and fuel report to the vehicle’s home base as soon as they are
   received.
4.73. Controlling and Evaluating Problem Areas. When unfavorable trends or indicators are
present, VM&A can use Attachment 6 to identify problem areas and their causes and effects.
Attachment 6 also reflects suggested review procedures and preventive measures. When
performing analysis, refrain from using inflation as a cause for increased cost-per-mile, the aging
fleet for increased NMCM rates or other often used "crutches‖.
   4.73.1. When investigating the cause of poor performance or when trying to isolate the
   prime reasons for a bad trend, try all the procedures listed in Attachment 6.
   4.73.2. All situations are not in Attachment 6; conditions that are command or base related
   may affect a situation in one case and may not in another.

Section 4L— Depot Maintenance Program

4.74. Depot Maintenance Program. VM&A is responsible for the effective use of the depot
program.
   4.74.1. Initiate and plan depot repair needs IAW TO 36-1-191. Note: Prior to submitting
   vehicles for depot overhaul, review the vehicle due-in listing to ensure a future need exists
   for the overhauled asset.
       4.74.1.1. At the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs discretion, capture vehicle
       downtime. Retain vehicle record in master file while vehicle is undergoing depot rebuild
       so that vehicle downtime is accurately documented.
128                                        AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      4.74.1.2. The downtime begins when the vehicle is removed from service and the
      shipping LTI is accomplished (this 4000 work order remains open). Downtime ends after
      the vehicle returns from depot, the acceptance LTI is accomplished and the vehicle is
      available for use. There will be no accounting of vehicle downtime if the vehicle is being
      shipped to depot and will not return to the shipping base.
      4.74.1.3. Capture depot rebuild cost. Process a ―JZ‖ transaction to capture the cost of
      depot rebuild when the vehicle returns from depot (JZ transaction is generated by the JZ
      screen that may be seen on the PCN SB004-005, edit list. JZ is used to charge the
      contract cost and establish contract warranty information). The cost will include
      transportation and actual depot repair costs. JZ transactions are limited to $99,999 per
      month/quarter. If depot and shipping costs exceed $80,000, split the cost evenly and
      capture the remaining cost the following month/quarter. Depot cost is provided by WR-
      ALC to the MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff, which subsequently forwards the cost
      data to the base. Contact your local TMF for the shipping cost to depot. Use this same
      shipping cost for the return cost from depot.
      4.74.1.4. Ensure depot rebuild date is captured and properly loaded via the AZ (years
      and months) in OLVIMS to prevent premature movement into replacement codes A-J,
      reference AFCSM 24-1 (AZ transaction used to load/update/delete a vehicle (static
      data)).

Section 4O— Interagency Motor Pools and Systems

4.79. Interagency Motor Pools and Systems. Title 10 U.S.C, 133(d) delegates authority to the
Secretaries of the Army, Navy and AF to establish and operate interagency motor pools and
systems. Title 40 USC 486 gives this responsibility to the Administrator of GSA for the actual
132                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


establishment and operation. GSA develops necessary data and cost statistics to determine the
economic feasibility of establishing a motor pool in an area. DOD components are notified if
consolidation is feasible.
   4.79.1. Services Provided by Interagency Motor Pools:
       4.79.1.1. Rent vehicles by the month.
       4.79.1.2. Maintain and provide Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POL) for other
       government-owned vehicles.

   4.79.2. Discontinuing Interagency Motor Pools. If an established interagency motor pool
   fails to achieve a savings during a reasonable period, i.e., 2 successive FYs, the GSA
   administrator gives a 60-day notification to discontinue the pool.
   4.79.3. Managing GSA Vehicles. Use GSA vehicles for official purposes only. If leasing
   GSA vehicles is more expensive than using AF-owned vehicles, or the AF cannot resolve
   operational problems with the interagency Motor Pool, AF activities will send full details
   through channels to HQ USAF/A4LE for resolution.

Section 4P— Interservice Vehicle Support Agreements

4.80. Interservice Vehicle Support. Interservice support among DOD components will be
used where economies can be realized without impairing mission effectiveness. DODI 4000.19,
―Interservice and Intergovernmental Support‖, implements DOD policy concerning Interservice
support. As a rule, the DOD component having the greater AOR (equipment and manpower)
furnishes the support requested to the extent capabilities and military commitments permit.
4.81. Arranging for Interservice Vehicle Support. Arrangements for Interservice support
generally provide that DOD components furnishing the service may not assume any liability
whatsoever for personal injury or property damage caused by any vehicle while it is in the
custody of the using component. The using DOD components must:
   4.81.1. Assume the cost of picking up and delivering vehicles.
   4.81.2. Properly operate, maintain and use vehicles in their custody.
   4.81.3. Take administrative action relating to damage or theft of the motor vehicle in their
   custody.
   4.81.4. Assume responsibility for any damages resulting from accidents, abuses or incidents
   while the vehicle is in their possession.

   4.82.1. Operates where it will be most economical or provides the most satisfactory
   transportation service.
   4.82.2. Pools full or partial transportation assets of separate activities. The pool segments are
   located within an area most convenient to the majority of the vehicle users.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        133


   4.82.3. Is administered by a lead activity designated by the components. It may be
   subdivided locally as necessary. Agreements for activity pooling are sent through channels to
   HQ USAF/A4LE for coordination.

Section 4Q—VVV

4.83. VVV. VEMSO is required to perform a complete review of all installations’ vehicle
authorizations every 3 to 5 years depending on established trigger points. A message should be
sent out annually to inform the bases of the scheduled VVVs. When a VVV is within 30 days of
the visit, another message should be sent to that particular base. These visits should either be
performed on site at each servicing VM&A or conducted electronically via email, teleconference
and/or VTC. The trigger point determines which of these methods to use.
   4.83.1. Vehicle justification packages will not be accepted by VEMSO 3 months prior to the
   start of the VVV. A 1-year moratorium on new vehicle justification packages will be in place
   once validation is completed.

          of towable aerospace ground equipment for Aircraft Maintenance, etc.).
   4.83.3. VEMSO (with the assistance of MAJCOM Vehicle Management staffs) will conduct
   preliminary meetings with key lead command FAMs (i.e., CE, fire department, fuel
   management, SFS, etc.) prior to each VVV. The meetings should include discussions on the
   following:
      4.83.3.1. Purpose of visit.
      4.83.3.2. Known concerns for each specialty.

                                  MATERIEL CONTROL

Section 5A— General Information

5.1. Description of Materiel Control.
   5.1.1. Materiel Control provides support to Vehicle Management using the SBSS, COPARS,
   Alternate Parts Procurement System (APPS) or other decentralized purchasing methods.
   Materiel Control manages SBSS transactions for management. Any action deviating from
   the procedures and guidance listed in this chapter must first be approved by HQ
   USAF/A4LE.
       5.1.1.1. COPARS is a DOD approved method of supplementing SBSS and for getting
       commercially available automotive parts. It reduces research, item identification times
       and costs for parts that are not stock listed or cataloged. Ideally located next to
       COPARS, Materiel Control personnel have many contacts with the contractor each duty
       day. This relationship makes it most important that all Materiel Control personnel read
       and know the terms of the contract. Vehicle Management activities wishing to establish a
       COPARS contract should contact their local Contracting Officer for more information.
       5.1.1.2. Decentralized purchasing methods, such as a BPA or GPC, may be more
       appropriate for some Vehicle Management activities than methods such as COPARS.
       The Contracting Officer is the source for information and advice on COPARS, BPAs and
       GPC provisions.
       5.1.1.3. BPAs for parts purchases are individual contracts with parts suppliers.
       Contracting negotiates for authorized items and discounts. They also surveil the BPA.
       Vehicle Management provides funds and manpower to identify, order requirements and
       document part procurement/ purchase activity for internal purposes. Vehicle Management
       may provide funds; however, they do not have authority to purchase (unless it is by GPC)
       nor do they document contract activities. Base Contracting does not provide surveillance
       on BPAs.
       5.1.1.4. GPC is a credit card used for purchasing parts and services within the parameters
       of the program. Contracting approves its use, trains the cardholder and manages the
       program. Vehicle Management nominates cardholder(s) who become Purchasing
       Agent(s), and are responsible for identifying and buying only authorized items,
       negotiating discounts and documenting GPC purchases.
       5.1.1.5. (Added-PACAF) . PACAF manages a formal commercial automotive parts
       and services support function, the Vehicle Parts Supply Organization (VPSO) at 3rd LRS,
       Vehicle Management Flight, Elmendorf AFB. Specifics on the use of VPSO can be
       found in PACAF Manual 24-302. Units are encouraged to use VPSO to fill their needs
       for non-MICAP commercial vehicle component repair (i.e., hydraulic cylinder rebuild,
       re-chroming, engine machine work and overhaul, etc), and for procurement of hard-to-
       find parts that are not available through normal DoD supply channels in time to meet
       local mission needs.

   5.1.2. Materiel Control is not a unit supply function. The VFM or VMS ensures supply
   functions unrelated to Vehicle Management needs are not given to Materiel Control.
   5.1.3. Manpower for Materiel Control is limited.
   5.1.4. The management personnel supervising Materiel Control may not have much
   exposure to supply procedures, but they must have a basic understanding of the job to
   properly supervise personnel, evaluate supply support and make knowledgeable performance
   ratings. SBSS provides customer training IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13,
   Standard Base Supply Customer’s Procedures, to fulfill part of this requirement. Where this
   training leaves off, this chapter explains supply terms and complicated procedures in
   language familiar to the maintenance worker.
   5.1.5. The scope of Materiel Control operations requires additional emphasis on training,
   because these specialists must maintain proficiency in the supply career field as well as
   develop a basic understanding of maintenance.
       5.1.5.1. The VFM and VMS ensures Materiel Control personnel become fully qualified
       in all aspects of the operation, including the use of SBSS, OLVIMS, COPARS
       procedures and all management products.
       5.1.5.2. A qualification training program is set up for all newly assigned personnel to
       ensure they receive proficiency training as soon as possible.
   5.1.6. The concepts and procedures outlined here ensure compatibility with AFMAN 23-
   110, Volume 2, Part 2, and AFCSM 24-1. At the ALCs, use AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part
   2, D035K Users Manual, with this chapter. At bases with a manual supply system, use
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 1, Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF),
   with this chapter.
   5.1.7. Overseas commands are authorized to establish requirements contracts (BPAs) for
   procurement of parts and supplies to support foreign buy vehicles. Overseas MAJCOMs
   develop procedures for the effective security, control, documentation and issue of parts
   purchased through BPAs. Authority to bypass the stock fund is provided in AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 2, Part 10, Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) Supply Management Activity Group
   (SMAG).

  items with the work center supervisor and VFM or VMS. In addition, coordinate bench stock
  items with the LRS Bench Stock Support Section.
  5.2.10. Manage centralized bench/working stocks. Review bench/working stocks with the
  work center supervisor and VFM or VMS. In addition, review bench stock items with the
  LRS Bench Stock Support Section.
  5.2.11. Coordinate procedures with outlying work centers to ensure high-cost bench/working
  stock items are charged to the proper AF Form 1823/1.
  5.2.12. Coordinate all repair cycle asset matters with the LRS Flight Service Center. This
  includes set up, inventory, reconciliation and management of supply points; turn in of
  serviceable and unserviceable assets, management of Due In From Maintenance (DIFM)
  assets, Awaiting Parts (AWP) and listings.
  5.2.13. Materiel Control should coordinate with the VM&A Workload Controller on
  appropriate DIFM status and process, and return DIFM assets to the LRS Flight Service
  Center as soon as possible.
  5.2.14. Inventory, store and list work order residue. When the VFM or VMS determines
  residue is no longer required, process turn-ins to the LRS Demand Processing Section or the
  DRMS IAW appropriate procedures.
  5.2.15. Assist the work center supervisor when requesting adjusted levels (AF Form 1996,
  Adjusted Stock Level) to support new and mission essential vehicles. Act as the focal point
  for the adjusted stock level review, and ensure changes reflect current mission and vehicle
  requirements.
  5.2.16. Assist with and perform parts research.
  5.2.17. Advise the Functional Commander or Functional Director of any COPARS
  problems.
  5.2.18. Keep a daily record of COPARS funds on funds ledger and tell the Functional
  Commander or Functional Director when the cost of the delivery order is 85 percent
  obligated. A computerized spreadsheet may be used as the funds ledger.
  5.2.19. Ensure the most economical parts are purchased. Order the least expensive part
  (including rebuilt items) when shop records do not show poor performance, less service life
  or reliability problems with rebuilt items.
  5.2.20. Query parts dealers to ensure new, rebuilt or after-market parts for all vehicles and
  equipment meet or exceed OEM specifications before ordering parts. Note: Individual parts
  are not specifically nuclear-certified by any manufacturer; however, any part is acceptable
  for use on certified vehicles and equipment if the part meets or exceeds the OEM
  specifications.

   backorder validation with VM&A.
   5.2.25. Utilize the HAZMART to the fullest extent. Ensure the AF Form 3952,
   Chemical/Hazardous Material Request Authorization, reflects an appropriate quantity to
   fulfill mission requirements but not create undue waste. An approved AF Form 3952 must be
   on file for any HAZMAT purchase regardless of purchasing method.

       5.4.2.8. Quick reference lists, as applicable.
5.5. Use of Reports and Listings in Materiel Control. Various reports and listings are
available from the SBSS and ALC supply systems for managing supply support for the shop.
Some of these reports are sent automatically; others are sent based on local needs. All reports are
listed in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 24, for SBSS bases. AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 3, Part 2, Chapter 14, Output Products, discusses the ALC base counterpart. All reports
should be neatly bound in order that they may be easily used. The following paragraphs describe
the basic uses of the most significant reports and listings (AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13,
explains most reports):
   5.5.1. The Daily Document Register (D04) is made in document number sequence and is a
   comprehensive review of the previous day’s supply transactions. It shows exceptional
   transactions that may require analysis; answers questions about supply that the shop may
   have and points out possible abuses of the supply system. It will be checked each duty day
   for issues, due-out releases and cancellation information.
   5.5.2. The Priority Monitor Report (D18) is reviewed each duty day for Urgency of Need
   Designator (UND) "A" requirements and weekly for UND "B" requirements. (The weekly
   and monthly reports exclude bench stock, equipment and supply point requirements). It lists
   outstanding due-outs for each item. It is used to validate all back ordered parts for delayed
   AF Form 1823s or AF Form 1823s.
   5.5.3. The AWP Validation Listing (D19) shows the required information to manage DIFM
   assets, to maintain a current inventory of DIFM items and to reconcile DIFM balances.
   5.5.4. The Supply Point Listing (Q13) lists all items authorized, on hand and due out to the
   supply point. It also has summary data on shortages, excesses and identification of buildup
   items.
   5.5.5. The Organization Bench Stock Listing (SO4) lists all bench stock items for each
   activity that applies. It can be used to find items in the bench stock, to check bench stock
   authorizations and to add new bench stock items. This listing is shown in NSN and item
   number sequence.
   5.5.6. The Due-out Validation (M30) provides data for review of UND "A" and "B" priority
   due-outs. It is also a managerial tool for validating all UND "C" due-outs monthly (except
   equipment, which is validated at least quarterly).
   5.5.7. The Stock Number Directory (M14) (frequently called SNUD) is a monthly list of all
   NSNs stored in the SBSS. It tells whether an item has been loaded in the computer as well as
   data about the item (unit price, unit of issue, source of supply and so forth). Due to its
   volume, this directory is not sent automatically and only a small number of copies are made.
   Materiel Control should tell the Management Systems Flight that it would like a copy of the
   previous month’s list.
5.6. Supply Discipline. Supply discipline is essential to good materiel management and applies
to all personnel. Responsibilities are identified in AFI 23-111, Management of Government
Property in Possession of the Air Force.
   5.6.1. A reparable is as important as a serviceable item, since the reparable may be the only
   source of supply. SBSS considers a DIFM detail as a potentially serviceable asset and will
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           141


   print an I023 Asset Management notice on an issue request. Reparable assets removed from
   the end item must be promptly sent through repair channels and controlled throughout the
   repair cycle. Local vendors and COPARS often require a reparable item (core) before a
   serviceable one is sold.
   5.6.2. Double ordering from any source wastes funds, reduces credibility and does not serve
   the shop well. Do not use such practices.
5.7. Priority System. There are five main terms that all Materiel Control personnel should
know:
   5.7.1. Force Activity Designator (FAD). Each organization is assigned a FAD (1 through 5)
   by the JCS through the USAF Program Document. The organizational FAD indicates the
   relative priority of a unit. The FAD code is loaded in the SBSS and will be loaded in
   OLVIMS. Vehicle Management, as a support unit, is rarely assigned a FAD as high as many
   of the vehicles it works on (such as flight line vehicles, fire trucks, etc.). In these cases the
   FAD of the mission supported by the vehicle should be used to order the parts needed for
   maintenance.
   5.7.2. UND. The UND is a one-character alpha code, used to indicate the urgency of the
   need. There are three primary UNDs: A, B and C.
      5.7.2.1. UND "A" means a lack of the requested item prevents mission accomplishment.
      5.7.2.2. UND "B" means lack of the item impairs mission accomplishment.
      5.7.2.3. UND "C" is used for routine needs not meeting the criteria for a higher UND.
      5.7.2.4. ―1‖ is a fourth UND used to indicate a verified NMCS condition for a MICAP
      reportable vehicle.
   5.7.3. Urgency Justification Code (UJC). The UJC is a two-character code that shows the
   priority and use of the required part (see AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11,
   Customer Requirements). The first character of the UJC is the UND; the second character is
   an alpha code assigned to the type of equipment being worked on. In the case of vehicles,
   the assigned code is "F" or "Q.‖ When requesting most parts from the LRS Demand
   Processing Section, Materiel Control uses UJC 1F, AF, BF, BQ or CQ.
   5.7.4. Base Delivery Priority. A local delivery priority is assigned by Materiel Control for
   each demand placed in SBSS. The delivery priorities are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part
   2.
   5.7.5. Requisition Priority. The requisition priority is assigned by the SBSS computer based
   on a combination of the FAD code of the requesting organization (or the supported vehicle, if
   FAD override is used) and the UND code. When the property is not available in LRS supply
   system for immediate issue, this priority tells the source of supply the level of urgency.
5.8. Coordination between Materiel Control and OLVIMS. Materiel Control has a key role
in ensuring all materiel costs are properly charged in OLVIMS.
   5.8.1. This part of the AFI integrates Materiel Control’s procedural responsibilities for
   OLVIMS with its other responsibilities. AFCSM 24-1 gives further procedures for
   expenditure data input and output using OLVIMS (see Figure 5.1 for cross-reference listing).

   5.8.2. Materiel Control personnel must know all aspects of the materiel costing process.
   VM&A is the focal point for OLVIMS and is the main source of information and training for
   new personnel. Also VM&A is the POC for keeping all personnel informed of system
   changes. The information in Figure 5.1 is provided for a quick reference of OLVIMS
   formats and listings used by Materiel Control. All references are from AFCSM 24-1.

High Cost Bench Stock Master List                                                  Section 9
   5.8.3. Materiel costs for purchases are inputted in OLVIMS. Items are charged in three
   different ways; to the:
       5.8.3.1. Vehicle on which the item is used.
       5.8.3.2. "High-Cost Bench Stock" account (work order number H8888), for items of
       bench stock or working stock costing $60 or more per unit. Do not charge these items to a
       specific vehicle until the parts are installed.
       5.8.3.3. "Low-Cost Bench Stock" account (work order number L9999), for items with a
       unit of use cost of less than $60. These costs are charged as overhead against the entire
       fleet, rather than to a specific vehicle.
   5.8.4. Items are further identified by charge codes for maintenance or non-chargeable costs
   (D, M or N). The requester assigns these codes and Materiel Control verifies them. For
   examples of items to be charged to D, M or N, see AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4.
5.9. Adjusted Stock Levels. Adjusted levels provide a means to change base stock levels and
are used when usage experience is not the best predictor of future needs. When wisely used,
adjusted levels are a valuable tool in supporting the mission. Because AF resources are limited,
the approval of an adjusted level frequently means that fewer dollars are available to buy items
with established consumption rates. Requests for adjusted levels must be carefully considered.
Procedures are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 19, Stockage Policy.
   5.9.1. Requests for adjusted levels are sent to the LRS Stock Control Section on an AF Form
   1996, Adjusted Stock Level. This form is used to request a change to stocked levels, not to
   bench stock minimum reserve levels.
   5.9.2. Materiel Control initiates the AF Form 1996 in five copies, with help from the
   requester. The VFM or VMS signs as the approving authority.
   5.9.3. One copy of the AF Form 1996 is held in a suspense file, three copies are sent to
   Stock Control Section and one is sent to the requester.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           143


   5.9.4. Initiate follow-up actions if Materiel Control is not notified within 10 days for items
   that require base-level approval or 45 days for items that require IM approval. When
   notification is received, inform the requester, remove the copy from the suspense file and file
   the approved AF Form 1996.
       5.9.4.1. Approved requests are filed in Materiel Control to use during adjusted level
       reviews.
       5.9.4.2. Rejected requests are reviewed with the requester to see whether more action is
       needed.

Section 5C—Issue Procedures

5.10. General Information. This section discusses procedures used in obtaining off-the-shelf
parts from LRS. To be effective, Materiel Control personnel must know the procedures of the
supply system they work with (SBSS, GPC, COPARS or BPAs). These procedures supplement
supply procedures, and generally apply to requesting parts for NMCS and delayed AF Form
1823/1823-1s. The LRS Customer Service & Training Section gives supply system training
when requested. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, outlines detailed procedures used in issue
requests.
5.11. Identifying the Requirement.
   5.11.1. This section discusses guidelines for determining the source of supply and describes
   the procedures to use. This is one of the most critical aspects of materiel support for the shop.
   Attention to detail in this process goes a long way in ensuring that the right part is ordered
   the first time.
   5.11.2. The technician helps Materiel Control determine the following information about the
   item:
       5.11.2.1. NSN, part numbers and associated manufacturer’s codes.
       5.11.2.2. Nomenclature.
       5.11.2.3. Quantity.
       5.11.2.4. TO, figure and index.
       5.11.2.5. UND. See paragraph 5.7.2
       5.11.2.6. FAD from the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
       5.11.2.7. Management code.
       5.11.2.8. Make and model of vehicle.
       5.11.2.9. Source code, when available. Check the format of the TO; if no code is
       available or item is coded Local Purchase (LP), COPARS or other sources may be used.
       5.11.2.10. VIN.
5.12. Requests Sent Through LRS Demand Processing.
   5.12.1. Document all parts requested through LRS Demand Processing Section by one of
   three methods:
144                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      5.12.1.1. Initiate AF Form 2005 according to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
      Chapter 11. Give Demand Processing the original and one copy. Hold a copy in suspense
      until the transaction appears on the D04, D22 (with OLVIMS transaction) and the
      property is received. If the transaction fails to appear on the D04 on the next computer
      processing day, follow up with demand processing to find out the status of the
      transaction.
      5.12.1.2. Log all parts requested on AF Form 2413, Supply Control Log. Column G
      contains the work order number and Column N (Mark For) contains the vehicle
      registration number. Once property is received, highlight the entire entry. Items not
      highlighted are considered active requests.
      5.12.1.3. Use a locally created database to track part ordering. Procedures are the same
      as AF Form 2413 in the preceding paragraph.
   5.12.2. Several actions take place when an item is issued from LRS Demand Processing
   Section:
      5.12.2.1. The part is delivered along with a DD Form 1348-1A. The part is checked
      against the suspensed AF Form 2005, supply control log entry or locally developed
      database to ensure the correct item was received. Clearly annotate the AF Form 2005, AF
      Form 2413 or locally developed database to show receipt of property.
      5.12.2.2. Using the D04, verify receipt of all issues and due-out releases. Initiate follow-
      up actions on any property not received by the next duty day.
      5.12.2.3. Using the D22, verify the following fields prior to uploading into OLVIMS and
      forwarding to VM&A:
         5.12.2.3.1. Compatibility of charge code and item (example: A tire FSC 2610 with a
         charge code 0 is incorrect).
         5.12.2.3.2. Validity of work order number (example: Real work order number is
         B1234 but shows F1234; L9999 or H8888 improperly used).
         5.12.2.3.3. Suspected unit of issue or extended cost errors.
         5.12.2.3.4. Verification of the cost on issues of $500 or more.
      5.12.2.4. To clear the AF Form 2005 issue suspense, supply control log suspense entry or
      locally developed database entry, Materiel Control must receive both the OLVIMS
      transaction and the item.
      5.12.2.5. Useful data on the D22 listing includes:
         5.12.2.5.1. Heading "CC.‖ On an issue, an "R" or "N,‖ if present shows the demand
         code; on a turn-in, the coded entry indicates the action taken.
         5.12.2.5.2. Heading "UJC.‖ This column is blank for off-the-shelf issues; the
         urgency of need code is shown for all delayed and NMCS issues.
         5.12.2.5.3. Heading "RVP.‖ This column contains an "R" when a transaction was
         reversed out of the SBBS.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          145


       5.12.2.6. VM&A inputs the ―VZ‖ transaction into OLVIMS. This transaction charges or
       reverses costs for items received from or turned in to the LRS Demand Processing
       Section. All transactions are shown on PCN SB004 - 005. Those that pass all edits (see
       AFCSM 24-1) reflect an Input Record Accepted (IRA) status on the right hand side of the
       list under column "RCDS-1.‖ If there are any errors shown by the system, an "IRE"
       appears in the columns, as well as an asterisk (*) to the right of the field in error. VM&A
       should be able to correct any error shown for these transactions.
       5.12.2.7. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staff may authorize alternative methods to
       check on the receipt of OLVIMS materiel costing transactions and property.
5.13. Requests Submitted Through COPARS. A valid AF Form 1823 or work order number
is required to submit request and receive items from COPARS. Organizations other than the LRS
will use their appropriate document to purchase parts from COPARS.
5.14. Requests Submitted Through BPA or GPC. The sales slip or invoice is the source
document for updating OLVIMS. After screening the sales slip or invoice, Materiel Control
forwards it to VM&A for the transaction input into OLVIMS. A separate "PZ" transaction is
input for each item (except L9999 or H8888) and will be shown on PCN SB004-005.

Section 5D—Vehicle NMCS Processing

5.15. General Information. When the required parts are not available from SBSS or other
sources, the vehicle is designated as NMCS. AFI 23-106, Assignment and Use of Standard
Reporting Designators, provides justification and guidance for the use of Standard Reporting
Designators (SRD). A NMCS condition starts extraordinary supply action by Materiel Control.
Track NMCS-reportable vehicles by the MICAP reporting system (if applicable) and the depot
IM until the need has been met. This section describes the procedures Materiel Control uses in
handling NMCS conditions. MICAP-reportable vehicles are found in the SRD list in Integrated
Maintenance Data Systems (IMDS) and Supply Systems. A quick-reference list is provided in
Attachment 3. Non-MICAP requisitions coded with a NMCS and AF UJC are authorized to
include a ―777‖ RDD. The ―777‖ identifies the item for fast transportation (AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9, Requisitioning). Materiel Control personnel will ensure the
judicious use of this code. The VFM and VMS will ensure appropriate emphasis is placed on
parts procurement priorities by periodically verifying compliance as necessary to meet mission
requirements.
   5.15.1. (Added-PACAF) . Vehicles deadlined for parts will be carried as NMCS,
   regardless of funding status. Only serviceable vehicles released to the user are "L" coded for
   funds (if funds are not available).
5.16. NMCS Verification Procedures. Prompt, responsive verification is the key to preventing
unwarranted NMCS conditions, cannibalizations, priority system abuses and unnecessary funds
abuse.
   5.16.1. Order UND "A" and "B" requests on a "fill" or "kill" basis, except AWP requests.
       5.16.1.1. When assets are not available to fill the request, a "kill" action takes place and
       the computer prints an I023 Other Assets Management Notice.
146                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      5.16.1.2. Information on the I023 includes: DIFM details, supply point details with on-
      hand balances, substitute NSNs with the requested Interchangeable Substitute Group
      (ISG) with serviceable balances, percent base repair and whether the item is on a bench
      stock.
      5.16.1.3. Materiel Control immediately verifies the need.
   5.16.2. Verification of requirements includes the following steps:
      5.16.2.1. Materiel Control researches part numbers, TO figure and index, next higher
      assembly or bits and pieces, usable-on-codes, quantity per assembly and source codes.
      5.16.2.2. The verifier checks availability of bench stock assets. If none are available, but
      a substitute item is, the verifier contacts the requester to find out whether it is suitable. If
      the substitute is suitable, Materiel Control makes the necessary arrangements with the
      shop with the bench stock.
      5.16.2.3. If DIFM assets are available, coordinate with the shop work center to expedite
      repair and return of the reparable to satisfy the request in time to meet the need. Materiel
      Control will not verify a repair cycle item as NMCS until it is found that an item cannot
      be fixed locally.
      5.16.2.4. Research the next higher assembly, find out its availability and suitability.
      5.16.2.5. Check the delayed part bins for needed item. Use the PCN SB004-016,
      ―Delayed Parts Received‖, as an aid to find whether other vehicles of the same type have
      delayed parts on hand. If so, complete an AF Form 1832, Record of Cannibalization
      (Vehicle Maintenance), transferring the parts from the delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1 to
      a NMCS AF Form 1823/1823-1. Send the AF Form 1823/1823-1 to VM&A where an
      "SW" transaction is made to charge the materiel cost from the delayed record to the open
      NMCS AF Form 1823/1823-1. Materiel Control submits the parts request for the delayed
      part, using the delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1’s number. The delayed AF Form
      1823/1823-1 should be marked accordingly.
      5.16.2.6. If the above actions have still not met the need, consider locally manufacturing
      the part within the shop. If there is no internal capability to do this, find out whether the
      capability exists elsewhere on-base. If a base shop is found that can fabricate the part,
      contact LRS Demand Processing Section and send the request as outlined in AFMAN 23-
      110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11.
      5.16.2.7. If a new part cannot be obtained, a serviceable used part can be purchased
      under a separate contract on a one-time basis.
      5.16.2.8. Notify requester to determine further actions on UND ―B‖ requests.
      5.16.2.9. If a part is not available for a UND "A" need, the verifier tells the work center
      supervisor or VM&A Workload Controller to verify that a NMCS condition exists. At
      this time, the VFM or VMS decides whether to cannibalize or to confirm an NMCS
      condition. If the VFM or VMS decides the latter, put the start time on the AF Form
      1823/1823-1.
5.17. MICAP and NMCS (AF Requisitions).
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      147


   5.17.1. Items backordered for a MICAP or NMCS condition (UJC 1F/AF) are shown on the
   Priority Monitor Report (D18). Review the report when received to ensure the supply system
   is acting on the request. Materiel Control verifies the following data:
       5.17.1.1. NSN.
       5.17.1.2. Quantity.
       5.17.1.3. Vehicle registration number.
       5.17.1.4. SRD. SRDs that apply to vehicles are in the IMDS and Supply Systems for
       query. NOTE: PCN SG054-84S, Standard Reporting Designator Codes, lists all SRDs.
       An extract from this report of commonly used vehicle and equipment MICAP Reportable
       SRDs is provided in Attachment 3.If the NMCS part does not appear or does not have a
       due-in date the day after the need has been levied, SBSS should be contacted to find the
       cause and correct it.
   5.17.2. D18 (see AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 5, Due-Out Processing, for
   more details). Status should be on the report within a given number of days, based on
   Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) priority.
   5.17.3. This status is posted to a status board or automated equivalent, and updated as
   changes occur. The NMCS status board or automated equivalent, has the following
   minimum data and must be readily available in the Materiel Control work center:
       5.17.3.1. Type of vehicle.
       5.17.3.2. Vehicle registration number.
       5.17.3.3. NSN or part number.
       5.17.3.4. Nomenclature.
       5.17.3.5. Quantity and unit of issue.
       5.17.3.6. Due-out document number.
       5.17.3.7. MICAP (1F) or NMCS (AF) backorder date (a color code may be used to
       differentiate between MICAP or NMCS).
       5.17.3.8. Current status.
       5.17.3.9. Source of supply.
   5.17.4. The VFM or VMS makes a policy on which MICAP and NMCS conditions they
   want briefed on and how often. Also set up a general procedure as to what is unsatisfactory
   status, thus requiring more action. Overseas bases supported by the Commercial
   Administrative Vehicle Repair Parts Program, under Project Code JZO, JCM and JZC, look
   at status policies as outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 11, Special
   Logistic Support Procedures, before making this determination. With these procedures,
   Materiel Control can keep key management personnel informed on NMCS status and provide
   follow-up supply assistance or supply difficulty action with SBSS, as the case dictates. The
   Materiel Control supervisor ensures that follow-up management actions are tailored to
   specific shop needs rather than a system of arbitrary follow up.
5.18. Supply Assistance and Difficulty.
148                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   5.18.1. Materiel Control will submit follow-up, supply assistance or supply difficulty action
   when bad status is received from the depot. Materiel Control will never allow ineffective
   supply support to be traced to a lack of aggressive follow up on its part.
   5.18.2. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9, outlines the procedures for following
   up on established due-outs. AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 1, outlines the
   policy for sending supply difficulty reports.
   5.18.3. Materiel Control maintains a copy of each request for supply assistance or difficulty
   with the appropriate MICAP, NMCS or delayed requisition.
5.19. NMCS Requirements through BPA, COPARS or GPC.
   5.19.1. View items in this category similarly to those requested through SBSS. Materiel
   Control must contact the vendor each duty day for current status.
   5.19.2. Annotate MICAP and NMCS items ordered through BPA or GPC with the correct
   data on the NMCS status board or automated equivalent.
5.20. Receipt of NMCS Parts.
   5.20.1. Materiel Control immediately informs the VM&A Workload Controller when a
   NMCS part is received so it may be scheduled for work. The parts are binned and the AF
   Form 1823/1 or parts ordering form marked accordingly. Mark the suspense copy of AF
   Form 2005 or the line entry in the supply control log to show that the part is received.
   5.20.2. An OLVIMS transaction should be received the day following the due-out release.
   After verification against the data on the suspense slip or line entry on AF Form 2413, the
   OLVIMS transaction is sent to VM&A and the AF Form 2005 can be destroyed. The
   suspended entry on the control log clearly shows that both the OLVIMS transaction and the
   part have been received.
   5.20.3. BPA or GPC parts received are binned and documented on the AF Form 1823/1823-
   1s. The sales receipt or invoice is reviewed for accuracy. The AF Form 1823/1823-1s and
   sales receipt or invoice is forwarded to VM&A for input into OLVIMS and scheduling of the
   repair.

Section 5E— Managing AF Form 1823/1823-1s Delayed for Parts

5.21. Importance of Delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1s. When a lack of parts does not cause a
NMCS condition, a delayed-for-parts AF Form 1823/1823-1 is initiated and the vehicle is
returned to the user. Delayed parts management is the heart of supply support for the preventive
maintenance program. The importance of this function grows as vehicles get older. Although
delayed parts have a lower priority than NMCS, they need special attention by Materiel Control
to ensure that positive action is taken for each request.
5.22. Delayed Work Order Folders.
   5.22.1. When an AF Form 1823/1823-1 has been delayed for parts, workload control
   VM&A makes a new AF Form 1823/1823-1 with all the required information, and sends a
   copy of the AF Form 1823/1823-1 and the parts request to Materiel Control for processing.
   All parts backordered through SBSS are marked on AF Form 2005 or the supply control log.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           149


       5.22.1.1. (Added-PACAF) . Joint VM&A/Materiel Control validation of delayed work
       orders will be conducted at least quarterly. Maintain a file of the last 4 quarters
       validation.
   5.22.2. VFM or VMS determines filing sequence of delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1s folders.
5.23. Monitoring Delayed Work Orders.
   5.23.1. For items requested through SBSS, the first check comes the day after the backorder
   requests are processed. The D04 is sent to Materiel Control for screening. Using the AF
   Form 2005 suspense file, supply control log, AF Form 1823/1823-1 or parts ordering request,
   Materiel Control verifies all backordered items appear correctly on the D04. The D04 also
   shows all issues, due-out release actions, turn-ins and cancellations. If cancellation action is
   noted, research the cancellation and either reorder using the appropriate NSN or eliminate the
   suspense.
   5.23.2. For items ordered with an UND "A" or "B‖, the Daily Priority Monitor report (D18)
   tells the user the latest status of the backorder. The D18 is reviewed each duty day. If the
   status shown in the report is unsatisfactory, Materiel Control begins follow-up, supply
   assistance or supply difficulty action.
   5.23.3. For items ordered through COPARS, Materiel Control coordinates with the vendor
   for status updates IAW the contract requirements.
   5.23.4. For items ordered through BPA or GPC, Materiel Control coordinates with the
   vendor for status updates. Frequent follow up is essential to prevent unnecessary NMC time.
   5.23.5. The Delayed Maintenance Report (PCN SB004-015) also gives information for
   management to track delayed actions. This report shows all delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1s
   with required action by delayed maintenance code.
5.24. Processing Parts Receipts.
   5.24.1. Take the following steps when receiving parts from SBSS, COPARS, BPA or GPC.
   Mark the suspense slip, AF Form 1823/1823-1, parts ordering form or supply control log to
   show the receipt. Hold the parts until the work can be scheduled. Mark the parts with the
   work order number and registration number, and bin them. Parts for the same vehicle may be
   binned together regardless of work order number. Do not mix bench stock, working stock,
   work order residue or delayed parts. Mark the AF Form 1823/1823-1 and parts ordering form
   (Materiel Control’s copy) with the bin location in the space provided. Then forward the
   information to VM&A.
   5.24.2. When the OLVIMS transaction is received from SBSS, verify the data against the
   suspense copy of the AF Form 2005, parts ordering form or the supply control log, before
   sending to VM&A for input in OLVIMS.
   5.24.3. The receipt process for COPARS, BPA or GPC delayed parts is essentially the same.
   Mark the AF Form 1823/1823-1s with the bin location and advise the VM&A Workload
   Controller of its receipt. Verify sales slips or parts receipts and/or invoices before forwarding
   them to VM&A. VM&A inputs a "PZ" transaction into OLVIMS containing a "D" charge
   code and a bin location number.
5.25. Work Order and Backorder Validation.
150                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   5.25.1. Screen UND "A" or "B" requirements and validate as outlined in AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11. The basic record used to do the validation is the Materiel
   Control copy of the delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1.
   5.25.2. Despite these efforts, the manual records used to track delayed AF Form 1823/1823-
   1s often disagree with the true needs of the individual vehicles. Consequently, Materiel
   Control, together with the VM&A Workload Controller, conducts an AF Form 1823/1823-1-
   to-backorder reconciliation and validation.
       5.25.2.1. Reconcile all work orders either monthly or quarterly, or as directed by the
       VFM or VMS, in conjunction with the monthly UND "A‖, "B," and "C" validation
       outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 13, Chapter 5.
       5.25.2.2. The first step in the validation process is a line-item review for each delayed
       AF Form 1823/1823-1. Materiel Control compares its entire delayed AF Form
       1823/1823-1 file to the VM&A Workload Controller's file of delayed AF Form
       1823/1823-1s. The delayed maintenance report is used at this time. Update both sets of
       AF Form 1823/1823-1s and the delayed maintenance report as needed, to bring all into
       agreement. Resolve discrepancies before updating to ensure all records are accurate. If
       there are large differences between these two files, the local procedures for coordination
       between the two functional units should be evaluated to find the cause.
       5.25.2.3. After VM&A and Materiel Control reconcile AF Form 1823/1823-1 records,
       Materiel Control ensures all necessary parts are backordered and reflect positive status
       through SBSS, COPARS, BPA or GPC. Materiel Control cancels the backorder for items
       no longer needed.
       5.25.2.4. Materiel Control will accomplish a complete inventory on all AF Form
       1823/1823-1s against which items have been received verifying bin location and quantity.
       If, after a complete search, the items are not available, the shortages are recorded and
       reordered. If this is a common occurrence, implement a local procedure to ensure parts
       are adequately safeguarded.
       5.25.2.5. When these actions have been done:
          5.25.2.5.1. All records should be in complete agreement.
          5.25.2.5.2. All AF Form 1823/1823-1s should be shown on the PCN SB004-015
          report with the partial or complete parts indicator.
          5.25.2.5.3. All parts should have been backordered with positive status (including
          follow-up) or be on-hand.
5.26. Partial or Completed Vehicle and Equipment Work Orders. Materiel Control sends
the completed work order to the VM&A Workload Controller for scheduling. Each time a new
work order is opened on a vehicle, all delayed work orders are thoroughly screened. Every
attempt is made to install received parts or accomplish maintenance that will complete any job
listed in the job description block of the work order.

Section 5F— Bench Stocks
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       151


5.27. Purpose of Bench Stocks. Bench stocks are established so that expendable supplies
needed to support the shop are always available. Failure to establish the proper line items and
levels disrupts the shop and can be costly. Bench stock responsibilities and procedures for its
establishment and operation are in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11.
5.28. Establishment of Bench Stocks. Establishment of a bench stock is a coordinated effort
between Vehicle Management and Bench Stock Support. When available, a vehicle ISSL or
FOSSL may be used as a guide in identifying the items and quantities to be stocked. When an
ISSL or FOSSL is not available, the shop or work center supervisor makes a list, based on his or
her estimate and judgment of the need. The VFM or VMS approves the bench stock and
Materiel Control sends the request to Bench Stock Support according to AFMAN 23-110,
Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11. Once bench stock is established, a copy of the Bench Stock
Listing (S04) should be readily available and used.
5.29. Shop and Co-located Bench Stocks, Working Stocks and Work Order Residues.
   5.29.1. Shop bench stocks, working stocks and work order residues may be set up within
   each Vehicle Management shop or its equivalent. Where two or more shops are co--located,
   a single bench stock, working stock and work order residue for their combined use is set up.
   NOTE: Bench stocks, working stocks and work order residue can be co-located; however,
   they must be separated and binned properly binned.
   5.29.2. Under certain circumstances, it may be more advantageous (because of location, total
   number of line items, cost or pilferage) to secure the bench stock, working stock and work
   order residue, and operate it under a staffed environment. When the VFM or VMS finds this
   to be more advantageous, consider consolidating this bench stock,, working stock and work
   order residue with a tool room in the work area. In any event, the overriding factor is the
   need of the shop.
   5.29.3. When using co-located bench stocks, working stocks and work order residues, units
   may want to display a bench stock "shadow board" outside the bench stock site, to be readily
   viewed by all personnel. Old and unserviceable parts for each item authorized can be shown,
   with the item or bin number under each asset as an easy means to show its location. Item
   descriptions may also be used in some cases.
5.30. Low-Cost Bench Stocks.
   5.30.1. In Vehicle Management, authorized bench stock items whose unit cost (based on a
   unit-of-use issue from bench stock to an AF Form 1823/1823-1) is less than $60 are low-cost
   bench stock. (For example, if a box of 12 fittings costs $67.50 and they are issued one at a
   time, the fittings would be shown as low cost).
       5.30.1.1. Replenish low-cost bench stock items using work order number L9999. This
       work order number is limited to "low-cost" items on authorized bench stock. The
       purpose of work order number L9999 is to prorate the cost of commonly used low-cost
       bench stock items against the total cost of maintaining the base fleet.
           5.30.1.1.1. Low-cost parts that do not qualify as bench stock items may be purchased
           through COPARS, BPA or GPC using the work order number or the vehicle
           registration number when an AF Form 1827 is used for minor repairs.
152                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   5.30.2. Low-cost items may be on other unit bench stocks or working stocks. Replenishment
   of bench stock items is IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2 Chapter 11. Note: If
   applicable, COPARS working stocks are usually drawn from COPARS like other items.
   GPC working stock is replenished by Materiel Control, not to exceed the quantity authorized
   as determined by the VFM or VMS.
   5.30.3. Bases are authorized to maintain shop stock. Shop stocks include parts kits consisting
   of universal-type hardware for brake systems, hydraulic systems, electrical systems, etc.,
   which are not normally economically handled as bench/working stocks. VFM or VMS
   establish procedures for effective control and management of shop stock.
5.31. High-Cost Bench Stocks.
   5.31.1. Items with a unit cost of $60 or more are defined as "high cost.‖ Fast-moving, high-
   cost items can be authorized on bench stock when approved by the VFM or VMS. Replenish
   high-cost bench stock using work order number H8888. Use of H8888 causes the parts to be
   charged against a special "holding" account, rather than against the entire base fleet. When
   the high-cost items are issued to specific AF Form 1823/1823-1s, they are charged against a
   vehicle using a ―QZ‖ transaction. Note: Review paragraph 5.43 for additional guidance.
   High-cost working stock items are not installed on a vehicle using an AF Form 1827.
   5.31.2. On approval of the VFM or VMS, Materiel Control or VM&A completes an "EZ"
   transaction (see AFCSM 24-1) to add the item to the High-Cost Bench Stock Master List,
   PCN SB004-046.
   5.31.3. Make a line-item entry or attach a preprinted label to the vehicle’s AF Form
   1823/1823-1 for each high-cost bench stock item issued.
   5.31.4. Materiel Control keeps a current copy of the PCN SB004-046 listing. At least
   quarterly, adjust the prices on the PCN SB004-046 based on the latest M14, the current
   COPARS price list or vendor’s price if purchased with the GPC.
       5.31.4.1. Delete items no longer on high-cost bench stock using an "ED" transaction.
       Input of this transaction clears the item from the PCN SB004-046.
   5.31.5. Request a new PCN SB004-046 listing when all changes, additions and deletions are
   made.
5.32. Shelf-Life Items. Control of shelf-life items is the responsibility of the Shop
Bench/Working Stock Monitor once the items are placed in their bench/working stocks. Shelf-
life items are identified in TOs, by markings on the package and on the bench/working stock
labels by the shelf-life code. If the shelf-life item is packaged in a unit pack, the unit pack
containing a quantity nearest the recommended level is issued as the authorized bench/working
stock quantity. Use the oldest items first to prevent waste, First In First Out (FIFO).
   5.32.1. Do not open shelf-life item containers until needed. If shelf-life items are loose in the
   bin and the expiration cannot be found, dispose of the items and replenish.
   5.32.2. Shelf-life items containing a HAZMAT will normally be controlled by the base
   HAZMART. These items will only be issued in pre-authorized quantities to those shops
   authorized the material. Return unused, yet serviceable, HAZMAT to HAZMART if there is
   no immediate need. HAZMATs which have a shelf life are to be purchased for Vehicle
   Management only in a quantity that can be used before its shelf life expires.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        153


5.33. Bench Stock Review. This is the standard method of adding, changing or deleting bench
stock items. The bench stock review will be conducted IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2,
Chapter 11, Attachment 11D-10.
   5.33.1. (DELETED) .
5.34. Working Stock.
   5.34.1. Working stock is essential to ensure certain fast-moving items are available at the
   Vehicle Management work site to reduce vehicle repair time. VFM and VMS cautiously
   weigh the costs against the benefits when approving stockage. A separate working stock
   account is established for each outlying work center when approved by the VFM or VMS.
   Maintain a locally developed working stock computer listing for each separate account. The
   listing reflects the following information as a minimum:
       5.34.1.1. Part description.
       5.34.1.2. Part number.
       5.34.1.3. Unit of issue.
       5.34.1.4. Unit price.
       5.34.1.5. Quantity authorized.
       5.34.1.6. Bin location number.
       5.34.1.7. Low or high cost item.
   5.34.2. Working stock is limited to a 4-week level (based on past experience or
   consumption). Certain bulk items (such as heater hose, etc.) are cheaper and easier to manage
   when bought in bulk; working stocks may be authorized for these and for seasonal items,
   even if their rate of use is low.
   5.34.3. Working stock replenishment is ordered against an L9999 work order number for
   lowcost items (items with a unit cost of less than $60) and an H8888 work order number for
   high-cost items (items with a unit cost of $60 or greater). Low-cost working stock items
   replenished using work order number L9999 are prorated against the entire fleet in the
   overhead labor rate. These items are not charged against individual AF Form 1823/1823-1s
   when consumed. Conversely, high-cost working stock items replenished using work order
   number H8888 are held in a special holding account and are charged against the vehicle
   being repaired or serviced on an AF Form 1823/1823-1 using a ―QZ‖ transaction.

Section 5G— Repair Cycle Asset Management

5.35. General Information. Repair cycle assets are those items with Expendability,
Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) XD and XF. Examples are tires, some engines, etc.
These items are a large cost investment for the AF and are stringently controlled and cycled back
into the system.
   5.35.1. Materiel Control reviews these items to see that they are processed according to
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapters 13 and 24. Materiel Control also ensures that
   all items subject to repair cycle control are managed and controlled according to the DIFM
   concept.
154                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   5.35.2. Use the daily AWP Validation Listing (D19) to perform identification and control
   checks, and prescribed monitoring procedures and files. Close coordination with the Repair
   Cycle Support Element (RCSE) is a must to ensure strict control of DIFM assets.
   5.35.3. DIFM items, whether in repair or in stock, are considered assets available to satisfy a
   requirement and may be the only source of supply.
5.36. DIFM Issues. A request for repair cycle assets automatically places the transaction under
DIFM control; usually, DIFM issues are for a quantity of one each. For items for which multiple
quantities may be needed (such as tires, matched sets, etc.) a multiple DIFM issue can be made.
Remember, though, when a multiple DIFM issue occurs, and various actions are taken on returns
(for example, condemned and recapped tires), prepare a separate turn in for each ―action taken‖
code. Since the DIFM issue document number is the control element on all DIFM transactions,
the duplication of turn-in document numbers could result in difficulty in tracing the transaction
audit trail.
5.37. DIFM Status. The AWP Validation Listing (D19) is a daily listing. The list provides
Materiel Control with current status on each item DIFM. Materiel Control updates the DIFM
detail record each time an item location or status changes. When standard DIFM delinquency
criteria are exceeded, Materiel Control finds the cause and eliminates the delinquency.
Immediately reconcile any discrepancies noted on the D19 with the RCSE. All daily changes to
the D19 report are shown on the next DIFM listing. OLVIMS, PCNs SB004-016 and SB004-062
show delayed parts on hand that are DIFM controlled.
5.38. Supply Points. Operate supply points IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter
24. When operationally effective, establish a supply point for vehicle tires IAW TO 36-1-191,
unless space is not available in or near the Tire Shop. The supply points may be established for
tires and other parts. VFM or VMS, and LRS Stock Control Managers establish manning
requirements.
5.39. DIFM and Supply Point Reconciliation. Reconcile supply points each quarter or at an
increased frequency due to high volume of changes.

Section 5H— Other Procedures for Materiel Control

5.40. TCTOs.
   5.40.1. The AF rules on TCTO kit distribution are in TO 00-5-15, AF Time Compliance
   Technical Order Process, and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 24. The Vehicle
   Inventory Manager at WR-ALC makes TO modifications, including assembly, storage and
   distribution of related TCTO kits. Required parts and materials are controlled and sent
   according to the applicable TCTO.
   5.40.2. Materiel Control orders TCTO kits from the AF Form 2001, Notification of TCTO
   Kit Requirements.
       5.40.2.1. Enter the organization and shop code of the Vehicle Management shop
       responsible for doing the modification on part I of the form.
       5.40.2.2. Initiate AF Form 2001 in three copies, with copies one and two sent to the
       RCSE and copy three filed in Materiel Control.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        155


      5.40.2.3. Provide due-in document number to VM&A when it is available for TCTOs
      requiring a TCTO kit. VM&A provides the document number(s) and registration
      number(s) to WR-ALC to request kit release.
   5.40.3. Materiel Control checks the status of TCTO needs using the D18. Each time a
   TCTO kit asset is received, SBSS generates an IO29 management notice showing the total
   on-hand balance and each existing due-out detail record. A copy of this notice is sent to
   Materiel Control. Place it in the TCTO jacket file with the AF Form 2001. A display board
   (the NMCS board or an automated control board may be used) shows the following
   information for all current and outstanding TCTOs:
      5.40.3.1. TCTO number.
      5.40.3.2. Due out document number.
      5.40.3.3. Quantity and unit of issue.
      5.40.3.4. Date requested.
      5.40.3.5. Current status.
      5.40.3.6. Quantity on hand.
      5.40.3.7. Date received.
      5.40.3.8. Mandatory compliance date.
      5.40.3.9. Remarks.
   5.40.4. Materiel Control tells the RCSE to force a due-out release of the kit for installation
   when all items are received and the modification is scheduled.
   5.40.5. As requested, SBSS produces a monthly TCTO kit reconciliation and status report to
   keep the shop informed of kit availability, shortages, excesses, due-outs and due-ins.
   Materiel Control tells the RCSE of excesses, changes or added requirements identified during
   the reconciliation.
5.41. Tool Accountability and Issue Procedures.
   5.41.1. General Procedures.
      5.41.1.1. The VFM or VMS will develop an OI to specify tool accountability procedures
      to fit the local mission and physical shop layout. At a minimum, the OI will cover
      inventory, spot checks, inlaying tools in foam, plastic, wood and etc., engraving, security
      requirements, reporting and reimbursement procedures for lost and/or missing tools. If a
      tool crib is utilized, its operation is further detailed in this OI.
      5.41.1.2. All tool kits and tool cribs are periodically inventoried and/or spot checked.
      When accountability changes, written inventories are performed by the outgoing and
      incoming responsible individuals, jointly, with Materiel Control. All inventories and spot
      checks will focus on missing tools, serviceability, safety and presence of unauthorized
      items in the tool kit/crib. Written inventories will be maintained for 1 year. An inventory
      record includes the date the inventory was completed, the name of the individual who
      conducted the inventory and a remarks column.
156                                        AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


         5.41.1.2.1. Technicians will visually inventory their ITKs on a daily basis at the end
         of their shift. Written inventories are accomplished annually by Materiel Control,
         jointly with the technician. Supervisors will spot check ITKs monthly. Spot checks
         will be documented in a locally determined manner.
         5.41.1.2.2. Supervisors (or their designees) visually inventory CTKs at the end of
         their duty day to ensure accountability of assigned tools and to prevent FOD. Written
         inventories are accomplished semi-annually by Materiel Control, jointly with the
         supervisor or designee.
         5.41.1.2.3. Materiel Control will visually inventory tool cribs under their control at
         the end of their duty day to ensure accountability of assigned tools and to prevent
         FOD. When tool cribs are managed by outlying sections, section supervisors perform
         this duty. Written inventories are accomplished semi-annually by Materiel Control
         (jointly if assigned to an outlying work center).
         5.41.1.2.4. During inventory, the individual turns in any deleted tools and receipts for
         the remaining tools in his or her possession. Code shortages Not Issued (―NI‖) and
         annotate listing with due-in information for backordered tools. The individual
         completes the certification in ink on each page of the tool list to knowledge receipt of
         the tools. Note: Any change must be listed in ink and initialed in ink by the
         individual and Materiel Control. Destroy any old lists.
         5.41.1.2.5. Materiel Control advises the work center supervisor when backordered
         tools are received. The responsible individual then goes to Materiel Control to pick up
         the tool and shows receipt by lining through the "NI" and dating and initialing the
         entry in ink. All newly received tools must be properly marked with unit or shop
         designator and ITK or CTK number before placement in the ITKs or CTKs.
      5.41.1.3. The VFM or VMS identifies tool requirements for each functional AFSC
      and/or work center and approves initial tool listings for ITKs and CTKs. Listings include
      tool NSN and/or part number, nomenclature, and quantity authorized.
         5.41.1.3.1. For ITKs, Materiel Control enters the technician’s name, grade and tool
         box number at the bottom of the list, leaving room for signature.
         5.41.1.3.2. For CTKs, Materiel Control enters the shop supervisor’s (or designee’s)
         name, grade and kit number at the bottom of the list, leaving room for signature.
      5.41.1.4. Warranty hand tools are the standard for vehicle maintenance operations due to
      their high quality and free replacement policy.
      5.41.1.5. Replace damaged and unserviceable tools on a one-for-one exchange basis
      through Materiel Control or the vendor.
      5.41.1.6. Use a separate DRMS holding area for condemned hand tools not exchanged
      with the vendor. Transfer condemned expendable hand tools (by weight) to DRMS as
      scrap IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 13.
      5.41.1.7. Powered hand tools may be issued to CTKs, tool cribs or ITKs. Ensure they
      are accurately accounted for due to their high replacement cost.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        157


     5.41.1.8. All tools in ITKs, CTKs and tool cribs are inlaid in foam, plastic, wood, etc.
     when stored in drawers and engraved with a locally assigned kit control number
     designated by Materiel Control. CTKs and tool crib control numbers include the shop
     initials.
     5.41.1.9. Materiel Control makes and keeps custodial listings for all ITKs, CTKs and
     tool cribs in the Vehicle Management complex. Listings are maintained in folders, filed
     in control number sequence, and include the responsible individual’s name, AFSC, shop
     and kit control number.
     5.41.1.10. Due to the high expense of tools and equipment required for operation of a
     Vehicle Management shop, pilferage concerns and the potential for tools to migrate to the
     flight line and potentially cause FOD, strict accountability is required. Account for any
     missing tools or initiate a ROS IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey For Air Force
     Property. Exceptions to initiating ROS must be approved by VFM or VMS and are
     usually based on unique circumstances surrounding the loss.
     5.41.1.11. Ensure the procedures in TO 32B14-3-1-101, Operation and Service
     Instructions Torque Indicating Devices, are followed prior to the use of any torque
     device.
  5.41.2. Tool Crib Operations.
     5.41.2.1. A tool crib is a storage and issue point for common and specialized tools shown
     on one or more AS. Tool cribs are established when practical based on physical shop
     layout, Materiel Control manning and other local considerations. VFM or VMS can
     designate other tools to be controlled under these procedures. Materiel Control manages
     tool cribs authorized for the shop complex and outlying tool cribs can be operated by
     work center personnel.
     5.41.2.2. A neat, clean, well-arranged tool crib is necessary to provide tool support and
     ease inventory requirements. Segregate special tools, if possible, by vehicle types and
     display them on shadow boards or store them in bins. Assign each item shown on a
     shadow board an item location designator. Mark this designator on the tool if practical
     and on its storage position on the shadow board. Post item identification and location lists
     near the issue counter. Store common items and those not suitable for the shadow board
     in bins, inlaid in foam, plastic, wood, etc.
     5.41.2.3. Issue tools by AF Form 1297, a chit system, an automated system or other
     locally approved method. Tools are not generally issued for a longer period of time than
     the user’s shift period without approval of the tool crib custodian. Do not issue tools for
     personal use. Set up a tool issue suspense system and check it each duty day to ensure
     tools are returned on time. The shop supervisor is told of individuals who fail to return
     tools within the established suspense time as determined locally. Advise the VFM or
     VMS of shops and personnel that continually fail to return tools on time.
     5.41.2.4. Mechanics must clean all tools before returning them to the tool crib. The tool
     crib custodian inspects them on return to make sure they are clean, in good condition and
     free of corrosion.
158                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      5.41.2.5. Materiel Control keeps a complete list of all tools in the tool crib. The list
      contains NSN and/or part numbers, nomenclature, authorized and on-hand quantity and
      other data as needed locally. Perform a complete inventory semi-annually or when the
      tool crib custodian changes.
      5.41.2.6. Materiel Control ensures Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment
      (TMDE) tools are scheduled for calibration and certification according to TO 00-20-14,
      AF Metrology and Calibration Program. Use a visual display board or computer-
      generated listing to keep the current status of all TMDE requiring calibration. Ensure all
      TMDE is accounted for on the semi-annual inventory.
   5.41.3. ITK Procedures.
      5.41.3.1. The tool custodian establishes initial accountability by obtaining the current
      ITK custody receipt listings and folders for all personnel assigned to the unit and issued
      tool kits. Materiel Control sub-receipts ITKs to the technicians using itemized inventory
      listings.
      5.41.3.2. When personnel are transferred or ITKs are no longer needed, the accountable
      technician and Materiel Control conduct a joint inventory. Joint inventories are
      accomplished annually for all ITKs.
      5.41.3.3. Unless another technician is to be assigned, the VFM or VMS may choose to
      keep the kit in storage. ITKs in storage are maintained by Materiel Control and have two
      copies of the tool list inside and shortages on order. The ITK is tagged with the kit
      number and the date turned in.
   5.41.4. CTK Procedures.
      5.41.4.1. A CTK is established for common tools not suitable for ITKs, typically when a
      shop is physically separated from the tool crib, and use of the CTK will save time and
      effort of the mechanics. VFM or VMS may, however, dictate the use of CTKs in place of
      ITKs when deemed most practical. CTKs will be maintained in a neat, clean and well-
      arranged manner to best provide tool support and ease inventory requirements. Unless
      impractical, CTKs are maintained in storage bins, with tools engraved and inlaid in foam,
      plastic, wood, etc.
      5.41.4.2. Materiel Control manages CTKs which are sub-receipted to the section
      supervisors (or their designees) using itemized inventory listings. The tool custodian
      establishes initial accountability by obtaining the current CTK custody receipt listings
      and folders for all CTKs in the unit.
      5.41.4.3. Materiel Control coordinates with applicable supervisors (or their designees) to
      update CTKs and perform inventories when kits are initially issued, semi-annually or
      when the responsible individual is transferred and a new one is assigned. The responsible
      individual and Materiel Control conduct a joint inventory at that time.
      5.41.4.4. Issue tools from a CTK by AF Form 1297, a chit system, an automated system
      or other locally approved method. Tools are not generally issued for a longer period of
      time than the user’s shift period without approval of the supervisor. Do not issue tools for
      personal use. VFM or VMS sets up a tool issue suspense system and the shop supervisor
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         159


      or his designee check the CTK(s) each duty day to ensure tools are returned. These
      checks also include inspection to ensure tools are clean and in good condition.
      5.41.4.5. Materiel Control ensures tools and TMDE assigned to CTKs are scheduled for
      calibration and certification using the same procedures specified for the tool crib TMDE.
5.42. Tire and Battery Management.
   5.42.1. Tire management and control procedures are covered in TO 36-1-191 and in
   AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2 Chapter 21, Special Logistic Support Procedures.
   Management establishes local procedures to ensure all tires are maintained and accounted for
   on an as-received and issued basis using AFTO Form 70, Tire Inventory Control Record, or
   other local form that can reflect similar data. All new tires and batteries will be directly
   charged via the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
   5.42.2. Charge recapped tires purchased through the supply system at the current recap
   percentage of the stock fund price as loaded in OLVIMS. Recapped tires are identified by a -
   2 suffix in the NSN.
   5.42.3. Tires recapped using local contract, AF Form 9 or GPC, which are not tracked in the
   supply system, are input in OLVIMS using work order H8888. Use of H8888 causes the cost
   of parts to be charged against a special "holding" account, rather than against the entire base
   fleet. When the tires are issued to a specific AF Form 1823/1823-1, they are charged against
   a vehicle using a ―QZ‖ transaction.
      5.42.3.1. For each tire issued, make a line item entry or attach a preprinted label to the
      vehicle AF Form 1823/1823-1.
   5.42.4. Forward supply point tires are issued with Transaction Identifier Code (TRIC) ―MSI‖
   through SBSS creating the OLVIMS transaction to ensure proper tire costing and
   accountability. The VFM/ VMS is encouraged to establish tire supply points for mission
   critical vehicles as necessary when space and manpower permit in order to meet mission
   demands. Forward supply points will be coordinated with the Materiel Management Flight
   and will be limited to levels not exceed 90 day requirements based on historical usage that
   should be accessed annually.
   5.42.5. Consume tires in the SBSS inventory first, whether in the main base warehouse or in
   the Vehicle Management forward supply point. When ordering the tires from the SBSS
   system use demand code ―R‖ for a recurring request. The ―R‖ does build demand, which will
   replenishment supply stocks as determined locally. When tires are issued and no longer
   needed from the supply point, suppress the replenishment by placing an ―F‖ in position 54 of
   the issue MSI request. Ensure appropriate actions are taken to remove the tire authorization
   from the supply point if determination is made that a tire stock level is no longer needed.
      5.42.5.1. Tire recapping programs take precedence over new acquisitions of tires in
      accordance with RCRA (see paragraph 1.16.2). Where recap or retread tires cannot be
      used, new tires will be obtained in SBSS as a mandatory source using the Michelin
      North American (MNA) fixed-price, tire contract via the Defense Supply Center-
      Columbus through the Defense Logistics Agency, (DLA). Delivery times for tires
      procured in SBSS will not exceed 3 duty days for the CONUS or 9 duty days for
      OCONUS from the date the requisition was established in SBSS. If tires cannot be
160                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      obtained through SBSS in the time lines mentioned, tires can be procured using
      alternative sources such as the Government Purchase Card, SF44 Program, COPARS or
      ICOPARS as determined by the VFM/VMS. The VFM/VMS initiate actions to purchase
      the tires locally if delivery times do not meet the criticality of mission for sortie
      generation, base & missile defense, and tactical operations that are below the base
      approved minimum essential level (MEL). The VFM/VMS will also ensure no
      replacement vehicle is available through the Vehicle Operations U-Drive it Fleet or
      through an approved priority recall plan prior to going local purchase for new tires when
      SBSS cannot meet the delivery times. When local purchase or alternative procurement
      methods are used outside SBSS, correspondence must be sent to VEMSO specifically
      identifying the tire NSN, date requisitioned through SBSS, with a copy of the requisition
      and the reason tires had to be purchased locally. VEMSO will forward all information for
      consolidation to AFMC/A4SP (Land Tire POC) for review. A copy of correspondence
      sent to VEMSO will also be attached to the AF Form 1823-1 and with the GPC
      approving official as further evidence that all resources were verified prior to going local
      purchase. For contracted vehicle maintenance activities, the MAJCOM will work with
      the base contracting officer to modify existing contracts to include the purchase of tires
      through SBSS as soon a possible, but prior to exercising the next option period.
          5.42.5.1.1. If a particular MNA contract tire has considerably higher cost, meaning at
          least one and a half times the cost of a local competitor with the same ply or load
          range, that information will be sent to VEMSO for further research through
          AFMC/A4SP to find the reasoning for increased cost.
          5.42.5.1.2. The local VFM/VMS is the determining authority for emergency
          requisitions for tires based on mission, circumstance and reasoning mentioned in
          paragraph 5.42.5.1 MAJCOMs, Contracting Officers, and the host base Materiel
          Management Flights will consider this a UCI checklist item.
          5.42.5.1.3. At no time does the MNA contract take precedence or direct new
          acquisitions of new tires over retread or recapped tires where they can be used in
          accordance with TO 36-1-191 and locally established procedures.
          5.42.5.1.4. Contract vehicle maintenance operations are exempt from the requirement
          to purchase new tires through SBSS and may instead purchase new tires directly from
          DLA.        Contractors may order tires through the DoD EMALL at
          http://www.dlis.dla.mil/emall.asp.

      5.42.5.3. (DELETED) .
      5.42.5.4. (DELETED) .
      5.42.5.5. (DELETED) .
   5.42.6. Use work order number H8888 for all vehicle-type batteries ordered for the battery
   shop. Local procedures between Materiel Control and the battery shop supervisor assure that
   when batteries are installed, they are charged properly in OLVIMS, using the "QZ" materiel
   costing transaction. Note: Batteries must be accounted for on an as-received and issued basis
   for audit purposes.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                           161


5.43. Work Order Residue. Items left over from maintenance are placed in "work order
residue" bins, preferably collocated but not commingled with bench stock. Identify work order
residue by NSN or part number and date established as residue. If there is no foreseeable need,
Materiel Control notifies all shop supervisors to take a "last look" to see if there is any need. If
not, the items are processed for disposal. Develop an inventory management system to provide
quick reference for all work order residue items. When a part is removed from residue and
placed on a vehicle, annotate the action on the AF Form 1823/ 1823-1 or parts request form by
writing ―W/O Residue‖ in the job description block or parts form respectively. This action will
provide management information concerning the source of the replacement part.
5.44. Vehicle Redistribution and Transfer. When vehicles are redistributed or transferred to
other AF bases or sent to DRMS, VM&A advises Materiel Control and applicable work center
supervisors. On notification of a vehicle transfer, Materiel Control will cancel any parts on order,
turn in serviceable parts if no future need is predicted or move them to the work order residue
area. Work center supervisors will have applicable personnel make necessary changes to bench
stocks, working stocks, work order residues and TO libraries.

                                         TRAINING

Section 6A— General Information

6.1. General Information. Successful operation of AF Vehicle Management activities depends
on the knowledge of assigned personnel and how well they accomplish the mission. The CFETP
for Vehicle Management is a comprehensive training program outlining specific training
requirements Vehicle Management personnel should receive as they progress throughout their
career. Career Field Functional Managers at all levels participate in developing the CFETP and
use it to tune their training programs toward achieving the plan’s overall goals.
   6.1.1. The VFM or VMS (senior base-level Vehicle Manager) is the Functional Manager for
   the Vehicle Management specialty at their respective location.
   6.1.2. The VFM or VMS should offer training opportunities to tenant organizations that have
   2T3 personnel assigned when Vehicle Management training resources are not available in the
   2T3’s assigned unit.
   6.1.3. Major Command Functional Managers (MFMs) share responsibility in developing the
   CFETP. The Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM) is the single POC responsible for
   overall management of 2T3XX specialties, including policy development, training, skills
   management and career development.
6.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. Select qualified personnel to perform a detailed functional review of AETC course
   training standards.

   6.2.4. Coordinate Mobile Training Team (MTT) requirements with the technical training
   centers.
   6.2.5. Develop OJT documentation requirements following guidelines in AFI 36-2201v3.
6.3. Vehicle Management Training Leader. The VFM or VMS shares overall responsibility
for the Vehicle Management training program with the Unit Training Manager. The VFM or
VMS should assign a qualified 2T3 as the Vehicle Management Training Leader and the
appointee should be a civilian for continuity purposes in all shops with over 40 personnel. The
person appointed is primarily responsible for establishing and monitoring upgrade/qualification
training and should not be assigned additional duties that will prevent full attention to the
training program (i.e., Environmental Manager, Technical Order Distribution Account Manager,
etc.). The Vehicle Management Training Leader will not reside outside of the physical Vehicle
Management shop due to the need to specifically focus on Vehicle Management training.
   6.3.1. The Vehicle Management Training Leader is also responsible for the following:
       6.3.1.1. Complying with AFI 36-2201v3.
       6.3.1.2. Assisting the VFM or VMS in selection of qualified OJT trainers and certifiers.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        163


       6.3.1.3. Preparing an annual budget to support training requirements (i.e., training mock-
       ups, commercial and unit funded classes and information technology items).
       6.3.1.4. Providing supervisors with assistance in obtaining literature and directives
       pertinent to the OJT program.
       6.3.1.5. Preparing and submitting AETC in-resident training requests in response to the

       6.3.1.8. Conducting quarterly reviews of all AF Form 623s, Individual Training Record
       Folder, within the Vehicle Management Flight.
       6.3.1.9. Conducting quarterly reviews on the training program using the Vehicle
       Management Training Checklist in Attachment 5.
       6.3.1.10. Briefing VFM and/or VMS on status of all personnel in upgrade training on a
       regular basis.
   6.3.2. VFM or VMS should consider sending the Vehicle Management Training Leader to
   the Instructional Systems Designer Course (J4AZT3S200 010) to enhance the individual’s
   ability to plan and manage a training program.

Section 6B— Types of Training

6.4. Establishing and Managing a Vehicle Management Training Program. Vehicle
Management training is more than progressing through the CDCs and certifying core tasks.
Various and complex vehicle systems combined with frequent personnel changes demand a
comprehensive, active training program that includes training beyond the initial skill-level
upgrade process. The program must also include training mechanics on new or improved
troubleshooting techniques, specialized test equipment and advanced vehicle systems. VM&A
personnel receive advanced training on analysis techniques and fleet management processes. An
all-inclusive training program should include the key areas listed below.
   6.4.1. First is the actual skill-level awarding requirements achieved through the CDCs and
   core task certification.
   6.4.2. Second is in-house training to keep mechanics proficient on new technologies and
   expand on the basic principles learned during the initial upgrade training. The in-house
   training will also assist in duty qualifying mechanics.
   6.4.3. Third, and one of the most important areas, is qualification training. As personnel
   rotate from overseas to CONUS bases or into new duty positions, they often need task
   training to be duty position qualified. If not properly task trained, possible injury or death
   could be the result.
164                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   6.4.4. Finally, a training program should also include specific training on unique hazards of
   specific vehicle types and incorporate the use of Operational Risk Management (ORM)
   principles. Safety is paramount to day-to-day operations and it is critical trainers identify
   these hazards prior to the start of any task training.
6.5. OJT. OJT consists of two parts; the first is career knowledge and is achieved by the use of
CDCs or other applicable technical references listed in the CFETP and the second is task
performance and is provided during the actual hands-on training and certifying of core tasks
identified in the CFETP. Refer to AFI 36-2201v3, for further guidance for setting up an OJT
program.
   6.5.1. CDC Administration. CDCs contain information on basic principles, techniques and
   procedures common to Vehicle Management. CDCs can be ordered all at one time. This
   reduces overall training upgrade time significantly by eliminating the 4 to 6 week waiting
   time between sets, but it does not change the time requirement to complete CDCs. Trainees
   will only have 30 days to complete each volume of their CDCs from the date the volume is
   issued to them (per AFI 36-2201v3, Table 8.1., Line 5). A trainee will not be issued more
   than one volume at a time.
       6.5.1.1. Supervisors (with assistance from the Vehicle Management Training Leader)
       will determine volume sequence of study and set the overall course completion schedule.
       6.5.1.2. The Vehicle Management Training Leader should use a local tracking system to
       ensure volumes are completed within 30 days of issue.
       6.5.1.3. Supervisors will determine the reason for slow progress, counsel the trainee,
       document the counseling in the AF Form 623a and place the trainee in supervised study.
       6.5.1.4. Pre-testing is a very effective tool in determining the current knowledge level of
       the trainee and should minimize End of Course (EOC) exam failures. VFM or VMS
       needs to develop local guidance for pre-testing trainees prior to taking the EOC exam.
           6.5.1.4.1. A pre-testing policy should include the following:
              6.5.1.4.1.1. When to administer the pre-test, after each volume or after each set.
              6.5.1.4.1.2. Minimum passing score for each pre-test administered.
              6.5.1.4.1.3. The number of pre-tests given prior to the EOC.
              6.5.1.4.1.4. Frequency of re-testing for trainees that fail to achieve the established
              passing score on the pre-test.
           6.5.1.4.2. VFM or VMS should conduct an interview with the trainee, trainee’s
           supervisor and Vehicle Management Training Leader at least 3 days prior to EOC
           exam day. The interview should focus on the confidence level of the trainee to pass
           the test and should provide ample time to postpone the EOC exam if necessary.
   6.5.2. Core Task Certification. Most of the 2T3 AFSCs have more than 100 core tasks that
   must be completed before a trainee can be upgraded and task certification is the most time-
   consuming portion of the upgrade process. Vehicle Management Training Leaders, with
   assistance from the work center supervisors, should develop projected timelines for core task
   completion. A proactive approach to core task certification will ensure the trainee is
   upgraded in a timely manner.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        165


     6.5.2.1. Consider reviewing your 18-month scheduled maintenance plan when
     developing your timelines. Since every vehicle will pass through Vehicle Management at
     least once every 18 months for PM&I, this will give you a good starting point to
     determine vehicle availability for each month.
     6.5.2.2. Identify the number of tasks a trainee must complete per month and meet with
     the trainer and trainee to discuss the upcoming month’s core task completion goals.
     6.5.2.3. Trainers should use lesson plans to ensure all trainees are trained at the same
     level, no matter who is doing the training. Standardized lesson plans and Core Task
     Performance Standards are available for download from the Vehicle Management
     Neighborhood Community of Practice website.
     6.5.2.4. Trainers will provide trainees safety briefings to identify hazards specific to the
     current vehicle or system being trained. Trainers will document the completion of the
     briefing on the trainee’s AF Form 623a.
  6.5.3. Developing a Master Training Plan (MTP). The MTP, developed by the work center
  supervisor, will reflect qualification requirements in each task a trainee is required to
  perform. The plan must provide 100 percent task coverage. At the minimum, the following
  items must be included in the MTP:
     6.5.3.1. Master Task List.
     6.5.3.2. Complete copy of the current CFETP.
     6.5.3.3. Applicable AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command
     JQS.
     6.5.3.4. Timelines for tasks and CDC completions.
  6.5.4. Rotation Plan for 7-Levels. Rotate mechanics in upgrade training to the 7-skill level
  through each section of Vehicle Management. Allow sufficient time for the trainee to gain a
  working knowledge of the section. VM&A personnel will be rotated internally within their
  section to ensure competency in all areas of their specialty. Personnel rotation is considered
  an essential element of an individual’s upgrade training and deployment preparation. Note:
  Remember to ensure 7-level mechanics continue to stay proficient by rotating them through
  each section of Vehicle Management as needed.
     6.5.4.1. VFM and VMS should consider rotating experienced 5-levels through all work
     centers to increase breadth of experience and help prepare them for deployment taskings.
     This should also minimize the impact of high deployment taskings on home station
     operations by increasing the available manpower to perform unique tasks.
  6.5.5. Tracking Time-In-Training. It is important the training program includes a
  mechanism to track the amount of time an individual has been in upgrade training. This
  should be a metric used by the VFM and VMS to measure supervisory involvement in
  upgrade training. The goal for the training program is established in the CFETP.
  6.5.6. Graduate Assessment Survey (GAS). As part of its training effectiveness evaluation,
  AETC requests evaluations of recent graduates from field units. Shop supervisors complete
  the training evaluations on students completing formal training courses or schools. Complete
166                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   these evaluations within 90 days for students completing basic courses and within 45 days for
   those completing follow-on or advanced courses.
       6.5.6.1. HQ AETC, in conjunction with 2AF, has converted to a web-based process that
       enables the supervisors of graduates to complete the GAS electronically. Supervisors will
       be notified through e-mail from base education. Paper-based surveys will still be sent to
       those isolated units that do not have access to electronic mail or internet. The website for
       the electronic GAS can be found at https://hq2af.keesler.af.mil/metrics/default.htm.
       Additional guidance can be found in AFI 36-2201v5, Air Force Training Program
       Career Field Education and Training.
6.6. In-House Training. The ever-increasing cost of maintaining vehicles demands trained
mechanics pass on what they have learned to other mechanics. The rapidly changing technology
used on vehicles requires the AF mechanic to stay proficient on theory of operations, diagnostic
procedures and test equipment. The in-house portion of the program accomplishes this type of
training and should include both classroom instruction and hands-on progress checks.
   6.6.1. The in-house program should include various levels of training on the following main
   vehicle systems:
       6.6.1.1. Automotive electrical and electronics.
       6.6.1.2. Brake systems.
       6.6.1.3. Wheel alignment.
       6.6.1.4. Automatic transmissions and transaxles.
       6.6.1.5. Engine cooling and climate control.
       6.6.1.6. Four wheel drive and differentials.
       6.6.1.7. Engine repair.
       6.6.1.8. Engine performance diagnosis, emission testing and tune-up.
       6.6.1.9. Oxyacetylene and welding (for contingencies).
   6.6.2. Consider taking a "Phase" approach when developing classes within the nine main
   areas. This will provide the framework for a progressive approach and allow mechanics to
   enhance their skills as they move through each phase of the training.
       6.6.2.1. Phase I should cover the basic vehicle systems and should target the entry-level
       mechanics. Some classes to include in Phase I:
           6.6.2.1.1. Basic electricity.
           6.6.2.1.2. Brake systems.
           6.6.2.1.3. Steering system.
           6.6.2.1.4. Engine cooling and heating.
           6.6.2.1.5. Automatic transmission.
           6.6.2.1.6. Four wheel drives and differentials.
           6.6.2.1.7. Valve trains.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                    167


         6.6.2.1.8. Fuel systems.
     6.6.2.2. Phase II should train mechanics to a higher level of complexity and include
     classes in:
         6.6.2.2.1. Chassis instrumentation.
         6.6.2.2.2. Power brake systems.
         6.6.2.2.3. Power steering systems.
         6.6.2.2.4. Carburetion.
         6.6.2.2.5. TBI and PFI Injections.
     6.6.2.3. Phase III can be used to train the mechanics to the more advanced level and can
     include classes on manufacturer-specific systems:
         6.6.2.3.1. Ford air conditioning systems.
         6.6.2.3.2. Chrysler automatic transaxle.
         6.6.2.3.3. GM 4L80E automatic overdrive.
         6.6.2.3.4. 208D transfer cases.
         6.6.2.3.5. Differentials.
         6.6.2.3.6. Engine block rebuilding.
         6.6.2.3.7. Valve refacing.
         6.6.2.3.8. Drum and rotor lathe operation.
         6.6.2.3.9. Antilock brake systems.
         6.6.2.3.10. Wheel alignment.
     6.6.2.4. Phase IV should be used to prepare mechanics specifically for the National
     Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) exams. ASE is the industry standard
     for measuring mechanic competency, and VFMs and VMSs should encourage this type
     of certification for those mechanics that wish to pursue ways to improve personal
     technical skills.
     6.6.2.5. Phase V should incorporate the use of commercial advanced classes from
     various manufacturers (i.e., GM, Ford, Chrysler, Oshkosh, etc.). These types of classes
     are normally taught at a very advanced level and may seem overwhelming for younger,
     less-experienced mechanics. This is why only the most experienced mechanics should
     attend this type of training.
  6.6.3. Identifying Your Needs. First, you must determine your local training requirements:
  There are several ways:
     6.6.3.1. Solicit feedback from supervisors and mechanics.
     6.6.3.2. Work with VM&A to perform data analysis on specific system codes or
     recurring maintenance for various vehicles. This should assist in identifying negative
     maintenance trends and pinpoint mechanics’ weak areas that need to be strengthened
168                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      using focused remedial training. This is an ongoing requirement given that mechanics are
      constantly rotating in and out.
   6.6.4. Training Aids/Materials. There are several media types that can be used to assist in the
   classroom instruction.
      6.6.4.1. Commercial Trade Publications. Information technology has overcome the need
      to subscribe to trade publications in many instances. Information relating to management
      and upkeep of vehicles is readily available on the Internet. VFM or VMS will determine
      their needs and sources for obtaining this information or publications.
      6.6.4.2. Web-based Course Material. On-line training courses are available from many
      commercial companies. On-line courses can save the administrative time required to keep
      information updated but are more expensive then videotapes.
      6.6.4.3. Training Aids (Vehicle Components). Vehicle system mock-ups reinforce the
      theory of operation and diagnostics by providing hands-on demonstration. Figure 6.1
      shows some training aids manufactured using vehicle components from salvaged
      vehicles.

Figure 6.1. Vehicle Management Training Aids.




      6.6.4.4. Videotapes. Videotapes are the most common training aid used in the classroom
      and are great for supplementing classroom lectures but are not very student interactive.
   6.6.5. Selecting Instructors. Key to a successful in-house training program is supervisory
   involvement. The supervisors are the most experienced and possess an understanding for
   what it takes to complete the day-to-day tasks. This is why the training leaders are
   encouraged to recruit the supervisors to fill the role as classroom instructors.
      6.6.5.1. The Vehicle Management Training Leader should develop an internal program
      to enhance the classroom instructional skills of the instructors. This will not only build
      the confidence of the instructor but will also improve the quality of the delivery of the
      information.
      6.6.5.2. Classroom instructors can improve personal teaching techniques by completing
      some of the following courses:
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         169


           6.6.5.2.1. Air Force Training Course (E6ADL3S251) (Mandatory for all personnel
           identified as trainers and task certifiers).
           6.6.5.2.2. Principles of Instruction (J4AZT3S200 011).
       6.6.5.3. Instructors should conduct at least one class a month to stay proficient in the
       subject matter.
       6.6.5.4. The Vehicle Management Training Leader should encourage instructors to
       pursue ASE certification in the area they will teach. This can bring increased credibility
       to the instructor.
   6.6.6. Scheduling the Training. The Vehicle Management Training Leader should work
   closely with supervisors to ensure trainees are available for training. Consider scheduling
   your classes during the first half of the duty day and try not to conduct classes longer than 4
   hours per day.
       6.6.6.1. Classes do not need to include all trainees. Classes can be developed for
       multiple days for smaller groups. This will also minimize the impact on work center
       workloads.
   6.6.7. Progress checks and follow up. It is important the training process include some type
   of tool to measure the effectiveness of the training upon completion of the class.
       6.6.7.1. Pre-tests and post-tests are great tools to determine if the instructor was
       successful with the delivery of the course material.
       6.6.7.2. A review of missed questions and open classroom discussions is another
       effective way to determine if the training was successful.
       6.6.7.3. Supervisor and student feedback through the use of critiques and informal
       conversations are good ways to identify areas needing improvement in the curriculum
       and delivery of the material.
       6.6.7.4. A long-term indicator for an effective training program is the decline in
       previously identified negative management trends.
6.7. Qualification Training. Qualification training is a continuous process, starting with the
individual's entry into service. This portion of the program should train personnel on a specific
duty position. An example of a need for qualification training would be a staff sergeant
reassigned from an overseas to a CONUS base who is not familiar with certain vehicles in the
local fleet.
   6.7.1. Work Center Orientation and Initial Evaluation. Supervisors must conduct a work
   center orientation and an initial evaluation for all newly assigned personnel within 60 days of
   assignment. Both the orientation and evaluation must be documented on the AF Form 623a
   IAW AFI 36-2201, V3.
       6.7.1.1. After identifying training requirements as part of the orientation and evaluation,
       the individual should be enrolled in the local in-house training track to get him or her
       duty position qualified.
170                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   6.7.2. Management Training. The VFM or VMS determines management qualification
   training needs and as personnel progress into supervisory/management positions they should
   attend, at a minimum, the following courses:
      6.7.2.1. Supervisory Safety Training Course (ZZ132012).
      6.7.2.2. Vehicle Maintenance Superintendent Course (L3AZP2T300 000).
   6.7.3. EPA Certification Training. Technicians whose duties include MVAC maintenance
   require training and certification. They may also require specific certification if the local
   implementation of the EPA emissions control inspection and maintenance program contains
   provisions for the AF to perform this type of work. The EPA, and possibly a state or local
   authority implementing the program dictate approves courses of instruction and certification
   methods.
6.8. Advanced Training.
   6.8.1. Commercial Training. Commercial sources provide many excellent training courses,
   as do manufacturers of equipment and vehicles at factory and regional locations. Some
   mobile commercial training courses can be scheduled on-base. The Vehicle Management
   Training Leader and VFM or VMS should seek local sources for commercial training.
   MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs can often aid in finding commercial sources. Once a
   commercial training source is located, send an AF Form 403, Request for Special Technical
   Training, through command training channels to HQ AETC IAW AFI 36-2201. AETC or
   the MAJCOM may make necessary arrangements to procure, schedule and fund for the
   training, if approved.
   6.8.2. Inter-service Training. Special training by other DOD or Federal agencies can be
   arranged by AETC. Requests for this training are also made on AF Form 403 IAW AFI 36-
   2201v2, Air Force Training Program Training Management.
   6.8.3. AFS Training. Specialty training courses available for Vehicle Management
   personnel are listed at https://etca.randolph.af.mil/. This includes basic and advanced
   courses. Submit requests for this type of training through the MAJCOM. These courses are
   available for all Vehicle Management skills including VM&A personnel. Other courses can
   be offered if an AF Form 403, generated at base-level, justifies the need.
   6.8.4. Advanced AETC Courses. AETC special courses are conducted at AETC Technical
   Training Centers or by AETC MTT at the using command’s facilities. Personnel selected for
   this type of training are normally at the 5-skill level or higher. Request this training through
   the MAJCOM as provided in AFI 36-2201v2.

6.9. ASE. ASE is the automotive industry standard of competency. Since it recognizes an
individual’s accomplishments, ASE certification serves as an impartial, third-party endorsement
of a mechanic’s knowledge and experience on a national, even international, basis.
   6.9.1. ASE certification is a voluntary professional commitment to recognize qualified and
   competent individuals. It is an indicator of a mechanic’s initiative to enhance personal
   technical skills. VFM and VMS should encourage participation.
   6.9.2. Personnel are allowed to test twice yearly in May and November. The Defense
   Activity for Non-Traditional Support (DANTES) covers the cost of three exams per cycle but
   the individual or Vehicle Management must pay a registration fee. Certification is valid for 5
   years at which time individuals must re-certify to keep ASE credentials in specialty areas of
   certification. Re-certification exams are not funded by DANTES so they will need to be
   funded by the individual or Vehicle Management.
   6.9.3. Contact the base Force Development Flight/Education Office for more information on
   DANTES-funded ASE testing.
6.10. Certified Technician Program. Certified Technician Programs realign process
ownership and responsibility for repair actions with those actually performing the work.
MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs may establish certified technician programs for use at all
subordinate, or specified management activities. If established, MAJCOM guidance will include
eligibility criteria, certification-decertification-recertification processes and details on
administering the program at the execution level as a minimum.

                                           Chapter 7

               DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION

Section 7A— Introduction and Documentation Rules

7.1. General Information. This chapter contains the procedures for Vehicle Management
documentation and records administration.
7.2. General Description and Basic Principles of the Vehicle Management Data Collection
System.
   7.2.1. The VFM or VMS ensures all day-to-day business of the Vehicle Management
   activity is properly documented. Collect data by converting maintenance repair work to
   codes and recording those codes in spaces on forms. The codes are computer processed to
   make summary reports, which are sent to VFM and VMS for use in analyzing, planning,
   scheduling and controlling the vehicle management effort. This data is maintained as
   accurately and timely as possible. A comprehensive backup system is used to allow recovery
   of this data should a failure occur in the data system.
   7.2.2. Labor hours spent on tire and battery build-up (not identifiable to a specific vehicle)
   are direct hours. Labor cost for these hours is prorated by OLVIMS against the entire fleet as
   indirect cost. Indirect productive hours (administrative, supervision, etc.) are automatically
   computed by OLVIMS using the difference between direct productive and indirect
   nonproductive hours and the employee available hours.
   7.2.3. Labor-hour data is entered on forms in hours and 10ths. Minutes are recorded as
   10ths of hours as follows:
   01 through 02 minutes - .0 hour.
   03 through 08 minutes - .1 hour.
   09 through 14 minutes - .2 hours.
   15 through 20 minutes - .3 hours.
   21 through 26 minutes - .4 hours.
   27 through 33 minutes - .5 hours.
   34 through 39 minutes - .6 hours.
   40 through 45 minutes - .7 hours.
   46 through 51 minutes - .8 hours.
   52 through 57 minutes - .9 hours.
   58 through 60 minutes - whole hour.
7.3. Use of Printed Characters. Print all entries on records except for signatures and stamped
initials of inspectors.
7.4. Legibility. Ensure that maintenance records are legible, complete and correct.
174                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


7.5. Transfer and Disposition.
   7.5.1. VM&A ensures all records are complete and given to the vehicle REMS monitor
   when a vehicle is transferred to another base or to DRMS.
      7.5.1.1. Send AF Form 1823s in the historical file at the time of transfer with the records.
      7.5.1.2. VM&A keeps copies of vehicle historical records, Static Data A, B and C
      transactions and the last AFTO Form 91. Note: Retain only the AFTO Form 91 and the
      document that directed the disposition action for vehicles processed to DRMS.
          7.5.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . Due to extended shipping time, validate receipt of
          vehicle and records by gaining unit prior to disposal of duplicate records. Mail a full
          copy of records, if practical, to the gaining unit and retain duplicates until receipt is
          validated. This also pertains to Rule 7 of table 7.1.
   7.5.2. Use USAF management code 4000 in place of the vehicle’s actual management code
   when processing vehicles for disposal once disposition instructions have been received (the
   final preparation for salvage work order only). Use vehicle management’s Responsibility
   Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) code and the using organization code of 0O (Zero Oscar) for
   management code 4000 AF Form 1823/ 1823-1s. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs
   determine the use of USAF management code 4000 for new vehicles processing in to the
   base, excess or depot. The use of management code 4000 will show the proper NMC hours
   against the fleet.
      7.5.2.1. (Added-PACAF) . Use of USAF management code 4000 for work orders in
      OLVIMS will be used for new vehicles processing into the base, depot maintenance, and
      excess vehicles. The work order with the 4000 management code will remain open until
      the vehicle is ready for service, shipped or salvaged.
   7.5.3. Vehicle static data records for newly received vehicles may be put into OLVIMS
   when the using unit is known by using the proper vehicle management code, organization
   code and RC/CC code. All acceptance inspections are initiated and records loaded within 5
   working days after release of the vehicle from the receiving activity.
   7.5.4. Process vehicle disposition packages through all base-level OPRs within 10 working
   days.
7.6. Vehicle and Equipment Records.
   7.6.1. Make a historical records file (jacket) for each vehicle maintained by the shop. This
   record file has two sections, historical and active. Note: Use Table 7.1 as a convenient guide
   for maintaining and filing records.
   7.6.2. VM&A initiates a vehicle jacket file when a vehicle is first received.
      7.6.2.1. File historical records in either vehicle registration number sequence or in
      management code and registration number sequence.
      7.6.2.2. File all material in the active (working record) portion of the jacket file in
      chronological order and file material in the historical portion of the jacket file by record
      type, in chronological order.
    AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          175


      7.6.3. See Table 7.1 for filing directions for forms, documents, correspondence and other
      related data for vehicle and equipment records.

    7.7. Missing Forms. The receiving unit asks the shipping unit to send missing records, or
    duplicate copies, when new or used equipment is received without complete records.
    7.8. Maintenance of Forms for Vehicles and Equipment in Extended Storage. When
    placing vehicles and equipment in storage as stated in TO 36-1-191 or like directives, record
    vehicle maintenance inspections the same as if they were in an operational status. Maintain
    records in an active file until the vehicle is disposed of.
    7.9. Processing Vehicles to Vehicle Management. VM&A schedules and controls vehicle
    management and inspections. Enter all work on an AF Form 1823 or AF Form 1827 according
    to Chapter 4.
    7.10. Maintenance of Transient Vehicles.
       7.10.1. Vehicle Management inspects and repairs transient vehicles.
       7.10.2. Document and process transient vehicle AF Form 1823/1823-1s as shown in this
       chapter, except that VM&A sends copies of the AF Form 1823/1823-1s to the home station
       to ensure data is included in their historical records.
       7.10.3. The base that does the work assigns a management code of 5000 and a work order
       number prefix code to the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
       7.10.4. It is not necessary to total OLVIMS AF Form 1823/1823-1 entries, as the system
       automatically produces a transient vehicle listing that shows total cost. VM&A sends the
       listing to the transient vehicle’s home base.
    7.11. Vehicles Assigned TDY or Deployed.
       7.11.1. A copy of the Vehicle Historical Record is sent with each vehicle operating on TDY
       for 30 days or longer. (Exception: A copy of the current vehicle historical record
       accompanies each vehicle or equipment item sent TDY for special weapons movement,
       regardless of the duration of the TDY.) At the TDY station, VM&A ensures that each
       service, repair and inspection is updated on the vehicle historical record and that the form is
       returned with the vehicle when the TDY is over. At local option, on return from TDY, the
       home station VM&A can update the original vehicle historical record with new data from the
       TDY copy by initializing an AF Form 1823/1823-1.

   7.11.2. When vehicles are sent TDY for more than 30 days, the home station, the TDY
   station and the TDY vehicle operator or supervisor complies with the procedures below
   which are necessary to provide cost, repair and inspection data to the home station.
      7.11.2.1. The home station VM&A attaches a card showing the mailing and e-mail
      address of the home station VM&A and the scheduled data for that particular vehicle
      with the copy of the vehicle historical record. When the vehicle arrives at the TDY
      station, the Vehicle Management activity receiving the copy of the vehicle historical
      record and the attachments immediately notifies the home station of the address of the
      supporting VM&A activity. The operator or TDY team supervisor is responsible for this
      action if management support is provided by another government agency or commercial
      source.
      7.11.2.2. For vehicles on TDY, VM&A at the TDY station controls the vehicle historical
      record, PM&I and Special Inspection data. It sets up schedules with the TDY personnel
      for turning the vehicle in for PM&I and Special Inspections. The TDY station VM&A
      sends the vehicle return listing (PCN SB004-019) to the home station as they are
      received. Send copies of AF Form 1823/ 1823-1s, Operator’s Inspection Guide and
      Trouble Reports, and other appropriate records to the home station when the TDY station
      no longer needs them for reference.
      7.11.2.3. For TDY vehicles supported by another government agency or commercial
      source, the vehicle operator or TDY team supervisor sends copies of completed AF Form
      1823/1823-1s or invoices (AF Form 15 or Commercial Fleet Service Card) to the home
      station and transcribes data to the duplicate vehicle historical record.
   7.11.3. For vehicles on TDY for 30 days or less, VM&A at the TDY station or the operator
   sends the vehicle return listing and AF Form 1823/1823-1s or invoices, as indicated above, to
   the home station. All records generated during the TDY are generally returned to the home
   station with the vehicle.
   7.11.4. Include the Vehicle Historical Record in the documentation package to accompany
   vehicles deploying in support of contingency operations. See paragraph A2.3 for specific
   guidance on documentation requirements for vehicle deployments.

Section 7B— Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report Forms

7.12. General Information.
   7.12.1. The two AF 1800-series Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report forms are
   listed below.
      7.12.1.1. AF Form 1800 (for use with all Registered Vehicle Equipment except
      Refueling Vehicles and Equipment).
      7.12.1.2. AF Form 1807 (fuel servicing vehicles/equipment). Note: Page one has three
      signature blocks to accommodate documenting an operator inspection at each shift
      change. MAJCOMs may establish policy to standardize documentation of a single daily
      operator inspection or an operator inspection at each shift change.
7.13. Procedures for Recording Discrepancies and Delaying Maintenance.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        181


   7.13.1. Operators record any discrepancies found during inspections which require
   maintenance in the ―Vehicle/Equipment Discrepancy and Maintenance Report‖ section of the
   appropriate series Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, and report them to
   Vehicle Management. Note: Operators do not make entries in the ―Maintenance Report
   Status‖ section of the AF Form 1800 or the "Maintenance Control Report" section of the AF
   Form 1807, except for end-of-month closeout as stated in paragraph 7.15
   7.13.2. When an operator reports discrepancies in any of the safety-type systems or devices
   described in paragraph 3.13.2.2, that could adversely affect the safety of personnel or the
   operation of equipment, that maintenance is not delayed and the vehicle or equipment item
   will not be continued in service. The VFM, VMS or a qualified representative resolves any
   question about the seriousness of a discrepancy, decides whether the discrepancy can be
   delayed and if it can, initials the maintenance report section on the inspection guide. At
   contract Vehicle Management locations, the FAC or QAP resolves any discrepancy issues.
7.14. Instructions for the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report. The following
instructions apply to both the AF Form 1800 and 1807. The forms are described in three
sections.
7.15. Heading Information. The using organization enters the heading data (top portion of
front, page 1) and issues forms for each vehicle or equipment item on the 1st duty day of the
month. The operator who performs the first inspection of the new month closes out the previous
month’s form by carrying forward the required entries according to the following paragraphs.
The operator will ensure the previous month’s form is returned to the using organization’s
VCO/VCNCO. The new form will be kept with the vehicle while in use.
7.16. Items to Be Checked, Operator’s Signature and Monthly Tire Pressure Check. The
items to be checked are listed by number on page 3. The numbered rows that are labeled
―OTHER‖ can be used for locally added items. This is especially useful when adapting one of
the forms to a peculiar equipment item. Items to be added will be coordinated between the user
and the maintenance shop.
   7.16.1. Each item identified on page 3 as requiring Operator’s Inspection is serviced,
   checked and/or operationally tested during each inspection. To keep the form neat, the
   operator does not make any entry, such as a check mark or initials, on the rows where items
   are listed.
   7.16.2. Space is provided for an operator's signature corresponding to the numbered day of
   the month and shift on page 1. An operator's legible signature consisting of first initial and
   last name (opposite the appropriate day of the month) shows completion of inspection or
   servicing for each item.
       7.16.2.1. Further, the operator's signature shows the entry of item numbers for which a
       discrepancy is being reported on the discrepancy and maintenance report or, the signature
       could show that the operator is aware that the entry is already being carried in a delayed
       or waiver status. Leave blank or void entry on the operator signature lines opposite the
       days of the month an inspection was not performed (non-use days) or required.
       7.16.2.2. The operator certifies completion of the inspection even though the
       discrepancies that are found and reported to Vehicle Management may result in placing
182                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


       the vehicle NMC. If the vehicle is returned to service that same day, the operator has
       only to make a brief visual check.
   7.16.3. Vehicle operators will perform monthly tire pressure check by the 10th calendar day
   of each month and document completion on page 2 of the appropriate Operator’s Inspection
   Guide and Trouble. Note: Monthly tire pressure checks will be completed and documented
   regardless of organizational utilization of the vehicle. Exception: The monthly tire pressure
   check for vehicles that are NMC during the first 10 calendar days of the month will be
   completed and documented by the operator at the time the vehicle is released/pick-up from
   maintenance.
7.17. Discrepancy and Maintenance Report Section (page 2). This section is used by
operators and vehicle management personnel for documenting vehicle discrepancy and reporting
actions, and the disposition (maintenance action/status) of discrepancies listed. However,
Vehicle Management may also use this section to record the completion of scheduled inspections
and/or discrepancies found during service/repairs.
   7.17.1. Before entering a discrepancy, both Vehicle Management personnel and operators
   must check the discrepancy list, and status to avoid duplicate reporting and processing of
   discrepancies. When a new monthly form is initiated, all open discrepancies (when the date
   under ―Maintenance Report Status‖ or "Maintenance Control Report" is blank) are
   transferred to the new form and ―C/F‖ (carried forward) entered in the blank "Date" block of
   the old form.
   7.17.2. Additional instructions for completing this part of the form are as follows:
       7.17.2.1. Item No. Enter the "item number" of the inspection guide’s "item to be
       checked" list against which a discrepancy is being reported. Leave blank when the
       discrepancy is not related to a numbered item.
       7.17.2.2. Discrepancy. Enter a brief description of the discrepancy.
       7.17.2.3. Date Disc (Discovered). Enter the date the discrepancy is found and entered.
       7.17.2.4. Date/Time. Enter the date the discrepancy is reported. Enter the 24-hour clock
       time (four-digit military time; e.g., 1430) that the vehicle or equipment was turned in for
       repair or request for support (mobile, wrecker, etc.) was received (reflect period that
       vehicle is not operational).
       7.17.2.5. (DELETED) .
       7.17.2.6. Miles/Hours. Enter the current hour meter or odometer reading next to the
       discrepancy. Note: Do not include ―tenths‖.
       7.17.2.7. Name. The individual completing the "Reported To Maintenance" part of this
       form prints their name in this space.
   7.17.3. VM&A personnel, VFM, VMS, a representative such as work center or shift
   supervisor, CSC personnel, or Mobile Maintenance technicians completed Maintenance
   Report Status entries. The VFM or VMS may prescribe permanent waiver forms use and/or
   a locally developed system to track waivered deficiencies. Note: The work center supervisor
   or designated personnel identifies items on the AF Form 1823/-1 that are permanently
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          183


   waived. VM&A and/or CSC transcribe these items to the permanent waiver form or system
   of record.
       7.17.3.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number (block 2 of AF Form
       1823/-1 or AF Form 1827) on which the discrepancy is annotated for maintenance action.
       Enter "None" if repairs were not required or if the discrepancy was waivered without an
       AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 entry.
       7.17.3.2. Date. Enter the AF Form 1823/-1 or AF Form 1827 close-out/completion time.
       If the maintenance action is delayed, leave the date blank and enter the appropriate status
       code.
       7.17.3.3. Status Code. These codes are listed on the bottom of the form. The codes are
       self-explanatory, except that code "W" (waiver of repair) is intended to identify items that
       do not require repair or replacement, and do not adversely affect safety or performance of
       the equipment. Additional status codes may be adopted locally, according to need, for
       more detailed status information. Items entered in the discrepancy block which could not
       be validated by maintenance are dated, a "N" status code entered, and initialed in the
       maintenance report section of the Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report form.
       These entries are made only by Vehicle Management personnel. An optional procedure
       can be used to keep waived items in the permanent section of the vehicle historical record
       jacket as a backup in case the using organization loses or damages the waiver form kept
       in the vehicle. A computer-based software program is also authorized for waiver control
       (preferred method). At a minimum, wavered items will be reviewed and updated when
       vehicles are turned in for scheduled maintenance.
       7.17.3.4. Employee Number. The person who assigns a status code to a discrepancy
       enters their OLVIMS employee number in this block.
   7.17.4. Status code entries should not be made by VM&A or a representative until all
   management processing is performed and the vehicle is being released for use.
       7.17.4.1. For delayed status codes, the date is not entered until the completed AF Form
       1823/ 1823-1 is received, at which time the old status code is lined out or over stamped
       with a corrected code.
       7.17.4.2. Each time VM&A or a representative processes an inspection guide form, all
       discrepancies in a delayed or code C-T (temporary fix) status are checked.

Section 7C— AF Forms 1823/1823-1 (1823) , Vehicle and Equipment Work Order

7.18. General Information. The AF Form 1823/1823-1 is used by Vehicle Management shops
that are not supported by OLVIMS. The AF Form 1823/1823-1 is a computer-generated form
used by Vehicle Management shops supported by OLVIMS. Instructions and information for
completing this computer-generated form are in AFCSM 24-1. Work order open and close
procedures are as follows: VM&A will print as many copies of the AF Form 1823/1823-1 as
locally required. The shop uses a legible copy to tell the technician what repairs are needed. One
copy may be retained in VM&A for workload scheduling and monitoring. Close the AF Form
1823/1823-1 in the computer when the shop’s copy has been completed.
184                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


7.19. Special Recording Procedures. All work performed by Vehicle Management personnel
not recorded on an AF Form 1827 must be entered on an AF Form 1823/1823-1. On the AF
Form 1823/ 1823-1, contract maintenance, accident repair, other government agency repair and
final quality assurance inspections are shown by placing an "X" in the upper, right-hand corner
of the form. Use of the AF Form 1823/1823-1 also requires the posting of appropriate entries on
AF Form 754. On the AF Form 1823/ 1823-1, the type of work being performed will be
displayed in the upper, right-hand corner. Note: The individual performing the final quality
check will sign and either enter an "X" in the block or circle the PASS or FAIL depending on the
AF Form 1823/1823-1 being used.
   7.19.1. Make two AF Form 1823/1823-1s when repairs are performed at the same time by
   Vehicle Management and contract maintenance or when government parts are provided to
   the contractor.
       7.19.1.1. If in-house repair is started and a part is repaired by contract maintenance, open
       and then close the contract maintenance AF Form 1823/1823-1 (same date and time) to
       prevent duplication of NMC time and to expedite the contract repair work.
       7.19.1.2. The in-house AF Form 1823/1823-1 must stay open until all repairs (contract
       and in-house) are done.
       7.19.1.3. The contract maintenance AF Form 1823/1823-1 stays in the work order master
       file until the contract repair work (JZ) transaction is processed.
   7.19.2. Actual TCTO AF Form 1823/-1 entries are the same as for other types of
   maintenance, except that block 21, ―Job Description‖, shows the TO data code number. On
   the AF Form 1823/-1, enter system code 43CZ to indicate ―user defined‖. Enter a work order
   number prefix code "T" in block 2. Note: Report compliance IAW paragraph 4.16.5
   7.19.3. SB and OTI AF Form 1823/1823-1 entries are the same as for other types of
   maintenance, except that block 21, ―Job Description‖, shows the SB number or OTI subject.
   On the AF Form 1823/ 1823-1, enter system code 43CZ to indicate ―user defined‖. Enter a
   work order number prefix code "S" in block 2.
   7.19.4. Accident repair AF Form 1823/1823-1s contain only the repairs caused by the
   accident. Put other repairs on a separate AF Form 1823/1823-1. Accident repair is identified
   in the upper, right-hand corner of the AF Form 1823/1823-1. All labor and material charges
   for accident AF Form 1823/1823-1s are charged as "M" (maintenance). An AF Form
   1823/1823-1 is made for all accident repairs.
   7.19.5. Contract maintenance and other government agency AF Form 1823/1823-1s are
   identified as such in the upper, right-hand corner of the AF Form 1823/1823-1. When the
   VM&A copy is processed, a contract maintenance indicator is displayed to show the contract
   or other government agency status of the Work Order Master File Status Report, PCN
   SB004-018. VM&A checks all completed contract maintenance documents to ensure that
   appropriate maintenance data is entered to OLVIMS. Review PCN SB004-018 prior to
   monthly processing to ensure all required contract costs are entered into OLVIMS.
   7.19.6. Delayed maintenance AF Form 1823/1823-1s are identified by putting the
   appropriate maintenance code in block 19. On an AF Form 1823/1823-1, the delayed code
   will be put in the ―ACTION TAKEN‖ block. When a delayed item appears on the shop’s
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         185


   copy of a completed AF Form 1823/ 1823-1 (as shown by maintenance code), the VM&A
   Workload Controller immediately makes a new AF Form 1823/1823-1 for these items only.
   When closing an AF Form 1823/1823-1 with delayed jobs, the system will automatically
   print out a delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1 for those jobs only.
      7.19.6.1. On AF Form 1823/1823-1 delayed work order, leave the work order number
      and kilometer, miles and hours blocks blank. The work order number from the original
      AF Form 1823/ 1823-1 is entered on the top margin of the new AF Form 1823/1823-1.
      On the delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1, the delayed work order number is printed in the
      middle of the AF Form 1823/ 1823-1. Print all other information as if this was an actual
      AF Form 1823/1823-1, with the exception that the word ―DELAYED‖ will be printed in
      the upper, right-hand corner.
      7.19.6.2. The original AF Form 1823/1823-1 is input in the computer for processing.
      Update delayed maintenance on the AF Form 1824, Motor Vehicle Work Order Status
      (see Section 7I). Note: Refer to AFCSM 24-1 for a list of work order number prefix and
      maintenance delay codes used for AF Form 1823/1823-1 entries.
   7.19.7. The AF Form 1823/1823-1 for accident repairs includes the following costs on
   separate line entries for damaged vehicles.
      7.19.7.1. All direct labor and material costs.
      7.19.7.2. Indirect cost.
          7.19.7.2.1. Shop indirect cost equals direct labor hours expended to repair the vehicle
          times the indirect hourly rate on the Employee Master List, PCN SB004-029 (these
          costs are not to be used for assessing ROS charges).
          7.19.7.2.2. Towing costs equals miles towed times wrecker O&M cost per mile plus
          operator’s hourly rate times the number of hours used or actual cost if contracted.
          7.19.7.2.3. Storage cost, if identified on an off-base invoice.
          7.19.7.2.4. The loss of use cost. This cost is computed by dividing the total service
          life (months) into the acquisition cost. Then compute use cost per month times
          number of months out of service. The provisions of this paragraph only apply if a
          replacement vehicle is required to be leased during the repair process. Note: If any
          combination of the above was completed by off-base contractors, the invoice should
          be used to compute the loss of use cost if a commercial or GSA vehicle is leased to
          replace the damaged vehicle in repair. Attach a copy of each invoice used and a copy
          of the completed AF Form 20 to the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
7.20. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1823/1823-1.
   7.20.1. Block 1, Replacement Code Change. (One-time repair, age or miles). If the repair
   cost exceeds the one-time repair limit and it is decided not to repair the vehicle or equipment
   and it is returned to the user, check the one-time repair block and enter the new replacement
   code. VM&A makes the necessary changes to update the vehicle master list PCN SB004-
   023. The computer will automatically update the code to A, B, C or D, as applicable. Note:
   Whenever a vehicle is placed in one of these codes, jobs that were not accomplished will be
   delayed using code "G."
186                                        AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   7.20.2. Block 2, Work Order Number. Always five characters. The first character is always
   an alpha character that shows the type of work being done. See AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4,
   for a list of approved prefixes.
   7.20.3. Block 3, Reimbursable Distribution Code. A one-position code that shows how costs
   are distributed (reimbursable or refundable) to a tenant organization or transient vehicle.
   VM&A loads the applicable code in OLVIMS for those vehicles assigned to the base and
   makes an entry on the AF Form 1823/1823-1 for applicable transient vehicles. The proper
   code is obtained from Accounting and Finance. Refer to paragraph 7.51
   7.20.4. Block 4, Registration Number. Enter the vehicle’s registration number. The
   registration number is always eight positions.
   7.20.5. Block 5, USAF Management Code. Enter the vehicle’s management code.
   7.20.6. Block 6, Miles/Hours. Enter hours, miles or kilometers as shown on the vehicle’s
   hour meter or odometer. Round the entry to the nearest whole hour, mile or kilometer. For
   vehicles that have both hour meters and odometers installed, determine the proper entry from
   the vehicle master list. For vehicles or equipment managed under utilization code "U", leave
   this block blank. The incoming inspector validates the odometer or hour meter reading.
      7.20.6.1. New odometers or hour meters are set to show the accumulated miles, hours or
      kilometers. The cumulative figure may be obtained from the latest quick reference or
      vehicle master listing. If the new odometer or hour meter cannot be preset, then the past
      accumulated miles, hours or kilometers become the "add-on" figure in OLVIMS using
      the "AZ" transaction. Once the "add-on" has been entered into OLVIMS, only the present
      meter reading needs to be entered on the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
      7.20.6.2. During the period that odometers or hour meters are inoperative, then show
      cumulative miles, hours or kilometers on the quick reference listing, minus any indicated
      "add-on".
      7.20.6.3. For vehicles with inoperative odometers or hour meters, use the accumulated
      miles, kilometers or hours on the latest maintenance quick reference list for all service
      and maintenance documentation, as the miles, kilometers or hours value is adjusted in the
      OLVIMS by the mileage estimator.
   7.20.7. Block 7, Work Center. Enter the work center code assigned to the maintenance
   activity where the work is done. See AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4.
   7.20.8. Block 8, Work Order Status. Check the initial/incomplete block when the AF Form
   1823/ 1823-1 is opened. When the shop’s AF Form 1823/1823-1 is completed, check the
   complete block.
   7.20.9. Block 9, User Phone Number. Enter the telephone number of the using activity.
   7.20.10. Block 10, Priority. Enter the priority for work to be performed according to
   paragraph 3.29.3
   7.20.11. Block 11, Manufacturer. Enter the make of the vehicle or equipment item, such as
   Dodge, Ford, etc.
   7.20.12. Block 12, Model/Type. Enter the model or type of the vehicle or equipment item
   such as F-150 pickup, etc.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                       187


  7.20.13. Block 13, Certified By. The work center supervisor or technician signs the AF Form
  1823/ 1823-1 to indicate completion and certification that entries are complete and factual to
  the best of their knowledge.
  7.20.14. Block 14, Received (Date/Time). Enter the date (MMDDYY) the vehicle was
  turned in to the shop or when the request for Vehicle Management support (mobile, wrecker,
  etc.) was received (example 013199 for 31 January 1999). Enter the clock time the vehicle
  was turned in using a 24-hour clock. The date and time starts when the vehicle or equipment
  item is physically turned in to the Vehicle Management facility or when a request for Vehicle
  Management support (mobile, wrecker, etc.) is received. Date and time must match the date
  and time reported to Vehicle Management on the Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble
  Report. Vehicles awaiting accident, abuse and repair decisions/ repairs are not available to
  the user and will draw downtime.
  7.20.15. Block 14A, Released (Date/Time). Enter the date and the 24-hour clock time the
  vehicle was released from Vehicle Management or the management support (mobile, etc.)
  was completed and the vehicle returned to the user (reflect period that vehicle is not
  operational).
  7.20.16. Block 15, Repair Estimates. Use blocks 15A through F for estimating costs of
  accident repairs and repairs that may cause the one-time repair limit to be exceeded. Make
  this estimate before work is started to avoid unauthorized repairs.
     7.20.16.1. If the repair action places the vehicle in replacement codes A, B, C or D for
     maximum one-time repair cost and the decision is made by the VFM or VMS not to
     repair the vehicle, check block 1. The VFM or VMS will provide VM&A with
     disposition instructions.
     7.20.16.2. Indirect costs are entered in block 15D. The indirect hourly rates can be
     obtained from the Employee Master List, PCN SB004-029.
  7.20.17. Block 16, Job Number. This is a preprinted number that shows the work to be done
  in block 21. If more than seven jobs are required to repair a vehicle, a continuation AF Form
  1823/1823-1 can be made using the same work order number and changing the job numbers
  in block 16 to 8 through 14. A new AF Form 1823/1823-1 work order number is required for
  any vehicle with over 28 jobs.
  7.20.18. Block 17, System Code. The four-digit, alphanumeric code shows the system,
  subsystem and component codes on which work was performed. The OLVIMS ―Help File‖
  lists the approved codes.
  7.20.19. Block 18, Operations. No entry required.
  7.20.20. Block 19, Maintenance Code. Use this code to identify delayed and NMCS
  maintenance conditions. See AFCSM 24-1 for codes and descriptions. VM&A enters these
  codes on the shop's copy of the AF Form 1823/1823-1.
     7.20.20.1. When a delayed item is shown on the shop's copy of the completed AF Form
     1823/ 1823-1, the VM&A Workload Controller makes a new AF Form 1823/1823-1 (in
     sufficient copies) for the delayed item.
188                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


       7.20.20.2. Enter the work order number, date and time from the original AF Form
       1823/1823-1 on the top margin of the new AF Form 1823/1823-1. Input the data from the
       original AF Form 1823/ 1823-1 in OLVIMS.
   7.20.21. Block 20, Action Taken. The work center enters or circles the letter-code that best
   shows the actual maintenance action. Refer to AFCSM 24-1 for a list of the 13 action codes.
   7.20.22. Block 21, Job Description. Enter a brief description of the job to be performed. For
   TCTO accomplishment, enter the TO and data code number. This entry should be clear and
   tell the technician the exact malfunction and what has to be done. Example: Replace water
   pump and repair shift linkage. The shop supervisor ensures the description identifies the
   repair or service actually completed. Make a separate entry for each special test done. Note:
   Add separate entries to reflect actual maintenance actions, i.e., remove broken exhaust
   manifold stud, free-up rusted brake linkage, etc. Do not take the total repair time against a
   single job described as "replaced exhaust gasket" or "replaced brake shoes‖.
   7.20.23. Block 22, Estimated Labor Hours. CSC enters the estimated hours to do the job
   described in block 21. Use the estimated hours for workload planning, scheduling
   maintenance and productivity assessments.
       7.20.23.1. If the work performed does not agree with the job described on the AF Form
       1823/ 1823-1, VM&A enters a revised estimated hour for the job actually performed. For
       example, if the job description called for brake shoe replacement, but an adjustment fixed
       the problem, then an estimated hour rate for the adjustment must be entered on VM&A’s
       copy of the AF Form 1823/ 1823-1 also.
       7.20.23.2. If the work center supervisor enters additional jobs on the shop’s copy of the
       AF Form 1823/1823-1, they must also be entered on VM&A’s copy and the estimated
       labor hour rate revised. Note: For delayed maintenance AF Form 1823/1823-1s, update
       the estimated hour rate by using AF Form 1824.
   7.20.24. Block 23, Employee ID Number, Labor Hours and Overtime Indicator. Enter in the
   upper portion of the block the employee identification number of the technician who did the
   job. Enter in the lower portion of the appropriate block the actual labor hours used to do the
   job. This entry is in hours and 10ths. Use an overtime or holiday work code when the actual
   labor hours were expended during these periods. (AFCSM 24-1 contains these codes.) If
   actual labor hours are used during both normal duty hours and overtime periods, the
   technician must make separate entries.

Section 7D— AF Form 1827 and Tire and Battery Shop Man Hour Documentation

7.21. General Information. The AF Form 1827 is used to record minor maintenance repair
actions for jobs of 2 labor hours or less on vehicles and equipment items (time awaiting parts,
awaiting maintenance and direct labor hours combined must not exceed 2 hours). Document the
vehicle kilometer, miles or hour data to update the specific vehicle master record. The AF Form
1827 is also used to document labor hours: In tire and battery shop stock buildup or repair;
hazardous/solid waste management, disposal and training; and repair of shop equipment or
spares. Use the AF Form 1827 to collect direct labor hours used for these activities. Note: The
AF Form 1827 will not be used to record multiple jobs on the same vehicle during the same
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        189


repair time frame. Each line on the AF Form 1827 is interpreted as a separate work order in
OLVIMS.
7.22. Procedures for Completing an AF Form 1827.
   7.22.1. Minor maintenance documented on an AF Form 1827 is limited to minor
   maintenance repair actions of 2 labor hours or less on vehicles and equipment items (time
   awaiting parts, awaiting maintenance and direct labor hours combined must not exceed 2
   hours) that use only low-cost bench/working stock, work order residue, shop stock and non-
   warranted parts (parts that are not being locally tracked).
   7.22.2. Do not use AF Form 1827 for scheduled services, inspections or transient vehicle
   repair.
   7.22.3. Send AF Form 1827 to VM&A weekly, when the form is filled or as prescribed by
   the VFM or VMS. Use a new AF Form 1827 for each processing cycle, except for the tire
   and battery shop. Note: Labor hours may be entered on the AF Form 1827 for inspection of
   vehicles and equipment prior to deployment or other contingency exercises, applying the
   same limitations as in paragraph 7.22.2
7.23. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1827.
   7.23.1. Block 1, Date. Enter the date on which the vehicle was repaired. For J9998 and
   J9999 entries, this date tells when the labor hours were used.
   7.23.2. Block 2, Work Order Number. Enter the fifth position of the preprinted ―J999‖ work
   order number as follows:
       7.23.2.1. Use "6" for hazardous/solid waste management, disposal and training.
       7.23.2.2. Use "7" for minor and mobile maintenance actions (time awaiting parts,
       awaiting maintenance and direct labor hours combined must not exceed 2 hours).
       7.23.2.3. Use "8" to record labor hours used in the battery shop to service or recharge
       batteries for stock. Also use ―8‖ to record labor hours used in the tire shop to build up
       spares for stock. Direct labor hours and material cost used to install new batteries and
       tires are charged against the vehicle on an individual AF Form 1823/1823-1.
       7.23.2.4. Use ―9‖ to record labor hours used for the repair of spares or shop equipment.
   7.23.3. Block 3, USAF Management Code. Not required.

   odometer or hour meter reading, as described in paragraph 7.20.6 For all other work order
   numbers, leave blank.
   7.23.6. Block 6, Action Taken. For J9997 work order number only, enter the letter that most
   nearly describes the actual maintenance action: G-repair; L-adjust; R-replace; or S-service.
   For all other work order numbers, leave blank.
   7.23.7. Block 7, Job Description. Enter a brief description of the job to be performed.
190                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   7.23.8. Block 8, Actual Labor Hours. Enter the actual direct labor hours used to do the
   repair. This entry is in hours and tenths. For J9997 work order numbers, this entry does not
   exceed 2.0 hours. Use the AF Form 1823/1823-1 if the vehicle downtime exceeds 2.0 hours
   (awaiting maintenance/parts and direct labor hours combined).
       7.23.8.1. Document repairs, servicing and upkeep of shop equipment and repair or
       rebuild of repairable (spares) items on AF Form 1827 using work order number J9999.
       For this type of work, if more than 9.9 labor hours are shown, they must be entered into
       the data system as multiple job entries.
   7.23.9. Block 9, Overtime Indicator Code. Enter an overtime or holiday work code when the
   actual labor hours were spent during overtime or holiday hours. AFCSM 24-1 shows a list of
   these work codes.

   number of the technician who did the repair.
   7.23.11. Block 11, Status. Enter an "X" in this block to show completion of the required
   work. For J9997 work order number, enter a "/" to indicate this requirement was referred to
   an individual AF Form 1823/1823-1. Line entries with a "/" in block 11 will not be input to
   OLVIMS. Account for labor hours and required work on the subsequent AF Form
   1823/1823-1.

Section 7E— Labor Hour Reporting, AF Form 1831, Indirect Labor Time Card and AF Form
1831-1, Indirect Labor Time Sheet

7.24. Labor Hour Reporting. The motor vehicle labor hour reporting system is based on
categorizing labor hours into three areas: Direct (0 series), indirect productive (20 series) and
indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series). These hours are categorized to show the efficiency of
the vehicle activity by comparing productive hours with hours used to support that activity, such
as clerical, supervisory, material chasing and so forth. The third category of labor, indirect
nonproductive, shows labor hours that were not used in repairing vehicles. Labor codes and
categories are explained in AFCSM 24-1. Note: Reporting of indirect nonproductive labor hours
is mandatory. The VFM or VMS will monitor use of 40- and 50-series labor codes to ensure they
are properly recorded and entered in OLVIMS, rather than have these hours default to indirect
productive (20 series) labor hours. Adjust available hours of personnel deployed in support of
contingency operations or AEF rotations to zero.
   7.24.1. Direct labor hours used by maintenance technicians are entered on the AF Form
   1823/1823-1 or AF Form 1827. Use work codes to show whether hours were used during
   normal duty hours or overtime or holiday periods. Work codes are shown in AFCSM 24-1.
   7.24.2. Indirect productive (20 series) labor hours are computed by OLVIMS, with the
   exception of 20-series labor hours used during periods of overtime or during a holiday.
   Document overtime and holiday indirect productive labor hours on AF Form 1831 or AF
   Form 1831-1.
   7.24.3. Indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series) labor hours are entered on AF Form 1831
   or AF Form 1831-1 by shop personnel.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        191


   7.24.4. Summarize and report work center labor hour utilization data on a monthly basis for
   management. OLVIMS captures productive (0 series) labor hours entered on AF Form
   1823/1823-1s and overtime and holiday indirect productive labor hours, as well as indirect
   nonproductive labor hours entered on AF Form 1831 or AF Form 1831-1. These hours are
   then subtracted from the total hours management personnel were assigned to calculate the
   indirect productive labor hours.
   7.24.5. Labor hours are collected for each employee by the employee’s identification
   number from AF Form 1823/1823-1s and Indirect Labor Hour Time Cards or Indirect Labor
   Hour Time Sheets. This data is then applied to a name in the Master Personnel File (PCN
   SB004029) and summarized to a particular work center by OLVIMS. There is no attempt to
   reconcile any individual employee’s labor hours. As a consequence, this labor hour reporting
   system is considered ongoing; that is, no close-out of AF Form 1823/1823-1 labor data is
   needed for labor hour balancing. A sufficient amount of labor hour data within a work center
   offsets month-to-month highs and lows in this data.
   7.24.6. Through this labor hour reporting system, labor hour distribution and utilization data
   are readily available for use by vehicle managers at all levels. AFCSM 24-1 describes labor
   hour reports.
7.25. AF Form 1831/1831-1. AF Form 1831-1 is an OLVIMS-generated time sheet. These
forms are used to record an individual’s overtime and holiday indirect productive or indirect
nonproductive labor. It is not necessary that each reportable employee submit one of these labor
cards/sheets each reporting period. In the absence of an indirect labor card/sheet for any
employee, the data system assumes that all the labor for that employee is divided between direct
and indirect productive labor hours. Where no direct labor is put on AF Form 1823/1823-1s for
that employee, the system then assumes all assigned hours were used in the indirect productive
(support) category, with no overtime or holiday hours used.
   7.25.1. The same AF Form 1831/1831-1 for each employee is used for the whole month. At
   the end of the month, a copy is sent to VM&A for input into OLVIMS, unless otherwise
   directed by the VFM or VMS.
   7.25.2. VM&A receives a copy of the AF Form 1831s/1831-1s at the end of the month from
   all work centers for processing. When the labor hour utilization summaries and reports are
   complete, VM&A sends a copy to the appropriate work center.
       7.25.2.1. VM&A processes the individual time card or sheet into a "GN" transaction as
       outlined in AFCSM 24-1.
   7.25.3. AF Form 1831s are not preprinted for individual employees. All entries on the cards
   are made manually. Separate cards are used for an individual transferring between work
   centers to show labor hours in each work center.
   7.25.4. AF Form 1831-1 is preprinted with individual employees’ names and man numbers.
   All other entries on these forms are made manually. Separate sheets are used for an
   individual transferring between work centers to show labor hours in each work center.
7.26. How to Fill Out AF Form 1831s/1831-1s.
   7.26.1. AF Form 1831 entries.
       7.26.1.1. Block 1, Card Code. VM&A always enters "G".

           7.26.1.8.3. Block 8C, Work Code. Enter a work code only when showing use of
           indirect productive (20 series) labor hours during overtime and holiday periods.
           Leave blank when documenting the use of indirect nonproductive (40 and 50 series)
           labor codes.
           7.26.1.8.4. Block 8D, Hours. Enter the labor hours and 10ths reported against the
           labor code shown in block 8B. Whole hours are entered in the first part of the block
           and 10ths entered in the last part (separated by a broken line).
   7.26.2. AF Form 1831-1 Entries.
       7.26.2.1. The AF Form 1831-1 is preprinted with the work center and employee’s name
       on it. To complete the form, fill in the indirect labor hours to the right of the respective
       day of the month and under the labor series for each employee (overtime 20 series, 40
       and 50 series).
       7.26.2.2. At the end of the month, total the labor hours for each employee and labor
       series and return the form to VM&A.

Section 7I— AF Form 1824

7.33. General Information. AF Form 1824s may be used by VM&A to update information on
the Delayed Maintenance Report (PCN SB004-015) via OLVIMS. Vehicles and equipment items
are automatically entered on the delayed maintenance report for delayed maintenance repairs as a
result of the maintenance code in block 19 of the AF Form 1823/1823-1. The AF Form 1824 is
also used to start and stop NMCS hours in OLVIMS, add or change bin locations, transfer
delayed parts costs, and delete or adjust labor hours.
7.34. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1824.
   7.34.1. When the first part is received against a delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1, Materiel
   Control bins the part and gives VM&A an AF Form 1824 showing the bin location so that
   the delayed maintenance record may be updated. This is accomplished by making the
   following entries:
       7.34.1.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form
       1823/1823-1.
       7.34.1.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
       7.34.1.3. Bin Location. Enter the bin location and place an "X" beside the "Z" under
       Type Transaction. Once the bin location has been established, all subsequent part receipts
       against that delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1 will also be assigned to that bin. If a new bin
       location is desired for additional parts, a new AF Form 1824 must be submitted reflecting
       the new location. The new bin location will only affect future parts as they are received
       and will not affect parts already on hand. Parts received without a bin location established
       will display a location of XXX; changing the bin locations for parts already on hand is
       accomplished with a "SW" transaction.
   7.34.2. When Materiel Control tells VM&A that a change in the status of parts and material
   has been made for a delayed AF Form 1823/1823-1, VM&A creates an AF Form 1824 to
   reflect this change by making the following entries:
       7.34.2.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form
       1823/1823-1.
       7.34.2.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
       7.34.2.3. Parts Status. Enter an "X" in the block beside either the letter "P" or "C" as the
       parts status code. The letter "C" (complete) is entered when all parts and material to
       accomplish delayed repairs on a specific AF Form 1823/1823-1 have been received. The
       letter "P" (partial) is entered to show only partial receipt of delayed parts or material. The
198                                         AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


      letter "P" is programmatically entered by OLVIMS when the first part is received and
      should therefore only be entered when a previously completed delayed action reverts to a
      partial due to cannibalization.
   7.34.3. When all delayed work against a specific maintenance code has been completed,
   VM&A creates an AF Form 1824 to delete that code from the delayed maintenance file by
   making the following entries:
      7.34.3.1. Work Order Number. Enter the work order number from the AF Form
      1823/1823-1.
      7.34.3.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
      7.34.3.3. Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the code to be
      deleted.
      7.34.3.4. Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter a ―0‖
      (Zero). Note: If the code deleted is the only one for which the vehicle is currently
      delayed, the entire AF Form 1823/1823-1 will be removed from the file. However, you
      cannot zero out all delayed hours on any AF Form 1823/1823-1 for which parts are still
      being reflected on the Delayed Parts File.
      7.34.3.5. Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the
      last three digits of the work center where the maintenance was delayed.
   7.34.4. When it is necessary to adjust delayed labor hours, VM&A submits an AF Form
   1824 with the following entries:
      7.34.4.1. Work Order Number.         Enter the work order number from the AF Form
      1823/1823-1.
      7.34.4.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
      7.34.4.3. Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the code you
      wish to adjust.
      7.34.4.4. Labor Hours (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter
      adjusted labor hours (hours and 10ths).
      7.34.4.5. Work Center (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the
      last three digits of the work center in which the adjustment took place.
   7.34.5. When informed that maintenance delayed for one reason has now changed to another
   or that maintenance delayed in one work center has been transferred to another, VM&A
   initiates an AF Form 1824 to change the maintenance code or work center by making the
   following entries:
      7.34.5.1. Work Order Number.         Enter the work order number from the AF Form
      1823/1823-1.
      7.34.5.2. Date. Enter the date the form is initiated.
      7.34.5.3. Code (block under Current/Original Data section of form). Enter the original
      code.

sends completed documents to VM&A for processing. Note: Except for L9999 purchases, items
drawn directly from COPARS, base supply or commercial source are charged on the AF Form
1823/1823-1 authorizing the repair, regardless of the item cost.

Section 7K— AF Form 1832

7.37. General Information. With the work center supervisor’s assistance, Materiel Control
initiates an AF Form 1832 when cannibalization action is recommended. Materiel Control
completes the "Action by Materiel Control" section and forwards the document to VM&A. If
cannibalization is not needed, no further action is necessary and the AF Form 1832 may be
destroyed. If cannibalization is needed, workload control makes entries in their part of the form,
and sends it to the VFM or VMS. The completed AF Form 1832 provides the information
needed for Vehicle Management to decide whether approval to cannibalize is justified.
7.38. How to Fill Out an AF Form 1832.

7.47. Work Codes. Work codes (see AFCSM 24-1) are used for those bases using OLVIMS to
support labor-hour reporting requirements.
7.48. Work Order Number Prefix Code. Work order prefix codes are used to show the type
of work the AF Form 1823/1823-1 was primarily opened for (see AFCSM 24-1).
7.49. Management Codes. Management codes for registered vehicles and equipment items are
found in the VMIF. Management codes for non-registered vehicles and equipment items are
found in the OLVIMS ―Help File‖. Management codes which are not pre-loaded in OLVIMS
will be rejected, in which case use the proper ―alpha character‖ and 999, temporarily.
7.50. Delayed Maintenance Codes. Delayed maintenance codes are used on the AF Form
1823/1823-1 and the delayed maintenance report (PCN SB004-015) to show the reason a repair
action has been delayed. Find these codes in AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4, or in the OLVIMS
―Help File‖.
7.51. Reimbursable and Distribution (R&D) Codes. R&D codes denote the organization for
which charges are refundable or reimbursable (see AFCSM 24-1, Attachment 4). At the
beginning of each FY, and when a change is required, VM&A furnishes a list of tenant
organizations supported to Accounting and Finance (through the Budget Office) for certification.
Accounting and Finance identifies which organizations are reimbursable (Code 3) or refundable
(Code 4) (refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 7, Support Guidance, and Volume 2,
Attachment 10, WIMS, OLVIMS, and Other Management Reports). Accounting and Finance
returns this certified list to VM&A to be used to enter the correct codes into OLVIMS.
   7.51.1. All reimbursable and refundable cost data must be reconciled monthly with
   Accounting and Finance. This data must be verified for accuracy, to include validating that
   all reimbursable and refundable units are loaded properly in OLVIMS.
   7.51.2. Vehicle and equipment work orders for vehicles assigned to reimbursable and
   refundable units will be retained for at least 1 year after the close-out date for reference for
   inquiries and audits.
   7.51.3. RC/CC codes will be validated at least annually.
7.52. System Codes. Vehicle system codes define the specific repair on a vehicle. They are
used for historical purposes and failure data capture toward improvements in reliability,
maintainability and deploy ability. Find these codes in the OLVIMS ―Help File‖.
7.53. System and Subsystem Descriptions. Subsystem codes are used to more closely define
the actual work performed during the repair, inspection and service cycle. These subsystem

codes are required entries in block 20 of the Vehicle Historical Record (OLVIMS PCN SB004-
828). When conscientiously applied, they help detect and control repeat maintenance. Sub codes
not assigned a specific description may be developed locally, when required. Find the codes and
their descriptions in the OLVIMS ―Help File‖.

8.1. Authority and Responsibilities
   8.1.1. Program Authority. The Headquarters United States Air Force, Deputy Chief of Staff,
   Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, Directorate of Logistics (HQ USAF/A4L) is the
   VEMSO Executive Agent.
   8.1.2. Program Responsibility. The Materials Support Division (HQ USAF/A4LE), acts on
   behalf of the Executive Agent. HQ USAF/A4LE establishes and enforces element policy,
   goals, objectives and proposes projects of interest to the AF Vehicle Management
   community.
      8.1.2.1. HQ USAF/A4LE designates the VEMSO authority to perform in the capacity as
      an adjunct to the staff. They are responsible for all data collection and draft report
      generation required above the MAJCOM level. While they are responsible for the data
      collection and draft report generation, each MAJCOM finalizes their own written
      narrative to those reports as required.
8.2. VEMSO Duties on Behalf of HQ USAF/A4LE
   8.2.1. Manage and draft for approval all changes or revisions to transportation policy
   directives, instructions and TO 36-1-191. The VEMSO will collect all inputs, consolidate
   and create a draft for MAJCOM review and coordination. Upon reconciling all MAJCOM
   inputs (or identifying unresolved conflicts), the VEMSO will present the draft to HQ
   USAF/A4LE for final review, approval and coordination to publish. Additionally, the
   VEMSO staff will review all MAJCOM supplements to the above listed publications and
   forward to HQ USAF/A4LE for final approval. The VEMSO will coordinate suggested
   changes to supplements with the submitting MAJCOM before forwarding to A4LE.
   8.2.2. Collect and generate all annual reports and data updates as required by HQ
   USAF/A4LE. Some examples of these annual reports are: (1) Federal Automotive
   Statistical Tool (FAST), (2) Presidential Budget (PB) 41, (3) OMB Circular Exhibits 33 and
   55, (4) AFI 65-503, Cost and Planning Factors update, (5) AF Financial Plan Input (lease
   cost data) and (6) Annual Energy Report to name a few. Note: Each session of Congress,

   Maintain the AS and coordinate all recommended changes with each MAJCOM.
   8.2.11. The preferred AF POC with the GSA Regional and National Fleet Managers. This
   does not preclude each base or MAJCOM from interacting with GSA at appropriate levels,
   only offers a common POC for GSA. The VEMSO will reach out to appropriate contacts
   within the vehicle community to resolve issues or concerns with the GSA leased vehicle
   program.
   8.2.12. Perform VVVs on all vehicle fleets.
      8.2.12.1. Remaining within current ceiling authorization-levels should be a consideration
      during the decision-making process. If a genuine mission change has not occurred (i.e.,
      additional aircraft assigned, new weapon systems deployed, new units assigned to a base,
      etc.) then the total number of authorized vehicles at a base cannot increase.
      8.2.12.2. Some additional factors to consider during the process are the mission,
      base/unit population, physical layout of the installation and geographical region/climate
      as well as the needs of the customer.
   8.2.13. TCTOs, SBs and OTIs management. The VEMSO will manage and monitor all
   TCTOs, SBs, and OTIs and other related vehicle compliance inspections that are loaded into
   CARS, and make updates into the WR-ALC CARS database. The VEMSO will provide a
   summary to AF/A4LE and MAJCOMs upon request.
      8.2.13.1. Follow-up on units not in compliance with established completion dates.
      8.2.13.2. Collect compliance data and forward to WR-ALC points of contact as required.
   8.2.14. Provide regular summaries to AF Vehicle Management units of maintenance tips and
   techniques to enhance efficiency and safe maintenance operations. Summarize this
   information in user-friendly publications (may be electronically transmitted) that effectively
   transmit information to the technician level.
   8.2.15. The VEMSO will correspond and interact directly with unit/base level OPRs to
   consolidate reoccurring monthly and quarterly legacy system data call requirements.
      8.2.15.1. The VEMSO will provide consolidated data/reports to MAJCOMs and K-
      Loader SPO as required.
   8.2.16. The VEMSO is the approving authority for all Air Force Forms 601 that require Air
   Staff approval for new missions and requirements.
   8.2.17. AF/A4LE has designated the VEMSO as approval/disapproval authority of all
   command levy requests for vehicle shipments between commands. Losing and gaining
   MAJCOMs will provide coordination on requests prior to submitting to the VEMSO.
   Gaining MAJCOMS must have valid authorizations for all assets requested for approval. All
   requests    will be    sent   to    the   VEMSO’s         common       e-mail    address:
   afelm.vemso@langley.af.mil. The VEMSO will return approval/disapproval to the
   respective MAJCOMs with a courtesy copy to AF/A4LE. Additionally, AF directed cross

   command redistribution orders will be generated by the VEMSO as required to support
   routine, priority and contingency missions.
      8.2.17.1. Transfer of AFRC or ANG assets between any commands requires AFRC or
      ANG A4R approval respectively. The A4R approval letter must state if recoupment or
      non-recoupment of funds/asset(s) are required in accordance with Title 10 law before
      command levy action can occur.

   part of the official evaluation and approval matrix, but is available to advise, research and
   coordinate on all suggestions regarding vehicles and Vehicle Management processes.
   8.3.8. Vendor Product Evaluations. The VEMSO will conduct vendor product evaluations as
   requested by at least two interested MAJCOMS. This is necessary to ensure time and
   resources expended during product evaluations produce tangible benefits to the AF vehicle
   community, with the primary focus on enhancement of deployed operations. See
   Attachment 8 for additional information regarding the vendor product evaluation process.
8.4. AEF Support. The VEMSO will be the vehicle community focal point to create, collect
and monitor all issues related to AEF support. This includes development and maintenance of
TMSK, deployment lessons learned database, and research and evaluation of tools and
equipment to support Vehicle Management operations in an expeditionary, deployed
environment.
   8.4.1. Tools and equipment will be specifically chosen for transportability (light weight and
   small size); ease of use in the field (power requirements, etc.); and overall necessity and
   practicality for the type of maintenance performed.

      personnel subject to deploy.
   8.4.4. Develop standards of vehicle condition for deploying vehicles to ensure maximum
   reliability in field conditions with minimal investment. Monitor condition of vehicles
   deployed through collection and dissemination of ―lessons-learned‖ and other means to
   institutionalize readiness and maximize return on investment.
   8.4.5. Perform "reach-back" tech data support for deployed vehicle maintainers with
   emergency tech data requirements.
8.5. VEMSO Product Support Cell (PSC), previously known as Centralized Registered
Equipment Management System (C-REMS). PSC performs a monthly scheduled command
reconciliation between selected base-level Automated Fleet Information System (AFIS),
Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), MAJCOM Automated Fleet Information System
(MAFIS) and the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) ensuring 100%
authorization integrity and asset accountability.
   8.5.1. As technologies evolve, customer needs and other external conditions change, PSC
   will be continually refined and improved to ensure our ability to:
      8.5.1.1. Collect, integrate, assimilate, and effectively manage vehicle Custodian
      Authorization Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) for all base-level host and tenant units.
      8.5.1.2. Develop new or improved processes for all vehicle authorization/asset
      transactions in SBSS.
      8.5.1.3. Monitor and maintain individual MAJCOM and base Vehicle Authorization
      Lists (VAL) for reconciliations, changes, updates, additions, and deletions.
      8.5.1.4. Advance organizational performance across the entire PSC work portfolio to
      include: 100% accountability for all products, physical and informational infrastructure
      and workforce management practices.
   8.5.2. Over time, these core functions will drive PSC’s ability to facilitate resource
   management decisions and provide 100% data integrity of all Air Force vehicles. This
   transformation effort supports the Air Force Command and Control Enabling Concept
   (Change 2) and supplements the responsibilities and organizational construct of Component
   MAJCOMs and Component NAFs that are addressed in HQ USAF Program Action Directive
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      211


   (PAD) 06-09, Air Force Component Organization. It formalizes, supplements, and
   implements appropriate provisions of HAF PAD 07-13, Implementation of the CSAF
   Direction to Transform and Consolidate Headquarters Management Functions, Annex D,
   Logistics, Installations and Mission Support and applicable Appendices; and implements
   results of the AF/A4R AFSO21 centralized vehicle accountability Rapid Improvement Event,
   23 March 2007.
   8.5.3. Background. Traditionally, our vehicle management processes have been marginally
   successful in sustaining accountability by using multiple legacy operating systems. This has
   been validated by various audits conducted at unit and AF levels. Establishing PSC at the
   enterprise level will achieve data synchronization by centralizing execution of accountable
   vehicle transactions and monthly reconciliation of legacy systems databanks.
   8.5.4. The flow charts in Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2 depict the current flow of vehicle
   accountability data and the future state. When the process of REMS was transferred to
   vehicle management in the late 1980s, each main operating base earned one full-time
   equivalent to support this function. Over time, requirements have been reduced by
   modernization of legacy systems and the manning has been integrated with other duties;
   however units have retained the same manning level.

  Figure 8.2. Future State Accountability Process




      8.5.5. Creation and implementation of PSC generates significant savings by eliminating 90%
      of the unit-level activities associated with data reconciliation between multiple legacy
      systems. Efficiencies gained in man-hour processing time will be captured during the
      capabilities based manpower standard transformation. For outsourced operations, reduced
      requirements determination will be addressed via contract updates or when contracts come up
      on their normal renegotiation schedule.
      8.5.6. The manpower requirement for PSC in Table 8.1 are based on one authorization per
      2,000 vehicles and resulted from benchmarking HQ ACC’s South West Asia C-REMS
      function currently in place, with minor adjustments due to a variety of MAJCOM fleet
      postures. The following specific MAJCOM contributions will be required to stand up the C-
      REMS in FY 08 under operational responsibility of the Air Force Element, Vehicle and
      Equipment Management Support Office (AFELM VEMSO), Langley AFB, VA. The
      expectation is manpower positions will be sourced from base level; however MAJCOMs
      have the latitude to use Headquarters or other command positions to fill the requirement.
      Note: Transfer of manpower resource adjustments for this transformation effort will be
      based on negotiated and approved realignments between the gaining and losing MAJCOMs
      and AFELM VEMSO. FY 08 PB manpower profile provided by MAJCOM/A1M should
      correctly reflect what manpower authorizations remain in the MAJCOMs as a result of PBD
      720 reductions. This instruction represents the MAJCOM/A4R Functional agreement and
      coordination for MAJCOM/A1M to initiate the above manpower programming and
      realignment actions.

  contracts come up for renegotiation, at which time, contracts will be modified to transfer PSC
  functions to AFELM VEMSO or remain a reach back capability if legal constraints prevent
  transfer. The MAJCOM functional community will coordinate PSC generated contract
  modifications with the VEMSO as they occur.
  8.5.9. The VEMSO will form a PSC Working Group with the MAJCOMs to work out any
  additional issues required for PSC. The VEMSO will convene the working group at least
  quarterly via video teleconference to provide updates on progress toward implementation and
  address MAJCOM concerns.
  8.5.10. Local fleet managers and MAJCOMs retain sustainment responsibilities for day-to-
  day management of the AF’s fleet. The PSC function will coordinate/collaborate with the
  base-level fleet manager and owning MAJCOMs to ensure resulting updates crossing
  multiple legacy systems and reconciliations are executed in a synchronized manner.

             8.5.11.6.1.1. Download the most current CA/CRL from SBSS and perform a line-
             by-line reconciliation with the base-level AFIS Vehicle Master Report.
             8.5.11.6.1.2. Take appropriate action to research and fix vehicle discrepancies in
             AFIS and SBSS, as required, to ensure 100% authorization integrity and asset
             accountability.
     8.5.11.7. Process of AFEMS Reconciliation (weekly):
         8.5.11.7.1. The VEMSO (PSC) will:
             8.5.11.7.1.1. Access AFEMS and review all vehicle SBSS rejects and variances

             variances caused by required Allowance Standard changes/updates (Hand-off).
8.6. AFEMS and MAJCOM VAL Data Interface. MAJCOM VAL data is used to populate
the following authorization tables in AFEMS:
  8.6.1. DB86 - Vehicle Authorizations.
  8.6.2. War Plans Additive Requirements Incoming MAJCOM VAL data must pass edits
  within AFEMS in order to populate the above database tables. PSC emphasis will be placed
  on correcting rejected MAJCOM VAL records since they inhibit base-level reporting.
  8.6.3. There are two types of edits; Rejects and Variances. A rejected MAJCOM data record
  is not processed and results in SBSS data rejecting in AFEMS because the authorization
  record is not loaded. A variance MAJCOM VAL record is processed in AFEMS but requires
  modification.
  8.6.4. PSC will research rejects and variances one duty day after VAL data has been
  transmitted to AFEMS.
  8.6.5. PSC will process rejects and variances by utilizing the edit logic/corrective action
  information. Once MAJCOM VAL record corrections and/or corrective action have been
  implemented by another agency (i.e., LGR ROF Monitor) retransmit the VAL data to
  AFEMS. Note: It is vital to retransmit the VAL data file after discrepancies are corrected.
  The AFEMS "Daily Corrupt Report" can also be used to locate rejects/variances.
  8.6.6. Vacant vehicle authorizations.
     8.6.6.1. 3400 funded authorizations. If an authorization is vacant for more than 18
     months and no asset is programmed for purchase to fill the authorization it is
     automatically considered invalid and deleted, unless an Exception to Policy has been
     granted by HAF/A4LE.
     8.6.6.2. 3080 funded authorizations. If an authorization is vacant for more than 2
     programming cycles and no asset is programmed for purchase to fill the authorization it is
     automatically considered invalid and deleted, unless an Exception to Policy has been
     granted by HAF/A4LE.

8.7. Leased Vehicle Authorization Management. The following actions will be taken to
establish accountability for leased vehicles.
   8.7.1. After the vehicle is received, verify and use the prime NSN applicable from the
   VMIF, and process a REC to receive the vehicle with the registration number assigned by the
   VEMSO. After processing the REC, process an issue.
   8.7.2. Issues must always be for a quantity of one (1) since a REMS detail is created for each
   registration number issued.
   8.7.3. Issue inputs must contain a transaction exception code of ―6‖, indicating a ―post-post‖
   transaction.
   8.7.4. Ensure the detail record contains equipment code ―V‖; otherwise, the REMS detail
   will not be established during issue processing.
   8.7.5. A vehicle will be loaded into REMS as a suitable (S) substitute only if the asset NSN
   cross-references to the prime NSN. When an asset NSN does not cross to a prime NSN, but
   has similar capabilities, load it as an unsuitable (U) substitute.
   8.7.6. Vehicles will be loaded with the AF registration number issued by the VEMSO. The
   third character will be an ―N‖. For the GSA leases, vehicle will be marked in the same
   manner as OSI vehicles or in a manner to ensure no cost is incurred when GSA turn in action
   is accomplished. Do not change the GSA license plate to the AF assigned registration
   number.
   8.7.7. To ensure audit trail and accountability of lease vehicle turn-ins accomplish the
   applicable following transaction.
      8.7.7.1. For lease turn-in of a ―like asset‖ such as a B102 for a B102 turn the vehicle into
      Base Supply using Status Code ―Q‖ and reissue the replacement with the new registration
      number.
      8.7.7.2. For lease turn in of a ―unlike asset‖ such as a B102 for a B222 turn the vehicle
      into Base Supply using Status Code ―Q‖ and do an FCH Identity Change from the old
      master NSN to the proper NSN to the new master NSN.
      8.7.7.3. For lease turn-in of an asset that does not have an immediate replacement or
      when one won’t be received do a paper work only turn in to DRMO, Status Code ―M.‖
   8.7.8. All assets obtained under a 580 CBSS (WR-ALC) approved Lease With the Option to
   Buy (LWOB) package will be loaded under an equipment code of ―P‖ authorization and
   assigned an ―N‖ registration number by the VEMSO. At the end of the LWOB period, and
   following the assignment of a permanent AF registration number by 580 CBSS, the
   authorization will change to equipment code ―V‖.
8.8. Air Force Owned Vehicle Authorizations. The following actions will be taken to
establish accountability for blue fleet vehicles.
   8.8.1. After the vehicle is received, verify the asset NSN, and process a REC to receive the
   vehicle. After processing the REC, process an issue.
   8.8.2. Issues must always be for a quantity of one (1) since a REMS detail is created for each
   registration number issued.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                        217


   8.8.3. Issue inputs must contain a transaction exception code of ―6‖, indicating a ―post-post‖
   transaction.
   8.8.4. Ensure the detail record contains equipment code ―V‖; otherwise, the REMS detail
   will not be established during issue processing.
   8.8.5. A vehicle will be loaded into REMS as a suitable (S) substitute only if the asset NSN
   cross-references to the prime NSN. When an asset NSN does not cross to a prime NSN, but
   has similar capabilities, load it as an unsuitable (U) substitute.
8.9. P-Series Registered Vehicles. The Office of Special Activities (HQ AFMC/A5J) is the AF
focal point for special project vehicles. Do not report P-series vehicles through REMS. HQ
AFMC/A5J assigns P-series registration numbers and accounts for the acquisition, procurement
and distribution of the vehicle fleet until disposition.
8.10. Vehicle Shipments. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs normally direct vehicle
shipments. Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding the
transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-201, Cargo Movement,
Chapter 3. When a vehicle is shipped, the computer-generated Vehicle Historical Record,
Vehicle Master Transfer Report, floppy disk and pertinent technical data will be sent to the
gaining installation. Process AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, to remove the vehicle from
the SBSS (DD Form 1348-1A). In either case, the C-REMS Manager must sign in block one.
Send vehicle record jacket and either the ―A5J‖ or ―SHP‖ document to TMF. The gaining VM
initiates follow-up action on vehicles not received within the specified time frame.
8.11. Vehicle Shipments to Depot Repair. Certain types of vehicles are eligible for depot-
level repairs. Local Traffic Management Flight will assist with guidance on funding the
transportation costs associated with an RDO as provided in AFI 24-201. Criteria for these
vehicles are contained in TO 36-1-191, Chapter 9. MAJCOM Vehicle Management Staffs will
provide shipping instructions for vehicles scheduled for depot repair. Three vehicle status codes
apply to depot shipments. Status codes ―B‖ and ―G‖ (accountability not retained by the shipping
base) require processing of turn-in documents. Input of either of these two codes will
automatically create shipping documents. Status code ―R‖ (vehicle programmed for return to the
base) requires preparation only of an off-line ―DO NOT POST‖ shipping document. An FCI 2C
transaction is required to enter status code ―R‖ into the REMS records.
8.12. SBSS Accountable Record Inventory Discrepancy Management.
   8.12.1. False duplicate vehicle registration number in SBSS. Correct by processing an
   inventory adjustment document (IAD; 1GP/SRC). Use of IAD processing will cause M10
   reporting and full explanation on the cause of action and copy of transaction must be
   provided to the responsible LRS office. Also, annotate that a reverse post will not work for
   REMS details per AFMAN 23-110 Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 7 ―I235 MGT Vehicle Issues
   Not Authorized Reverse-Post.‖
   8.12.2. To remove a false NSN serviceable balance (vehicle record). If you discover the
   serviceable balance before issuing any assets to detail process a reverse post, however if you
   have ran an issue on any of the records process an IAD to eliminate the remaining balance.
   Use of IAD processing will cause M10 reporting and full explanation on the cause of action
   and copy of transaction must be provided to the responsible LRS office. Also, annotate that a
218                                          AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009


   reverse post will not work for REMS details per AFMAN 23-110 Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter
   7 ―I235 MGT Vehicle Issues Not Authorized Reverse-Post‖.
   8.12.3. NSN discrepancy between Authorized in use Detail (201) and REM-Vehicles only
   Detail (214). Process an IAD to correct this discrepancy. If the IAD processing does not
   resolve the discrepancy submit FIX action request. Use of IAD processing will cause M10
   reporting and full explanation on the cause of action and copy of transaction must be
   provided to the responsible LRS office. Also, annotate that a reverse post will not work for
   REMS details per AFMAN 23-110 Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 7 ―I235 MGT Vehicle Issues
   Not Authorized Reverse-Post.‖
   8.12.4. When SBSS asset quantity (vehicle count) is greater than the number in AFIS.
   Research AFIS historical records to determine appropriate action required in SBSS. Attach
   historical documentation to accountable documents and file. For balance mismatches that
   historical activity records cannot be found initiate the proper resolution action (i.e., report of
   survey).
8.13. Vehicle Status Codes. These codes indicate the current utilization or physical status/loss
of a vehicle.
   8.13.1. A - Assigned for authorized use (except for Use Code ―M‖ WRM assets). ASC
   cannot be ―987‖.

       9.3.25.7. Give direction to the contractor or employees. Offer advice to the contractor
       which may adversely affect contract performance or compromise the rights of the AF.
9.4. Performance Plan (PP). Identifies the multi-functional team, their roles and
responsibilities, how the team will assess performance and manage the contract to obtain
efficiencies, improved performance, and cost savings throughout its life cycle.
   9.4.1. Use the PP to assess the services provided by the contractor. The PP provides for
   effective and efficient performance assessment to ensure acceptable service is received. The
   performance plan includes:
       9.4.1.1. Objective(s) in having the service provided, i.e., to provide quality vehicle
       maintenance for AF vehicles, while complying with all environmental, air pollution and
       mandated requirements.
       9.4.1.2. Incorporate the strategy, methods and tools the multi-functional teams have
       developed to assess the contractor’s performance against the performance thresholds,
       measurements, metrics and incentives identified in the contract. Performance thresholds
       are measured in terms of quality and timeliness. Include a table that incorporates the
       performance threshold, measurement and metrics.
       9.4.1.3. Develop a management approach, to include methods and tools the multi-
       functional team has developed to validate the objectives and goals identified as part of the
       Performance Plan, i.e. benchmarking, etc.
       9.4.1.4. Provide an incentive plan that validates the objective and goals of the multi-
       functional team.
   9.4.2. Performance metrics are used to track contractor progress towards meeting stated
   performance objectives. The multi-functional team ensures that the performance metrics are
   aligning with the performance-based work statement and overall mission support objectives.
9.5. Performance Assessment Methods. The suggested source of performance assessment is
the contractor’s Management Information System. The purpose of having an information system
is to validate the contractor is performing in accordance to the terms and conditions of the
contract. The data system is used to validate contractor response times, schedules, etc..
   9.5.1. Random Inspection/Sampling. Random visits to assess performance provide the QAP
   with a valuable management tool. Random samplings provide good overall performance
   indicators. Each job is evaluated against the PWS or performance standard to ensure the
   contractor is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract. .The critical
   element in a random sampling evaluation is the samplings taken are truly random and they
   depict the true average performance.
   9.5.2. Checklists. The checklist system is an easy method to identify the routine functions of
   the contractor’s activities. Prepare initial checklists from previously existing inspection
   guidelines and specific provisions in the contract. Review and modify the checklist as
   necessary to ensure accuracy and currency.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                         225


   9.5.3. Customer Complaints. The QAP can use customer complaints to identify potential
   problems. The QAP must train the customer on the terms and conditions of the contract to

9.7. Contract Administration. The QAP has certain responsibilities to be familiar with. The
following are the primary functions and personnel the QAP will routinely deal with:
   9.7.1. FAC. The FAC is a Functional Commander or Functional Director of any functional
   area with government program management responsibility to oversee the functional mission.
   For example, for Vehicle Management the LRS Commander or equivalent is the FAC. They
   are generally responsible for:
      9.7.1.1. Developing and sustaining a sound Quality Assurance Evaluation Program.
      9.7.1.2. Implementing the PP and establishing a comprehensive training program.
      9.7.1.3. Overseeing development of the PWS, PP, market research, government cost
      estimates, funding and evaluation assessment guides.
          9.7.1.3.1. The requirements in the PP and assessment guides are "outcome-based" in
          that they only reflect the desired end results--not the process. Each outcome-based
          requirement includes clear, unambiguous and measurable performance thresholds so
          there is no question whether our mission requirement was met. Performance
          assessment methods are consistent with the standards-focusing on end results, not the
          processes.
   9.7.2. The Contracting Officer is empowered to award and/or administer contracts. The
   Contracting Officer acts as an agent between the AF and the contractor. The Base
   Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to enter into contracts and is responsible for
   reviewing the contractor’s performance to ensure that it is satisfactory and the AF receives
   the products and/or services requested.
   9.7.3. QAPs may be involved in the modification process in the following areas: Identifying
   the required change(s), preparing documentation on the proposed change(s), preparing
   government cost estimate(s), advising the Contracting Officer on technical aspects of the
   change(s), participating in reviews of contractor technical proposals, supporting the
   Contracting Officer in the negotiations of change.

                                    VEHICLE CONTROL

Section 10A— Introduction

10.1. Vehicle Control Officer Program. DOD policy requires that government motor vehicle
resources are organized and managed to ensure optimum responsiveness, efficiency and
economy in support of the DOD mission. To ensure day-to-day management of those motor
vehicles permanently assigned to units and agencies, the Air Force has adopted the vehicle
control program. As established in this AFI, each applicable organization will appoint a Vehicle
Control Officer (VCO) and alternate, in writing, and forward that appointment to the base
Vehicle Fleet Manager (VFM) or Vehicle Management superintendent (VMS). The VFM/VMS
will ensure VCO training is accomplished.
10.2. Vehicle Management Policy. Public law directs the DOD and Air Force to maintain the
minimum number of fuel-efficient motor vehicles to accomplish the mission and limits their use
to official purposes. All management echelons must put emphasis on controlling and conserving
vehicle assets. The vehicle user is responsible for operation, conservation and condition of
vehicles used. This responsibility is enforced through the operator’s supervisor, commander, and
commander appointed vehicle control officers.
10.3. Host Logistics Readiness Services. The host logistics readiness activity provides
maintenance support, fleet management, and transportation services not within the using
agencies capability.
   10.3.1. See AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, for specific guidance on Government Motor
   Vehicle (GMV) usage, services and assistance. Vehicle Operations flights normally provide
   the following services:
       10.3.1.1. Taxi Service. This service provides a quick response, point-to-point service to
       all requestors requiring official transportation.
       10.3.1.2. U-Drive-It (UDI) Service. A limited number of passenger and cargo vehicles
       are available to support organizations that do not have assigned vehicles and to augment
       units with assigned vehicles in meeting infrequent peak requirements for short term
       (normally limited to 72hrs) use.
       10.3.1.3. Bus Service. Depending upon the installation, various modes of mass
       transportation services may be available.
       10.3.1.4. Operator Records and Licensing. All matters related to operator licensing and
       certain vehicle certification. Will validate unit plans of instruction for vehicle licensing
       and manage the Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) program.
       10.3.1.5. Vehicle Recovery Service. Local procedures will be developed by the host
       logistics readiness squadron for vehicle recovery services and procedures.
   10.3.2. Vehicle Management flights normally provide the following services:
       10.3.2.1. Vehicle Management and Analysis (VM&A). Provides assistance to VCOs
       with such services as, vehicle justifications, leasing procedures, vehicle analysis, DOD

      scheduled in advance, based on a vehicle’s actual or projected mileage, hours of
      operation, or by calendar time. VM&A will coordinate scheduled maintenance with unit
      VCOs.
      10.3.2.3. Unscheduled Maintenance. VCOs should ensure that any motor vehicle
      malfunction is reported to the vehicle management customer service section (or
      equivalent element) in a timely manner.
      10.3.2.4. Minor Maintenance Road Side Assistance. During normal duty hours, roadside
      service for most disabled vehicles can be provided. This service may also be available
      after normal duty hours for urgent or emergency situations. Follow the installation
      prescribed procedures for requesting this assistance.
10.4. Vehicle Control Duties. Locally developed VCO orientation briefings should cover all
aspects of a VCO's duties. As a minimum unit VCOs are responsible for:
   10.4.1. Acting as a liaison between their unit and the host logistics readiness squadron for all
   unit government motor vehicle matters.
   10.4.2. Controlling unit vehicles and obtaining transportation services required to support

      format. The requirement(s) is verified by the VFM and approved by the base Mission
      Support Group Commander. If locally approved, the VFM sends the requirement to the
      MAJCOM vehicle management staff for final action. The authorization, when approved
      by the MAJCOM, will be supported with the appropriate vehicle type when it becomes
      available. Note: Vehicles are not assigned pending approval of the authorization. See
      paragraph 4.25 for additional information.
          10.4.3.1.1. Purchase requests for Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances
          (OGMVC) must be reviewed by the VFM or VMS and forwarded to the host
          MAJCOM to ensure the desired asset is an equipment item and not a vehicle.
          Additional guidance on the procurement of OGMVCs can be found on paragraph
          4.20 Note: Purchase requests for other non-registered equipment (i.e. ATVs,
          mowers, etc.) will need to be coordinated with the VFM or VMS to ensure parts,

   10.4.12. Ensure all unit vehicle leasing actions are coordinated through Vehicle
   Management. Associate units are required to have vehicle lease requests coordinated
   through the host logistics readiness squadron’s vehicle management flight. Vehicle leasing
   may possibly effect vehicle buy submissions, vehicle rotations, MEL, etc.
10.5. Permissible Operating Distance (POD). Since it is usually more economical to use
services of commercial carriers for the transportation of personnel and cargo to destinations
outside the immediate areas of the installation, each base has an established permissible
operating distance for assigned motor vehicles. POD applies to all government-owned and leased
vehicles. Be aware of approved POD and seek approval from Vehicle Operations before
traveling outside the POD.

Section 10B— Motor Vehicle Official Use Policy

10.6. Official Use of Government Vehicles. AFI 24-301, contains specific policy guidance on
official use of government vehicles. General official use rules listed in AFI 24-301, Attachment
8 are non-inclusive and are provided to aid unit vehicle control personnel in interpreting official
use policy. The DSC/DSS (VOM/VOS in those units that are not required to reorganize to have
a Distribution Section) can give guidance in specific cases where the official nature of vehicle
usage is in question. Questions concerning the official use of government vehicles shall be
resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions.

NOTE: This inventory contains mandatory items required for UTC UFMXK, Transportation
Vehicle Management Support Kit. This kit is designed to be light and lean ensuring timely
arrival at deployed location. Additional items can only be added after MAJCOM Vehicle
Management Staffs approval for unique situations.
A2.2. MAJCOM CAT Procedures. This attachment provides general guidance to personnel
staffing CATs or equivalent, at the MAJCOM-level.
     A2.2.1. Personnel filling these positions are considered FAMs. They are responsible for
     identifying, sourcing and tracking resources used to support crisis or contingency operations.
     The FAM also ensures the sourced base is not over-tasked (more than what is postured in that
     AEF). To perform these duties, the FAM needs to understand the mobility process, TPFDD,
     ART and Air Force-Wide Unit Type Code Availability and Tasking Summary (AFWUS).
     The following training courses are highly recommended:
        A2.2.1.1. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Course. JOPES
        supports crisis action planning and management of deployment operations.
        A2.2.1.2. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES)
        Course. DCAPES is a classified part of the Global Command and Control System
        (GCCS) and links AF planners to Joint war planners.
        A2.2.1.3. MAJCOM-specific functional training.
        A2.2.1.4. Contingency Wartime Planning Course (CWPC). CWPC educates FAMs in
        the art and science of contingency war planning.
     A2.2.2. TPFDD Actions. The FAM will need to determine what taskings are in the TPFDD
     and who they are for. This section is designed to enable the FAM to extract that information.
     After accessing the TPFDD, complete data retrieval by using the following steps:
        A2.2.2.1. The first step is to sort the Service Reserve Code column. (See Figure A2.10,
        Typical MAJCOM Codes.)

Note:
Use "*" on end of code to see Guard and Reserve requirements (e.g. 1C* for ACC).
        A2.2.2.2. The second step is to sort the OPLAN column. The Deployment Plan
        Identification Designators (PID) has a "D" on the end. Redeployment PIDs have an "R"
        (e.g. PID 111AD = deployment and 111AR = return). The PID identifies a specific
        OPLAN that has been implemented.
        A2.2.2.3. The third Step is to sort the UTC column:
           A2.2.2.3.1. The LRS/Transportation 2TXXX AFSC UTCs begin with UF.
           A2.2.2.3.2. The LRS/Supply 2SXXX AFSC UTCs begin with JF.
           A2.2.2.3.3. The LRS/Fuels 2FXXX AFSC UTCs begin with JF.
           A2.2.2.3.4. The LRS/Logistics Plans 2GXXX UTCs begin with XF.
           A2.2.2.3.5. LRS officer 21RX (21T/21S/21G) UTCs begin with 9LR.
        A2.2.2.4. The fourth step involves sorting the PCD column. Sorting on blanks (in
        column) identifies all the requirements (ULNs) that need FAM immediate action.
           A2.2.2.4.1. FAM should perform the following:
               A2.2.2.4.1.1. Ensure base is only tasked for what is postured in AFWUS. Note:
               A unit may be tasked with a UTC that is not listed in the AFWUS as long as they
               have a UTC with the same capability imbedded, for example same AFSCs are
               available in other UTCs.
               A2.2.2.4.1.2. Ensure base is only tasked for UTCs reported as useable in ART.
AFI23-302_PACAFSUP_I 23 NOVEMBER 2009                                                          271


              A2.2.2.4.1.3. Notify UDM of taskings.
              A2.2.2.4.1.4. Coordinate with AEFC on any changes required.
       A2.2.2.5. The fifth step requires inserting the appropriate PCD validation codes.
           A2.2.2.5.1. Different plans require different validation codes depending on
           timeframe. The tasking MAJCOM (owner of PID) will provide guidance as
           necessary. Submit codes for each ULN to JOPES element or equivalent for DCAPES
           update.
   A2.2.3. AFWUS Actions. Completing the AFWUS Action requires the completion of the
   following 3 steps:
       A2.2.3.1. First, sort by base, then unit, then UIC and finally by AEF.
       A2.2.3.2. Second, match the TPFDD tasking against AFWUS posturing.                  Taskings
       cannot exceed amount of UTCs postured or coded as usable in ART.
       A2.2.3.3. Lastly, ensure the base is not over tasked. Compare TPFDD tasking to UTCs
       postured in that AEF. Tasking cannot exceed postured capability. FAM can also look at
       other units within the same paired AEF and, if required, can request AEFC to re-source to
       a less tasked unit. Re-sourcing can’t interfere with the teaming guidelines.
   A2.2.4. ART Actions. Perform the following to complete the ART Action:
       A2.2.4.1. Select the base, unit and UTC series.
       A2.2.4.2. Match the TPFDD taskings against the reported UTCs. The FAM ensures the
       unit has not been tasked to support more than what is qualified to go based on what the
       unit has reported.
   A2.2.5. The following are some useful links:
       A2.2.5.1. Air     Force    Manpower         Agency      (AFMA)       page   at
       https://www.afma.randolph.af.mil/orgunits/MAS/WartimeReadiness/MANFOR.asp
       . It includes MISCAP Statements (Unclassified Only), Manpower Details, MANFOR
       Summary Information and UTC Registration Updates (Canceled UTCs, Deleted UTCs,
       MAJCOM Transfers & UTC Title Changes).
       A2.2.5.2. For classified MISCAPs use the SIPRNET URL address for AFMA at
       http:\\www.anmcc.nmcc.smil.mil\~dr101rlb\afmrf1.html.
   A2.2.6. Review AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces, for
   additional guidance on ART reporting and AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution,
   for additional guidance on deployments.
A2.3. VM&A Vehicle Deployment Processing. The following paragraphs outline vehicle-
processing requirements for deployments. It is crucial that all the following steps are completed
correctly.
   A2.3.1. Some of the supplies you will need during vehicle processing are large envelopes,
   black markers and tape.
   A2.3.2. The following are the required documents:
       A2.3.2.1. AF Form 1800/1807 (signed for current day).

                           VENDOR PRODUCT EVALUATION

A7.1. Vendor Product Evaluations. VEMSO is the AF focal point and manager for the vendor
product evaluation program. The following guidance is used to perform vendor product
evaluations. Note: All product demonstrations must be suggested by at least two MAJCOMs,
provide expected tangible benefits to the AF and vehicle community with a focus on enhancing
forward deployed operations and be approved by HQ USAF/A4LE prior to beginning product
demonstration.
A7.2. Product Reviews.
   A7.2.1. HQ USAF/A4LE will:
       A7.2.1.1. Approve all vendor product evaluation requests.
       A7.2.1.2. Intercede on behalf of VEMSO to obtain MAJCOM support for
       demonstrations, including after action reports.
   A7.2.2. VEMSO will:
       A7.2.2.1. Review and recommend vehicle products for evaluation.
          A7.2.2.1.1. Recommend final determination of project start and stop dates, and
          maintain official AF records of all evaluations.
          A7.2.2.1.2. Retain hard-copy master project files for at least 3 years after the end of a
          project.
          A7.2.2.1.3. Coordinate with applicable MAJCOM POCs to determine which bases or
          units should conduct a test. Note: It’s important to test seasonal items during the
          period they would get maximum use, such as snow equipment in winter, agricultural
          equipment in summer, etc.
          A7.2.2.1.4. Send a project completion report to all MAJCOMs and other appropriate
          offices involved in the evaluation process. Provide a bailor’s report to product
          manufacturers IAW established agreements.
          A7.2.2.1.5. When necessary, send a project monitor to the evaluation site to start and
          close projects to keep the program on track.
          A7.2.2.1.6. Calculate costs savings and avoidance that resulted from project
          evaluation.
          A7.2.2.1.7. Direct test activities to review test data 45 days before the end of the test
          to determine if purchase of test equipment (in place) is warranted. If the purchase of
          the tested equipment is desired, test activities will prepare an AF Form 9 along with a
          sole source justification and process it through their contracting activity or use a GPC
          for purchase.
          A7.2.2.1.8. Obtain all required systems, supplies and equipment needed for project
          evaluations.
          A7.2.2.1.9. Inform AF, MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs on project status via website

         A7.2.2.1.10. Research areas for improvement related to vehicles, tools, equipment
         and materials, vehicle facilities, and management procedures.
         A7.2.2.1.11. Forward recommendations for improvement to HQ USAF/A4LE.
         Prepare detailed Completion Reports with project test results.
         A7.2.2.1.12. Make firm recommendations based on findings, including criteria for
         AS placement or replacement and cost savings. Coordinate recommendations with
         MAJCOMs.
         A7.2.2.1.13. Ensure products are evaluated and compared against currently available
         or stock listed items, when possible.
         A7.2.2.1.14. As a minimum, available or stock listed items will be reviewed for
         comparison of specifications.
         A7.2.2.1.15. Write, publish, distribute and post product review status reports on
         website.
         A7.2.2.1.16. Ensure at least two employees are trained and certified to perform duties
         as primary and alternate quality assurance personnel. Individuals will be authorized
         to sign no-cost-to-the-AF bailment agreements used to obtain loaned products for the
         purpose of evaluation.
         A7.2.2.1.17. Prepare final reports relating to Vehicle Management procedures and
         inspection criteria, in coordination with all MAJCOM Vehicle Maintenance Staffs.
      A7.2.2.2. Research and test environmentally friendly alternatives to current processes, to
      include equipment and products.
         A7.2.2.2.1. Participate in environmental and pollution prevention workshops and
         conferences to learn current industry practices and work to embed them in Vehicle
         Management processes. Coordinate proposed environmental projects with the AF
         Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE/EQP/EQT). An Environmental
         Impact Analysis Process, categorical exclusion, environmental assessment or an
         environmental impact statement might have to be developed for projects having
