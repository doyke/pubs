SUBJECT: Air Force Reserve Command Guidance Memorandum for Protecting Personally
Identifiable Information (PII)

RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

       By Order of the Commander, Air Force Reserve Command, this AFRC Guidance
Memorandum immediately implements Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent
with other Air Force publications; the information herein prevails, in accordance with (IAW)
AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

         Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information about an individual that identifies
links, relates, or is unique to, or describes him or her. PII is also described as information which
can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, social security
number, date of birth, place of birth, mother’s maiden name, or biometric records, including any
other PII which is linked or linkable to a specified individual. It is every Airman’s responsibility
to protect this information by ensuring its handling is necessary and done lawfully which is
outlined in AFI 33-332. The consequences of misuse can incur undue financial burden for the
exposed person or provide critical information to an adversary.

        Certain PII is protected from transmission to personal or commercial email accounts.
Specifically, AFI 33-332, paragraph 1.1.11.4 prohibits the transmission of Social Security
numbers, financial information, driver license, passport or alien registration number to these
accounts unless written consent is obtained from the individual who has requested that their PII
be sent to their personal or commercial email account. Additionally, transmission of Protected
Health Information (PHI) as defined in AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient
Administration Functions, is prohibited even with consent.

       Other email restrictions apply within DoD, i.e. to official DoD email accounts. As set out
in AFI 33-332, paragraphs 2.2.4 – 2.2.6, PII transmission via DoD email is to be prudent,
encrypted and to appropriate recipients.
        IAW AFI 33-332 Paragraphs 1.2.9.3 and 9.3.2 Commanders are instructed to conduct an
inquiry after a PII event to determine the circumstances and impact of privacy breaches. Wing
Commanders, Directors, and independent Group Commanders will complete the attached
briefing template, schedule with AFRC/A6O and in conjunction with NAF leadership, brief
AFRC leadership within 30 days of the violation.

        This is a serious issue that affects all Airmen, and I expect you will take measures to
ensure your Airmen are trained on the risks and methods to protect PII (Attachment 2). The
action office for this issue is HQ AFRC/A6O DSN 497-0037, e-mail: AFRC.FOIA@us.af.mil.

       Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this Memorandum are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

        The guidance in this Memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the
date of this Memorandum, or upon release of an AF publication incorporating the guidance,
whichever is earlier.

    METHODS FOR PROTECTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

Remove personal information maintained within SharePoint or equivalent or like software
programs when no longer needed for daily operations and file according to Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS)

Use the Army Missile Research Development and Engineering Center Safe Access File Exchange
(AMRDEC SAFE) as an alternate means of transmitting PII (does not apply for transmitting
Protect Health Information (PHI)) to personal or commercial e-mail accounts.

Use official forms and similar tools that have been approved and published IAW AFI 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management, when collecting personal information.

      Use Microsoft Outlook Encryption button

       When e-mail encryption is not available… encrypt the files
Encryption Wizard protects data on your network, while stored on media and during transmission
across the Internet. Available for use on DoD and Commercial systems
        Go to http://www.spi.dod.mil/ewizard.htm
        DoD systems users: Click EW-Govt (DoD CAC required)
        Commercial/contract/home users: Click EW-Public

       Safe Access File Exchange (SAFE)
        SAFE is designed to provide AMRDEC and its customers an alternative way to send files
other than email. SAFE supports file sizes up to 2GB
