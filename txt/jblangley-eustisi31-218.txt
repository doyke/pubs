   to a unit on Fort Eustis.
   10.1.2. Vehicle registration may be accomplished at the Pass and Registration Office.

   Access Card (CAC), or other valid identification for DoD civilians, dependents, or retirees.
   At the time of registration, the registrant will provide current state vehicle registration, proof

   Form 2219W will only be issued to vehicles with decals that are expired, damaged, or within
   90 days of expiration. Note: Pass and Registration clerks will issue the “General” placard in
   place of the separate decal sets. General officers cannot use the placard on multiple vehicles,
   only one placard for each vehicle. Any vehicle displaying installation tabs will be placed
   underneath the DD Form 2220 and the month/year decal will be placed on the right side of
   the DD Form 2220.

   followed. On two wheeled vehicles, place registration decals on a conspicuous front-facing
   surface or plate affixed to a front facing surface. At no time shall the decal be affixed on the

   733 SFS whenever the registered vehicle will no longer be operated on the installation under

       10.2.1.1. Upon sale or other disposition of the vehicle.
       10.2.1.2. Upon transfer of possession of the vehicle under power of attorney to another
       person for the purposes of later sale, shipment, or disposition on behalf of the registrant.
       Exception: The designee power of attorney will register the vehicle (if registration
       requirements are met) in his/her name using the current decals until final disposition at
       which time all decals will be removed.
       10.2.1.3. Upon release of the registrant from military service, the decals or remnants will
       be returned to 733 SFS. Failure to comply could delay out-processing.
   10.2.2. Personnel are required to out-process their vehicle(s) from the Pass and Registration
   Office prior to final post out-processing if they registered their vehicle. Members separating
   will remove all decals from their vehicles and hand-carry the pieces to the Pass and
   Registration Office for removal from the COPS database.                   Members PCSing to
   CONUS/OCONUS locations or retiring are not required to remove their vehicle registration
   decals from their vehicle prior to final out-processing.
10.3. Unsafe or Defective Vehicles and Safety Inspections.
   10.3.1. Persons will not drive nor will a registered owner knowingly allow any unsafe or
   defective vehicle to be driven anywhere on Fort Eustis.
   10.3.2. An annual Virginia state safety inspection is required if the vehicle is registered in

   inspection, the inspection sticker must be displayed on the windshield as required by state
   law.
   10.3.4. Persons will not operate a vehicle not in compliance with State of Virginia safety
   requirements. Owners will not allow an unsafe or defective vehicle to be operated.
