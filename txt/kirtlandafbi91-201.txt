Classification of Weapons SRC I AA&E: Man—portable missiles and rockets in a ready-to-
fire configuration. Included are the Redeye, Stinger, Dragon, Javelin, light antitank weapon
(66mm), shoulder-launched multi-purpose assault weapon rocket (83mm), M136 (AT4) anti-
armor launcher, and cartridge (84mm). These weapons, when jointly stored or transported with
the launcher tube and/or grip stock and the explosive round, though not in a ready-to-fire
configuration, shall be considered Category I items. Note: Regardless of Force Protection
Condition, SRC I will always require Satellite Motor Surveillance, Driver Protective Service
with National Agency Check, and Security Escort Vehicle Service. For further instruction, refer
to DTTS freight traffic rules. SEV service, as described above, is required when the
security/force protection offices at the origin, destination, or locations en route have identified a
specific, imminent local threat. The installation commander makes the final decision. The key is
direct communication between the transportation office and the security/force protection office
on the current threat.
