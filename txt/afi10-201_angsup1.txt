Supersedes AFI 10-201/ANGSUP1, 30 June 2003                                             Pages: 25
                                                                                  Distribution: F

AFI 10-201, Status Of Resources and Training System, 12 December 2003, is supplemented as fol-
lows and is applicable to the Air National Guard (ANG) with the following exceptions and modifications.
For the purpose of this instruction Major Command (MAJCOM) for National Guard Bureau (NGB) is
defined as the Air National Guard. All previous correspondence is hereby rescinded.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


1.3.4. (Added) Any unit experiencing communication problems where they cannot transmit their Status
of Resources and Training System (SORTS) report through normal means will mail their (classified)
report on a computer disk to:


                                  ANG/XOXR
                                  3500 Fetchet Ave.
                                  Andrews AFB, MD 20762-5157

This will be accomplished using an overnight delivery means.
1.7.9.4. (Added) Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement Response Time Rules. The maxi-
mum DOC response time is 72 hours for C-level reporting. Units with multiple missions and different
response times must apply these rules to determine the proper DOC response time:
2                                                                AFI10-201_ANGSUP1 15 APRIL 2004


1.7.9.4.1. (Added) Alert Forces. Only units with the majority of their forces on alert (for example, ICBM
units) must use alert response times. For alert response times less than 1 hour, a unit reports as of the time
of the report.
1.7.4.4.2. (Added) Generation Forces. The DOC response time for units that generate for employment
from their present location is the final time that their generation flow plan calls for all wartime resources
to be generated, not to be more than 72 hours. Temporary duty (TDY) assets, which can be returned to
their home unit and generated within the 72-hour limit, may use this as their DOC response time.
1.7.9.4.3. (Added) Mobility Forces. The DOC response time for units that must deploy before employ-
ment is the time specified in mobility regulations, not to be more than 72 hours. The reporting unit must
project its ability to have its deploying resources properly configured or packaged for deployment.
1.7.9.4.4. (Added) Combined Generation-Mobility Forces. The DOC response time for units with com-
bined tasking, i.e., one portion of the unit generating for employment and another portion deploying to an
employment site, will be based on the most demanding requirement.
1.11.3.2.6. (Added) In the event a measured unit is assigned to a new initial gaining command, ANG
SORTS Branch (ANG/XOXR) will obtain MAJCOM coordination on all assigned DOCs.
1.11.4. The command reporting organization (CRO) for ANG is ANG/XOXR.
1.11.4.14. ANG/XOXR will use electronic distribution to the maximum extent possible. ANG DOCs are
posted on the ANG Global Command and Control (GCCS) Secure Internet Protocol Router Network
(SIPRNET) home page.
1.11.4.18.2. ANG units will develop and maintain a continuation training program for all data handlers.
Continuation training for unit monitors and commanders will be conducted quarterly. Unit continuation
training content will be determined at the local level.
1.11.4.20. Until AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, is updated to reference Table 10-16,
SORTS worksheets and databases will be kept for a period not to exceed 35 days unless superseded by
current monthly report.
1.11.6. (Substitute) “Manpower Office:” with “XPMM”.
1.11.10.2.11. (Added) ANG units will develop and maintain a SORTS folder. Unit folders at a minimum
will include:
1.11.10.2.11.1. (Added) Documentation of formal and continuation training for all SORTS monitors.
1.11.10.2.11.2. (Added) Self-inspection checklist.
1.11.10.2.11.3. (Added) Letter from the unit commander appointing at least a primary and alternate
SORTS monitor.
1.11.10.2.11.4. (Added) Current DOC statement.
1.11.10.2.11.5. (Added) Letter of delegation for releasing authority of SORTS report (where the unit
commander feels it is appropriate in the commander’s absence).
1.11.10.2.11.6. (Added) Latest SORTS database from Defense Information Service Agency (DISA/
FORSTAT) and supporting documentation. All previous reports are superseded when a new report is sub-
mitted and the data content verified. Destroy all superseded materials in accordance with (IAW) DoD
5200.1-R, Information Security Program.
AFI10-201_ANGSUP1 15 APRIL 2004                                                                       3


1.11.10.2.11.8. (Added) Conduct SORTS Self-inspection quarterly.
1.11.11.2.4.5. (Added) ANG SORTS managers and monitors will respond to error messages within one
working day. If you have submitted a report and have not received either received/processed message or a
database back within 72 hours call the Readiness Assessment Branch.
1.11.12.2.6. (Added) ANG RED HORSE (RH) data handlers will coordinate with flight data handlers on
information regarding UTC 4F9R1, 4F9R2, 4F9R3, 4F9R4, 4F9H1, 4F9H2, 4F9H3, 4F9H4, 4F9H5,
4F9H6, and FFLGE to include personnel, training, vehicles, equipment, supplies, MRSP, etc.. RED
HORSE Squadron SORTS monitors will consolidate squadron and flight information in preparing the
SORTS report.
1.13.2.2.3. (Added) The OVERRIDE feature will be used by the ANG.

Observer AFSCs (1W051 and 1W031).
2.11.7.6. (Added) Active duty personnel assigned or attached to an ANG unit may be counted as assigned
and available for SORTS reporting purposes. ANG flying units with active duty crew members assigned
will identify the number of crew members assigned in a remark using the label “CREWF”.
2.11.8.1.3. (Added) ANG Civil Engineering units will report unit funded dollar shortfall and depot (AF)
funded dollar shortfall amounts for each ESSA subarea under the appropriate ESSA remark. Additionally,
they will report an overall unit and depot funded dollar shortfall amounts in the ESRES remark.
2.11.8.1.4. (Added) ANG Civil Engineer Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) will report combat essen-
tial and combat support EOD individual equipment (as identified by the ANG EOD FAM) in the ESRES

FAX DSN: 123-9999, COMM: (111) 234-9990; PLA HQ ANG ANDREWS AFB MD.)
2.11.13. (Added) ANG air control, combat communications, air traffic control, joint communications
support, E&I, and communications units with a mobility mission, ensure that impact of depot level repair-
able funding shortfalls is annotated in appropriate remarks using label “ESRES”, as it affects the XD-2
items authorized in Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSP).
2.11.14. (Added) Mobility support equipment is defined as that equipment necessary to generate/regener-
ate the aircraft (e.g., AGE, powered/non-powered, tugs, tow bars, etc.). Units must identify any shortage
requiring higher headquarters assistance in a remark using label “ESSA5.”

C-level.
2.11.17.1. (Added) ANG air traffic control squadrons and units with an Air Traffic Control and Landing
Systems (ATCALS) mission, combat communications, joint communications support squadrons, and
engineering and installation units report the percent of personnel who have deployed (i.e., field condi-
tions) within the last calendar year in a remark with label “TRSA4.” Do not use these values in calculating
training C-level.

3.1.1.3.1. (Added) Units that have personnel deployed will submit a remark using TPAVL label, stating
number of individuals deployed (Officer/Enlisted) and mission/operation that the individuals are
deployed on (i.e., Exercise Big Wind) and estimated return date.
3.1.1.6. (Added) Individuals who are non-participants are not to be counted as available. Non-participa-
tion for SORTS purposes is when an individual has 10 consecutive unexcused drill periods. Please note
that there are four drill periods per Unit Training Assembly (UTA), therefore, if a member misses two and
one half UTA’s consecutively that are not excused, they are considered non-participants.
3.1.1.7. (Added) Units will not count personnel assigned until after Basic Military Training (BMT) is
completed and have a total of 12 weeks of federal military service. Personnel assigned to the student flight
may not be counted. CE Units will report the number of personnel currently assigned to the student flight
that will be gained to the unit within the PRRES remark. If no student flight is currently postured at the
local Base/Wing, then the CE unit will report the number of personnel assigned to the unit PAS code that
have not attended BMT or have 12 week of federal military service.
3.1.2.5.2. Service Officers will be counted as critical personnel assigned only after completing AFSC
entry level formal AFIT courses required for their grade.
3.1.2.8. (Added) Aviation units will include required RSP support personnel (2S0X1) that are assigned to
the Logistics Readiness Squadron in the Flying Squadron SORTS report. These personnel will not be
included within the Logistics Readiness Squadron SORTS report. Individuals required by unit DOC
tasked Unit Type Codes (UTCs) that are not authorized on the reporting unit or its direct support units
manning document, but may be available from another unit within the co-located wing/group, may only
be considered subjectively.
3.2.2.1. (Added) ANG Weather units count personnel attending school, other than for award of the basic
Weather Specialist AFSC, as available.
3.5. Critical Personnel Packet Formulation. ANG units will not use personnel packets unless specifi-
cally directed by the Functional Area Manager (FAM).
4.1.1.6. (Added) Test equipment in Precision Measuring Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) is counted as
possessed if it can be returned to the unit in serviceable condition within the unit’s DOC response time.
4.2.6. (Added) ANG Army support Weather units (SOF and Conventional) will report MT&OE equip-
ment on all reports using the ESSA4 remark in the following format: “WPNS (Break out by types
required)/REQ/AUTH/AVAIL, CHEM MASK (Indicate type required)/REQ/AUTH/AVAIL, CHEM
SUIT/REQ/AUTH/AVAIL, RADIOS (Break out by types required)/REQ/AUTH/AVAIL, VEHICLES
(Break out by types required)/REQ/AUTH/AVAIL, TRAILERS (Breakout by types)/REQ/AUTH/
AVAIL.” Consider Army equipment available even if not on hand if it’s known that the Army unit has,
and is maintaining, the equipment at their location.
4.2.7. (Added) ANG Weather Flights will report all DOC listed essential METOC equipment using the
ESSA1 label and all DOC listed combat support METOC equipment using the ESSA4 label, on all reports
regardless of C-level, using the following format: TYPE/REQUIRED/ ASSIGNED/AVAILABLE. Report
any new equipment that is not listed on the DOC statement as it is received, i.e., N-TFS, T-VSAT,
TMQ-53, etc.
4.6.1.1. (Added) ANG Weather units tasked for TMOS (i.e., TMQ-53), that are not on-hand, not avail-
able, or not mission ready, will reflect shortfalls in the equipment and supplies/condition C-levels. Com-
manders may assess upwards, overall only, if they determine that a Mobile Observing System Kit (MOS),
AFI10-201_ANGSUP1 15 APRIL 2004                                                                           7


a Belt Weather Kit (BWK) with a mobile anemometer and barometer, or a Kestrel 4000, will meet mission
requirements of the TMOS. TMOS short falls require a remark against the ESSA1 label.
4.9.7. (Added) If the status of the MRSP is less then C-1 due to parts shortage, use the remarks field under
the ESSA1 label to give more in-depth information on the problem part or parts. Use format: NSN, noun,
authorized quantity, quantity on hand, requisition number, and status/EDD. List the 5 top individual prob-
lem parts. Units with multiple weapon systems will identify the LOWEST rating as the driver for their
unit’s C-rating. The status of other “well” weapon systems will be stated in the remarks field “ESSA1
label”. In this way the problems of a specific weapon system will not be masked by the health of the other
weapon systems at a unit.

     2. ATC radar requires one functional PAR and two functional ASR positions with radio and landline
        capability.
     3. TACAN requires transponder and monitor capable of passing flight check.
6.3.4. (Added) ANG Weather units with a jump requirement will report unit jump capabilities using the
TRSA3 remark and the following format: “AFSC/AUTH/ASGN/AVAIL, J15W3/#/#/#, J15W1/0/#/#,
J1W091/0/#/#, J1W071A/#/#/#, J1W051A/0/#/#, J1W031A/0/#/#.” These entries are independent of
those reported in the PERTP. Count as assigned and available for a jump position if , 1) individual has at
least a 3 skill level weather AFSC, 2) individual has successfully completed the Basic Airborne Course.
6.4.4.1.2.2. ANG units may use any combination of Aviation Position Identifier (API) code 1, 2, and API
6 positions, as designated by the OG/CC, to arrive at the required numbers. All other flying positions

Table A2.3. (Added)

NOTES:
  DOCIDs listed above are designed primarily to aid information processing and relate to capability:
1. The first character is the alphabetic A through Z (minus I) that relates to a general mission category.
   For example, A relates to air superiority, and B to air defense.
2. The second character specifies whether the unit’s reported mission is alert (A); generation (G); com-
   bined alert and generation, or combined generation and mobility (D); mobility (M); or surveillance
   (S). In rare cases when no DOCID has been established the second character will be a (X), this should
   only be used until a new DOCID is developed.
3. The third and fourth characters are the numeric 22 through 99. The third and fourth characters specify
   the capability in a general mission area.

NOTES:
  1: A continuity binder is not a requirement at this time, however, units may find an established binder
  would aid the whole SORTS reporting process, particularly when a primary monitor is away and the
  alternate monitor must do the report. The following table is a suggested content:



            Has a continuity binder been established? As a minimum, does this
     1.1.
            binder contain:
            Higher Headquarters guidance, letters, messages and email traffic
     1.2.
            regarding SORTS?
     1.3.   Copies of ANG “ART of SORTS” newsletters?
     1.4    Notes on AFSORTSDET procedures?
     1.5.   Local procedures for transmitting SORTS reports?
     1.6.   Procedures for uploading/downloading reports?

NOTE: 2: If retaining a copy of the actual unit SORTS report in the continuity binder, and/or the pass-
words for the programs, be sure to classify the binder correctly and safeguard it as appropriate.
