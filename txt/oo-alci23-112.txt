SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidance to clarify the reporting time to the Base Engine
Manager (BEM) IAW TO 00-25-254-1.
1. General Information. Propulsion systems, which include aircraft jet engines, aerodynamic
missile engines, aircraft reciprocation engines and drone engines, require selective management.
The high cost of these systems makes them ‘unique’ among the assets managed throughout the
AF. There will be one primary OO-ALC BEM for both owning stock record account number
(SRAN) managed at/by HAFB, to include 571st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (571 AMXS),
operating location (OL) at Randolph Air Force Base (RAFB). There will also be one alternate
identified for each SRAN. HAFB SRAN designator is FJ2029, and the OL designator is FJ2840.
The concept of selective management of these high-cost, low-volume items has been refined into
a stand-alone computer system, CEMS (D042). The command engine manager (CEM) is located
at Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Headquarters (HQ) A4MM; Wright Patterson AFB is
the focal point for engine management matters for the command. The FJ2031 account, managed
by 639th Aircraft Sustainment Group Propulsion CEMS/Program Management Office (PMO),
within the Aircraft Sustainment Wing located at Tinker AFB, is the United States Air Force
(USAF) accountable record for engines.
     1.1. The primary purpose of the CEMS program is to provide current status of engines,
     tracked engine components and TCTO compliance. CEMS identifies owning SRAN, status,
     condition and configuration information for all CEMS accountable engines by serial number
     and configuration item identifier (CII).
     1.2. The primary objective of the engine management reporting in CEMS is to submit
     accurate information on the status, condition and location of aircraft and missile engines at
     all times.
     1.3. Policies and procedures which outline instructions for reporting actions and events to
     the CEM are outlined in TO 00-25-254-1 and TO 00-25-254-2.
     1.4. No aircraft will be flown or delivered until the engine and/or components are reported in
     CEMS. Failure to comply with CEMS reporting could result in placement of equipment in
     questionable status, which will cause unnecessary overage of critical life limited parts.
     1.5. All incoming/outgoing engines, modules, aircraft or missiles arriving at HAFB and/or
     the OL at RAFB will be processed at the central engine management contact point, OO-ALC
     Production Support Office (OO-ALC/OBWP), or 571 AMXS OL. This includes engines for
     programmed depot maintenance (PDM) aircraft, special projects and missile maintenance.
        1.5.1. Engines and engine components primarily managed at OO-ALC, to include the
        OL, consist of aircraft and missiles with various configurations.
            1.5.1.1. Aircraft engines and serially controlled components:
                1.5.1.1.1. Hercules (C-130), T56-Allison (A)-7 and T56-A-15;
                1.5.1.1.2. Fighting Falcon (F-16), F100-Pratt & Whitney (PW)-
                200/220B/220E/220F/229, F110-General Electric (GE)-100 and F110-GE-129;
                1.5.1.1.3. Thunderbolt (A-10), TF34-GE-100;
OO-ALCI23-112 21 MARCH 2013                                                                       3


              1.5.1.1.4. Raptor (F-22), F119-PW-100;
              1.5.1.1.5. Talon (T-38), .J85-GE-5.
          1.5.1.2. Missile engines:
              1.5.1.2.1. Air Launch Cruise Missile (ALCM) AGM086B, F107-Williams
              International (WR)-101.
   1.6. Engine status, actions and events at OO-ALC/RAFB OL are reported to the BEM by the
   propulsion personnel in the engine section, aircraft flight test organization, aircraft incoming,
   aircraft production and ALCM scheduling. PDM responsibilities in reporting engine status
   are outlined in the applicable TO 00-20-5 series.
2. Reports and Codes.
   2.1. Aircraft engine run:      Report/download is processed through the work center
   Comprehensive Engine Trending and Diagnostics System (CETADS) to the BEM host
   CETADS computer or through the Integrated Maintenance Information System (IMIS) (F-22
   only) after the following events: green run/engine run or engine times cycles/total
   accumulated cycles update NLT the end of shift following the date/time of the occurrence.
   Each time the engine is ran, the engine is downloaded and processed in the CETADS work
   center computer, then reconciled to the BEM host computer and recorded in CEMS, IAW
   with TO 00-25-257-1, Engine Health Management Plus (EHM+) User’s Manual Instructions
   for Turbofan Engine Model: F100-220; TO 00-25-257-2, Engine Health Management Plus

   2.2. Test cell engine run: OO-ALC Form 206, F100-PW-220 Data Run Sheet, and OO-ALC
   Form 207, F100-PW-229 Data Run sheet, is submitted to the BEM for processing through
   CEMS after completion of test cell run.
   2.3. Aircraft flights: Report/download is processed through work center CETADS computer
   to the BEM host CETADS computer or through the IMIS (F-22 only) each time the aircraft is
   flown for functional check flight, proficiency flight, or operational check flight NLT the end
   of shift following the date/time of the occurrence. Note: For C-130- and T-38 update flying
   hour (FHR) only.
   2.4. AF Form 1534, CEMS CDB Report (Attachment 2), OO-ALC Form 205, Modular
