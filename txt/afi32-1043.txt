       instructions, and the appropriate 35E8-series T.O.
       1.3.3.4. Conduct inspections according to 35E8-series T.O. work cards and maintain an
       accurate historical log and maintenance records for each assigned AAS. Locally
       developed forms and logs are authorized.
       1.3.3.5. Develop and implement local procedures and instructions in writing to clearly
       delineate responsibilities of all personnel engaged in AAS activities during and after
       normal duty hours. These instructions must clearly define the different responsibilities of
       power production and firefighters involved during emergencies, and should address
       coordination with other work centers involved during operations, such as snow and ice
       control. They must include procedures to clear aircraft from the runway and inspect and
       reset the system immediately after each engagement. The BCE must approve the
       operating instruction. A signed copy must be forwarded to the MAJCOM representative
       and another maintained in the power production section. These instructions must be
       reviewed annually for needed changes and updates. When updated, a copy must be
       provided to the MAJCOM AAS representative within 10 days of approval and
       publication.
       1.3.3.6. Submit all requested information to the MAJCOM for inclusion in the Aircraft
       Arresting Systems Report as described in paragraph 1.2.1.
       1.3.3.7. Submit           aircraft          engagement            information           at
       https://wwwmil.afcesa.af.mil/Directorate/CES/Civil/airfield/aasee_entry.asp. Include
       supplemental information as directed by the MAJCOM. Also file reports for all missed
       engagement attempts. (See Attachment 1 for the definition of a missed engagement.)
       Reports should be sent as soon as possible after the engagement. Electronic submittals are
       authorized and encouraged. Note: Do not submit the report during periods of inactivity or

     emergency. The report must be submitted for each engagement or attempted engagement.
     In the event the Website is down for any reason, fill in the online form and print (rather
     than submit) to Adobe® Acrobat®, or copy and paste the completed form into another
     program such as Microsoft® PowerPoint or Word. The report can then be sent to the
     appropriate personnel via e-mail or hard copy.
     1.3.3.8. Develop local procedures and lesson plans to thoroughly train all civil
     engineering personnel (including non-power production personnel) who use, operate, or
     maintain an arresting system to the appropriate task level in the 3E0X2 career field
     education and training plan (CFETP), and ensure that all personnel are task-certified for
     their assigned duties. Document training and certification of civilian employees on AF
     Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, and other training records, as appropriate.
        1.3.3.8.1. Provide training for non-power production personnel at not less than
        quarterly intervals to ensure all personnel are trained on their duties at least once
        every 12 months. Maintain a record for each training class that identifies the
        instructor and all trainees in attendance.
        1.3.3.8.2. Provide a copy of the record to the trainee's regular duty section for their
        use.
     1.3.3.9. Report all deficiencies discovered with arresting systems and components to
     base supply according to T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency Reporting,
     Investigation, and Resolution.
     1.3.3.10. Establish and maintain a record of the effective pendant height (EPH)
     according to Attachment 6 for each hook-cable arresting system installed on the runway
     or in a displaced threshold area (except retractable cable systems such as BAK-14 or
     Type H). EPH records are not required for emergency systems installed in overruns. In
     accordance with Attachment 6, notify the Airfield Manager if the EPH falls to less than
     38 millimeters (1.5 inches).
     1.3.3.11. Ensure that systems that do not comply with the requirements of this instruction
     or the applicable T.O. are programmed for corrective action or replacement.
     1.3.3.12. Ensure that copies of applicable AAS T.O.s and work cards, Air Force
     instructions, MAJCOM supplements or instructions, and local instructions are maintained
     in the work center and are available for all personnel engaged in arresting systems
     activities.
     1.3.3.13. Ensure that all non-power production personnel engaged in daily AAS
     activities are certified in their training record and the qualification level is documented.
     Qualifications must be reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Document each
     individual's AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder.
     1.3.3.14. Establish and maintain a "special level" (on-hand supply) of critical
     replacement items for AAS. Examples of items that should be maintained at special
     levels include (but are not limited to) purchase tapes, tape connectors, pendants, control
     valves, shuttle valves, special fittings, brake sets or kits, and replacement modules for
     textile brake arresting systems.

       1.3.3.15. Ensure personnel engaged in AAS operations use appropriate personal
       protective equipment per Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standard
       (AFOSHSTD) 91-10, Civil Engineering.
1.4. HQ Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). AFMC manages engineering development
of new requirements and oversees initial production. Once the initial production quantity is
complete, responsibility for item management, engineering, and procurement support is
consigned to the appropriate ALC, presently Warner Robins ALC (WR-ALC).
   1.4.1. WR-ALC provides logistic and engineering support and item management for these
   systems and components. WR-ALC is also responsible for the following:
       1.4.1.1. Procure systems and oversight of spare parts standards.
       1.4.1.2. Provide technical assistance, configuration control, and consultation on
       maintenance, product improvement, modifications, testing, inspections, and installation
       of all arresting systems in the Air Force inventory.
       1.4.1.3. Compile and document all information from the aircraft arrestment reports to
       ensure availability of the data for analysis of specific system performance and use.

                                          Chapter 2

       OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, CERTIFICATION, AND INSPECTION

2.1. General Information.
   2.1.1. This chapter provides basic information on inspection, maintenance, certification,
   operation, maintenance records, and deficiency reporting for AAS. Information contained in
   this chapter is intended to be general in nature. Specific technical information may be found
   in the applicable 35E8-series T.O.s.
   2.1.2. T.O.s for BAK-12 and BAK-13 provide alternate procedures for removing an aircraft
   from the cable after engagement. These alternate procedures are commonly referred to as a
   "slingshot" removal of the aircraft. Potential for aircraft damage is high when using these
   methods; therefore, use these procedures only during contingencies or in-flight emergencies
   that require rapid removal of an aircraft from a cable. The procedure must be approved by the
   installation commander before being used for routine disengagement of aircraft during local
   exercises or scheduled testing of the arresting system (e.g., certification).
2.2. Inspection and General Maintenance.
   2.2.1. Inspections must be performed in accordance with the applicable T.O., information
   contained within this instruction, and the 35E8-series work cards.
   2.2.2. In-service pendant cables must be inspected daily and after each engagement. Use
   cable inspection criteria from BAK-12 or BAK-13 T.O.s for textile brake AAS. Also, for all
   AAS cables (pendants), measure and record the swaged end cable insertion depth
   measurement in the maintenance records before placing any arresting system cross-runway
   pendant in service (see Figure 2.1). Do not install cables with swaged end depth
   measurement greater than 63 millimeters (2.5 inches). Also, mark the cable at the swaged
   end connectors with paint or some other means of permanent marking so that any movement
   of the swaged end will be evident. After each engagement, inspect the swaged end for
   movement or measure the swaged end depth again and compare it with the initial
   measurement recorded in the maintenance records. Remove cables from service that show
   any change in the swaged end position on the cable and file a product quality deficiency
   report including item serial number. Spare pendants should be stored indoors.
      2.2.2.1. Expedient trim pad anchoring systems can be installed using K-M anchoring
      components from the MAAS. Use USAF ETL 06-4, Expedient Trim Pad Anchoring
      Systems, to install and inspect expedient trim anchors. Use the following guidance for
      cable inspection and disposition if AAS pendants are used to restrain the aircraft during
      trim operations.
      2.2.2.2. Cables used with the expedient trim pad setup shall be kept separate from cables
      used for aircraft engagements, and shall only be used for trim operations (e.g., cables
      used for trim operations shall not be used for aircraft engagements, and cables that have
      been used for engagements shall not be used for trim operations).
      2.2.2.3. Develop a use and inspection log for each new cable and record the date and
      pertinent details of each trim operation in the log. Maintain the log for the life of the
      cable. There is no limit to the number of trim operations that can be performed with a
 12                                                                       AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


      single cable within a 36-month period; however, all cables will be removed from service
      36 months after their initial installation date unless they fail to meet the requirements
      stated below.
      2.2.2.4. Before installing any cable, measure and record the swaged end cable insertion
      depth as prescribed above in paragraph 2.2.2. Also, inspect the cable in accordance with
      instructions in T.O. 35E8-2-5-1, Operation and Maintenance Instructions – Aircraft
      Arresting System Model BAK-12. Do not install cables with defects identified in the T.O.
      or if the insertion depth measurement exceeds 63 millimeters (2.5 inches).
      2.2.2.5. After each trim pad operation, inspect the cable in accordance with instructions
      in T.O. 35E8-2-5-1. Also, measure and record the swaged end cable insertion depth for
      each end, or inspect for swaged end movement if the swaged end position has been
      marked as described in paragraph 2.2.2 above. Remove the cable from service if it fails to
      meet the inspection requirements of T.O. 35E8-2-5-1 or shows any change in the swaged
      end position on the cable.

Figure 2.1. Pendant Swaged End Depth Measurement.




         Drilled Inspection Hole is 0.125" Diameter. Maximum Allowable Depth to End of
         Cable is 63.5 mm (2.5") . The butt end of a drill bit works well as a depth gauge.




   2.2.3. Crop exposed tape between the runway edge sheave (fairlead beam) and the tape
   connector on BAK-9 and BAK-12 systems every six months. Crop the tape between the
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                          13


   absorber base and the tape connector every six months on expeditionary systems if a tape
   tube is not used. Reverse (end-for-end) tapes on all systems every 24 months. No nylon tapes
   should be retained in service longer than 48 months or if usage exceeds the maximum
   allowable for engagements and pull-outs or tape stack height in the applicable 35E8-series
   T.O. Due to the negative effects of ultraviolet (UV) light on nylon, every effort must be made
   to protect tapes from direct sunlight. For this reason, all spare nylon tapes must be stored
   indoors.
   2.2.4. For MA-1A, a new webbing assembly must be installed after each engagement. See
   T.O. 35E8-2-2-1, Operation and Service Instructions - Runway Overrun Barrier, Types MA-
   1 and MA-1A Runway Overrun Barrier, Section 1, for details. Also, inspect pendant cables
   and replace if conditions are indicated.
   2.2.5. The center 23 meters (75 feet) of pavement extending out for 60 meters (200 feet) on
   both the approach and departure sides of the arresting system pendant are critical areas.
   Protruding objects, excessive paint build-up, excessive joint sealant material, warped
   sacrificial panels, and undulating surfaces are detrimental to successful tailhook engagements
   and are not allowed. This area of the runway must be visually inspected at least monthly for
   indications of the above noted conditions. Suspect areas, such as pavement cracks and joints,
   and panels beneath the cable must be inspected more closely. Increased attention will be
   necessary after each freeze-thaw cycle.
       2.2.5.1. Problem areas must be immediately identified to the installation pavements
       engineer for a more thorough inspection and corrective action. The airfield manager must
       also be notified so that NOTAMs, local NOTAMs, and aircrew briefings can be issued to
       highlight the potential problem pending corrective action.
       2.2.5.2. Perform more detailed inspections of suspect areas with a 4-meter (12-foot)
       straightedge. Begin on the runway centerline and check the pavement in the immediate
       area of the cable for high spots, depressions, or other undulations. Perform the inspection
       out to a point beyond the first transverse pavement joint on rigid pavements or for
       approximately 3 meters (10 feet) past the suspect area, or for a minimum longitudinal
       distance of 6 meters (20 feet), whichever is greater. Repeat this procedure within 1 meter
       (3 feet) on both sides of the runway centerline, and then at not more than 2-meter (6-foot)
       intervals across the runway, for a total distance of 11.5 meters (37.5 feet) on either side of
       the runway centerline. Grind flush any high spots exceeding 3 millimeters (0.125 inch).
       Report depressions exceeding 3 millimeters (0.125 inch) in depth to the installation
       pavements engineer for corrective action.
2.3. System Certification.
   2.3.1. All Air Force arresting gear (excluding MA-1A, E-5, BAK-15, textile brake, and soft
   ground arrestor systems) that have not been engaged at a speed sufficient to exercise the
   hydraulic system within the past 12 months must be certified by an aircraft engagement. The
   recommended minimum speed for certification engagement is 75 knots regardless of aircraft
   weight. For BAK-12 and MAAS, aircraft speeds reported at less than 75 knots are also
   acceptable as long as the hydraulic system is exercised. To qualify as a valid certification
   engagement, each hydraulic selector valve must shuttle from static pressure to pump
   pressure. Certification engagements will be made toward the center of the runway. This may
   require the aircraft starting position to be in the overrun area. This requirement also applies to
 14                                                               AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


   initial system installations and after a brake change or absorber overhaul. It does not apply to
   War Reserve Materiel systems in storage.
   2.3.2. If extenuating circumstances prevent certification by engagement, a certification
   inspection must be performed or the system must be removed from service. The certification
   inspection must be performed by a MAJCOM-designated representative. For annual
   certification requirements, the inspection must be accomplished on or before the anniversary
   of the last system engagement. The inspection must include (but is not limited to) all
   requirements in Section 5 of the applicable 35E8-series T.O. The period between aircraft
   engagements must not exceed 24 months. Assigned installation maintenance personnel may
   not perform the inspection. Certification inspections cannot be substituted for initial
   installation certification engagements. Note: The installation commander has the authority to
   direct that new system installations are placed in service or those overdue for certification are
   kept in service for critical missions. If such an order is given, it must be documented in the
   maintenance records and the MAJCOM representative notified immediately.
   2.3.3. Maintenance crews will also be evaluated during certification engagements. The
   following factors will be considered:
      2.3.3.1. Evaluate crew proficiency in disconnecting the aircraft and returning the system
      to service.
      2.3.3.2. Evaluate adequacy of maintenance records and data.
      2.3.3.3. Evaluate availability of necessary tools, spare parts, and equipment.
   2.3.4. Responsibility for assuring that certification is accomplished according to this
   instruction rests with the host command. Base personnel must provide an information copy of
   each record of certification engagement or certification inspection report to airfield
   management for their file. Records of certifications will also be maintained in accordance
   with paragraph 2.6.
2.4. Operation.
   2.4.1. Disconnect and remove unidirectional barrier nets and pendant cables located in
   overruns on the approach end of the runway. Also disconnect and remove BAK-9 cables
   located on the runway on the approach end. Full-size net systems such as the BAK-15 may
   remain in place in the overrun in the down position; however, the energy absorbers must be
   disconnected and the BCE's designated representative must inform the airfield manager and
   the MAJCOM/A3 and SE when the net will be left in place. Do this to publicize the potential
   hazard to aircrew.
      2.4.1.1. If environmental conditions require frequent system configuration changes
      (runway changes) for MA-1A or MA-1A modified net systems, E-5, BAK-9, or textile
      brake systems, the nets and cables may be left in place on the approach end of the runway
      to avoid excessive runway downtime and/or excessive wear from abrasion; however, the
      non-standard configuration must first be recommended by the installation commander
      and approved by the MAJCOM/A3, SE, and A7.
      2.4.1.2. Additionally, for all unidirectional systems (MA-1A, E-5, BAK-15, and MB
      60.9.9.C), the energy absorbers must be disconnected from the engaging device(s) before
      operations commence in the opposite direction (toward the unidirectional system).
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                       15


     2.4.1.3. For MB 60.9.9.C textile brake systems, after the cable is disconnected from the
     yoke on both ends, the 31.75-millimeter (1.25-inch) -diameter cable should be secured to
     the eye-loop of each Tirfor anchor plate or to an added anchor point to prevent movement
     due to jet blast. Use standard 10-millimeter (0.375-inch) -diameter, three-strand nylon
     rope (NSN 4020-00-968-1356) like that used for cable tie-downs.
  2.4.2. Maintain BAK-12 and BAK-13 operational arresting systems in the ready position on
  the approach and departure ends of the runway unless the installation commander directs
  otherwise. Barriers and hook cables may be removed from the overrun and runway during
  snow and ice removal operations, but coordinate removal with airfield management first and
  return the barriers and hook cables to operational status as soon as possible.
     2.4.2.1. The BAK-14 and the Type H hook cable support systems were not designed to
     operate in the up position with repeated aircraft rollovers. Repeated high-speed rollovers
     will damage the system components, reduce system reliability, increase the chance of a
     missed engagement, and increase maintenance costs.
     2.4.2.2. Low-speed taxi rollovers must also be kept to a minimum to prevent degradation
     of system performance. If the AAS is not required to stop the aircraft, air traffic control
     (ATC) should lower the BAK-14 or Type H prior to rollover.
  2.4.3. When performing duties associated with AAS and barriers in the airfield environment,
  it will be necessary to communicate with ATC, ground control, fire emergency services, and
  airfield management by two-way radio. Follow local procedures established within the
  airfield operating instruction (AOI) and the base airfield driving regulations and program.
  General terms to be used for radio communication are provided in AFI 13-204, Volume 3,
  Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, and Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) Order JO 7110.65T, Air Traffic Control, Pilot/Controller
  Glossary. The most common terms for use and their definitions are provided in paragraphs
  2.4.3.1.1 through 2.4.3.1.7. Attachment 1 also provides definitions for the various terms that
  relate specifically to the airfield and airfield operational areas, including the method used to
  designate the in-use runway.
     2.4.3.1. Common phrases used in radio communication and their meanings are provided
     below. The phrase "clear" must not be used when communicating with tower personnel.
         2.4.3.1.1. ―Acknowledge‖ — Request that you have received and understand the
         message.
         2.4.3.1.2. ―Affirmative‖ — Yes.
         2.4.3.1.3. ―Negative‖ — No.
         2.4.3.1.4. ―Say Again‖ — Request to repeat the message.
         2.4.3.1.5. ―Roger‖ — I have received and understand the last transmission.
         2.4.3.1.6. ―Hold Short‖ — Do not proceed per the tower’s instructions.
         2.4.3.1.7. ―Wilco‖ — I have received and will comply with your message.
     2.4.3.2. There is no standard phraseology for reporting system status to ATC; however,
     use ―operational‖ and ―not operational,‖ and ―in-service‖ and ―out of service‖
     consistently when reporting status to the airfield authority. These terms are easy-to-
 16                                                             AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


      understand descriptions of airfield systems. The specific terms selected for each
      installation should be specified within the local AOI.
      2.4.3.3. When communicating the location of an AAS on the active runway, use the
      active runway designation and refer to the system in question by approach, midfield, or
      departure end cable, or approach or departure end barrier. In this case, it is important to
      differentiate between cables and barriers. BAK-12, BAK-13, and BAK-14 systems are
      cable systems, not barriers. Net systems such as MA-1A and BAK-15 systems are
      barriers. See the definition of terms in Attachment 1. The active runway (the runway in
      use) is identified by the numeric designation of the approach end of the runway. For
      example, for Runway 12/30, the active runway would be "Runway 12" when aircraft are
      taking off from or landing toward the end of Runway 12, or are on a 120-degree compass
      heading.
2.5. Standard Hand Signals. Standard hand signals for use between AAS crewmembers and
aircrew members are provided in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
Ground. Standard hand signals for use between AAS crewmembers are shown in Figure 2.2
through Figure 2.5.

2.6. Maintenance Records. The following records will be maintained on each AAS for the
overhaul service life of the system and returned to the overhaul facility when the system is
changed out. This includes War Reserve Materiel systems in storage and systems designated for
training use only, as applicable.
   2.6.1. Daily inspections.

  OBTAINING NEW SYSTEMS, SITING, AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Obtaining New Systems.
   3.1.1. Identify new system requirements to the MAJCOM and AFCESA, in turn, at least two
   years in advance, or as soon as new requirements are known, to allow sufficient lead-time for
   budgeting, contracting actions, manufacturing, and delivery.
   3.1.2. The BCE's representative processes new requirements received from the operations
   group commander or air expeditionary group commander by first coordinating with the
   MAJCOM functional manager for AAS. The MAJCOM functional manager coordinates the
   new requirement with the MAJCOM A3O, SEF, and A7O, and responds to the installation’s
   request. Once MAJCOM endorsement is received, the installation representative submits an
   AFEMS request to the base equipment management office (BEMO).
   3.1.3. Semiannually, the MAJCOM AAS representative must identify all new requirements
   to AFCESA/CEO during the call for new requirements.
   3.1.4. AFCESA/CEO validates the new requirements with WR-ALC for budgeting and
   procurement.
   3.1.5. Upon approval of the AFEMS request, installation-level personnel should requisition
   the system and any other components not included in the government-supplied equipment
   (GSE) kit, such as the pendant.
3.2. Siting New Systems.
   3.2.1. General Information. AAS and overrun barriers are installed in several
   configurations. Typically, overrun barriers (nets) and emergency arrestors such as MA-1A,
   BAK-15, E-5 chain gear, textile brake, or soft ground arrestor systems are installed as
   redundant systems for emergency recovery only. As such, they are installed in the overrun
   area of the runway. Operational arresting systems, such as BAK-12, are usually installed
   between the runway thresholds. This is necessary to allow pilots to touch down on the normal
   landing surface and stabilize the tailhook before engagement. Fairlead beams or runway edge
   sheaves (to direct the purchase tape path) are installed on the runway shoulders to allow the
   energy absorber to be installed outside the mandatory zone of frangibility (at least 84 meters
   [275 feet] away from the runway centerline). Support ramps are constructed to lead up to
   exposed vertical surfaces of fairlead beams and tape tubes to allow an aircraft to roll over
   them smoothly. Arresting gear that is installed on grade must have an "airfield friendly"
   structure built over it to protect the equipment from environmental degradation. The design
   should be in compliance with typical installation drawings 67F2011A or 67F2012A, as
   applicable, this instruction, the applicable 35E8-series T.O., and the requirements detailed
   within UFC 3-260-01 (Chapter 3 and Section 13). Do not install any arresting system where
   the runout will conflict with any other arresting system or any obstacle such as elevated
   airfield lights or signs. In cases where criteria cannot be met, a waiver must be established
   according to UFC 3-260-01 and/or the applicable T.O., as appropriate.
   3.2.2. Siting Operational Systems. The large rectangular pavement markings (fixed
   distance markings) located 300 meters (1000 feet) from the threshold represent the ideal aim
 22                                                               AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


   point for pilots on approach to landing. Other visual landing aids, such as the visual glide
   slope indicator system, cue the pilot to touch down approximately 300 meters (1000 feet)
   from the threshold. This ensures a minimum threshold crossing height of at least 11 meters
   (35 feet). Since stabilizing the tailhook after touchdown requires a distance of 150 to 240
   meters (500 to 800 feet), the best location for an arresting system that accommodates
   approach end engagements is 450 to 540 meters (1500 to 1800 feet) from the threshold.
   Runways used extensively during instrument meteorological conditions may require that the
   system be sited as much as 670 meters (2200 feet) from the threshold; however, if aircraft
   that are not compatible with trampling of the pendant must operate on the same runway, the
   installation commander may shift the installation site as close to the threshold as possible, but
   not closer than the distance that will allow an unobstructed runout with a standard BAK-12
   system set-up (see paragraph 3.7 and T.O. 35E8-2-5-1). It is critical that the runout area for
   an aircraft engaging the system from either direction not conflict with other AAS or
   equipment such as threshold or runway end light fixtures. Other operating scenarios, such as
   northern tier locations with heavy snow or ice accumulation, may dictate that you place an
   additional system at the midpoint of the runway. The installation commander must approve
   midfield siting after coordinating the plan with the host MAJCOM/A3, SE, and A7.
   3.2.3. Siting Emergency Systems. Locate unidirectional arresting systems and barriers
   (nets) in the overrun area of the runway. The energy-absorbing device dictates the distance
   from the threshold because of the need to accommodate full system runout. Do not locate
   unidirectional systems or net barriers closer than 11 meters (35 feet) from the threshold of the
   runway. Note: Runway threshold markings begin 6 meters (20 feet) inboard of the full-
   strength pavement; therefore, do not install a unidirectional system within 17 meters (55 feet)
   of the threshold markings. Do not mark AAS warning markings on the pavement in overruns,
   or install arresting gear marker (AGM) lighted signs in the overrun to identify the locations
   of these systems. Installation of these markings and signs might cause a pilot to attempt an
   approach end engagement with the system.
3.3. Installation Requirements.
   3.3.1. Comply with the following standards when locating, configuring, installing, or
   repairing an arresting system. BCEs must get the installation commander's approval and
   coordinate with MAJCOM/A3, SE, and A7 before deviating from these standards. A waiver
   to UFC 3-260-01 or the applicable 35E8-series T.O. will be required if these standards
   cannot be met.
   3.3.2. The BCE's designated representative determines the configuration and location of
   arresting systems in cooperation with representatives from A3 and SE. Design must conform
   to the criteria in Section 3 of the appropriate 35E8-series T.O., the typical installation
   drawings, the requirements in this instruction, and UFC 3-260-01. In cases where criteria
   cannot be met, a waiver must be established according to UFC 3-260-01 and/or the
   applicable T.O., as appropriate.
      3.3.2.1. Locate all energy absorbers below grade or at least 84 meters (275 feet) from the
      runway centerline. (Exceptions: MA-1A and E-5 ship’s anchor chains and textile brake
      modules may be located along the runway overrun shoulders. Bi-directional textile brake
      modules may be located either along the overrun or runway shoulders.) Provide paved
      transitions and buried crushed stone ramps around the arresting system components and a
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                      23


     paved service road to the site from the runway, as well as a location other than the
     runway. Pit-type installations may be sited closer to the runway as long as they meet the
     minimum split-distance required; however, all above-grade appurtenances must be
     frangible, the transition to the pit cover must meet runway shoulder grade allowances
     given in Chapter 3 of UFC 3-260-01, and the pit cover and door must be designed to
     support wheel loads in accordance with UFC 3-260-01, Chapter 3, paragraph 3.9,
     ―Shoulders.‖
     3.3.2.2. Where fairlead beams, edge sheaves, and tape tubes project above the grade of
     the existing runway shoulders, provide suitable fill materials and compaction next to or
     over these components to a finished grade of 1V:30H or flatter. Tape tubes must be steel
     or ductile iron. Tape tubes of other materials must be programmed for replacement and
     inspected monthly for signs of damage or degradation. For new installations, select tape
     tubes that are capable of supporting wheel loads in accordance with UFC 3-260-01,
     Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.9, ―Shoulders.‖
     3.3.2.3. Provide obstruction marking and lighting and arresting system location marking
     and lighting according to the provisions of AFI 32-1042, Standards for Marking
     Airfields, and UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation Systems. This requirement also
     applies to temporary installations for construction or air shows unless waived by the
     appropriate authority. See UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B, Section 1.
     3.3.2.4. Protective shelters constructed for on-grade installations must be constructed
     from lightweight framing materials and sheathing using connections that will allow the
     structure to break away or collapse if struck by an aircraft wing. See UFC 3-260-01,
     Appendix B, Section 13, paragraph 13-2.20.1. Provide shelters with a removable roof or
     end wall, or a door opening to facilitate major maintenance or replacement of the
     equipment. Also provide proper ventilation and windows that will allow the operator to
     view the runway and tape sweep areas in both directions. See Typical Installation
     Drawing 67F2011A, Sheet 2, Note 3.
     3.3.2.5. The 60 meters (200 feet) of pavement on both the approach and departure sides
     of the arresting system pendant within the center 23 meters (75 feet) of the runway are
     critical areas. Exception: For 46-meter (150-foot) -wide runways with BAK-14 systems,
     the critical area is limited to the off-center engagement capability for the BAK-14 system,
     which is the center 18 meters (60 feet) of runway pavement. For wider runways, the
     critical area is the center 23 meters (75 feet) of runway pavement for BAK-14 or any
     other model AAS, regardless of the stated off-center engagement capability. Within this
     critical area, protruding objects, excessive paint build-up, and undulating surfaces are
     detrimental to successful tailhook engagements and are not allowable. The maximum
     permissible longitudinal surface deviation in this area is ±3 millimeters (±0.125 inch) in 4
     meters (12 feet). This does not apply to the channels in grooved pavement surfaces. The
     prohibition on changes in pavement type does not apply to emergency arresting system
     cables located in overruns because overruns are constructed of asphaltic pavement and
     the first 305 meters (1,000 feet) of runways are constructed from portland cement
     concrete (PCC). Grooves to improve surface drainage and surface friction characteristics
     are not permitted within 3 meters (10 feet) of arresting system cables. Changes in
     pavement type or an interface between rigid and flexible pavements are not permitted
     within 60 meters (200 feet) of arresting system cables in the center 23 meters (75 feet) of
24                                                             AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


     the runway. This does not apply to emergency systems located within overruns,
     sacrificial panels installed beneath cables, or to PCC anchor blocks installed for
     anchoring tie-downs in flexible pavement systems. These are not considered a change in
     pavement type. Rigid inlays must not be used as a surface repair material beneath the
     cable in flexible runway systems. This type repair causes high hook-skip potential when
     the flexible pavement consolidates, exposing the leading edge of the rigid pavement.
     However, rigid pavement must be used as a foundation under sacrificial panels installed
     beneath AAS cables in both rigid and flexible pavement systems. In these cases, no part
     of the rigid foundation can be used as a top-wearing surface.
     3.3.2.6. Install cable tie-down anchors for operational systems (systems located between
     the runway thresholds) to limit cable bounce and potential aircraft damage during aircraft
     rollover. Install eight anchors for F-16, C-17, and C-130 operating bases and four anchors
     at all other locations. When using the MAAS or other expeditionary cable systems for
     other than an air show or a short-term construction project, add cable tie-downs to the
     runway to prevent aircraft damage during aircraft roll-over and engagements. This also
     applies at forward locations but may have to be postponed until time and materials are
     available to accomplish the work. Install anchors at 6-meter (20-foot) intervals centered
     on the runway width for four-point tie-downs, or at 3-meter (10-foot) intervals centered
     on the runway width for eight-point tie-downs. For rigid pavements, it is desirable that all
     anchor locations be offset at least 600 millimeters (24 inches) from pavement joints. The
     minimum offset from pavement joints for anchor locations is 300 millimeters (12 inches).
     If sacrificial panels will be installed, see Attachment 8 for anchor spacing. See Figures
     3.1 through 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 for cable tie-down anchor installation. Any of the three
     styles of anchors may be used for flexible or rigid runway pavements but the anchor
     block detail shown in Figure 3.6 is specifically designed for flexible pavement systems.
        3.3.2.6.1. Secure the cable to the anchors with a length of 10-millimeter (0.375-inch)
        -diameter, three-strand nylon rope (NSN 4020-00-968-1356) approximately 1200
        millimeters (48 inches) long (2200 kilograms [5,000 pounds] maximum breaking
        strength). The rope must be fastened to the anchor with a simple overhand knot then
        tied to the cable with a square knot.
        3.3.2.6.2. Tie a simple overhand knot as close to the square knot as possible with the
        remaining rope. This will prevent the square knot from becoming loose. See Figures
        3.3 and 3.4.

      3.3.2.7. The BCE's AAS representative will review the construction drawings and
      contract specifications at the 35 percent and 65 percent completion stages and approve at
      the 90 percent design completion phase. Other entities with a stake in the project, such as
      SE and A3 at base and MAJCOM levels, should also be asked to review the project
      drawings and contract specifications. The BCE's representative also ensures that
      installation contracts stipulate:
          3.3.2.7.1. The construction superintendent, project engineer, or other authority
          experienced in installing arresting systems is onsite during construction and
          installation of each system.
          3.3.2.7.2. The contractor corrects any deficiencies in the installation until at least two
          pullouts of the purchase tape are accomplished in each direction of intended operation
          and the contracting officer officially accepts the system.

3.4. Grandfathered Systems. On-grade BAK-12 systems installed before 1 July 1977 that are
sited at least 76.2 meters (250 feet) from the runway centerline do not have to be relocated to
meet the minimum setback requirement of 84 meters (275 feet) from the runway centerline;
however, all systems equipped with 2-roller edge sheaves or 2-roller fairlead beams must be
programmed for retrofit with 3-roller fairlead beams or edge sheaves to eliminate the
longitudinal wheel abutment along the runway shoulder. Replacement foundations must be
constructed as described in paragraphs 3.3.2.1, 3.3.2.2, and Typical Installation Drawings
67F2011A or 67F2012A to comply with the 1V:30H (3.3 percent) maximum slope requirement
along the runway shoulder (see UFC 3-260-01, Table 3.2).
3.5. Installing Systems at Jointly Used Airports.
   3.5.1. The FAA acts for and on behalf of the DOD Service component in operating arresting
   systems installed at jointly used civil airports for the primary use of US military aircraft.
   3.5.2. Site arresting systems on civil airports jointly used by civil and military aircraft
   according to FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5220-9, Aircraft Arresting Systems on Civil
   Airports.
   3.5.3. To install an arresting system at a jointly used civil airport, the installation commander
   must first notify the airport manager (or authority) of the need. If the airport manager agrees,
   the installation commander submits the plan with sketches or drawings to the Air Force
   liaison officer at the FAA regional office. Refer any disagreement between the responsible
   officials to the next higher level within the chain of command.
   3.5.4. If construction involves a lease agreement that does not allow placing additional
   structures on the leased premises, contact the MAJCOM.
   3.5.5. Third-party claims presented for damage, injury, or death resulting from FAA
   operation of the system for military aircraft or from the Air Force or Air National Guard
   maintenance of the system may be the responsibility of the Air Force. Process such claims
   under the appropriate Air Force regulatory guidance (AFI 51-502, Personnel and
   Government Recovery Claims).
   3.5.6. The FAA is responsible for claims presented for damage resulting from FAA
   operation of the system for civil aircraft; therefore, separate agreements between DOD and
   FAA concerning liability for such damage are not necessary.
   3.5.7. The MAJCOM negotiates the operational agreement with FAA for a jointly used civil
   airport. The MAJCOM may delegate this authority to the installation commander. The
   agreement describes FAA functions and responsibilities concerning the remote-control
   operation of arresting systems by FAA air traffic controllers. See Attachment 5 for a sample
   letter of agreement.
3.6. Military Rights Agreements for Foreign Locations and Use by Non-US Government
Aircraft.
   3.6.1. Install these systems under the military rights agreement with the host government.
   The installation commander coordinates any separate agreements required with the local US
   diplomatic representative and negotiates the agreement with the host nation. If the parties are
   unable to agree, refer the issue to the MAJCOM.
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                     31


   3.6.2. In an emergency, the pilot of a non-US Government aircraft may request and use
   arresting systems at Air Force bases and jointly used airports within the continental US
   (CONUS) and overseas.
3.7. Standard BAK-12 System Set-Up. For any of the three installation methods described
within T.O. 35E8-2-5-1, site selection should be made to accommodate a standard system
configuration. A standard system configuration includes a 365-meter (1200-foot) runout,
synchronization pressure of 7584.233 kilopascals (kPa) (1100 pounds per square inch [psi]), and
a 32-millimeter (1.25-inch) -diameter pendant supported by 152-millimeter (6-inch) -diameter
support disks (donuts). Once the site has been selected and the system installed, the Aircraft
Arresting Systems Report (RCS: HAL-ILE [AR] 7150) is submitted in accordance with
paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.3.3.6 and a copy is provided to the airfield manager. Information
pertaining to location with respect to runway thresholds and runout must be published within the
DOD FLIP. Once this has been reported and published, any change to the standard configuration
(system runout, synchronization pressure, pendant cable diameter, or donut size) must not be
made without written authorization from the installation commander and the MAJCOM civil
engineer.

able to support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The FAA/ICAO term for this is
―stopway.‖ UFC 3-260-01 identifies this area as one that prevents serious damage to aircraft that
overrun or undershoot the runway.
Pendant—The part of an AAS that spans the runway surface or flight deck landing area and is
engaged by the aircraft arresting hook.
Reset Time—The time required to ready the arresting system for another engagement after
aircraft release. (This does not include time to disengage the aircraft from the arresting system
but does include the time required to inspect and certify the system as fully operational.)
Stopway (FAA/ICAO)—An area beyond the take-off runway designated by the airport
authorities as able to support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The USAF term for this is
―overrun.‖

                  TYPES OF USAF AIRCRAFT ARRESTING SYSTEMS

A2.1. General Information. Aircraft arresting systems (AAS) consist of engaging devices and
energy absorbers. Engaging devices are net barriers such as MA-1A and BAK-15, disc-supported
pendants (hook cables), and cable support systems such as BAK-14 and the Type H that raise the
pendant to the battery position or retract it below the runway surface. Energy-absorbing devices
are ship’s anchor chains, rotary friction brakes (such as the BAK-9 and BAK-12), or rotary
hydraulic systems (such as the BAK-13), tearing strap modules such as textile brake systems,
and soft ground systems such as the Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS). Tables
A2.1 and A2.2 below show the leading particulars for USAF energy-absorbing systems.

A2.2. Types of USAF Systems.
   A2.2.1. MA-1A. The MA-1A emergency arresting system consists of a net barrier and cable
   system designed to engage the main landing gear of an aircraft (Figure A2.1). Because it is a
   unidirectional system, it must always be installed in the overrun area. Aircraft engaging this
   system above the speed and weight limits provided in Figure A2.3 (or Chart 1-1 of T.O.
   35E8-2-2-1) will result in a runout greater than 305 meters (1000 feet) or cable failure. Most
   MA-1A systems employ ship’s anchor chains as the energy absorber. These systems require
   a runout area of at least 259 meters (850 feet) plus the length of the aircraft. The chains lie on
   either side of the runway overrun, beginning at the barrier location and running in the
   direction of aircraft travel; however, some MA-1A systems use a BAK-9 instead of a ship’s
   anchor chain as the energy absorber. These systems require a runout area of at least 290
   meters (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft. This configuration is an MA-1A/BAK-9. The
   MA-1A may also be complemented with a hook-cable interconnect to accommodate hook
   engagement. This arrangement is shown in Figure A2.2. The MA-1A is not currently in
   production as a system. Do not consider it for new installations unless you can salvage the
   necessary equipment from another facility. Obtain further technical information on this
   system from T.O. 35E8-2-2-1.
                                                                   Fig A2.1

                          the energy absorber but these systems are never connected with a barrier (net). For the Navy
                          or Marine Corps, these systems can have from one to four disc-supported hook cables, with
                          designations of E-5 and E-5 Mod 1 through E-5 Mod 3. Obtain further technical information

   A2.2.3. BAK-9. The BAK-9 (Figure A2.5) is an obsolete bi-directional emergency arresting
   system. It consisted of a single energy absorber that employed two rotary friction brakes and
   purchase-tape reels mounted on a common shaft. The reels were mechanically connected at
   the midpoint by a third brake that acted as a clutch. This allowed each reel to turn at different
   speeds during off-center engagements and helped steer the aircraft toward the center of the
   runway. The energy absorber for these systems was installed below grade on one side of the
   runway and the purchase tape was routed to the opposite side of the runway through deflector
   sheaves and duct. The other purchase tape (near side) was routed to a turnaround sheave
   located in a pit sited to allow both purchase tapes to be of equal length. The BAK-9 is not
   currently in production as a system and should not be considered as a suitable system for a
   new requirement. Obtain further technical information on this system from T.O. 35E8-2-4-1,
   Aircraft Arresting Gear, Model BAK-9.

   A2.2.4. BAK-12. The BAK-12 (Figure A2.6) is the standard USAF operational AAS. This
   bi-directional system employs two energy absorbers. Each absorber consists of two multi-
   disc rotary friction brakes mounted on either side of the purchase-tape reel on a common
   shaft. The energy absorbers are located on opposite sides of the runway, connected to a 32-
   millimeter (1.25-inch) disc-supported pendant by the purchase tape. Ideally, the energy
   absorbers should be in a below-grade pit with a minimum split distance of 15.24 meters (50
   feet). (Split distance is a measurement taken between the lead-on sheave of the fairlead beam
   or edge sheave, and the energy absorber.) Split distances of up to 91 meters (300 feet) are
   acceptable for all BAK-12 installations. You may also install BAK-12 systems above grade
   in one of two configurations, the selection depending upon site conditions and operational
   requirements. These are the expeditionary installation for periods of up to one year, and the
   semi-permanent installation, well-suited for long-term use and typically selected when site
   conditions will not allow a pit-type installation. Siting and grading requirements are in
   Section 3 of T.O. 35E8-2-5-1. Typical Installation Drawings for pit-type installations
   (drawing number 67F2012A) and permanent surface type installations (drawing number
   67F2011A) are available from AFCESA/CEO and 642 CBSG/GBEB.
      A2.2.4.1. Originally, BAK-12 energy absorbers were fitted with a 60-inch purchase-tape
      storage reel. This design allowed the maximum energy expected to be imparted during an
      aircraft engagement to dissipate within a runout of 290 meters (950 feet) plus the length
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                      45


     of the aircraft. Designers have since improved the BAK-12 to meet increased demands of
     heavier and faster aircraft. The energy absorbers have been retrofitted with larger 66-inch
     or 72-inch tape storage reels to accommodate increased runout, thus increasing the total
     energy capacity of the system. Although some BAK-12 systems have 60-inch tape
     storage reels, new and upgraded BAK-12 systems (part numbers 52-W-2291-801, 52-W-
     2291-801A, 52-W-2291-901, and 52-W-2291-901A) have 66-inch reels. These systems
     require 366 meters (1200 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for maximum runout. The
     72-inch reel systems are special-purpose systems configured for 610 meters (2000 feet)
     of runout.
     A2.2.4.2. The standard BAK-12 is configured for cross-runway separations of up to 61
     meters (200 feet) (distance between fairlead beams or edge sheaves). For installations
     with cross-runway spans exceeding 61 meters (200 feet), replace the BAK-12 control
     valve cam to accommodate full runout of the system. Refer to T.O. 35E8-2-5-1 and T.O.
     35E8-2-5-4, Illustrated Parts Breakdown – Aircraft Arresting System Model BAK-12, to
     identify the part number for the correct replacement cam and installation procedures.
     Also select a pendant length of at least 80 percent of the distance between the fairlead
     beams to avoid adverse cable dynamics. Selected cable length should be at least 2 meters
     (6 feet) less than the total span between runway edge sheaves. This will allow sufficient
     exposed tape on each side of the runway (at least 0.6 meter [2 feet]), as well as an off-set
     between the runway centerline and the center point of the cable, to further reduce cable
     dynamics by disrupting parity in the kink wave caused by the engagement.
     A2.2.4.3. Dual BAK-12 systems are special-purpose installations configured to
     accommodate high-energy engagements of aircraft ranging from 27,200 to 63,500
     kilograms (60,000 to 140,000 pounds). These configurations consist of four BAK-12
     energy absorbers arranged in pairs on either side of the runway. The energy absorbers
     may be standard BAK-12s or be equipped with 72-inch-diameter tape storage reels to
     accommodate 610 meters (2000 feet) of runout. Special tape connectors and edge sheaves
     are needed for these installations. For details of these components and other special
     considerations, see Section VIII of T.O. 35E8-2-5-1.

  by nylon purchase tapes and a 32-millimeter (1.25-inch) disc-supported pendant. The energy
  absorbers are made from a steel weldment base incorporating a tape-storage reel mounted on
  a vertical shaft and a vaned rotor assembly enclosed within a vaned stator assembly (also
  called a tub) that contains a water and glycol mixture. A rewind engine, transmission
  assembly, and an operator control panel are also included, along with necessary hydraulic
  system components.
     A2.2.5.1. The energy imparted during an aircraft arrestment converts to heat through the
     turbulence developed by rotation of the vaned rotor within the vaned stator. An external
     cooling reservoir permits rapid cycling of this system.
     A2.2.5.2. Siting and grading requirements are provided in Section 3 of T.O. 35E8-2-7-
     11, Operation and Maintenance Instructions, Aircraft Arresting System, Type BAK-
     13A/F48A. The site requirements are essentially the same as for the BAK-12; however,
     the low-profile units may be located as close as 46 meters (150 feet) from the runway
     edge if installed in a semi-permanent configuration. These systems require 290 meters
     (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for maximum runout. The BAK-13 is not
     currently in production as a system. It should not be considered as a suitable system for a
     new requirement due to the potentially high hook loads generated during engagement.

       A2.2.6.1. The BAK-14 hook cable support system (Figure A2.8) is a bidirectional hook
       cable (pendant) support system used in conjunction with the BAK-12, BAK-13, or a
       comparable arresting system to engage and safely stop a hook-equipped aircraft. It
       provides the means to support the pendant at least 51 millimeters (2 inches) above the
       runway surface while giving ATC the means to lower the pendant below the surface of
       the runway to prevent damage to low-undercarriage aircraft, the pendant, and the
       pavement below the pendant during trampling. These systems can accommodate 45-,
       200-, and 90-meter (150-, 200-, and 300-foot) -wide runways, but the system can be
       ordered to suit the specific application. The control side BAK-12 pit or protective shelter
       and foundation must be expanded to house the compressed air and control systems
       needed to operate this supplemental system. The site and utility considerations for

      A2.2.6.2. The Type H hook cable support system (Figure A2.9) is a bi-directional hook
      cable support system that can be used in conjunction with any type of energy-absorbing
      device. It provides a means to raise a cable at least 51 millimeters (2 inches) above a
      runway surface or lower it below the runway surface in less than 1.5 seconds. It can be
      supplied to accommodate runway widths of 46, 60, and 90 meters (150, 200, and 300
      feet). A radio remote-control system provides ATC the means to operate the system and
      to monitor its operational status. It typically consists of 14 to 18 (depending on runway

   A2.2.7. BAK-15 (61QSII). The BAK-15 aircraft arresting barrier consists of a pair of
   electro-hydraulically powered steel masts that provide support and remote-controlled
   movement for a unidirectional nylon net barrier (Figure A2.10). The masts are installed on
   opposite sides of the runway overrun on concrete foundations. The ATC tower contains a
   remote-control panel which can be hard-wired but most commonly is radio-controlled.
      A2.2.7.1. The barrier must be augmented with an energy-absorbing device such as a
      ship's anchor chain, BAK-12, or textile brake. During an aircraft engagement, shear links
      in the net suspension straps separate by the force of the aircraft engaging the net. The net
      then envelops the aircraft and seats on the leading edge of the wings, transferring the
      forward momentum of the aircraft to the energy-absorbing device.
      A2.2.7.2. The system can be complemented with a standard disc-supported pendant to
      accommodate tailhook engagements through interconnect configuration hardware similar
      to that used for the MA-1A Modified. The hook cable interconnect kit is designated as
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                    51

   A2.2.8. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS). The MAAS (Figure A2.11) is
   essentially a BAK-12 AAS mobilized through installation on a specially developed trailer. It
   is configured for a maximum aircraft runout of 302 meters (990 feet). This system was
   initially developed and tested to accommodate recovery of fighter aircraft returning to a
 52                                                            AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


   battle-damaged airfield. Such cases require rapid deployment and installation and may
   require that only the minimum essential anchoring hardware be installed to accommodate this
   scenario. When installed for this purpose, the MAAS is installed using a 19-stake anchoring
   scheme. This configuration is limited to unidirectional engagement capability with a
   maximum aircraft weight and speed of 18,144 kilograms (40,000 pounds) at 150 knots
   (Table A2.1). For detailed instructions on this system, refer to T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Operation
   and Maintenance Instructions, Arresting Systems, Aircraft, Mobile.

   A2.2.9. MAAS Upgrades. The MAAS can be upgraded to accommodate bi-directional
   engagements with the full capacity of a standard BAK-12 AAS (Table A2.1). This is
   accomplished by increasing the total number of cruciform stakes used to anchor the system
   from 19 to 31, extending the runout to 366 meters (1200 feet) and synchronizing the system
   for higher brake pressure. The system may also be installed in a set-back configuration to
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                     53

  For detailed information, see T.O. 35E8-2-10-1, Section VIII, Difference Data Sheets.
  A2.2.10. Textile Brake. This modular arresting system is primarily intended as an
  emergency back-up system for standard operational systems. It is composed of multiple
  modules arranged in equal numbers on both sides of the overrun that contain specially woven
  textile tearing straps to absorb the kinetic energy generated during an engagement. One end
  of each module is anchored to the ground and the other end is connected to a tensioned cable
  positioned across the runway. The system is available in a two-stage unidirectional
  configuration (Figure A2.12) or as a single-stage bi-directional system (Figure A2.13). See

     A2.2.10.1. The advantages of the two-stage system (MB 60.9.9.C) over the MB
     100.10.C bi-directional system are higher system capacity and lower costs for
     reconfiguration after low-energy engagements. The modules in a stage (breaking line) are
     expended upon aircraft engagement and must be replaced; however, a life cycle analysis
     indicates system costs are approximately 50 percent of the life cycle cost for a BAK-12
     installed in the overrun area of a runway due to the low number of engagements that
     occur there. These systems are designed for tailhook-equipped fighter aircraft but can
     also be complemented with a net barrier such as the BAK-15 or a net/cable interconnect
     system. They may also be configured for expeditionary or temporary installations.
     A2.2.10.2. If the bi-directional version of the textile brake arresting system is installed
     on the operational runway surface due to a non-standard length overrun, the arresting
     gear marker (AGM) signs should be blanked when viewed from the approach. This is
     because the system is a low-energy-capacity system (compared with BAK-12 or BAK-
     13) and is not intended for approach end engagements.

A2.2.11. Soft Ground Type AAS. The Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) is an
FAA-approved soft ground system normally used for civil airports to mitigate short safety areas
(less than 305 meters [1,000 feet] long) at runway ends. The system is constructed of cellular
foam concrete of specific strength and thickness to decelerate an aircraft that overruns the
runway through rolling resistance. The design for each system is aircraft-specific, based upon the
type of aircraft that will use the runway. FAA AC 150/5220-22, Engineered Materials Arresting
Systems (EMAS) for Aircraft Overruns, provides the design basis. It is intended for use where it
is impractical to obtain the standard 305-meter (1000-foot) safety area and other alternatives are
not feasible. See Figure A2.14 for layout of a typical soft ground type system. For purposes of
design, the soft ground arrestor system can be considered fixed by function and frangible since it
is designed to fail at a specific impact load; therefore, a soft ground system is not considered an
obstruction under Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 14 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part
77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace. Soft ground systems are located beyond the end of the
runway, centered on the extended runway centerline. They will usually begin at some distance
from the end of the runway to avoid damage due to jet blast or short landings. This distance will
vary depending on the available area and the specific system design.

     TYPICAL ARRESTING SYSTEM AND BARRIER CONFIGURATIONS, AND
                         DECOMMISSIONING

A3.1. Configurations. The primary mission aircraft dictates the total number, type, and
location of AAS required. The owning MAJCOM of the tailhook-equipped aircraft (or aircraft
compatible with net barrier systems) can determine through operational risk management
(ORM), runway configuration, proximity to other airfields, and other factors, that the typical
configuration of both a runway and overrun system may not be required. Use the following
examples for guidance:
   A3.1.1. A runway intended primarily for operating tactical or training tailhook-equipped
   aircraft should typically have an emergency system in each overrun and an operational
   system at each end of the runway for redundant capability. For some locations at forward
   operating bases or where snow and ice accumulation warrants, however, two operational
   systems may be necessary for each runway end and a midfield installation may be needed as
   well.
   A3.1.2. Runways that are prime divert facilities for bases operating tactical or training
   tailhook-equipped aircraft should typically have an emergency system in each overrun and an
   operational system on each end of the primary runway.
   A3.1.3. Bases that are occasional hosts to arrestment-capable transient aircraft should have
   an emergency system installed in each overrun of the primary runway or an operational
   system on each end of the primary runway.
A3.2. Decommissioning. If the mission aircraft assigned to an installation does not require an
arresting system complex and removal will not have an impact on other USAF activities,
consider decommissioning; however, first follow coordination procedures in Chapter 1.

        SAMPLE LETTER OF AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL AVIATION
                         ADMINISTRATION (FAA)

AGREEMENT: The [FAA office and address] and [designated MAJCOM] agree to the
following provisions for the operation and use of aircraft arresting equipment installed on
[designated runway, airport name, and address].

General Provisions:

This agreement describes FAA functions and responsibilities concerning the remote-control
operation of arresting systems by FAA air traffic controllers. It governs the use of arresting
barriers and hook cable arresting systems for military aircraft and, in an emergency, at pilot
request for civil aircraft.

The conditions and procedures described in this agreement become effective when it is signed
and dated by the parties and the tower chief receives written notice from the installation
commander that one of the following conditions exists:

       The arresting system has been accepted from the contractor and is commissioned and fully
       operational.

       The arresting system is available for emergency use only. If the arresting system has not
       been accepted from the contractor, this notification must come with a written statement
       from the contractor authorizing emergency use of the system and waiving any claim
       against the FAA for damage to the system as the result of such use.

       A NOTAM has been issued specifying one of the above conditions. Before receiving the
       letter from the installation commander, the military crew deenergizes the tower arresting
       system controls and the chief controller labels them "Inoperative." Tower personnel may
       not energize the controls under any circumstances.

Automatic arresting systems may be installed on the runway or in the overrun. Control tower
personnel raise or lower the barrier or hook cable through a remote-control panel in the control
tower.

Air traffic controllers operate the tower arresting system controls at the request of:

        The pilot of any military aircraft (regardless of the Service concerned, type of aircraft, or
        nature of the operation).

        The pilot of a civil aircraft in an emergency, when in commission or emergency use
        status as described above.

        A mobile control unit, the airfield manager, or a designated representative.
 62                                                                AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


The military crew originates NOTAMs covering operational or outage status of a barrier or hook
cable. During a NOTAM outage for repair or maintenance, tower personnel operate the controls,
provided that the outage NOTAM contains the statement "available for emergency use" and the
tower possesses a copy. Otherwise, the military crew deenergizes the tower controls and the
chief controller labels them "Inoperative." In this event, tower personnel may not energize the
controls under any circumstances.

During NOTAM outages due to failure of controls or when tower personnel advise of
malfunction of the system, the military crew at the system site has full and final responsibility for
operating the arresting device. The arresting system crew maintains a listening watch on air and
ground frequencies and has transmitting and receiving capability with the tower on the ground
control frequency keeping personnel informed of the position of the system.

Operations:

Typically, all military aircraft take off and land toward an operational arresting system in the
"ready" configuration. The pilot asks the control tower operator to raise or lower the barrier or
hook cable. For example, the pilot says "Duluth Tower, Joy 32 on base, gear down and locked,
raise cable."

For normal landings, the request involves the approach-end cable.

For normal takeoffs, the request involves the departure-end barrier and cable.

When tower personnel receive a request to raise or lower the barrier or cable, they must inform
the pilot of the intended barrier or cable position as part of takeoff or landing information. For
example, they say "Joy 32 cleared for takeoff, barrier indicates up."

The pilot may request barrier or cable operating status at any time.

The barrier and cable controls are in the down position except when pilots or other authorized
personnel request that either or both be raised.

Tower personnel raise the departure-end barrier and both approach- and departure-end cables for
known or suspected radio failure landing by any military arrestment-capable aircraft. Activate
the arresting system even if you doubt the aircraft's ability to engage the system.

The standard phraseology for emergency requests to raise the barrier is "barrier, barrier, barrier."
The standard phraseology for emergency requests to raise the cable is "cable, cable, cable."

Tower personnel start normal crash procedures when an aircraft engages the barrier or cable if
these procedures are not in progress.

When there is a malfunction of the barrier, hook cable mechanism, or remote control system, the
tower personnel notify airfield management immediately.

                          EFFECTIVE PENDANT HEIGHT (EPH)

A6.1. General.
   A6.1.1. Pendant discs must have proper pavement support to ensure adequate clearance
   between the underside of the pendant cable and the runway surface. Adequate clearance
   increases the probability that the aircraft tailhook will successfully engage with the arresting
   system pendant cable. The term for this clearance is the EPH.
   A6.1.2. The EPH is the vertical distance (in millimeters or inches) from the underside of the
   pendant to a projected surface representing the original runway surface. The EPH for an
   undamaged or ungrooved runway surface is approximately 60 millimeters (2.38 inches) for a
   32-millimeter (1.25-inch) pendant cable and 64 millimeters (2.5 inches) for a 25-millimeter
   (1-inch) cable.
A6.2. EPH Measurements. Measure the EPH along the center third of the runway width at 3-
meter (10-foot) intervals or less using an EPH-measuring tool (see Figure A6.1). Manufacture
the tool locally for use by the power production shop.
   A6.2.1. Start measuring when you notice pavement erosion or grooving and repeat
   measurements at least monthly. As the EPH approaches 38 millimeters (1.5 inches), take and
   record measurements daily.
   A6.2.2. Record EPH measurements in the arresting system maintenance log, using a sketch
   to demonstrate the EPH values and the distance to the location where the measurement was
   taken. Indicate the distance to the left and right of the runway centerline facing the runway
   approach.
   A6.2.3. Arresting system maintenance personnel must notify the MAJCOM representative
   when EPH measurements become necessary. Provide status reports as changes to the EPH
   occur.
A6.3. Pavement Repairs. Arrange for pavement repairs when any EPH measurement drops to
44 millimeters (1.75 inches) or less. Make the repair before the lowest EPH drops below 38
millimeters (1.5 inches). Perform emergency repairs (permanent or temporary) when any EPH
measurement is less than 38 millimeters (1.5 inches).
A6.4. Notification of Reduced Engagement Reliability. When the EPH falls to less than 38
millimeters (1.5 inches), ask the airfield manager to issue an airfield advisory notifying pilots of
the reduced arresting system reliability.

                                           Attachment 8
      INSTALLATION OF ULTRA-HIGH-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT (UHMW)
  POLYETHYLENE PANELS UNDER AIRCRAFT ARRESTING SYSTEM CABLES
    (CONUS, ALASKA, HAWAII AND INSTALLATIONS IN US TERRITORIES)

A8.1. Purpose. This attachment provides instructions for installation of UHMW polyethylene
panels under AAS cables. It includes panel specifications and installation and inspection
guidelines.
A8.2. Application. Requirements of this attachment are mandatory for new construction of
UHMW panel installations. Designers should also consider thickened slabs under UHMW panels
for new construction to ensure adequate runway pavement strength and sufficient anchoring
depth for studs and tie-downs are provided. Installation of UHMW panels is the preferred
method of repair for existing pavements; other repair options may be justified based on economy
or mission.
A8.3. Specific Requirements. AAS cables impact underlying pavement, eroding grooves in the
pavement; the pendant support disks (donuts) supporting the cable sink into the grooves,
lowering the cable. When the EPH is below 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) the aircraft tailhook may
miss the cable. These areas must be repaired to maintain a uniform pavement surface and the
proper EPH to ensure reliability of the arresting system.
A8.4. Criteria for Repairs:
   A8.4.1. Materials must; (1) install easily, and; (2) not warp or erode.
   A8.4.2. Method must be cost-effective.
A8.5. Background and Best Practices.
   A8.5.1. Bonded Partial-Depth Inlays. The Air Force has used numerous cementitious,
   epoxy, and polyurethane-based materials under arresting system cables. Performance varies
   from satisfactory to very poor, even with the same material. Most of these repairs have been
   costly and/or eroded quickly.
   A8.5.2. Preformed Panels. The Air Force has tested non-UHMW preformed panels with
   only limited success—panels warp and their edges protrude above the adjacent runway
   pavement, causing the aircraft tailhook to skip over the cable. It has been established that in
   cases where preformed panels are the best repair option, UHMW panels should be specified.
   Further, it is absolutely critical to keep panels flush with, or, preferably, slightly recessed (1.6
   to 3.2 millimeters [0.0625 to 0.125 inch]) below the adjacent pavement surface. Thermal
   compatibility of the panel material, the anchoring system, and the adjacent pavement is
   extremely important; if possible, plan to install the panels and sealant during average
   temperatures to allow for optimum sealant placement. If the panels are placed in cold
   weather the joints will tend to close completely in hot weather. If placed in hot weather the
   joints will tend to be too wide during cold weather. It is desirable to use light-gray colored
   panels to help minimize thermal expansion and contraction (see preferred panel colors in
   Figure A8.1).
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                        69

Government Procurement.




      A8.5.2.1. When considering the installation of UHMW panels it is important to verify
      thickness of the existing pavement. The panels must be anchored in a solid concrete bed.
      A typical anchor stud is 245 millimeters (9.625 inches) long and the receiving slot is
      drilled slightly deeper. A minimum slab thickness of 280 millimeters (11 inches) is
      recommended to properly anchor the panels.
      A8.5.2.2. If the existing concrete is not thick enough you must replace it with adequate
      thickness concrete prior to UHMW panel installation or select alternative repair methods.
   A8.5.3. Installation in Flexible Pavement Systems. For installation in asphalt pavement,
   saw-cut and remove a minimum 635-millimeter (25-inch) -wide section of the asphalt as well
   as the underlying materials to a depth of 915 millimeters (3 feet). Backfill the bottom of the
   trench with a well-graded crushed stone material and compact to a 305-millimeter (12-inch)
   thickness in 150-millimeter (6-inch) lifts then pour the concrete foundation (approximately
   570 millimeters [22.5 inches] thick) for panel installation. Care must be taken to ensure that
   the concrete foundation is finished level enough and at the proper depth for panel installation.
   Once the concrete is cured, proceed with installing and anchoring the panels as outlined in
 70                                                            AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


   this attachment. This is a repair procedure for an existing asphalt pavement. If installing
   UHMW panels in conjunction with construction of new pavement (or reconstruction of an
   existing pavement), the design may differ; however, the above procedure is recommended.

   A8.6.2. Panel Dimensions and Anchor Stud Locations.
      A8.6.2.1. Panel Dimensions. Tolerance on panel length and width will be ±3.2
      millimeters (±0.125 inch). Panel thickness will be no greater than 38.1 millimeters (1.5
      inches) or less than 36.5 millimeters (1.4375 inches).
      A8.6.2.2. Anchor Stud Hole Locations and Dimensions. Each full-sized panel will
      have six anchor stud holes centered 102 millimeters (4 inches) from the edge of the panel.
      Each partial-sized panel will have four anchor stud holes centered 102 millimeters (4
      inches) from the edge of the panel. The anchor stud hole will be 25.4 millimeters (1 inch)
      for the through hole and 51 millimeters (2 inches) for the countersink hole. The
      countersink hole will be 22 millimeters (0.875 inch) deep with square shoulders for a flat
      washer to lie firmly against. Figure A8.2 shows dimensions and drilling details.
      Tolerances on dimensions for locations and diameters of anchor holes will be ±1.6
      millimeters (±0.0625 inch).
   A8.6.3. Holes for Cable Tie-down Anchors. The agency ordering panels will specify if
   cable tie-down anchor holes are required and the number of panels that will be furnished with
   cable tie-down anchor holes. The cable tie-down anchor hole will be 102 millimeters (4
   inches) in diameter and drilled completely through the panel. Cable tie-down anchor holes
   will be located in the center of the panel. The location of the cable tie-down anchor hole is
   shown in Figure A8.2. The number of tie-down anchors required should be provided by the
   MAJCOM AAS engineer. Cable tie-downs will not be located closer than 305 millimeters
   (12 inches) from existing pavement joints. Partial-sized panels will not receive holes for
   cable tie-down anchors.
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                        71


A8.7. Material.
   A8.7.1. The panels will be fabricated from virgin and/or recycled UHMW polyethylene and
   will be black in color and UV-stabilized. An antistatic additive will be added to the UHMW
   polyethylene.
   A8.7.2. The UHMW polyethylene must meet the physical requirements of Table A8.1.

                                   Method A (see Note)
 Note: The test specimens must have two opposing 15-degree notches.
A8.8. Guidelines for Panel Sizing and Preparation.
   A8.8.1. Panel Dimensions. Uncut panel stock is 1220 millimeters (48 inches) wide by 3048
   millimeters (10 feet) long by 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) thick. Typically, at least five panels
   can be cut from the 3048-millimeter (10-foot) -long stock with minimal waste. Determine
   whether a partial or full runway width installation is desired then size, or order panels sized,
   to avoid material waste.
   A8.8.2. Length. Cut panels to allow joints between panels to line up with runway pavement
   joints. For runways with slabs sized in 1524-millimeter (5-foot) increments, such as those
   having 6-meter (20-foot) longitudinal paving lane joint spacing, panels should be 1207
   millimeters (3 feet, 11.5 inches) long. Panels may be shorter but must never exceed 1219
   millimeters (4 feet). Recommended joint space between panels is 13 millimeters (0.5 inch).
   In all cases, particularly at oversea installations, the existing slab sizes should be verified
   before ordering materials and the panels should be sized so the joints between panels line up
   with the existing pavement joints. Panels should never straddle pavement joints and should
   not be positioned in a way that would allow the anchor studs to fall in existing pavement
   joints.
   A8.8.3. Width. To reduce panel warping and damage to joints from cable impact, panels
   should be a nominal 610 millimeters (24 inches) wide for all installations.
   A8.8.4. Thickness. Panel thickness should not be less than 36.5 millimeters (1.4375 inches)
   nor more than 38.1 millimeters (1.5 inches).
   A8.8.5. Panel Finishing. The panel supplier should pre-drill holes in panels (for anchor
   stud installation) in accordance with Figure A8.2.

   and spacing of tie-down anchors. Predrill an appropriate number of panels with 102-
   millimeter (4-inch) -diameter holes to allow tie-down anchor installation. Tie-down anchors
   should be located in the center of full-size panels.
A8.9. Guidelines for Pavement Preparation and UHMW Panel Installation.
   A8.9.1. General Procedures. The procedure to install UHMW panels under arresting
   system cables involves the following major steps:
          A8.9.1.1. Prepare the receiving slot.
          A8.9.1.2. Place a cementitious setting bed.
          A8.9.1.3. Install the UHMW panels.
          A8.9.1.4. Install panel anchor studs.
          A8.9.1.5. Install new cable tie-down anchors.

      A8.9.2.1. Remove Concrete. The dimensions of the area of concrete removed depend
      upon the number of panels installed. For example, for a runway with 3.8-meter (12.5-
      foot) slabs, each full panel is 1076 millimeters (42.375 inches) long by 610 millimeters
      (24 inches) wide, and partial panels are 530 millimeters (20.875 inches) long and 610
      millimeters (24 inches) wide, with 13-millimeter (0.5-inch) gaps between panels.
      Therefore, for a 22.86-meter (75-foot) -long inlay of 18 full panels and six partial panels
      across the runway (11.4 meters [37.5 feet]) on each side of the runway centerline, the saw
      cut area must be:
          A8.9.2.1.1. 22.87 meters (75 feet, 0.5 inch) long.
          A8.9.2.1.2. 635 millimeters (25 inches) wide.
          A8.9.2.1.3. At least 64 millimeters (2.5 inches) deep.
          A8.9.2.1.4. An installation extending completely across a 46-meter (150-foot) -wide
          runway requires 36 full panels and 12 partial panels. Note: For partial-runway-width
          installations, provide a means of drainage for the receiving slot to prevent damage
          from trapped water or dirt that may enter at leaks in the joint seals. Several saw cuts
          made to run from the ends of the inlay to the shoulders and cut at the same depth as
          the receiving slot will typically suffice.
      A8.9.2.2. Perimeter Cuts. Perimeter saw cuts must be 76 millimeters (3 inches) deep
      and overlap at least 76 millimeters (3 inches) to ensure that corners are perfectly square
      when pavement is removed. Remove all loose, unsound concrete within the area.
      Additional saw cuts inside the perimeter will make removing the concrete easier (using
      chipping hammers) and result in a more uniform concrete profile.
      A8.9.2.3. Inspect Receiving Slot Following Concrete Removal. With a notched board
      (Figure A8.3), check the depth of the concrete within the recessed setting bed. Use a
      chipping hammer to remove any portions less than 64 millimeters (2.5 inches) from the
      surface of the adjacent pavement then visually check the concrete, sound it with a steel
      rod to identify any unsound portions, and remove all unsound concrete.

      A8.9.2.4. Remove Existing Tie-down Anchors. Cut existing AAS cable tie-down
      anchors flush with the bottom of the concrete substrate before placing the setting bed.
      A8.9.2.5. Clean Concrete Substrate. Upon removal of concrete from the slot, it is
      important to adequately clean the slot to ensure the new setting bed material will adhere
74                                                              AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012


     to the substrate. Particular care should be taken to remove the laitance from the smooth
     faces of the sawcut walls; sandblast or use wire brushes, followed by compressed air.
  A8.9.3. Place a Setting Bed. Place a cementitious setting bed under the panels and allow
  the bed to cure before drilling and anchoring the panel anchor studs. Use ordinary PCC at
  airfield strength (34,474 kPa [5,000 psi] compression/4,482 kPa [650 psi] flexural strength in
  28 days) when several hours' cure time is available.
     A8.9.3.1. As a suggested mix, use:
         A8.9.3.1.1. A lean seven-bag mix with 10-millimeter (0.375-inch) maximum size
         aggregate.
         A8.9.3.1.2. Water-to-cement ratio not to exceed 0.3:1.
         A8.9.3.1.3. Plasticizer admixture.
         A8.9.3.1.4. Substitute fly ash for -50 sieve size sand as required.
         A8.9.3.1.5. This mixture will allow drilling within 18 to 24 hours. For short-cure-
         time applications, a prepackaged material such as Rapid Set® Concrete Mix is
         satisfactory. Rapid Set Concrete Mix is packaged in 27-kilogram (60-pound) bags
         that yield approximately 0.014 cubic meters (0.5 cubic foot) of concrete when mixed
         with water (refer to Table A8.3 for ordering information). Placing a small test sample
         in a disposable pail the same depth as the setting bed may also serve as a helpful tool
         in determining adequate cure time for drilling operations.
     A8.9.3.2. Mixing Equipment Placement. Position two mechanical mortar or concrete
     mixers approximately 6 meters (20 feet) from the prepared inlay near the center of the
     runway. Transport mixed mortar in a wheelbarrow. Mortar mixers are preferred.
     Depending upon the type of material used, drum mixers may not agitate the material
     enough to produce the desired workability when the recommended amount of water is
     used.
         A8.9.3.2.1. Mixing and Placing Procedure for Rapid Set Concrete Mix.
             A8.9.3.2.1.1. Place 2.8 to 3.8 liters (3 to 4 quarts) of water in the mixer. In hot
             climates, using cold water can extend the setting time of the mix. In cold climates,
             using hot water and heating the substrate may shorten the setting time.
             A8.9.3.2.1.2. Add one bag of Rapid Set Concrete Mix and mix for two to three
             minutes. Note that this mix "wets" slowly. Do not add more water until the full
             mixing time has elapsed. Over-wetting will weaken the final mix. Place the
             material within 10 minutes after mixing. If temperature is above freezing, wet the
             substrate first. If below freezing, do not wet the substrate.
     A8.9.3.3. Finishing. Finish the material from the center of the bed to the edges to
     achieve proper bonding along the side walls of the excavation.
     A8.9.3.4. Curing. After initial set, when the surface becomes hard to the touch, fog- or
     spray-mist-cure with water for one hour. Do not add an excessive amount of water. Over-
     wetting will weaken the setting bed.
AFI32-1043 30 MARCH 2012                                                                       75


   A8.9.4. Leveling the Setting Bed. Mechanically vibrate or jitterbug the concrete before
   screeding to consolidate the mass. Even simple hand-tamping with a garden rake greatly
   reduces the percent of voids in the mix. Level the concrete to the proper depth in the setting
   bed using a notched screed board (Figure A8.4). Strike the screed periodically to ensure
   proper depth and uniform surface. The 39.7-millimeter (1.5625-inch) depth of the screed
   board is based upon a panel thickness of 38 millimeters (1.5 inches). Measure the actual
   thickness of each panel upon delivery to ensure they are all the same thickness and to
                                                                        Fig A8.3
   establish the required screed dimensions. The setting bed must be level and of the proper
   depth to correctly support the panels. A properly placed setting bed will help avoid a lot of
   aggravating manual labor. A setting bed that is not level or is placed at an improper depth
   requires excessive grinding of the pavement and/or shims, or may require grinding of the
   adjacent pavement surfaces. Shims should be used as a last resort, not planned into the job.
   When required, the shim stock should be a nonferrous metal and should be sized to provide
   full surface support for the panel, not just point support at the anchor locations.

   A8.9.5. Joints. Extend existing pavement joints through the setting bed by saw-cutting or
   using an expansion board. The saw cut should be a single blade-width and extend completely
   through the setting bed. Expansion boards must be set the full depth of the setting bed.
   A8.9.6. Install UHMW Panels. Install panels in accordance with the following:
      A8.9.6.1. Allow the setting bed to harden (approximately 4 hours, depending on the type
      bed used) to the minimum strength that allows drilling without spalling the concrete.
      A8.9.6.2. Lay the panels in place and inspect to ensure that the top surface of the panel is
      at least 1.6 millimeters (0.0625 inch) lower than the adjacent pavement surface. Grind the
      bedding material or panel edges as necessary so that the panel surface is slightly recessed
      (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters [0.0625 to 0.125 inch]) below the adjacent pavement surface.
      Panel height is especially critical in the center half of the runway.
      A8.9.6.3. Set spacing between panels using a 13-millimeter (0.5-inch) -thick board and
      secure all panels in place with wood wedges (minimum four sets per panel) to prevent
      panels shifting during drilling of anchor stud holes. UHMW panels contract and expand
      greatly with temperature changes. The panels should be placed and anchored at the
      medium temperature for the given location to allow for movement either way with
      temperature changes.

   A8.9.7. Install Panel Anchor Studs. (For a list of required tools and equipment, see Table
   A8.2.)
      A8.9.7.1. Drill Holes. Position the locally fabricated alignment tool (Figure A8.5) over
      each predrilled hole in the panel and drill 22-millimeter (0.875-inch) -diameter holes in
      the setting bed. Not all anchor studs are consistent in length as ordered, so check actual
                                                                      Fig A8.4
      anchor stud lengths and drill to accommodate the longest stud. The depth of the hole is
      critical—if it is not deep enough, the stud will protrude above the panel surface and
      require excessive grinding; if it is too deep, the adhesive capsule will be positioned below
      the stud and not provide adequate coverage. Use a drill-mounted depth gage rod or mark
      a position on the drill bit shaft the length of the stud plus the depth of the alignment tool
      to ensure proper hole depth when drilling.

      A8.9.7.2. Clean Drilled Holes. Thoroughly clean debris from the drilled hole with a
      round wire brush and compressed air. A 9- to 13-millimeter (0.375- to 0.5-inch) -
      diameter tube attached to the compressed air line is necessary to remove all fines from
      the holes. Insert tubing to the bottom of the hole to ensure all particles are removed.
      A8.9.7.3. Install Anchor Studs. Install each anchor stud as described below. To avoid
      work stoppage while the adhesive cures, have at least 12 cap nuts available for setting
      anchors.
          A8.9.7.3.1. Insert an adhesive capsule into each hole with the rounded end facing the
          bottom of the hole. Screw a cap nut (or other manufacturer-provided adapter) onto the
          end of the anchor bolt and attach the unit to a heavy-duty drill (or rotary impact
          hammer). Insert a flat washer onto the threaded stud just below the adapter, or
          position the washer over the panel hole inside the countersink. Drive the anchor stud
          slowly to the end of the hole and continue slowly rotating the stud in the hole for
          approximately 15 seconds to mix the adhesive and work it up the anchor. Once the
          anchor stud is in position, do not disturb it until the adhesive is cured. Allow the
          adhesive to cure (approximately one hour or as recommended by the manufacturer) to
          the point where the cap nut can be removed without disturbing the stud position.
          A8.9.7.3.2. Remove cap nut and flat washer; seal around stud with silicone sealant;
          reinsert flat washer; and attach lock washer and nut to top of anchor stud.
          A8.9.7.3.3. Allow adhesive to fully cure according to the manufacturer's instructions
          and then torque the nuts to 81 newton meters (N·m) (60 pound feet [lb ft]).

          A8.9.7.3.4. Grind off any portion of a stud that protrudes above the panel surface.
   A8.9.8. Installing New Cable Tie-down Anchors. The MAJCOM AAS engineer will
   prescribe the number and spacing of cable tie-down anchors required. Each cable tie-down
   anchor hole will be located in the center of the appropriate installed panel. When installing
   cable tie-downs, ensure the top of the tie-down is at least 5 millimeters (0.1875 inch)
   (recommend 13 millimeters [0.5 inch]) below the final panel surface height. Depending on
   the location of existing runway pavement joints in relation to the runway centerline and the
   longitudinal joint spacing, UHMW panels may be installed with a panel joint or panel center
   falling on the runway centerline. Figures A8.5 through A8.9 depict recommended cable
   anchor tie-down locations when installing standard full-sized and partial panels in various
   slab sizes. The partial panels are required to permit acceptable tie-down spacing and to avoid
   overlapping joints in the existing slabs. For installation in slabs sized other than those shown,
   consult the MAJCOM AAS engineer. Use eight-point tie-down configurations for F-16 and
   C-130 aircraft operations; use four-point configurations for all other aircraft operations.

A8.9.9. Sealing Joints.
       A8.9.9.1. Apply joint sealant in spacing between and around panel edges, recessed 6.35
       millimeters (0.25 inch) below the panel top surface. Joint sealants do not adhere well to
       UHMW panels and joints should be inspected frequently. Silicone sealants should be
       used in lieu of hot-pour asphalt or tar sealants. Silicone sealants are suitable for climates
       with wide temperature ranges and develop a low elastic modulus which allows good
       extension and compression recovery; this is important due to the contraction and
       expansion properties of the panels.
          A8.9.9.1.1. The size of the backer rod is also complicated due to the expansion
          properties of the panels. The spaces between panels should be noted while the panels
          are in their contracted state to prevent installing undersized backer rods that allow the
          sealant to flow underneath.
          A8.9.9.1.2. A non-shrinkable, non-absorbent, highly compressible foam backer rod
          should be used, sized to span the maximum expected gap but placed at the medium
          temperature and set at a depth to ensure a proper shape factor is created for the sealant
          reservoir.
       A8.9.9.2. Joints should be resealed just prior to onset of cold weather to prevent moisture
       accumulation and freezing below panels. Freezing below panels may result in panel
       failure, anchor failure, or excessive panel warping.

A8.10. Guidelines for Inspection. Installations should establish formal procedures to ensure
satisfactory performance of UHMW panels. UHMW panels should be inspected daily and
monthly for effects of aircraft traffic and thermal movement (expansion/contraction/warping) in
accordance with the following.
     A8.10.1. Daily Inspection. Panel inspection should be added to the daily arresting system
     inspection by power production personnel. Visually check for panel buckling, warping, and
     surface variations.
     A8.10.2. Weekly Inspection. Check for panel buckling, warping, and surface variations by
     placing a steel straightedge on top of each panel parallel to the runway centerline at:
        A8.10.2.1. Each joint between panels.
        A8.10.2.2. At least two locations within each panel.
        A8.10.2.3. Any other location that appears raised or irregular.
        A8.10.2.4. The straightedge must be long enough to overlap the pavement on each side
        of the panel by a minimum of 305 millimeters (12 inches). Immediately report raised
        edges or high spots exceeding 3.2 millimeters (0.125 inch) above the plane of the
        adjacent runway to the installation pavements engineer and to the MAJCOM AAS
        engineer for further evaluation. Take color photographs to document findings.
     A8.10.3. Monthly Inspection. The installation pavements engineer should participate once
     each month in the daily inspections with the power production personnel. Record all panel
     conditions, including (but not limited to):
        A8.10.3.1. Erosion/EPH.
        A8.10.3.2. Distresses.
        A8.10.3.3. Warping/curling.
        A8.10.3.4. Soundness.
        A8.10.3.5. Delamination.
        A8.10.3.6. Anchor stud effectiveness. Note that anchor stud nuts may be over-torqued if
        tightened repeatedly. Consider using a thread-locking or seizing compound such as
        Loctite® products on nuts that continually loosen. Report any significant deterioration or
        problem to the MAJCOM immediately for further evaluation.
        A8.10.3.7. Joint seal performance.
        A8.10.3.8. Spalling.

                        jackhammer and pick. (Hand-held hammer and steel chisel may also
                        be used.) Slot side walls cleaned with wire brushes. Slot cleaned and
                        dried with high-pressure air.
 25 Jun   2000–2230     Mixing and placing of setting bed begins. Both concrete mixers used.
                        Ten-person crew used. No bonding agent used or needed. Notched
                        board used to keep setting bed at the correct level below the
                        surrounding pavement surface.
 25 Jun   2030–2242     Curing compound applied periodically as the setting bed is placed.
 25 Jun   2242–2300     Cleanup accomplished and runway cleared. Approximately 90 bags of
                        mortar placed.
 26 Jun   0855–1030     Joints and cracks saw-cut through the mortar patches, both flush and
                        recessed patch areas. Hand-held portable saw used for recessed setting
                        bed cracks/joints and self-propelled pavement saw used for flush
                        patches.
 26 Jun   1015–1045     Panel placement begins. Panels positioned and tightly wedged into
                        place using wood spacers and wood shims (wedges). Panels as ordered
                        for the job have predrilled bolt holes.
 26 Jun   1050–1130     Drilling bolt holes begins. Three heavy-duty electric impact drills (two
                        Hilti HE72, one Milwaukee) used and work well. Three minutes
                        drilling time per hole required. Portable drill alignment tool used to
                        keep drill bit positioned vertically to start hole. Drill bits marked with
                        tape to control hole depth. Long slender tube inserted completely to
                        bottom of bolt holes delivers compressed air to thoroughly clean holes.
                        Recommended wire brushing of holes is not accomplished.

 Date     Times         Event Description
 26 Jun   1130–1345     Panel anchor studs set in position using electric drill with adapter
                        attachment. Anchor studs anchored into pavement with adhesive
                        capsule inserted before inserting anchor stud in hole. Installation of
                        anchors is delayed during first hour while new adapter is fabricated
                        locally for anchor installation. After first adapter is tried and proven,
                        two more adapters are fabricated. Anchor stud installation then
                        progresses rapidly with most anchor studs installed in last hour.
                        Applying oil on ends of studs aids adapter removal after stud
                        installation.
 26 Jun   1340–1400     Shims removed. Site cleaned with compressed air to remove all
                        particles before sealing around panels with joint sealant.
 26 Jun   1710–1730     Studs torqued to 81 N·m (60 lb ft) with torque wrenches. All studs
                        torqued adequately but several stud ends protrude above panel surface.
 26 Jun   1810–1820     High studs ground down flush with surface using a heavy-duty disc-
                        type electric grinder.
 26 Jun   1720–1820     Sealant applied to joints around panels using kettle with hot-applied,
                        single-component, non-jet-fuel-resistant sealant (SS-S-1401). Job
                        complete.
 26 Jun   1820–1830     Final inspection and job site cleanup completed.
