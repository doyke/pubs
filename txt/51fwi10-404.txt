regulations section has been revised to reflect changes to website addresses for publications
available digitally. All paragraph numbers have been rearranged due to the previous paragraph 1
has removed. Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information, has added and

1. General: All flying units operating out of Osan AB are subject to all applicable local flying
regulations.
2. Policy: All non ROK-based units flying aircraft or deploying ground forces to Osan AB that
intend to remain overnight, operate from, or use Osan AB facilities must have prior coordination
and approval from the Reception Working Group (RWG) in accordance with 51 FWI 10-402,
Reception Working Group. Transient units should obtain a copy of the RWG request worksheet
from their Osan AB host unit POC. Transient aircrew staying no more than one night will
request a Prior Permission Required (PPR) number through Airfield Management. Osan
squadrons planning to work with deployed units will provide a POC and function as the transient
unit’s host. In the event the visiting unit is not planning to conduct operations with Osan flying
squadrons, host functions will be provided by the incoming unit’s Osan liaison. For more
information or for urgent requests, contact the 51 LRS/LGRDX at DSN 784-8787.

      aircrew currency prior to flight. Aircrews will review the AIRADs, CHUM, and
      NOTAMs prior to flight. All flying units will establish a standardized Go/No-Go
      procedure with the items listed above, as a minimum. Units may add other items as
      necessary in compliance with command/service directives. Units will implement
      tracking procedures to ensure individual aircrew compliance. Deployed squadron

      signed off all Go/No-Go items.
      4.1.4. Scheduling:
          4.1.4.1. Deployed units will contact 51 OSS/OSCS (DSN 784-5700) who will
          coordinate for a scheduling POC from the host squadron. A unit scheduler will attend

      requests.
          4.2.2.1. Exceptions to PPRs include aircraft with DV-6 or higher grade on board,
          Aeromedical Evacuation (AIREVAC), scheduled AMC missions, and Republic of
          Korea Air Force (ROKAF) Uniform Charlie Missions.
             4.2.2.1.1. PPR numbers for other than fighter aircraft will be issued no more than
             5 days in advance. A 24-hour advance notice is required and aircrews will make
             their takeoff and land time (+/- 30 minutes). Fighter aircrews may request PPRs
             up to 7 days prior. All fighter requests not going through the RWG (except ROK
             Combat Cross Servicing) must obtain PPR approval from the 51 OG/CC.
          4.2.2.2. Priority for PPRs will be based on unit’s support of Wing flying training.
4                                                                  51FWI10-404 1 APRIL 2010


             4.2.2.2.1. Coordination for determining these priorities will be through 51
             OSS/OSCS (DSN 784-5700).
          4.2.2.3. PPR violations will be reported to the 51 FW/CC, or a designated
          representative, and may affect future PPRs being issued.
             4.2.2.3.1. When aircrews violate their PPR time, the aircraft commander will
             provide a written explanation of the incident using 51FW Form 30, FPNO/PPR
             Violation Statement. Airfield Management will forward the report through the
             Airfield Operations Flight Commander and 51 OG/CC to the 51 FW/CC.
          4.2.2.4. Airfield Management will contact Transient Alert (TA) to determine whether
          requested aircraft can be handled at the requested time before issuing a PPR. For F-
          16 aircraft only, if TA cannot support, Airfield Management will call the 36 FS Top-3
          (DSN 784-4430) to determine if they can support the request.
             4.2.2.4.1. If Transient Alert cannot support the request at the requested time, they
             will inform Airfield Management when they would be able to support the request.
             4.2.2.4.2. Transient Alert cannot turn aircraft for local sorties.
          4.2.2.5. When space is a consideration, the following agencies can be contacted by
