This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-326, Pre-
paring Official Communications, 1 November 1999. This supplement establishes procedures for pre-
paring communications in both manual and automated environments. It defines local procedures for
categorical addresses and written communication for all assigned and partner units at Hurlburt Field.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This supplement has been revised in its entirety and must be reviewed. This supplement has been
updated to reflect the new guidance within a reorganization of the 1st Special Operations Wing and
partner units at Hurlburt Field.
4.5. Memorandum for Record. Do not use letterhead stationary for Memorandum for Record.
4.5.1. (Added) Place the form or guide memorandum number in the lower left corner 1 inch from bottom
of page. If room does not permit, place in lower right corner.
4.11. (Added) Categorical Listings. Categorical addresses authorized on Hurlburt Field are listed at
Attachment 5 (Added). See Attachment 5 (Added) for further guidance on categorical addresses.
5.2. Form Memorandums. Two-letter staff activity chiefs determine at what level form or guide memo-
randums are numbered and controlled within their organizations. Format must conform to requirements of
AFMAN 33-326, Chapter 5.
6.1. General Information. Use SF Forms 65-B and 65-C, US Government Messenger Envelope, for
on-base and pouch distribution.
6.3. Addressing the Envelope. For overseas addresses, do not use the foreign locality, but use the appro-
priate unit number and APO/FPO designator followed by the Zip Code. Do not mix the foreign locality
with the APO/FPO address. Envelopes addressed to be mailed cannot be hand scribed.

7.5. TCC Responsibilities. Complete an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, for correspondence pre-
pared for 1 SOW Commander/Vice Commander's review, coordination, and signature. Staple staff sum-
mary sheet on top of the folder. Ensure the following coordination is affixed in the appropriate sequence:
Squadron Commander, Group Commander, 1 SOW/CCEA, 1 SOW/CCS, 1 SOW/CCE, 1 SOW/DS, 1
SOW/CV, and 1 SOW/CC. For enlisted matters, add 1 SOW/CCC. Place correspondence requiring coor-
dination or signature on the inside (right) of folder. Place background material on inside (left) of folder.
Ensure you mark commander’s signature space with a Post-It flags. Do not use "Executive Correspon-
dence" transparency cover sheets, except for award packages. Use of Optional Form 41, Routing and
Transmittal Slip, is also acceptable for information-only type correspondence.

                                    CATEGORICAL ADDRESSES
A5.1. (Added) General. A categorically addressed memorandum may be used in lieu of a multi-
ple-addressed memorandum when wide dissemination is desired. Such memorandums will not be used
when information is classified or should be issued as a standard publication.
A5.2. (Added) The following categorical addresses have been established for Hurlburt Field (see para-
graph A5.10. (Added)):

Table A5.1. (Added) Categorical addresses.

   NOTE: AFSOC & directorates/ partner units ONLY

A5.3. (Added) Distribution codes will not be combined.
A5.4. (Added) Use Distribution A only when absolutely necessary, i.e., for safety, policies, or proce-
dures that must be disseminated to the lowest level in each organization quickly. If information is of gen-
eral or routine nature, consider placing short-notices in the Hurlburt Field Official Bulletin, E-Mail, LAN,
or fax information channels, rather than in a categorically addressed memorandum.
A5.5. (Added) All categorically addressed correspondence will show the appropriate distribution code in
the "Memorandum For" element as shown in the following example:
A5.5.1. (Added) Memorandum for Distribution A.
A5.6. (Added) Correspondence dispatched via categorical address may indicate a functional area or addi-
tional duty directly after the distribution code. For example, DISTRIBUTION A (Security Managers);
DISTRIBUTION B (Records Managers); or DISTRIBUTION C (Information Management).
A5.7. (Added) Variations to distribution codes may include:
A5.7.1. (Added) When an activity needs to add additional addresses, not included in a distribution code,
the address line will reflect:
A5.7.1.1. (Added) Memorandum for Distribution B.
A5.7.1.2. (Added) Plus 605 TS.

A5.7.2. (Added) When an activity within a distribution code does not need the correspondence, the
address line will show:
A5.7.2.1. (Added) Memorandum for Distribution C.
A5.7.2.2. (Added) Minus staff agencies.
A5.8. (Added) If action or information copies are required for other units, use a "cc" notation at the close
of the memorandum. The originator is responsible for mailing these copies.
A5.9. (Added) Individuals preparing categorically addressed memorandums may:
A5.9.1. (Added) Post memorandum on the base local area network (LAN), using the bulletin board titled
“Base-Wide Bulletins”. OPRs are reminded that some units on base do not have LAN access and still
require a hard copy. Organizations affected are highlighted in paragraph A5.10. (Added) The OPR is
responsible to make the appropriate copies for these organizations and forward to 1 SOCS/SCBP for dis-
tribution.
A5.9.2. (Added) OPRs who desire hard copy distribution, must make the appropriate copies as shown in
Table A5.1. (Added), this supplement, and forward to 1 SOCS/SCBP for distribution. Note: Categorical
address users are reminded to date their memorandum for the day they expect the memorandum to reach
distribution, i.e., consider the review process, printing, and distribution time when dating correspondence
and assigning publishing suspense dates.
A5.10. (Added) Categorical addresses include only activities located on Hurlburt Field or serviced by the
Base Information Transfer Center. Distribution requirements are as follows:
