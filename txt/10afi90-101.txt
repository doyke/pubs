1. Definitions:
   1.1. RAV. A scheduled visit to a unit to conduct wartime readiness training and prepare the unit for
   a major command (MAJCOM) operational readiness inspection (ORI). The visit is not an inspection.
   Emphasis is on providing assistance and training vice formal evaluation of performance. RAVs may
   include only portions or phases of the overall ORI tasking and more than one unit. They identify
   problems, recommend solutions and provide assistance in the implementation of corrective/preven-
   tive actions. RAVs are administered according to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector Gen-
   eral Activities and applicable MAJCOM supplements, Air Force Special Operations Command
   Instruction (AFSOCI) 90-202, Inspector General Operational Readiness Inspection, and unit supple-
   ments/plans. (OPR: 10 AF Chief of Operations Plans Branch (10 AF/A5(XPO)))
   1.2. SAV. A scheduled visit to a unit to validate unit compliance with established program manage-
   ment directives. A SAV may be requested by a commander to render support in a specific area, to
   prepare the unit for a unit compliance inspection (UCI), Maintenance Standardization and Evaluation
   Program (MSEP) inspection or to provide an in-depth perspective of the health of the unit. The SAV
   team may review common core compliance areas (CCCA) identified in AFI 90-201, Air Force
   Reserve Command (AFRC) Supplement (Sup) 1, Inspector General Activities , and applicable
   self-inspection checklists. Although the primary purpose of a SAV is to validate unit compliance, the
   SAV team is not limited to just CCCA or checklist items. Within Maintenance, over-the-shoulder
   personnel evaluations and evaluator proficiency evaluations will be accomplished. (OPR: 10 AF/
   A5(XPO))
   1.3. DAV. A scheduled team visit to a unit to conduct deployment training and provide assistance
   during a deployment exercise. A DAV may be part of an operational readiness exercise (ORE) or
   annual exercise requirement according to AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. Deploy-
   ment processes are conducted according to AFI 10-403, AFI 90-201, AFI 90-201/AFRC Sup 1,
   AFSOCI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and local deployment guidance.
   1.4. FAV. A scheduled visit to a unit or functional area within a unit to satisfy a specific need or
   request. FAVs are tailored to the subject functional area. (OPR: Division Chiefs/Functional Areas)
   1.5. MSEP. A scheduled team visit usually done in conjunction with a unit SAV to validate wing/unit
   program(s) to ensure maintenance organizations comply with AF, MAJCOM and unit directives.
   (OPR: 10 AF Chief of Logistics (10 AF/A4))
   1.6. Unit. For the purpose of this instruction, unit is defined as any wing, group, squadron or flight
   assigned to 10 AF or 610 RSG.
   1.7. Gatekeeper. Single point of contact (POC) to monitor all requests for SAVs, RAVs, and DAVs.
   FAV requests are not required to be coordinated with the 10 AF gatekeeper. The 10 AF gatekeeper is
   assigned from 10 AF/A5.

2. Scheduling Policy:
   2.1. Assistance visits are scheduled when requested by the unit commander, 10 AF Commander (10
   AF/CC), or Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC).
   2.2. RAVs and DAVs are normally scheduled six to nine months prior to the ORI from the oversight
   MAJCOM. This allows sufficient time to correct any noted deficiencies prior to the unit inspection.
   SAVs do not have to be coupled with UCI timing and can be requested by a commander at any time.
4                                                                       10AFI90-101 17 JANUARY 2007


    SAVs requested in preparation for a UCI should be scheduled six to nine months prior to the UCI to
    allow time for corrective action.
    2.3. FAVs are normally scheduled after a request from a unit functional area to the Numbered Air
    Force (NAF) counterpart. FAV request approval authority is at the NAF functional area division
    level. The details of the visit are not required to be coordinated with the 10 AF gatekeeper.

3. Assistance Visit Objectives:
    3.1. Provides the 10 AF or 610 RSG commanders with a report on the operational readiness and man-
    agement effectiveness of their subordinate units.
    3.2. Identifies problem areas affecting the units’ mission readiness. Assistance visits concentrate on
    ensuring unit compliance with HQ AFRC and gaining major command (GMAJCOM) instructions and
    directives. During SAVs review the CCCAs identified in AFI 90-201, applicable MAJCOM supple-
    ments, and applicable self-inspection checklists.
    3.3. Validates unit specific resource deficiencies in manning, facilities, and funding as identified by
    the unit and commander.

remainder of the team composition depends on which functional areas require assistance and is deter-
mined jointly by the unit commander and the 10 AF Team Chief utilizing the 10 AF assistance visit team
composition matrix (Attachment 6). Functional areas may solicit field units for augmentees if unable to
support the request. If required, the assistance visit Team Chief coordinates with HQ AFRC/CVA for
SAV team augmentation for functions not available or which have limited availability at 10 AF. The
senior team member from the functional area requiring augmentation is responsible for the conduct of the
augmentee during the visit. Any assistance visit team may include the 10 AF/CC, chief of staff (10 AF/
CVA), or command chief master sergeant (10 AF/CCC).

     The request should include the type of assistance visit desired, unit functional areas requiring
     assistance, and desired dates of visit. If the request is for a RAV or DAV, the request should indi-
     cate whether or not the unit desires the 10 AF to develop the exercise scenarios and generate mes-
     sage traffic (i.e., EAMs, warning orders, execution orders, airflow, and related information).
     5.8.2. After the 180-day meeting/Initial Planning Conference (IPC) between the unit and the

     brief the 10 AF/CC and assistance visit team on the salient points of the RAV/ORI plan. The
     briefing should be scheduled NLT 60 days prior to visit. It is preferred that the team travel to 10
     AF, Naval Air Station (NAS) Joint Reserve Base (JRB) Fort Worth Texas, to conduct the briefing.
     This allows for face-to-face time with 10 AF counterparts and is more conducive to questions and
     answers. If travel is impractical, a video teleconference (VTC) may be used.
        5.8.2.1. The briefing should be based on the Base “X” Plan, with emphasis on key event tim-
        ing, modified “11-1 brief”, Status of Resource and Training Systems (SORTS) brief, a wiring
        diagram of the organizational structure, a map of the proposed play area, copies of approved or
