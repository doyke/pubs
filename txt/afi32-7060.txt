OPR: HQ USAF/CEVP (Mr Lee Schoenecker)                  Certified by: HQ USAF/CEV (Col Peter Walsh)
Supersedes AFR 19-9, 14 February 1986.                                                   Pages: 18

This instruction implements AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, by identifying requirements for Air
Force Interagency and Intergovernmental Coordination for Environmental Planning (IICEP). It also
implements Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 4165.61, Intergovernmental Coordination of DoD
Federal Development Programs and Activities, August 9, 1983, with Change 1; Executive Order (EO)
12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs; Title IV of the Intergovernmental Coordination
Act (ICA) of 1968; and Section 204 of the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of
1966.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is the initial publication of AFI 32-7060. It aligns with AFPD 32-70. This instruction streamlines
current IICEP written guidance. It identifies Federal-regional interagency and state intergovernmental
roles of the Air Force Regional Compliance Offices. It also identifies intergovernmental planning coordi-
nation at local and areawide levels as the major commands (MAJCOM) provide guidance to their bases.
                                                Chapter 1

                                HOW TO USE THIS INSTRUCTION

1.1. Background. The procedures in this instruction are essential to achieve compliance with all applica-
ble Federal, state, and local directives and instructions for IICEP. The responsibilities and procedures in
this instruction do not substitute or limit compliance with existing laws, executive orders, Federal regula-
tions, DoD, and Air Force directives or instructions.

1.2. Concept. This instruction provides MAJCOMs and installations with a framework to oversee the
Air Force environmental program according to AFPD 32-70. MAJCOMs provide additional implement-
ing guidance where pertinent in supplemental publication to the instruction. The MAJCOM supplement
must identify responsible offices and include implementing guidance to comply with this instruction.

1.3. Statutory and Regulatory Basis and Coverage:
   1.3.1. Section 401(b) of the ICA states that, "All viewpoints-national, regional, state, and local will be
   fully considered when planning Federal or federally assisted development programs and projects."
   1.3.2. EO 12372 implements the ICA and encourages states to set up advisory review procedures.
   Governors designate a single point of contact (SPOC) and each state develops its own intergovern-
   mental review procedures. DoD Directive 4165.61 implements EO 12372 within DoD.
   1.3.3. Environmental Compliance, Cleanup, Pollution Prevention, Natural Resources, and Cultural
   and Historical Resources Federal Interagency and Intergovernmental Programs laws and regulations
   generally fall under the following non-DoD Federal departments and agencies: The Department of
   Agriculture, The Department of Commerce, The Department of the Interior, The Department of
   Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
