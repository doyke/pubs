AFB units and tenant units on the responsibilities and procedures for self-help work.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision updates organizational responsibilities and procedures for the Self-Help Program to include
designation of the Support Group Deputy Commander as head of the awards’ selection team. Also,
deletes the facility manager’s photographic requirement for award nomination and changes the selection
of annual award winners from monetary recipients to the recipient of the Golden Hammer Award. The
supplement also changes the name of the Self-Help Center to Strike Eagle Hardware. A bar ( | ) indicates
revisions since last edition.
1.7.1. (Added) Strike Eagle Hardware.
1.7.1.1. General. As an integral part of the Self-Help Program, Strike Eagle Hardware is designed to
expedite materials for the accomplishment of minor maintenance and repair self-help work in contrast to
self-help projects larger in scope.
1.7.1.2. Authorized Customers. Squadron commanders, first sergeants, dormitory managers, building
custodians, alternate building custodians, and Military Family Housing occupants are authorized to obtain
materials and tools/equipment from the Strike Eagle Hardware. Each squadron will provide a current
squadron commander, first sergeant, and dormitory manager listing. CE Customer Service provides cur-
rent building custodian listing. The Military Family Housing occupant listing is provided by the Housing
Office. These listings are used to verify authorized customers. The Strike Eagle Hardware Manager will
not issue self-help materials to individuals other than those specifically authorized.
1.7.1.2.1. Military Family Housing occupants may be required to sign a Donor Statement letter depend-
ing on the type of work requested.
1.7.1.2.2. Quantity limits may be imposed on items due to availability or potential unauthorized use of
items.

1.7.1.2.3. Due to funding restraints, not all store items are available to both housing residents and build-
ing managers.

excluding holidays and wing exercises
1.7.1.3. Manning. Strike Eagle Hardware will be manned from CE sources during normal operations.
During heavy workload periods, e.g. spring and summer, additional personnel may be required. Normally
the requirement will be filled by Quality in Construction (QIC) team members if they are between job
phases or on job stoppage.
1.7.1.4. Type of Work Authorized.
1.7.1.4.1. Materials obtained off the shelf from Strike Eagle Hardware are for accomplishment of minor
maintenance and repair. Following is a small example of minor maintenance and repair items that may be
authorized:

will perform periodic spot checks to determine if materials issued to customers were used in the facility
indicated on the appropriate issue form. Suspected violations will be brought to the attention of their
Group Commander.
1.7.1.6. Safety. Maintenance and repair of air conditioning/heating, plumbing, fire protection, and electri-
cal systems are not normally authorized for self-help accomplishment. The Self-Help Planning Techni-
cian or representative, depending on the work to be performed, conducts safety briefings to customers.
The customer acknowledges the briefing by signing the confirmation of briefing form at the time materi-
als are issued.
