SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision includes office symbol changes, updates the responsibilities, nomination
procedures and clarifies the SMC SOS selection board process and procedures used to select
military personnel to attend SOS in-residence. Additional minor administrative corrections were
made and references updated.


3.10.5. (Added) The Space and Missile Systems Center Commander: Delegates the authority to
administer the SOS Central Selection Board (CSB) program to SMC/CV.

7.1.1. (Added) Eligible officers assigned to SMC and subordinate organizations will be selected
to attend SOS in-residence via a centralized selection board (CSB). The fundamental purpose of
the CSB is to select officers through a fair and competitive selection process for in-residence
attendance at SOS. A CSB is necessary because there are not enough quotas for 100%

professional qualifications of eligible officers as long as they discuss only matters permitted by
law, this supplement, or SMC/CV guidance and instructions

7.1.1.2.9. (Added) Using the Scoring Scale.

7.1.1.2.9.1. (Added) Board chairperson and members will use this scoring scale:

10.0                   Absolutely superior

9.0                    Few could be better
8.5                    Strong
8.0                    Slightly above average
7.5                    Average
7.0                    Slightly below average
6.5                    Well below average
6.0                    Lowest

7.1.1.2.10. (Added) Conducting Trial Runs. The board recorder provides board members with
pre-identified records to practice scoring and to illustrate situations the board may encounter
during the scoring process. The trial run records will not be actual records of officers being
considered by the board.

7.1.1.2.10.1. (Added) The board chairperson makes the determination if a second trial run is
needed.

“split” and may change scores to resolve the “split” or re-score the record. Normally board
AFI36-2301_SMCSUP 6 August 2012                                                                      7


members with split scores may change their scores in the process of resolving a split. If the split
is not resolved, the record is re-scored by the board. The board chair has the option of calling for
a total rescore of that individual record.

7.1.1.2.13. (Added) Establishing the “Cut Line.” The board recorder or administrative support
staff totals the scores for each record and lists the scores in an order of merit. The primary cut
line is determined by the number of seats allocated by HQ AFSPC for SOS classes under
consideration.

7.1.1.2.14. (Added) Identifying the “Gray.” “Gray” occurs when the preliminary “cut line” falls
between officers who have the same score.

7.1.1.2.15. (Added) Resolving the “Gray.” Board members re-score the records of all officers in
the “gray” until a preliminary “cut line” falls between officers having different scores. Board
members must make a good faith effort to resolve the “gray,” to include multiple attempts at
rescoring, before deferring to SMC/CV.

7.1.1.2.15.1. (Added) If the board cannot resolve the “gray”; SMC/CV will have full authority
to determine the final determination.

7.1.1.2.16. (Added) Establishing a Recommended List.

7.1.1.2.16.1. (Added) Officers above the “cut line” will comprise a tentative primary selectee
list.

7.1.1.2.16.2. (Added) Officers below the “cut line” will comprise a tentative alternate selectee
list. The number of officers designated as alternates will be dependent on the number of class
seats received. Normally this number will equate to the number of seats received x 75%.

7.1.1.2.16.3. (Added) Conduct an additional review of nominees in their last year of eligibility
to ensure accuracy of their original score.

7.1.1.2.16.4. (Added) SMC/CV is the final decision authority for the recommended list

7.1.1.2.17. (Added) Disclosing Board Recommendations.

7.1.1.2.17.1. (Added )Prior to signing of the board report, board participants may only disclose
board recommendations or proceedings to other board participants who have been designated in
writing by SMC/CV.

7.1.1.2.17.2. (Added) Public release of results will be determined by SMC/CV upon review of
the board report.

7.1.1.2.18. (Added) Preparing Board Reports. The board chairperson, with the recorders’
assistance, prepares a written report to the SMC/CV “Eyes Only” on its proceedings according to
 8                                                        AFI36-2301_SMCSUP 6 August 2012

MEMORANDUM FOR 61 FSS/FSDE


FROM: 61 SFS/CC
     483 N. Aviation Blvd., Ste 1467
     El Segundo, ca 90245

SUBJECT: FOUO - SOS Eligibility Waiver for Capt John J. Smith

1. Per AFI 36-2301, request a waiver to the 7 year TAFCS limit for member to attend
SOS.

2. Capt Smith was not afforded the opportunity to attend SOS in-residence due to a
recent assignment in the Middle East. There were not adequate facilities for him to
enroll in SOS by correspondence, or to begin his Master’s program. Capt Smith’s
accomplishments and focus at his previous assignment is clearly evident in both his
level of responsibility as a junior captain, and his award of the Meritorious Service
Medal upon tour completion.

3. It is imperative that Capt Smith be granted a waiver to attend SOS in-residence. His
window of opportunity is rapidly closing and he will be meeting the O-4 board next year.
I have no doubt he will benefit from the PME experience, and will share the knowledge
gained from this experience with his peers.

4. If you have any questions, please contact me at DSN 653-XXXX.

Commander, 61st Security Forces Squadron

NOTE: Ensure you address the following in your justification:

a. Why the member has not yet attended.

b. Why the AF should allow him/her to attend.

     Figure A11.4. Instructions for Filling out an SOS Nomination Form

     The following is additional guidance on how to prepare an SOS Nomination Form.
     The purposes of the SOS Nomination Form are to: (1) give the 2-Letter
     organization an important voice on the process, (2) capture accomplishments
     since the last OPR, and (3) find out the officer’s priorities for class dates. Please
     follow the instructions precisely so your people will be as competitive as possible
     when their records meet the selection Board. Note: Each bullet must not
     exceed one line in length.

     Bullet One

     This is arguably the most important bullet on the nomination form and should be
     treated as such. The format for the bullet is simple. Give the record a rank order
     out of the pool your unit is nominating. For example, if Captain Jones is your
     number one person and your unit is nominating five Captains then your
     nomination form will read something like Captain Jones is my number one of five
     from EA for this Board. The bullet should list the name of the member, his/her
     rank out of the pool, and the nominating unit. No more, no less.

     Current perception is that if you give someone a ranking below the top one or two
     positions it hurts the member’s record. Board feedback indicates this is not the
     case. The member’s record is the most important factor being considered. The
     nomination form provides additional information to the Board about the member.

     Bullet Two

     This is a mandatory bullet. The class order and preference will go here. If a
     member is eligible for a limited number of classes or can only go to one class
     due to mission constraints, please list here.

     Bullet Three

     State the percentage of completion by correspondence. (Ex.: Nominee has
     completed __________% of SOS by correspondence) based on the number of
     exams passed.


     Bullet Four through Six

     These are the real “meat and potatoes” of the nomination form. These bullets
     are to be used primarily to document accomplishments that occurred since the
     last OPR was written. You can also use these bullets as clarifying tools. If there
AFI36-2301_SMCSUP 6 August 2012                                                           17


       is an error in the record or a discrepancy, please use one of the bullets to clarify
       the issue and eliminate questions before they arise, e.g. percentage of Masters
       Degree completed. Remember, PME is critical to career development. The
       nomination form can be the deciding factor in whether or not your nominee
       attends SOS in residence.

       Do not use these bullets to include information concerning education. If you
       must, put information concerning education on the push note.

       Please be sure and use all bullets at your disposal. Leaving one out or the
       misuse of one will raise questions that you will not be able to defend since SOS
       Boards are closed proceedings. Use every available resource at your disposal to
       raise your nominee’s chance for selection.

       Also, bullet items should not duplicate information found elsewhere within
       the package (e.g. completed Education found in a SURF/RIP).

       Don’t forget to include your signature block and sign the supplemental sheet.
