SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This supplement was created to revise obsolete guidance and procedures outlined in previous
15th Air Base Wing and 15th Airlift Wing publications. It also consolidates the following
programs into one cohesive 15th Wing Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance document; Fuel
Systems Repair area of operations; Tool/Equipment Management procedures; Functional
Operations Check Flight, In-Flight Operational Check and High Speed Taxi check procedures;
Dropped Object prevention; Foreign Object damage; Handling, Storage, and Transportation of
Training/Explosives.
3.4.1.16. 15 MXG/QA will be the focal point for all functional, technical and QAE matters
pertaining to performance-based activities.
3.4.1.17. The PACAF RPoLE SharePoint will be the means for maintenance crosstell within the
15 MXG.
5.5.4.5. (Added) The open fuel tank repair areas are as follows: Aircraft Fuel Systems Repair
Facility (Bldg 2135/Hangar 19), Open Repair Area (Fuel Cell Charlie), KC-135 Fuel Shop (Bldg
3004).
5.5.4.6. (Added) The owning organization completes an applicable aircraft fuel configuration
sheet (configuration sheets will be provided by the Fuel Systems Repair Specialist).
5.5.4.7. (Added) All outside open fuel tank maintenance will stop when winds exceed 30 knots.
5.6.1.6. (Added) Non-flight line maintenance organizations, or off-base agencies requiring
temporary use of AGE will submit written justification (e-mail is acceptable) to the 15 MOC no
later than ten working days prior to event.
5.6.1.6.1. (Added) When a request is approved for off-base agencies the requesting agency will
send an appropriate transportation vehicle, and a qualified AGE operator to the AGE flight,
building 2030, hangar 15, to sign for the loaned equipment. The AF Form 1297, Temporary
Issue Receipt will be used to issue out equipment.
5.6.8. (Added) Aircraft jack trailers should be used to transport aircraft tripod/axle jacks long
distances to prevent wear and tear on wheel casters. When jacks are transported using a jack
trailer ensure that jacks are secured with tie down straps.
5.6.9. (Added) Universal Maintenance Stand (UMS)/Split Deck: will not be driven from
hangars/nose docks to aircraft parking area or vice versa. This is to prevent unnecessary wear
and tear, and damage to its drive train components. Contact 15 MOS/MOC or AGE drivers for
towing of universal maintenance stand.
5.6.10. (Added) User Responsibilities:
5.6.10.1. (Added) If any discrepancy is discovered contact 15 MOS/MOC or AGE flight. For
Non Powered AGE (NPAGE) also display the red streamer (located in forms bag) so it is visible
outside the unit.
5.6.10.2. (Added) Users are responsible for the pickup and delivery of NPAGE to and from the
appropriate sub-pool and from spot to spot (i.e., maintenance stands, aircraft jacks, trailers, LOX
carts, gaseous nitrogen carts, gaseous oxygen (GOX) carts, oil/hydraulic servicing carts, and
fuel/oil/hydraulic trailer tanks). Exception: The LOX carts will be towed by AGE drivers to the
AFI21-101_AMCSUP_15WGSUP 23 NOVEMBER 2011                                                       3

user will furnish fluids and service carts proper fluids.
5.6.11. (Added) Cryogenic Equipment. The electro-environmental shop (ELEN) will perform
applicable inspections and maintenance on cryogenic equipment and is responsible for all GO81
entries and the AFTO Form 244. Exception: Since AGE is responsible for the unit frame and
chassis, they will order parts and make GO81 entries for this associated area.
5.6.11.1. (Added) Cryogenic equipment status for LOX servicing carts will be monitored by
AGE on a daily basis. As a minimum, the daily status will include quantity levels, inspection due
dates, and current ready status.

deliver the empty carts to the cryogenics facility. Thereafter, the AGE driver will notify the 15
MOS/MOC to call the respective ramp expediter to provide fire guards at the LOX plant (Ref:
AFI 23-201, Para 2-8).
5.6.11.3. (Added) The AGE driver will pick-up and deliver cryogenic equipment to the ELEN
shop for scheduled inspections and repairs.
5.6.11.4. (Added) All LOX carts will have a current AFTO Form 134 at all times. All users will
be responsible for documenting product usage on the AFTO Forms 134. This documentation is
critical whereas, if not properly annotated with accurate usage, the LOX cart will not be accepted
for servicing at cryogenics facility. The 15 AMXS CTK Section maintains the form 134 for all
LOX carts.
5.6.11.5. (Added) The users will ensure the LOX carts are not depleted during servicing below
10 gallons to prevent purging the cart.
6.2.2.28.1. (Added) MOC will maintain CANN log and assign control numbers.
6.2.6.16.4.8.2. Manual JCNs will be assigned by MOC and are used only when deemed
necessary or when G081/ IMDS are unavailable. The section performing the work will be
responsible for generating an AF Form 349, and inputting G081/ IMDS information within 24
hours of system availability. Any conflicts or problems with the assignment of JCNs should be
brought to the attention of the DBM for resolution. 15 MOS Analysis Section will assign
manual JCNs and the manual JCN list will be maintained 15MOS Maintenance Operations
Center local website.
7.1.1. Automated History Equipment (AHE) from the applicable Maintenance Information
System (MIS) will be used in place of the manual AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data,
to document events on aircraft, engines, AGE, armament equipment, and their components. This

manager. Upon return from GRIP, chart “B”, Aircraft Weighing Record, will be verified, printed
and added to primary W&B handbook
8.19.1.5. Essential W&B data is available in the Primary W&B handbook located in the QA

an entry will be made in the 781As to reflect a red X condition. The write-up will state the
reason for removal and location of the handbook for example ―W&B handbook removed to QA
office for update‖. This discrepancy can be signed off by any red X qualified technician who has
physically verified the book has been placed back onto the aircraft. This discrepancy requires
only the corrective action and signature in the inspected by block, no corrected by signature is
needed.

Center (MOC) of FOD incidents. MOC will then notify Wing Safety.
14.19.7.1. (Added) Bird Strike to Engine Procedures.
14.19.7.1.1. (Added) Bird strike damage to engines is not chargeable as FOD, but must be
investigated to preclude the 15 WG from being charged with a FOD incident.
