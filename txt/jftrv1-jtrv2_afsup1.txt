1.3.2. (U4725-C) Improper Shipments. The TMO is responsible for determining and
documenting conditions that resulted in improper shipment of HHG or unavoidable separation of
the HHG from the member. If justifiable, TMO personnel must forward the shipment to a proper
destination.

1.4. (U4735) When Excess Charges Are Incurred. (See paragraph 2.7. and Chapter 11)

1.5. (U4745) PCS With TDY En Route. (See paragraph 3.2.2.)

1.6. (U4755) Indeterminate TDY. The agency providing the funding for the indeterminate
TDY may choose whether or not to authorize and/or approve shipments under this paragraph.
CRITERIA: For a member who’s PDS is outside CONUS, NOT LESS than 12 months must
remain in the member's OCONUS tour after the Required Delivery Date (RDD). For storage or
shipment under other circumstances, the TDY period must be 20 or more weeks at any one-duty
station.

1.7. (U4770) HHG Storage in Connection with TDY/Deployment.

1.7.1. (U4770-A) Temporary Storage. The TMO is designated to authorize/approve storage
under this paragraph.

1.7.2. (U4770-B2) TDY/Deployment for 90 or More Days/An Indefinite Period. A written
request for storage under this paragraph must be submitted to the TMO and include the
individual’s name and grade, anticipated duration of the TDY, Special Order Number, TDY
purpose, rationale for storage, and concurrence of the individual’s Squadron Commander.
                                                                                           7


1.7.2.1. The member’s unit’s O&M funds are to be used to effect storage under this paragraph.
Storage at government expense terminates not later than 90 days after TDY completion. A
member’s request for additional storage must have endorsement by the member’s Squadron
Commander. The TDY or deployment period need not be at just one location. However,
multiple TDY assignments or deployment for more than 90 days must be consecutive to qualify
for this storage.

                          HHG TRANSPORTATION AND NTS

2.1. (U5310) Basic Entitlement.

2.1.1 (U5310-A) General. When members exhaust their JFTR weight allowance, shipment of
additional weight at government expense or by government arrangement is PROHIBITED.
Members should protect their shipping entitlements for property in Non-temporary Storage
(NTS). Accordingly, the first shipment should be a request for continued NTS, temporary
storage at origin or shipment of the NTS lot.

2.1.2. (U5310-A3) Use of a Combination of Orders to Effect a Shipment from Prior or Previous
Duty Stations/Designated Locations. After issuance of a PCS order, entitlements under a prior
PCS order cease to the current permanent duty station, except as provided in JFTR, par. U5310-
A3. This procedure is often referred to as a chain-of-orders shipment. Such shipments are only
authorized from a former duty station or designated point to which previously shipped at
government expense. The appropriate shipping document must be annotated to show "Paying
Officer Review Requested."

Example:
Member is ordered from Beale AFB to Offutt AFB.
Member’s JFTR prescribed weight allowance under that order is: 12,000 lbs.
Member actually ships from Beale to Offutt: 7000 lbs.
Unused balance is: 5,000 lbs.
Member is subsequently ordered from Offutt AFB to Hanscom AFB, MA.
Μember’s JFTR prescribed weight allowance under that order is: 13,000 lbs.
Member may ship 13,000 lbs. to Hanscom AFB; 5,000 lbs. of that weight may be shipped from
Beale AFB to Hanscom AFB using a combination of the order to Offutt AFB and the order to
Hanscom AFB.

2.1.3. (U5310-B) Prescribed Weight Allowances.

2.1.3.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS):

2.1.3.1.1. Within the CONUS, full JFTR weight allowance is authorized.

2.1.3.1.2. To, From, and Between OCONUS Areas. HHG shipment weight allowances are
subject to Air Force administrative limitations (See paragraphs 2.2. and Attachments 1 and 2).

NOTE: Full JFTR weight allowance is authorized upon return from OCONUS for retiring or
separating members.

2.1.4. (U5310-C) Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E). (See Attachment 8)
                                                                                               9


2.1.4.1. See definition of PBP&E in JFTR, Appendix A. Non-temporary storage of PBP&E is
authorized when the PBP&E is not required at member’s next PDS.

2.1.4.2. During counseling, a member must be informed of the importance of declaring PBP&E.
Although members may indicate they do not exceed their HHG or unaccompanied baggage
weight allowance, it is incumbent upon the TMO to ensure compliance with the following:

2.1.4.2.1. If incomplete applications are received, shipment is not delayed provided the member's
desires are not questionable and shipments are otherwise authorized.

2.1.4.2.2. When a member or agent personally submits a DD Form 1299, Application for
Shipment and/or Storage of Personal Property, item 8 must either indicate the estimated
weight or have the word "NONE" entered and initialed. The member’s initials must appear on all
copies of the DD Form 1299. NOTE: Before the member initials "NONE," reemphasize that in
making such a declaration, later consideration for PBP&E is not given unless the member qualifies
for the “after-the-fact” approval identified below.

2.1.4.2.3. When a member declares PBP&E, this acts as certification that those items are
necessary in the performance of their official duties. Such items must meet the criteria of PBP&E
as defined in JFTR, Appendix A, and other provisions contained herein. Members are to be
counseled that the burden of proof, if challenged, rests with them.

2.1.4.2.4. PBP&E must be separately packed, marked, weighed and a clear description of articles
entered on the carrier’s HHG inventory prepared at the time of pickup. If it isn’t possible or
practical to weigh PBP&E at origin, the constructive weight of 40 pounds per cubic foot applies.
In either event, actual or constructive weights of each inventoried item must be entered on the
inventory.

2.1.4.2.5. After-the-Fact declaration of PBP&E can only be accepted when a review of the
member’s case file contains documented intent to declare PBP&E. Documented intent includes a
requirement the PBP&E was separately identified, marked, and inventoried during the move in
question. Refer questionable cases to the Director, JPPSO-SAT. When a member declares
PBP&E and the carrier fails to record and weigh the items, credit may be given if the TMO
documents the items and weight upon delivery. TMO can use actual weight or construct weight
of 40 pounds per cubic foot.

2.1.4.3. Military Affiliate Radio Station (MARS) Equipment:

2.1.4.3.1. To qualify for shipment or storage of MARS equipment at government expense,
members must present a completed MARS certificate. (See Attachment 4.)

2.1.4.3.2. When MARS members are transferred OCONUS where a MARS operation is
authorized, Non-temporary storage or shipment to other than new duty station is prohibited.
10


2.1.4.3.3. When MARS members are assigned OCONUS where individual MARS operation is
not authorized (See Attachment 5 and Personal Property Consignment Instruction Guide
(PPCIG)) shipment OCONUS or within CONUS is prohibited. Under these circumstances, the
member is authorized to store MARS equipment in Non-temporary storage for the duration of the
OCONUS tour.

2.1.4.3.4. Storage of MARS equipment incident to JFTR, pars. U5345-E, U5360, U5365, and
U5380-H is authorized.

2.1.4.4. Air Force Band Equipment:

2.1.4.4.1. To qualify band equipment as PBP&E, the member must provide a written statement,
signed by the local band commander, certifying such equipment is PBP&E. Following is a
suggested statement: “ I certify (member's name and rank) is a member of the Air Force Band
and possesses the appropriate AFSC. I further certify the band equipment to be (shipped)
(stored) as professional equipment is necessary in the performance of official duties."

2.1.4.4.2. Pianos and organs may qualify as PBP&E. The local band commander must also add
the following remark in the written statement for such items to be shipped as PBP&E: "Member
is an arranger, piano or organ player, or both."

2.1.4.4.3. Personal stereo equipment and records or tapes are not PBP&E.

2.1.4.5. Air Force Personnel Assigned to the Defense Attaché System. Subject members,
required by their position to socially entertain on a regular basis, may designate “representational
items” such as china, crystal, and silverware purchased for that purpose, as PBP&E. China,
crystal, and silverware is not authorized for shipment as PBP&E for members assigned to Defense
Attaché posts where the quarters are furnished with these items. Entitlement applies both to and
from the OCONUS duty station where these items were required in the performance of duty.
SAF/IA (AFAAO), Air Force Attaché Affairs, is the approval authority for designating
representational items as PBP&E. Members making subsequent permanent change of station
moves to other than attaché duties may no longer declare these items as PBP&E.

2.1.4.6. (U5310-D) Additional Consumable Goods. See paragraph 9.2 for description and
Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part IV, Chapter 413, for weighing and GBL
preparation provision pertaining to shipment of these goods. NOTE: The use of extra pickup
provisions to pick up these goods directly from base commissaries or commercial grocery stores
is permitted.

2.1.4.7. (U5310-F) Excess Costs for Transportation of Boats as HHG. A weight additive from
the applicable tariff is applied to Non-temporary storage shipments that contain boats with or
without trailers.
                                                                                                 11


Example:

Member’s JFTR Weight Allowance is 12,500 pounds
HHG weight 7,200 pounds, minus 10 percent packing allowance (720 pounds) equals     6,480 pounds
Boat (18-ft) and Trailer (22-ft) (no packing allowance authorized)                  2,500 pounds
Weight Additive*                                                                    3,720 pounds
Total weight                                                                        12,700 pounds

1. Authorized cost for 12,500 pounds NTS
   Packing ($10.00 cwt), drayage ($8.50 cwt), handling-in ($1.00 cwt),
       handling-out ($0.85 cwt) equals $20.35 times 12,500                  $2,543.75
       Storage $1.00 cwt times 12,500 pounds equals $125.00 per month
          times 12 months                                                   $1,500.00
   Total authorized cost                                                    $4,043.75

2. Actual cost for NTS
   Packing ($10.00 cwt, drayage ($8.50 cwt), handling-in ($1.00 cwt),
        handling-out ($0.85 cwt) equals $20.35 cwt times 12,700 pounds      $2,584.45
   Storage ($1.00 cwt) times 12,700 pounds equals $127.00 cwt per month
        times 12 months                                                     $1,524.00
   Total actual cost                                                        $4,108.45

3. Excess Cost                                                              $     64.70

*Review applicable tariff for current weight additives).

2.1.4.8. (U5310-I) Services. Services provided for shipment or storage of such items is limited
to those provided under carrier’s tariffs or contractual provisions. Nothing in the law (Title 37,
United States Code) or implementing directives provides that the government furnishes
extraordinary or special services when shipping expensive and valuable items. If a member
requests exceptional packing and crating services, the member is responsible for all costs for those
services.

2.1.4.9. (U5310-J) Transportation of Replacement HHG Items.               The Traffic Management
Officer is the approval authority for this provision.

2.2. (U5315) Administrative Weight Limitations: (See Attachment 1 and 2.)

2.2.1. (U5315-A) General:

2.2.1.1. Unaccompanied members assigned to, from, and between OCONUS areas (including
Alaska and Hawaii) are limited to HHG weight allowances in Attachment 3, Table A3.1.

2.2.1.2. Restricted weight areas for accompanied members assigned to, from, and between
OCONUS areas are listed in Attachment 1. Exceptions to the administrative weight limitations
are listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.1.
12


2.2.2. (U5315-C) Exceptions. Exceptions in Attachment 2, Table A2.1 and A2.2 may apply.
The Military Personnel Flight (MPF) annotates the authorized weight exceptions in member’s
special order.

2.3. (U5318) Re-Transportation of the Same HHG:

2.3.1. Member’s Convenience. Reshipment of the same property on one PCS order is not
authorized at government expense. “Reshipment” means to ship again or start anew. This type of
action would require the issuance of a new GBL or other movement document. Reshipment of
the TDY weight allowance from TDY location to TDY location to new PDS is authorized.

2.3.1.1. Delivery from storage is not synonymous with the term reshipment. A long delivery
from storage (Storage In Transit (SIT) or Non-Temporary Storage (NTS)) can be made to an
alternate or different destination for the member’s convenience. The member must agree to be
financially responsible for the excess cost for the distance exceeding delivery within the
commander’s authorized local (delivery) area (See paragraph 9.3). This applies to a member who
selects a city to live in, has their HHG shipped to that city and then decides to move more than
30/50 miles from that city. Because of limitations in the Domestic/International tariffs, the
member might have to pay excess cost. The origin TMO should counsel the member to not ship
their HHG to an address if the member is uncertain of the final destination, but rather to place the
HHG in storage at origin.

2.3.1.2. DD Form 619-1, Statement of Accessorial Services Performed (SIT Delivery and
Reweigh), or other contractual document must be annotated to reflect that the member is in an
‘excess cost status’. Copy of Delivery from SIT Certificate, DD Form 619-1, or other contractual
document are to be forwarded to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF, 613 Northwest Loop 410, Suite 400, San
Antonio, Texas 78216-5518, for review and action. Members not in a pay status (i.e.,
separatees) must have the excess costs paid in advance of delivery.

2.3.2. Other Reasons. (See paragraph 2.5.2.)

2.4. (U5320) Methods of Transportation.

2.4.1. (U5320-A) HHG:

2.4.1.1. CONUS: Shipment is by surface modes.

2.4.1.2. OCONUS: Normally, shipment is made by a surface mode except to and from “Hardlift
areas” (Attachment 6), Transportation Priority 4 (TP-4) areas, or when authorized or approved
under the provisions of paragraph 10.6. Shipments to Hardlift areas, TP-4 areas, and those
approved for airlift are always to be moved with preference given to AMC.

NOTE: (1) Space required airlift of HHG including airlift to “Hardlift areas” is not authorized for
retirees or separatees. (2) There is no TP-4 capability for inter-theater shipments (i.e., EUCOM
to PACOM); however, TP-2 is available (reference paragraph 11.2.4.)
                                                                                             13




2.4.2. (U5320-B) Unaccompanied Baggage.

2.4.2.1. Shipment Procedures: Unaccompanied baggage is to be shipped to arrive at destination
within 5 days of the member’s or dependent’s arrival. Shipment of UB is authorized to any duty
station worldwide.

2.4.2.3. Between Points within CONUS: Normally, UB is included with the HHG if the transit
time satisfies the member’s needs. HHG shipped in this manner is identified to the carrier as
“designated items for extra pickup or delivery.” One GBL is issued and annotated “Extra Pick Up
and/or Extra Delivery Authorized.” The carrier must inventory, load and store designated items
to permit ready access at destination. Expedited mode (for the JFTR-limited amount of UB) may
be used when the transit time of the HHG shipment does not meet the required delivery date for
UB. This also applies when the only shipment is UB. (See paragraph 5.1.4.)

2.4.2.4. To, From, or Between Points OCONUS: See the PPCIG for routing/mode. Separate
shipments of UB to, from, and between Hardlift areas are not authorized for dependents or
members when concurrent travel of dependents is authorized. Separate shipment is authorized
when required due to host country restrictions. Consult PPCIG, Volume 2 (Overseas).

2.4.2.5. Movement of more than 1,000 pounds UB by expedited mode (i.e., commercial
air/AMC) is not authorized unless commercial air is the only mode directed by the PPCIG.

NOTE: Any part of UB allowance not used may be included with the HHG shipment for
administrative weight restricted areas.

2.4.3. (U5320-D) Personally Procured Transportation & NTS. (See Attachment 14)

2.5. (U5330) Factors Affecting HHG Transportation.

2.5.1. (U5330-A) Combining Weight Allowances When Husband and Wife are Both Members.
In military member married to another military member couples, neither can be counted as being a
dependent of the other to increase any allowance (including HHG weight). If no other dependent
exists, both are members without dependents in determining weight allowance except as
prescribed in footnote 5 of the table in JFTR, par. U5310-A.

2.5.1.2. When both members are assigned to or from an OCONUS duty station unaccompanied,
they each are limited to the unaccompanied member weight allowance.

2.5.1.3. When both members are assigned to or from a weight restricted OCONUS duty station
accompanied (See Attachment 1), either member may ship HHG. The weight shipped must be
within the total weight prescribed for the higher-ranking member (See JFTR, par. U5315-B.) for
the OCONUS station. The combined weight allowance may be divided between the two members
provided neither exceeds the weight allowance prescribed for their grade. Any shipment
exceeding the authorized weight is subject to excess cost.
14




2.5.1.4. Military member married to a civilian employee. The civilian employee, if under a PCS
order, is authorized appropriate JTR entitlements. The member may also be authorized HHG
shipment under a PCS order. Both persons cannot be paid for the same expenses.

2.5.2. (U5330-D) Improper Transportation. The TMO is assigned responsibility for determining
and documenting conditions which result in improper shipment (property erroneously shipped at
no fault of the member) or unavoidable separation of the property from the member. If justifiable,
TMO personnel must forward the shipment to the proper destination and provide a copy of the
shipment justification to JPPSO-SAT ECAF. (See paragraph 2.3. and JFTR, par. U5318.)

2.5.3. (U5330-E) Items of Extraordinary Value. (See DTR, Part IV, Chapter 401, Paragraph
D.)

2.5.3.1. Members contemplating shipment of expensive and valuable items must be counseled:

2.5.3.1.1. If these maximum amounts would provide inadequate reimbursement, members should
obtain commercial insurance or increased release valuation coverage.

2.5.3.1.2. Increased valuation coverage is NOT available on OCONUS shipments and property
placed into NTS through government arrangement.

2.5.3.1.3. Split shipment for the purpose of reducing the cost of increased valuation or
commercial insurance is allowed subject to excess transportation cost.

2.5.3.1.4. Members should hand-carry valuable items such as expensive jewelry, watches,
cameras, and other valuable items susceptible to pilferage. Claims for this type of property are
evaluated strictly, and if approved for payment, payable sums are limited.

2.5.3.1.5. The burden is upon the member to substantiate loss and to establish the value of the
lost items. Thus, members should retain bills, receipts, appraisals, etc., separate from their stored
or shipped property.

2.5.3.1.6. The Government does NOT provide insurance for HHG shipments. What is provided
is the opportunity for members to submit claims for lost or damaged property at the depreciated
value of their lost or damaged items.

2.5.3.2. Supplemental Protection. The maximum non-insurance amount to be paid by the
government on claims that arise as the result of a single incident is limited to $40,000 (based on
the weight of shipment). Each member should compare the value of the items included in the
shipment with the maximum payable individual item’s limitations shown in AFJPAM 24-226, It’s
Your Move (contact the local Claims Office for an up to date listing and maximum amounts).
This publication can be located at http://www.mtmc.army.mil/. The member should then decide
whether or not it is advisable to obtain insurance protection for these items. The government
would protect the remaining HHG in the shipment up to $40,000 in depreciated value. Listed
                                                                                                 15


below is general information concerning insurance protection. Such protection may be obtained
in the following ways:

2.5.3.2.1. Commercial trip transit insurance may be obtained from an insurance company directly
or through a HHG carrier. Trip transit insurance is expensive and ordinarily must be obtained for
the full value of the property.

2.5.3.2.2. Protection may be obtained on domestic shipment by requesting increased valuation
coverage. The GBL and DD Form 1299 must be marked in accordance with DTR, Part IV. Full
replacement protection of a member’s HHG can also be obtained on the GBL. The member must
request these types of coverage in writing from the TMO. (See Attachment 10)

2.5.3.2.3. Certain other types of commercial insurance are available to provide extra protection
for property during shipment or storage. Ordinary personal property insurance, while less
expensive than some other types, covers only certain named risks. All-risk insurance for
specifically scheduled items is available at higher cost. Normally, these policies cover other types
of losses in addition to transportation and storage and are considered to be permanent insurance.
To consider additional insurance, the terms of the policy should be carefully studied. Members
should be aware of the perils covered and co-insurance clause.

2.5.4. (U5330-F5) HHG Removed from Mobile Home to Meet Safety Requirements. A
commercial carrier may determine that the mobile home is not safe for movement (e.g., if the
manufacturer’s recommended gross weight is exceeded). If the recommended gross weight is
unknown, estimate an allowance NTE 3 pounds per square foot of unused floor space for
personal effects. EXAMPLE: A maximum personal effects load of 216 pounds (72 square feet
times 3 pounds) would be acceptable for a mobile home with an unused open floor area of 6 feet
by 12 feet.

2.5.4.1. If the mobile home exceeds the manufacturers recommended gross weight, advise the
member to reduce the gross load. The member can do this by shipping excess items separately or
by disposing of them by other means.

3.5.4.2. Additionally, excess items should be removed upon the recommendation of the
commercial carrier when based on the condition of the mobile home. The member must provide
the TMO with a written copy of the carrier’s assessment when applying for HHG shipment under
this paragraph.

2.5.5. (U5330-G1) General. TMO personnel must retain the member's written agreement to be
financially responsible for the shipment as well as the “Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order” and establish a
suspense file of 60 days to ensure the TMO receives orders. If the TMO does not receive the
order within 60 days, the TMO inquires with the MPF. If an order has not and will not be issued,
the TMO initiates billing action (DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization) against the
member.
16


2.5.5.1. A member pending discharge because of non-judicial punishment or court-martial is not
authorized to use a “Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order”.

2.5.5.2. A member who moves HHG at personal expense prior to the issuance of an order or a
“Letter-in-Lieu-of-Order” is not entitled to reimbursement.

2.6. (U5335) Determining the Net Weight. (See Attachment 7)

2.6.1. (U5335-F) Exceptions.

2.6.1.1. In any case where the outer container is the member's "personal" property, no packing
adjustment is authorized.

2.6.1.2. The Traffic Management Officer (TMO) is designated to approve a change of the net
weight of shipments. This is allowed only when a shipment is completely unpacked and weight of
packing materials is verified. The actual weight of the packing materials is then subtracted from
the carrier/contractor's net weight.

NOTE: A packing allowance as prescribed in Attachment 7 is not authorized after weighing in
this manner.

2.7. (U5340) Excess Charges. (See Chapter 11 for Responsibilities and Procedures)

2.7.1. (U5340-A2) NTS.

2.7.1.1. Charges for excess HHG weight in Government NTS facilities are paid by the
government and charged to the member. Charges include preparation, drayage, handling, and
storage. TMOs are not to bill members unless advised by JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

2.7.1.2. Excess HHG Weight in Commercial Non-temporary Storage (NTS) Facilities. When
excess weight situations become known, TMOs should not convert the overweight portion of
these lots to the member's account unless advised to do so by JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

2.7.1.3. JPPSO-SAT/ECAF determines which shipment (HHG, NTS, UB, etc.) the excess weight
and costs are attributable. When computation of excess weight on NTS shipments result in the
least excess cost to the member and the member requested on the DD Form 1299 that the
government to pay the excess costs, JPPSO-SAT/ECAF sends the member a letter offering two
payment options. A copy of this letter is provided to the TMO. The member may (1)
immediately pay all storage costs (based on the tour length reflected on the special order) for the
excess weight stored, or (2) defer payment of the excess costs until the lot is withdrawn from
NTS. Considering the members selection, JPPSO-SAT/ECAF (1) issues a DD Form 139 and
subsequently provides a corrected DD Form 139 if the actual storage time frame differs from the
anticipated tour length, or (2) provides a DD Form 139 once the property is removed from NTS
or remains in NTS under a new special order.
                                                                                              17


2.7.1.4. TMO responsibilities at the time of counseling are to annotate the DD Form 1299 for
NTS with the statement "In the event that I incur excess weight on my NTS lot, I request the US
Government pay the excess costs subject to reimbursement by me." The member must initial this
statement on the DD Form 1299. The TMO also provides copies of the member’s NTS
documentation (DD Form 1164, Service Order For Personal Property, DD Form 1299, special
order, weight tickets, etc.) when requested by JPPSO-SAT/ECAF and file a copy of JPPSO-
SAT/ECAF’s letter in the member’s NTS folder. When the lot is removed from NTS, the TMO
notifies JPPSO-SAT/ECAF and provides copies of the new line-haul or local drayage weight
tickets.

2.7.1.5. The above procedures result in lower excess cost payment for affected members because
they pay the lower government storage rate rather than the higher commercial storage rate.

2.7.2. (U5340-B) HHG Transportation in Excess of Authorized Weight Allowance. Excess cost
includes accessorial preparation, drayage, warehouse handling, storage, line haul, port handling,
and MSC or AMC charge (if applicable). If AMC airlift is a factor, stress that the cube rule must
be used to determine AMC charges. TP4 cargo charges are assessed on a cube basis per U.S.
Government Department of Defense Airlift Rates. To facilitate computation of cash charges for
overweight household good shipments, TP-4 household good rates are quoted in dollars per
hundredweight. The density factor to be used for calculating TP-4 (HHG) is 7.0 pounds per cubic
foot. However, the member’s proportionate share of the excess costs is always based upon the
carrier-recorded shipment weight.

2.7.3. (U5340-C) HHG Transportation Other Than Between Authorized Locations. Members
contemplating shipment of HHG other than between authorized locations should always be
advised of possible excess cost. Excess costs may occur even if the distance is LESS than the
distance between authorized locations.

2.7.4. (U5340-D) Transportation of Unauthorized Articles.         The member pays for all the
expenses between any locations for unauthorized articles.

2.7.5. (U5340-E) HHG Transportation with Special Routing or Services Provided.

2.7.5.1. Higher Cost Mode Specifically Requested by Member. Excess cost is the difference
between the mode selected by the TMO and the mode requested by the member.

2.7.5.2. Special Services. Special services not provided under normal rates can be requested by
and furnished to the member. These include premium packing and crating not otherwise required
by a carrier to protect an item. The excess cost includes the cost of the special services.

2.7.5.3. Shipment in Separate Lots Between the Same Points. A member is authorized to ship
one lot of HHG between the authorized points. Excess cost is incurred when the actual cost of
multiple shipments exceeds the authorized cost for a single shipment.
18


2.7.5.3.1. An exception is made for payment at government expense of a single extra pickup
and/or single extra delivery. Those services are not special routing or services.

2.7.5.3.2. The member may request final shipment of the property legally awarded to an ex-
spouse incident to a divorce. The decision on whether or not to use the PCS entitlement for this
purpose rests solely with the member. The shipment is authorized on the current order provided
the property was not previously shipped on that order and a shipping entitlement still exists.
Otherwise, the member must be in possession of a new PCS order before property may be
shipped.

2.7.5.4. Higher Released Valuation. A member may request a higher released valuation than
normally provided in the carrier tariff. Excess cost is the difference between the actual cost and
the normal cost under the basic released valuation. (See Attachment 10 and the DTR Part IV,
Chapter 401, Paragraph D.2.g.2.)

2.7.5.5. The TMO annotates the GBL to reflect the special service requested by the member and
checks the paying officer review block.

NOTE: When Transportation Operational Personal Property Standard System (TOPS) does not
permit applicable data entry, enter manually.

2.8. (U5385) Advance of Funds. The government travel card may be used to procure supplies
and services associated with personally procured HHG shipments and mobile home moves. All
members are strongly encouraged to obtain an estimate of the cost they are to be reimbursed by
the Government before utilizing the card for personally procured HHG and mobile home
shipments. Guidance in this paragraph does not preclude limitations and conditions. (AFI 65-104
Government Travel Charge Card. If in doubt refer member to FSO.)
                                                                                              19


                              Chapter 3
           TRANSPORTATION UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF PCS ORDERS

3.1. (U5012) PCS Allowances General.

3.1.1 (U5012-I) Travel & Transportation Allowances Extensions When a Member Separates
from the Service. (See paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6).

3.2. (U5345) Transportation Under Various Types of PCS Orders.

3.2.1. (U5345-B5) Commissioned from Service Academies. Property transported to the
individual’s home from the Academy may NOT be transported to the first PDS on the same PCS
order.

3.2.2. (U5345-C) PCS with TDY En Route, PCS While on TDY, or PCS Following TDY
Pending Further Assignment:

3.2.2.1. TDY shipment should be charged to the TDY fund cite listed on the order. PCS open
allotment fund cite is used to move property from TDY location to final PCS location.

3.2.2.2. Encourage the member to always exercise the entitlement to NTS for the TDY period.
This reduces the possibility for excess costs. It also provides the member with temporary storage
entitlement at the new PDS upon completion of the TDY.

3.2.3. (U5345-G2) Ordered from OCONUS PDS. Members returning for separation processing
may use the AF Form 899 (PCS Order) to:

3.2.3.1. Place property in NTS.

3.2.3.2. Ship unaccompanied baggage or HHG DIRECTLY to a location in the CONUS.

3.2.3.3. Destination may be beyond the processing station, ONLY if the AF Form 899 contains
the "home of record" or "place of entry into the service" or “place last entered on active duty."
(It must also include the point to which such travel is intended.) Shipments exceeding the
authorized weight or distance are subject to the advance collection procedures in Chapter 11
JFTR, par. U5340-E. The member must furnish a city and state for a delivery.

3.2.3.4. Shipment from Non-temporary storage is NOT authorized until the final separation order
(AF Form 100) is issued.

3.3. (U5350) Transportation Under PCS Orders To or From Sea Duty or OCONUS Duty.

3.3.1. (U5350-A1) Ordered to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG Transportation Is Permitted.
The member may elect to ship HHG to a designated location or place the HHG into NTS. No
further shipment at government expense, of the same property, is authorized until a new PCS
20


order is issued. Upon subsequent PCS to another duty station outside CONUS, reshipment from
the designated location or Non-temporary storage to the new consecutive OCONUS tour (COT)
PDS requires prior approval.          The Transportation Squadron Commander, Chief of
Transportation, JPPSO Director or equivalent agency official at the member’s PDS is designated
to authorize and/or approve these shipments. This authority is limited to individual HHG items
the member elected not to ship to the initial OCONUS location then discovered they were needed
at the new OCONUS location due to changing conditions. (i.e., transfer from hot to cold climate
installations.) See JFTR, par. U5317, item 7, for time limitations.

3.3.1.1. (U5350-A2) Ordered to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG Transportation Is to Be
Authorized within 20 Weeks of Member’s Port Reporting Month. HHG shipments may be sent
directly to the OCONUS permanent duty station when authorized/approved by HQ USAF/ILGT
via MAJCOM. Criteria for approval includes:

3.3.1.1.1. The member’s acceptable written justification,

3.3.1.1.2. Copy of the member’s PCS order and

3.3.1.1.3. The TMO’s cost of storage, and transit time.

3.3.1.2. (U5350-A3) Ordered to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG Transportation Will Not Be
Authorized Until 20 or More Weeks After the Member’s Port Reporting Month. Use of this
entitlement is tied directly to the designation in Block 13 of the AF Form 899 unless otherwise
specified in the PPCIG.

3.3.2. (U5350-C) Ordered from a CONUS PDS to an OCONUS PDS to Which HHG
Transportation Is Prohibited or Restricted, to Unusually Arduous Sea Duty, or Duty Under
Unusual Circumstances. If dependent travel is not involved, MAJCOM commanders are
designated to authorize and/or approve shipments. This authority may be redelegated to MPFs.
APPROVAL CRITERIA: Because Non-temporary storage is authorized at government
expense in lieu of shipment (JFTR, par. U5380-C), shipment to a designated location OCONUS
should not be authorized when dependent travel is not applicable unless the HHG are intended for
use at the OCONUS destination by dependents as defined in JFTR, Appendix A who are already
located at that point; or the member states in writing the intention to establish a residence at that
place upon separation or retirement after completion of the current OCONUS tour of duty (See
JFTR, par. U5365).

3.3.2.1. Single members and members serving an "ALL OTHERS" (dependents not authorized)
tour are limited to the applicable unaccompanied baggage allowance. These allowances are
shown in Attachment 3, Table A3.1, and applicable notes. Exceptions to these weight allowances
are listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.2.

3.3.2.2. To participate in both the "Follow-on" and "Home Basing" assignment programs,
members agree to certain conditions. The conditions include voluntary member decisions on
shipment and storage of HHG, a POV, and movement of dependents at Government expense.
                                                                                           21


CAUTION: A member participating in either program may still exercise the JFTR entitlements to
ship and store HHG. TMO notifies the local MPF in writing of the member’s election.
Questions on whether a particular action impacts the follow-on assignment should be resolved
between the member and the MPF.

3.3.2.2.1. An order to a restricted or remote assignment may identify the follow-on location.
This order is not the authority for movement of HHG to the OCONUS follow-on points. An
order specifically authorizing shipment to the OCONUS follow-on location is required. The
PPCIG must be carefully checked on HHG shipments to OCONUS locations for unaccompanied
dependents. EXCEPTIONS to utilize PCS entitlements and receive advance assignment
consideration are:

3.3.2.2.2. Relocation of dependents and/or HHG is authorized to the follow-on location ONLY.
NOTE: HHG should not be shipped to the follow-on location at government expense unless the
member or the member’s agent can accept HHG delivery upon HHG arrival at the follow-on
location. A period of SIT not to exceed 90 days may be authorized.

3.3.2.2.3. Single members, single member parents, or either spouse of a member-married-to-
member couple, who are to serve concurrent, but separate, unaccompanied short tours, can store
HHG at government expense.

3.3.2.2.4. If denied continued occupancy of government owned or controlled quarters,
dependents and HHG may be moved (local move only) as prescribed by JFTR, par. U5355-C.

3.3.3. (U5350-D/second item 3). Ordered from an OCONUS PDS to an OCONUS PDS to
Which HHG Transportation Is Prohibited or Restricted, or Duty Under Unusual Circumstances.
If dependent travel is not involved, MAJCOM commanders are designated to authorize/approve
shipments. This authority may be redelegated to MPFs.

3.3.3.1. APPROVAL CRITERIA: Because Non-temporary storage is authorized at
government expense in lieu of shipment (JFTR, par. U5380-C), shipment to a designated location
OCONUS should not be authorized when dependent travel is not applicable unless:

3.3.3.2. HHG must be intended for use at the OCONUS destination by bona fide dependents who
are already located at the point; or the member states in writing the intention to establish a
residence at that place upon separation or retirement after completion of the current OCONUS
tour of duty (See JFTR, par. U5365). The PPCIG must be carefully checked on shipments of
HHG to OCONUS locations for unaccompanied dependents.

3.3.4. (U5350-D/second item 4) Ordered from an OCONUS PDS to an OCONUS PDS to
Which Transportation Is Prohibited or Restricted, or Duty Under Unusual Circumstances.
MAJCOM Commanders are designated to authorize/approve shipments of HHG to any location
outside the CONUS in situations other than described above.
22


3.3.4.1.     APPROVAL CRITERIA.          Dependent travel to such location must be
authorized/approved under JFTR, par. U5222-F or a bona fide dependent must already be
residing at the OCONUS location. The PPCIG must be carefully checked on shipments of HHG
to OCONUS locations for unaccompanied dependents.

3.3.5. (U5350-E) Ordered from OCONUS Duty to a CONUS PDS:

3.3.5.1. Shipment of HHG from OCONUS areas other than the official OCONUS duty station is
permitted. The term “HOUSEHOLD GOODS” does not include articles "acquired" AFTER the
effective date of orders. For new furniture shipments, the items must be manufactured and owned
before the effective date of orders to qualify for shipment by government arrangement.

3.3.5.2. The member, prior to departure from the OCONUS PDS, must sign a DD Form 1299
agreeing to be responsible for all additional costs resulting from such shipments.

3.3.5.3. TMO does not forward the application if the member exceeded the full JFTR weight
allowance by previous shipments. When administrative weight limitations are exceeded, members
are to be counseled that OCONUS costs are a personal financial responsibility. The full JFTR
weight allowance applies for the CONUS portion of the shipment.

3.4. (U5355) Local Short Distance Moves.

3.4.1. (U5355-A) General. The local short distance move area is not defined by the local move
contract in place.

3.4.2. (U5355-B) Short Distance Moves Incident to Reassignment or PCS:

3.4.2.1. Except for a PCS Code M (no cost) or V (low cost) order, issuance of a funded travel
order shows that the MPF has the Installation Commander's authority for HHG shipment.

3.4.2.2. A member presenting a PCS Code M or V order, or an unfunded order is to be
referred to the MPF. The MPF or member obtains the necessary gaining Commander's approval
and the MPF issues a funded order when appropriate. This applies to local short distance moves
under JFTR, par. U5355-B1. If a PCS Code V order contains a fund citation, but the amount is
not sufficient for HHG shipment, advise the member to contact MPF.

3.4.2.3. Temporary storage (SIT) is not authorized for intra-city local short distance moves
(JFTR, par. U5375-A1).


3.4.4. (U5355-B2) PCS between PDSs Located in Proximity. Temporary storage for Inter-city
moves is authorized in JFTR, par. U5375-H2 (see paragraphs 3.4.2.2 and 5.1.7.1.

3.4.5. (U5355-C) Short Distance Move and NTS Incident to Government or Government-
Controlled Quarters Assignment/Termination. (See paragraph 5.2.5.1.)
                                                                                                 23




3.4.6. (U5355-D) Short Distance Move and NTS Incident to Vacating Local Economy Quarters.
(See paragraph 5.2.5.2.)

3.5. (U5360) Separation From the Service or Relief from Active Duty Except for Discharge
with Severance or Separation Pay.

3.5.1. (U5360-A) General. Members should be carefully counseled BEFORE electing to receive
travel pay to a selected separation point. Election to receive the greater amount of travel pay may
be negligible when compared to the loss or restriction of the HHG shipment entitlement.

3.5.1.1. For separated members, there is no authority to consign shipments of HHG to a military
installation, embassy, or consulate.

3.5.1.2. Full JFTR weight allowance is authorized upon return from OCONUS for separating
members. They are not restricted to allowance authorized to the OCONUS PDS. However, to
avoid excess costs, NTS and HHG at designated locations should be taken into account.

3.5.1.3. When members die before exercising their entitlements, the dependents or other persons
legally entitled are offered the same entitlements as the member.

3.5.2. (U5360-B1) Non-temporary Storage. Seventy-five (75) days prior to expiration of the
entitlement the TMO advises the member, by certified letter, that if application for shipment is not
received by the TMO before the expiration of the entitlement, the member should contact the
NTS contractor to procure enough insurance to cover the property remaining in storage. When
the member requests shipment, the TMO will collect all excess charges prior to release of the
NTS shipment.

3.5.2.1. The government maintains the NTS account during the authorized shipping entitlement
extension period. The member is billed for all storage costs exceeding 180 days from date of
separation. Under this arrangement, the member benefits by the storage rates available to the
government. However, the member is NOT covered for loss or damage to the property beyond
the basic authorized time limitation. The Military Personnel and Civilian Employee Claims
Act of 1964 does not apply after the authorized time limitation.

3.5.2.2. (U5360-B2) Temporary Storage. Temporary Storage of HHG transported from NTS
should be avoided. Close coordination between origin, destination and the member is critical. If
temporary storage becomes necessary the destination TMO is the appropriate authority to
authorize/approve. Under no circumstances should temporary storage be granted past 90 days
without approval from MAJCOM.

3.5.3. (U5360-D) Separation or Relief from Active Duty Upon Expiration of Enlistment or
Prescribed Term of Service. This local drayage authority applies only to a member who is in
physical receipt of a separation order. A member’s separation order is to be used to effect
shipment under this paragraph. The following statement is to be annotated in the remarks section
24


of the DD Form 1299, "Shipment per JFTR, par. U5360-F." Shipment is authorized to any point
within the local area (See paragraph 9.3.).

3.5.4. (U5360-E) Relief from Active Duty for Members of the Reserve Components
Called/Ordered to Active Duty for Less Than 20 Weeks or Less Than 6 Months for Initial Active
Duty for Training. The member’s order MUST have a reserve component fund cite on it.

3.5.5. (U5360-F) Member Required to Vacate Government or Government Controlled Quarters
Upon Separation or Relief from Active Duty. This local drayage authority applies only to a
member who is in physical receipt of a separation order. A member’s separation order is to be
used to effect the shipment under this paragraph. The following statement is to be annotated in
the remarks section of the DD Form 1299, “Shipment per JFTR, par. U5360-F.” Shipment is
authorized to any point within the local area. (See paragraph 9.3.).

3.5.6. (U5360-G) Time Limit.

3.5.6.1. Submission of an application is not to be interpreted strictly as the member’s signature on
the DD Form 1299. A constructive application, which contains the signature of the member, such
as a letter, fax or message from the member, within the specified time frame, is acceptable.

3.5.6.2. Extension of the time limit is permitted if a written request is submitted within the 180-
day-time limit; and physical release of HHG within the 180-day-time limit would impose a
hardship on the separated member.

3.5.6.3. Transportation officers may approve extension for shipment for a period of 15 workdays
following the scheduled pickup date. This applies when hardship occurs after shipping
arrangements have been made, but before the scheduled date services are to be performed.
Extension requests and authorizations or approvals are to be documented and retained in the
shipment file.

3.5.6.4. JPPSO-SAT is delegated authority to approve or disapprove requests for extension
beyond 15 workdays. Request must be based on a bona fide hardship to the member that would
be created by compliance with the 180-day basic entitlement. All requests for extension will be
fully documented and forwarded to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF-B, 613 Northwest Loop 410, Suite 400,
San Antonio, TX 78216-5518.
                                                                                                          25


3.5.6.4.1. The following are examples of situations under which extensions will be considered:

                      Reason For Extension & Documents Required                          # of Extension
                                        (See Note)                                         (See Note)

member with the circumstances and date of death.                                               1
Death of Member (Active Duty). First extension is automatic with call from
survivor.                                                                                      1
Spouse is active duty member or when two members are married and one separates
more than 180 days in advance of the other receiving PCS. Copy of spouse’s active              1
duty order, DEROS Rip or retirement/separation if applicable.
Spouse is a permanent civil service employee impacted by RIF action. Copy of
spouse’s RIF notification letter.                                                              1
Separatee’s job search. Letters from employment agencies, perspective employers,
etc. (“Suitability” is not a consideration.)                                                   1
Employment OCONUS. Employment must be to the benefit of the Government (e.g.,
DOD contractor, civil service employee, etc.) Requires letter from employer.                   1
Legal/administrative proceedings that preclude member from moving within time
limits (e.g., BCMR, custody hearings, etc.) Requires copy of document denoting                 2
proceedings.
NOTE: The circumstances outlined above are guidelines only. Due consideration must be
given to circumstances surrounding each member’s request. Each extension equals 180 days
(e.g., 2 extensions = 360 days)

3.5.6.4.2. Extension requests forwarded to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF-B must contain a specific date for
the new time limitation. Requests for open-ended extensions (i.e., until my spouse separates,
retires, transfers, etc.) are to be returned without action.

3.6. (U5365) Retirement, Placement on TDRL, Discharge with Severance or Separation
Pay, Involuntary Release from Active Duty with Readjustment or Separation Pay.

3.6.1. (U5365-A) HOS Authorized. Prepare AF Form 2473, Home of Selection Travel and
Transportation Entitlements, (Attachment 13) in duplicate, on shipments or storage incident to
retirement. Place the original in the member’s case file and give the duplicate copy to the
member. AF Form 2473 may be ordered through publication, reproduced locally or produced
from automated systems.
26


3.6.1.1. Home of selection (HOS) is the place selected by the member under JFTR, par. U5130.
The member is required to indicate the HOS at time of application.

3.6.1.1.1. A home of selection and shipment at government expense to any place within the
United States (including Alaska and Hawaii).

3.6.1.1.2. A place outside the United States from which the member was called (or ordered) to
active duty to the first duty station.

3.6.1.1.3. Any “other place” at a cost not to exceed what it would have cost the government had
the member selected a home at a specified place in the CONUS. NOTE: If “other place” is
selected, collection action is effected by JPPSO-SAT/ECAF based on all pertinent travel and
transportation documents. TMOs annotate the shipping document with "Paying Officer Review
Required." The Finance Services Office (FSO) and TMO (per DFAS DER 7010-3) furnish to the
member available cost comparison options (estimates). The FSO provides the member with the
most favorable travel pay option. The TMO furnishes the most favorable HHG rate point. The
member selects one of these options for entitlement purposes. Once an option has been chosen,
the TMO furnishes an estimate of excess costs, if any, associated with the shipment outside the
CONUS.

3.6.1.1.4. If member chooses an HOS outside the United States as “other place”, NO POV
transportation entitlement exists.

3.6.1.2. For a retired member, the HHG weight allowance is that noted in JFTR, par. U5310-B.
The pay grade in which the member was serving on the LAST day of active duty is used.

3.6.1.3. For a member separated or retired under JFTR, par. U5365, there is no authority to
consign a shipment of HHG to a military installation, embassy, or consulate.

3.6.1.4. For members separating or retiring under JFTR, par. U5365, full weight allowance is
authorized upon return from OCONUS.

3.6.2. (U5365-C4) Temporary Storage. Close coordination between origin, destination and the
member is critical. It is important to counsel the retired member the government does not
ordinarily pay for any further storage.

3.6.2.1. The TMO is without authority to delay a shipment beyond the authorized time limitation
for the member’s convenience. These members must be carefully counseled on the ramifications
of their actions and are required to provide a specific pickup dates for the shipments from NTS.

3.6.2.2. If temporary storage becomes necessary and meets the requirements of JFTR, par.
U5365-C4a or b, the destination TMO is the appropriate authority to authorize/approve. Under

NOTE: The circumstances outlined above are guidelines only. Due consideration is to be given
to circumstances surrounding each member’s request. Comptroller General decision B207157, 2
Feb 1983 states “The primary requirement is that the travel be the result of separation/retirement
from the service, since it is not a benefit which the separated/retired member retains until used
regardless of circumstances.” Each extension equals 1 year but may not be extended for more
than a total of 6 years (including the first year after retirement) from the retirement/separation
date IAW JFTR, par. U5018-I).

                                            Chapter 5
                                           STORAGE

5.1. (U5375) TEMPORARY STORAGE.

5.1.1. (U5375-A) General. The TMO maintains close liaison with housing, personnel, and
sponsors to determine status of incoming personnel. The TMO ensures HHG are only placed into
SIT after the determination is made that the member could not accept them.

5.1.1.1. Departing personnel should be thoroughly briefed on their responsibility to promptly
notify the TMO when they arrive at destination. Normally, telephone contact is acceptable.

5.1.1.2. The following provisions exist to guide the TMO and the member on temporary storage:

5.1.1.2.1. When temporary storage is required at origin, two methods of storage may be used. If
the member specified a geographical destination, a GBL or similar type of shipping document
authorizing SIT at origin may be issued to cover storage and movement. If the member does not
designate a destination state, HHG are to be placed in storage under a basic agreement or DPM
contract. NOTE: The TMO determines which method to use based on the member’s individual
circumstances and/or which method results in the lower overall cost to the government.

5.1.1.2.2. If a GBL was used, it is to be canceled when the member fails to request shipment
from temporary storage within the authorized time limitation. The TMO should process the
payment to the carrier or agent in accordance with paragraph 10.9. If origin services were
originally procured by local contractual arrangement, the contractor is to be paid for services and
storage. Any additional storage charges must be settled between the member and the contractor.
In the circumstances noted above, collection action is to be initiated against the member for origin
services and storage paid by the government.

5.1.1.2.3. If shipment is made at a later date and the member has not yet reimbursed the
government, collection action is to be canceled. The initial warehouse handling and storage are
‘services authorized incident to the line-haul shipment’. If payment has already been made, the
member may file a claim for reimbursement.

5.1.1.2.4. If a member remains in a pay status and receives further PCS orders before requesting
shipment under the previous order, collection for origin services and storage previously furnished
remains valid. However, these charges should not be collected if the new order amends, modifies,
or revokes the previous order (See JFTR, par. U5375-G) or if the member requests a shipment
under the chain-of-orders concept.

5.1.1.2.5. Members separated in a NON-PAY status could also face situations wherein approved
temporary storage expires before the shipping entitlements expire (i.e., HHG placed in storage at
origin before the separation date or member obtained an extension of the shipping time limitation.)
In those circumstances, follow the guidance above.
34


5.1.2. (U5375-B1) First 90 Days of Storage. TMOs are to maintain an effective suspense
system on all temporary storage. Members are to be notified as to expiration of temporary
storage and advised as to their responsibilities concerning removal or continued storage.
Members should be thoroughly counseled so they understand and can comply with all instructions
relating to temporary storage entitlements. See paragraph 3.3.2.3.2. for maximum storage
entitlement for members participating in the Home Basing, Follow-On Program.

5.1.2.1. (U5375-B2) Second 90 Days of Storage. Use DD Form 1857, Temporary Commercial
Storage at Government Expense to document additional SIT. Temporary storage is not to be
authorized beyond 180 days, except under the provisions of JFTR, pars. U5375-B3a and b, even
though the member agrees to reimburse the government. There are two options for those
shipments that entitlements to SIT have expired.

5.1.2.1.1. Member’s Expense. Temporary storage is terminated at 2400 hours on the 180th day,
with the account converting to the member's expense. Additional accrued storage charges
become a matter for resolution between the member and the storage company. In this case, the
warehouse becomes the destination of the shipment. It is recommended that the member and
warehouseman conduct a joint inspection of the shipment and complete a DD Form 1840. A
claim against the Government may be denied unless the member has evidence that the loss or
damages occurred while the shipment was stored at the Government’s expense .

5.1.2.1.2. Government Expense. If the member is still in a pay status the TMO may elect to
maintain the Government-funded character of the shipment in SIT and recoup the excess storage
cost from the member upon delivery. This period will not exceed one year beyond the last
approved storage period.

5.1.2.1.3. In either case the member is entitled to delivery at government expense. The
Transportation Office under local invoicing or purchasing procedures after the PPGBL has
terminated shall make payment for delivery services at government expense.

5.1.2.2. (U5375-B3) Storage After First 180 Days. Approval criteria for shipments in temporary
storage from 181 to 270 days are delegated to the Traffic Management Officer. Approval
authority for storage from 271 days plus is delegated to the Traffic Management Officer with
coordination required from MAJCOM transportation staff, JPPSO Director/Deputy or equivalent
agency official.

5.1.2.2.1. (U5375-B3a) Additional Storage When Member on TDY or Deployed for More Than
90 days or for an Indefinite Period While HHG are in Temporary Storage. The Traffic
Management Officer is designated to authorize/approve additional storage under JFTR, par.
U5375-B3a. Disapproval of requests for additional storage is to be made only with
concurrence of the respective MAJCOM. Requests must include a copy of the member's TDY or
deployment order, together with the member’s statement as to the necessity for additional
temporary storage. Storage at government expense terminates not later than 90 days after
completion of TDY or deployment, unless the MAJCOM transportation staff, JPPSO
                                                                                                35


Director/Deputy or equivalent agency official approves additional storage (not to exceed an
additional 90 days).

5.1.2.2.2. (U5375-B3b) Additional Storage Under Circumstances Beyond Member’s Control.
Approval criteria for shipments in temporary storage over 180 days are as follows:

5.1.2.2.2.1. Storage required to permit direct delivery from temporary storage into government
quarters. To meet this criterion, the member must have been on the active government quarters
waiting list throughout the entire time the shipment was in SIT. NOTE: This does not apply to
members who are on a waiting list for a specific type of house when other adequate housing is
available. Verification from the housing office is required. If a member is removed from the
active waiting list, government SIT terminates immediately, or

5.1.2.2.2.2. Storage required due to non-availability of suitable local economy quarters for the
member based on the member’s pay grade and family size (work closely with housing manager to
ascertain the local housing situation), or

5.1.2.2.2.3. Other deserving cases wherein members submit justification indicating that the
situation is beyond their control and that failure to provide the additional storage would create a
financial hardship.

NOTE: These time extension authorities are not meant to relieve members of their
responsibilities to expeditiously seek and obtain adequate housing.

5.1.3. (U5375-D) Temporary Storage Converted to NTS. The TMO is the designated approval
authority.

5.1.4. (U5375-E) HHG Partial Lot Withdrawal and Delivery from Temporary Storage. The
TMO is the designated approval authority.

5.1.5. (U5375-F) Further PCS Orders Received After The Member Arrives at a New PDS. See
JFTR, Appendix A, for definition of Effective Date of PCS Orders.

5.1.6. (U5375-G) Orders Amended, Modified, Canceled or Revoked. See JFTR, Appendix A,
for definition of Effective Date of PCS Orders.

5.1.7. (U5375-H) Short Distance Moves.

5.1.7.1.  (U5375-H2)       Inter-City Moves.      See paragraph 5.1.2 for time limitations.
Approval/Authorization for storage under this paragraph is the same as identified in par. U5355-
B.

5.2. (U5380) NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE.
36


5.2.1. (U5380-B1) General. When NTS is authorized from OCONUS, HHG are normally
returned to a CONUS port of entry for NTS. NTS is authorized OCONUS, when such approved
facilities are available for:

5.2.1.1. Members retiring OCONUS who select a home in or near the OCONUS duty station.

5.2.1.2. Members who separate with home of selection entitlement and indicate in writing the
intention to select a home in or near the OCONUS duty station.

5.2.2. (U5380-B2) Return of HHG from OCONUS. HHG returned from OCONUS for NTS
are to be forwarded to the CONUS NTS storage facilities. Shipments are to be marked and
documented "FOR NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE", and supported by a DD Form 1299 and the
member’s special order.

5.2.2.1. Port Terminal Action. The Terminal TO determines whether commercial or government
facilities are to be used for storage as required in DTR, Part IV.

5.2.2.2. Non-temporary Storage Facilities in OCONUS Areas. See DTR, Part IV.

5.2.3. (U5380-C) NTS as an Alternative to Transportation.         The TMO is the designated
approval authority: (See Attachment 11)

5.2.3.1. When cost comparison indicates NTS for the contemplated period of the new assignment
will cost less than shipment of the property to the new duty station.

5.2.3.2. For a specified period of storage which is less than the contemplated period of the new
assignment. Storage costs for the specified period cannot exceed the cost of shipment to the new
assignment. The member must agree to conversion of the storage account to personal expense on
a specific expiration date.

5.2.3.3. When HHG are in NTS and continued storage costs less than shipment to the new
assignment.

NOTE: HQ USAF/ILGT is the determining authority in all other cases.

5.2.4. (U5380-D) NTS Converted to Temporary Storage. This entitlement applies only to the
removal of HHG from NTS for line-haul shipment. The TMO is the designated approval
authority. A DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, is to be initiated to collect storage
charges in excess of 180 days unless the TMO authorizes additional storage under paragraph
5.1.2.2.

5.2.5. (U5380-G) NTS Incident to Occupancy of Government or Government-Controlled
Quarters and Incident to Vacating Local Economy Quarters. Applies to CONUS and OCONUS
areas. An order (AF Form 150) authorizing drayage and storage at government expense must
contain a fund citation provided by the housing or billeting officer. NOTE: Budget and
                                                                                                   37


obligation authority is not maintained by the TMO; it is the Housing Manager’s responsibility
(AFI 32-6001 and AFI 65-601 V1 paragraph 10.51)

5.2.5.1. (U5380-G1)        Incident to Occupancy of Government or Government-Controlled
Quarters.

5.2.5.1.1. Under certain circumstances when it has been predetermined that a member is to
occupy government quarters immediately upon arrival at a new duty station, the member may
apply for NTS at the old duty station in CONUS. The gaining installation will fund the storage
cost for the NTS regardless of the location of the property. This exception ordinarily applies to
key and essential personnel required to occupy pre-designated quarters or members who have
PCS’d and received new quarters prior to moving HHG from their old PDSs. The items must be
declared excess to the requirements in assigned quarters at the new duty station. As such, the
members would be afforded the opportunity to inspect assigned government quarters and could,
at that time, determine NTS requirements at origin. The housing office at destination would have
to issue an appropriate order (AF Form 150, Drayage/Storage Authorization - Government
Quarters) and funding for the items authorized for NTS at origin.

5.2.5.1.2. Members assigned to or between government quarters who intend to declare articles
excess to space limitations and must submit a list of articles to the housing or billeting office that
controls the assignment to government quarters.

5.2.5.1.2.1. IMPORTANT: The member must prepare a list of articles to be placed into NTS.
The responsible housing manager reviews and authenticates this listing. Normally, this is done

              PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE (POV) TRANSPORTATION

PART A: TRANSPORTATION OF POVs

6.1. (U5405) Eligibility.

6.1.1. The "ownership prior to effective date of orders provision" does not apply for shipment of
POVs.

6.1.2. Military members married to military members are each authorized shipment of a POV –
one POV per member.

6.2. (U5410-A) Transportation Permitted.

6.2.1. OCONUS Tour of Duty in Excess of 1 Year: The POV must be delivered to Vehicle
Processing Center (VPC)/POV loading port within 90 days of the member’s (or dependent’s)
departure from the previous PDS and the member must have a minimum of one year remaining on
the current tour at the time of vehicle turn in at the VPC/port.

6.2.1.1. If over 90 days has passed since the member’s (or dependent’s) departure from the
previous PDS and/or less than one year remains on the current tour, the POV may be shipped
only upon written approval of the OCONUS installation commander. For the purpose of this
entitlement, OCONUS commander authority may be delegated to Transportation Commander or
Chief of Transportation.

6.2.1.2. OCONUS Tour of Duty for 1 Year or Less: The POV must be delivered to the
VPC/port within 30 days after departure of the member from the member’s last PDS.

6.2.1.3. Transportation of POV Incident to a PCS Involving Inter-Theater Assignments:

6.2.1.3.1. Members may ship one POV for personal use or their dependents’ use to the port/VPC
serving their new PDS, or

6.2.1.3.2. A POV can be shipped to the port serving the member's new PDS providing the cost
does not exceed the cost of through water movement between the port serving the old and new
duty stations, or no direct ocean service is available between the ports serving the old and new
duty stations.

6.2.1.3.3. Advance approval by the Traffic Management Officer is required for shipping POVs
involving transshipment through CONUS. Requests are to be submitted to the losing Traffic
Management Officer for approval/disapproval consideration. Requests must indicate individual's
name and grade, circumstances involved, origin and destination, through movement cost versus
requested routing cost comparison (to include dollar savings), certification that no direct ocean
40


service was available between old and new duty stations, and that the POV is otherwise eligible
for movement (i.e., conforms to things like EPA and Customs requirements).

6.2.2. (U5410-B) POV Shipment When Transportation to the New PDS Not Permitted.

6.2.2.1. HQ USAF/ILGT is the determining authority under JFTR, par. U5410-B1, second item
b, when the shipment is not related to the travel of dependents. The member must state in
writing, that the POV destination is the port/VPC normally serving one of the following:
residence of member’s family; home of record; or place of entry on the current tour of active duty.
A request for shipment to any other place must contain detailed justification and clearly identify
who is to accept the vehicle.

6.2.2.2. For shipments under JFTR, par. U5410-B1, second item c, the member is responsible for
all costs related to payment of customs, import duties, etc.

6.2.3. (U5410-C) Replacement POV Transportation. MAJCOM and SOA Directors of
Transportation having logistical responsibilities in the OCONUS areas are designated to make
replacement vehicle determinations. Time remaining on station requirements in paragraphs 6.2.1
and 6.2.1.1. do not apply. However, approval for members with less than one year remaining
should have very strong justification. This section pertains to shipment of POVs from CONUS to
the OCONUS station.

6.3. (U5414) Transportation of POVs To/From PDS.

6.3.1. (U5414-B) Transportation of a POV Between OCONUS VPC/Port and OCONUS PDS.
SAF/IA (AFAAO) is designated to authorize/approve requests for Air Force personnel assigned
to US Defense Offices worldwide.

6.3.2. (U5414-C) Transportation of a POV within CONUS Incident to PCS. The local MPF is
designated to authorize/approve shipments when member is physically unable to drive or there is
insufficient time for the member to drive and report to their new PDS. It is the member’s
responsibility to provide documentation substantiating the request for overland shipment to the
MPF and the authorization is to be included in the member’s PCS order.

6.4. (U5415) Transportation Restrictions.

6.4.1. (U5415-B) Restriction, Prohibition, or Suspension to a Member’s OCONUS PDS. See
DTR, Vol. V and PPCIG, Volume II - OCONUS.

6.4.2. The DOD has imposed an embargo on the shipment of POVs made after 31 Mar 76 to
Japan. By Memorandum of 6 Sep 95, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Force Management
Policy) has granted the Commander US Forces Japan a limited waiver authority to this embargo.
Waiver application procedures are contained in the PPCIG, Volume II, Japan.
                                                                                               41


6.4.2.1. The waiver authority does not include Okinawa because it does not have the air pollution
laboratory required for emission testing.

6.4.2.2. Member is responsible for all charges associated with meeting Government of Japan
vehicle emission standards.

6.4.2.3. In the event of any vehicle not meeting Government of Japan standards, the member is
responsible for disposal of the vehicle, and any associated costs of such disposal; and

6.4.2.4. Commanders and members must understand, no government entitlement exists to return
the vehicle to the US until the issuance of subsequent PCS orders, or such time as an early return
of dependents application is authorized.

6.4.2. (U5415-C) Restriction on Vehicle Size. The formula for determining the measurement
ton (MT) size of a POV is: length times width times height (in feet) divided by 40. (EXAMPLE:
(L) 17’ x (W) 8’ x (H) 5.75’ = 782 cubic feet, ÷ 40 = 19.55 MTs). Size restriction does not apply
for members who are authorized shipment of an oversized POV for medical reasons. Members
must send requests through the Installation Surgeon General (SG) and MPF. Authorization for
oversized vehicle under these circumstances must be annotated on member’s order.

6.5. (U5435) Ports Used.

6.5.1. (U5435-A) Designation of Ports.

6.5.1.1. The designated port for entitlement purposes is the MTMC controlled VPC nearest to
the current and next PDS or in between the two.

6.5.1.2. See DOD 4500.9-R, Part IV, Appendix BD for identification of ports that have service
between the shipping and receiving points.

6.5.2. (U5435-B) Alternate Ports.

6.5.2.1. For entitlement purposes, shipments from a port located in a different country than the
designated port’s country, require HQ USAF/ILGT approval (EXCEPTION: SAF/MRM has
granted approval for AF members in Europe to ship from any European port provided members
pay any excess costs).

6.5.2.1.1. A request is to be forwarded to the applicable MAJCOM for initial determination. If
the request contains adequate justification, it is to be forwarded to HQ USAF/ILGT for approval.

6.5.2.1.2. Any request forwarded must contain a strong MAJCOM-recommended positive
endorsement. Prime considerations in forwarding a case for review are those situations beyond
the member's control and those where approval would alleviate an undue hardship. Requests
lacking adequate justification are returned without action
42


6.5.2.2. Other than Designated Shipping Port Usage Within the CONUS. The member must be
advised of the responsibility for any excess cost for use of a port/VPC other than a designated
port/VPC. Such costs should be collected at the port/VPC in advance of shipment.

6.5.3. (U5435-C) Transshipment from a Designated Port. HQ USAF/ILGT is designated to
make determinations on these requests.

6.6. (U5440) Factors Affecting POV Transportation.

6.6.1. (U5440-A) Transportation of POV May Be Deferred. EXAMPLE: Member went PCS
from Andrews AFB to Mildenhall AFB in 1996 and did not use an entitlement to ship a POV. In
1999 the member went PCS from Mildenhall AFB to Ramstein AFB. Member has entitlement to
ship a POV from the port/VPC servicing Andrews AFB to Germany or from England to
Germany.

6.8.1. (U5455-B) Member Reassigned from OCONUS PDS to Which Dependent Travel Is
Authorized to an OCONUS PDS to Which Dependents’ Travel Is Not Authorized before the
POV Is Transported from a CONUS VPC/Port. This paragraph authorizes inter-coastal or intra-
coastal shipment of a POV. The authorization is to a port/VPC serving the designated location of
dependents, when such designated location is in the CONUS. When the dependents travel to a
non-foreign OCONUS area (e.g., Alaska, Puerto Rico), shipment is authorized as provided in
JFTR, par. U5410-B1, second item b.

6.8.2. (U5455-E) Member Officially Reported as Dead, Injured, Ill, Absent For More Than 29
Days in a Missing Status, or Upon Death.

6.8.2.1. A POV is not to be shipped at government expense until such time as the Mortuary

address of the lawful recipient of the POV.

6.8.2.2. DD Form 1300, or documents listed in AFI 34-501, may be used to support the
procurement for shipment. Also, the dependent travel order may be used if travel of dependents

the TMO must obtain an appropriation from the local Comptroller.

6.8.2.4. Commercial "Drive-Away" service is NOT to be used for overland shipment of POVs.
                                                                                                43


6.8.2.5. Mobile homes and campers used as a residence and designed to be moved overland,

disaster. Local moves may be performed under JFTR, pars. U5355-C1, and U5380-G1a and b.
for Government quarters, and pars. U5355-D1 and U5380-G2a for economy quarters. These
moves are funded by local installation support funds, and cannot be charged to evacuation funding
appropriations. An evacuation does not have to be declared for the installation commander to
authorize HHG shipment/storage.

PART B:    AUTHORIZED OR ORDERED                           MOVEMENTS           WITHIN      THE
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES (CONUS)

8.3. (U6050) General Information. Same as 8.1. above.

                                       Chapter 9
                          JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix A Definitions

9.1. Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco Products.

9.1.1. Shipments within CONUS: These items are subject to the rules and regulations established
or approved by an appropriate federal or state regulatory authority.

9.1.2. Shipments Entering the Customs Territory of the United States (CTUS) See DTR, Part V.
Members are to be counseled they are required to make arrangements, and are responsible, for
ensuring compliance with destination state laws.

9.1.3. Shipments within and between OCONUS Countries and Shipments from CTUS to
OCONUS Countries: Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products may be shipped subject to host
country requirements/restrictions. Consult PPCIG Volume II for host country requirements/
restrictions. When in doubt, the origin TMO must request clarification from the responsible
transportation authority at destination.

9.1.4. Reimbursement for self-procurement. Reimbursement is restricted to what it would have
cost to move a like weight of HHG by surface mode. TMO prepares a letter of reimbursement
and forwards a copy to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF. Members are subject to excess cost for split
shipments.

9.2 Consumables. Consumables may consist of foodstuff items, household or other personal
items that are to be consumed and need replacement. Consumables cannot include any prohibited
items (i.e., hazardous). The member should have received information from the sponsor advising
which types of consumables are not available at the new location.

9.3. Duty Stations/Permanent (Duty) Station (PDS). If an authorized commuting area has not
been designated, the TMO must request that one be established IAW JFTR, Chapter 3, and JTR,
Chapter 2 by the Installation Commander.

9.4. Intra-Theater Move. HHG movement within a geographic area outside the CONUS within
which a member’s HHG can be shipped without having to transit the CONUS (e.g., European
theater would include movements within and between all EUCOM organizations; Iceland, and
Azores).

9.5. Motorcycle/Moped:

9.5.1. Shipment in HHG does not change federal emission control or safety requirements in effect
for that model year. Motorcycles/mopeds entering the CTUS, not conforming to US EPA/DOT
standards, are not to be included in HHG because the entire shipment would be delayed and
opened at CONUS port of entry by customs. The certification label affixed to the frame is used to
determine compliance with US EPA/DOT standards. See Shipping Your POV Pamphlet
                                                                                                    51


(Nonconforming POVs) http://www.mtmc.army.mil/. NOTE: Members may elect to make a
separate HHG shipment, subject to excess cost, for motorcycles/mopeds.

9.5.2. The motorcycle/moped is to be prepared for shipment by the member to meet carrier
requirements. Specifically, at origin, the vehicle is to be drained of fuel and then operated until all
fuel is exhausted. The battery must be completely protected to prevent short circuits. Batteries
are to have cables disconnected and be secured in the vehicle’s battery box to prevent acid
leakage.

9.5.3. Some foreign countries require a motorcycle/moped to be licensed as a POV. These
countries may also allow importation of only one POV. The owner should be advised of the
country’s importation licensing/registration requirements if also anticipating shipment of a POV.
Owners shipping a POV to such countries should consider whether shipment of a
motorcycle/moped in HHG is wise. The owner may incur excessive customs duties plus other
associated costs. Consult Volume II, PPCIG, for host country requirements/restrictions.
When in doubt, the origin TMO must request, by message, clarification from the responsible
transportation authority at destination.

9.5.4. For surface shipments, documents must identify the location of the vehicle in the shipment.
This is necessary because any surface shipment destined to/from OCONUS may be diverted to an
air shipment. If the shipment is diverted to AMC, a Shipper Certification for Dangerous Goods
must be prepared in accordance with AFJMAN 24-204. To complete the form, service liaison
and AMC personnel must be able to locate the vehicle in the shipment.

9.5.5. For HHG shipments to/from Hardlift areas and via TP-4, the Shipper Certification for
Dangerous Goods must be prepared and affixed by the origin TMO.

9.5.6. They can also be shipped in unaccompanied baggage if this is the only mode available or
the only shipment elected by the member. TMOs must consult Volume II, PPCIG, for host
country restrictions.

                                   Chapter 10
                        GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE

10.1. Counseling Members. Entitlements, modes and methods of shipments are constantly
changing. Therefore, TMOs should develop a continuing education program on personal
property entitlements for the base population. JPPSO-SAT has developed a Personal Property
Counselor’s Handbook which can be used to supplement your training program. It can be
downloaded from http://jppso-sat.randolph.af.mil/ppd/default.htm.

10.1.1. In addition to the requirements in DTR, Part IV, overprint the DD Form 1797, Personal
Property Counseling Checklist. Use the reverse to add special interest items relative to particular
shippers or groups. Also use the DD Form 1797 to record any misunderstanding or
disagreement the counselor had with the shipper. Use this record to respond to case file
inquiries.

10.1.2. Items of Extraordinary Value. Ensure members are briefed in accordance with DTR, Part
IV, Chapter 401, Paragraph D.

10.1.3. TMOs are to counsel members and employees on POV movement using Part V of the
DD Form 1797. This must be done whether or not the member/employee is currently shipping a
POV.

10.1.4. Prepare AF Form 2473, Home of Selection Travel and Transportation Entitlements, in
duplicate, on shipments or storage incident to retirement. Place the original in the member’s
case file and give the duplicate copy to the member. (Attachment 13)

10.2. Sensitive Shipments/Witness Protection. Air Force personnel with classified
assignments, the "assigned to" blocks of the special orders for these members do not contain "in
the clear" destinations. Therefore, counseling and documentation preparation requires special
attention. Ship the property to the destination requested by the member and:

10.2.1. Accept a statement from the District Detachment Commander certifying the authorized
weight allowance for Office of Special Investigations (OSI) special agents. Treat this information
as sensitive data to be used for entitlement purposes only.

10.2.2. If a counselor with the proper security clearance is available and members are allowed to
discuss the end assignment on a need-to-know basis, give these members a verbal briefing on
their specific entitlements. Annotate the reverse of the DD Form 1797 to reflect that an oral
briefing was given and indicate the name of the counselor involved.

10.2.3. If a properly cleared counselor is not available or if the member cannot discuss the end
assignment with TMO personnel on a need-to-know basis, give the member a generic counseling
and record the counseling on the reverse of the DD Form 1797.

10.3. Exception to Provisions of the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) and Joint
Travel Regulation (JTR) is prohibited.
                                                                                               53




10.3.1. The JFTR is a direct implementation of the laws enacted by the Congress and the
President and interpretations of those laws by the Comptroller General of the United States
(GAO) and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) and has the force and effect of
law. The JTR is the DOD implementation of General Services Administration (GSA) Federal
Travel Regulation (FTR) that is the direct implementation of law and GAO and GSA Board of
Contract Appeals (GSBCA) interpretations. There is NO authority to grant an exception or a
waiver to any JFTR/JTR provision. DO NOT FORWARD SUCH REQUESTS TO HQ USAF
FOR CONSIDERATION.

10.3.2. Recommended changes to the JFTR/JTR may be submitted through MAJCOM channels
to HQ USAF/ILGT who forwards them to HQ USAF/DPRC for submission through the
appropriate channels (I.e., Unified Legislation and Budgeting (ULB), or Military/Civilian
Advisory Panel (MAP/CAP)).

10.4. Congressional Inquiries. Air Force personnel have the legal right to petition, furnish
information to, or communicate with the Congress (Title 5, United States Code, Section 7102 and
Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034). Most Congressional inquiries relating to HHG are
sent to SAF/LLI and then tasked to HQ USAF/ILGT. If you receive a request from HQ
USAF/ILGT or your MAJCOM for information respond quickly and accurately, answering all
questions to the best of your ability. Email is the preferred method. Ensure your Commander is
informed of the request and your response.

10.4.1. Congressional Inquiries to Local Commanders. Air Force policy is to respond promptly
and factually to direct requests for information from Members of Congress and their staffs.
Commanders are to establish appropriate procedures in accordance with AFI 90-401. If you
receive a congressional inquiry from other than your MAJCOM or HQ USAF/ILGT notify your
MAJCOM Traffic Management Division.

10.4.2. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about
military and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an
individual’s written consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only general
information according to the provisions of AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program
(converting to AFI 33-332), which sets forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air Force may,
however, disclose an individual’s records without the individual’s consent when requested by a
chairperson or ranking minority member of a congressional committee or subcommittee if the
information relates to matters within its jurisdiction. When making such a disclosure, the Air
Force should tell the committee or subcommittee members about any sensitive information and
the need to safeguard it.

10.5. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR) Procedures. The BCMR
has authority to correct any element of a military record, including the facts supporting any type
of indebtedness. It applies to members or former members and dependents or heirs of deceased
members. It recognizes the right to appeal cases if they think an error or injustice has been
committed. The individual completes and submits a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of
54


Military Records Under the Provisions of Title 10, US Code, Section 1552. Forms are obtained
from and processed by Customer Service, MPF.

10.5.1. Before BCMR action involving excess costs can occur, the member must appeal the case
by filing a rebuttal. A copy of the final adjudication from JPPSO-SAT/ECAF must support the
BCMR application.

10.5.2. Enlisted members on active duty must file for remission (cancellation) of the debt
BEFORE SUBMITTING FOR BCMR. The remission request must be sent to DFAS-DE
through the local FSO. A copy of the response from DFAS-DE must accompany the BCMR
application.

10.5.3. If BCMR request is granted, JPPSO-SAT/ECAF takes the necessary action to modify or
terminate the indebtedness.

10.6. Airlift of HHG. HHG shipment by air to, from, or between Hardlift areas listed in
Attachment 6, and via AMC TP-4, does not require prior approval. Airlift to any other area
requires prior approval. JPPSO-SAT/DIR is delegated approval authority for TP-2 airlift.
Absolute preference must be given to the use of Air Mobility Command resources. NOTE:
Space required airlift of HHG is not authorized for retirees or separatees.

10.6.1. Hardlift normally applies to all inter-theater HHG shipments for members/employees
outside CONUS unless the member has a temporary duty/leave/delay en route of more than 30
days. Under those circumstances ship the member’s HHG by surface carrier.

10.6.2. TP-4 Airlift of HHG.

10.6.2.1. AMC TP-4 airlift of HHG uses AMC excess by-product airlift capability.

10.6.2.2. HHG are airlifted on a space-available basis at surface competitive rates.

10.6.2.3. AMC TP-4 airlift of HHG can be used with Code T or DPM shipment modes.
However, AMC air terminal managers control the availability of this service over specific airlift
channels in coordination with the Air Clearance Authorities (ACA). They determine the actual
amount of TP-4 accepted into the aerial ports. They also work together to fill excess capacity to
maximize aircraft utilization. The ACA validates the movement and coordinates with the
appropriate APOE. Shippers should use one of the following methods when requesting clearance
of HHG at the TP-4 rate.

10.6.2.3.1. Via http://www.pats.wpafb.af.mil/atacmd/index.cfm

10.6.2.3.2. Fax information to DSN 787-3185 or commercial (937) 257-3185

10.6.2.3.3. Telephone ACA office DSN 787-4949 or commercial (937) 257-4946.
                                                                                               55


10.6.2.4. TMOs may use available TP-4 airlift when a local cost comparison indicates that it is
cost favorable or when it is required to meet the member’s, dependent’s, or next-of-kin’s
requirements. However, HHG shipments are to move as TP-4 when it best meets the needs of the
member without incurring storage-in-transit costs at destination. The TMO is to obtain an
advance airlift clearance based on estimated pieces, weight, and cube before making any
commitment to this type of movement. Personal Property Processing Offices must indicate their
request for TP-4 movement by annotating the request on the DD Form 1299 and forwarding it to
the shipping office.

10.6.2.5. Shipments being returned from OCONUS points destined for CONUS Non-temporary
storage can be routed via TP-4.

10.6.2.6. Once the appropriate clearance authority clears a shipment, it moves as TP-4.
Shipments are not to be pulled out of the airlift system by AMC and diverted to surface
movement without coordination with the airlift clearance authority. Options are to upgrade to
TP-2 (if justified) or allow the shipper to divert to other modes.

10.6.3. TP-2 Airlift Requests. Airlift requests (AMC TP-2) to, from or between other than
approved Hardlift areas are sent to JPPSO-SAT/DIR. (See paragraph 10.6.3.3.) The TMO
initiates the request that includes, as a minimum, the following:

10.6.3.1. The member’s name, grade, and social security number;

10.6.3.2. The shipment origin and destination; (Identify any applicable origin and destination
military installation.)

10.6.3.3. Pickup date and RDD;

10.6.3.4. Pieces, weight, and cube;

10.6.3.5. Original code of service, name of carrier, and GBL number;

10.6.3.5.1. Circumstances (obtained from the origin TMO) resulting in the inability to move via
surface to include, as applicable: carrier delay in delivery to port; port processing delays; ship
availability (past and anticipated); origin TMO failure to comply with applicable routing guide;
port agent deficiency; failure to effect shipment from origin; or other pertinent data.

10.6.3.5.2. Specific hardships experienced by the member or family. Indicate whether a housing
loaner kit is available and being used by member. General statements such as "member is in dire
need," "member has quarters," and "past RDD" are insufficient to justify airlift.

10.6.3.5.3. Any other data to assist in evaluation of requests.

10.6.3.6. Airlift requests should be transmitted by message to JPPSO-SAT with information
copies to AFMC LSO/LOTA and the MAJCOM. Email requests can be used as an alternate
56


method of transmission to extensions@jppsosat.randolph.af.mil. Email address for the correct
AFMC LSO can be found at www.pats.wpafb.af.mil/atcmd/atcmd.htm.

10.6.3.7. Disapproval authority for airlift requests remains at HQ USAF/ILGT. If JPPSO-
SAT/DIR believes the request for airlift lacks adequate justification, telephonic coordination is to
be made with HQ USAF/ILGT.

10.6.3.8. Requests for airlift of a civilian employee’s HHG must include authority to cite the
specific allotment. If authority of the agency controlling the funds has not been obtained, the
agency is to be included as an action addressee. The agency is to be requested to furnish JPPSO-
SAT/DIR authority to cite their funds to defray airlift cost. The controlling agencies are:

10.6.3.8.1. The gaining civilian personnel office for Air Force employees;

10.6.3.8.2. DLIELC/LEX, Lackland AFB TX/LEANO for Defense Language Institute (DLI)
employees.

10.6.3.8.3. The gaining Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DODDS) Regional Office
for Air Force funded shipments for DODDS employees;

10.7. OSI Investigations. HQ USAF/ILGT sends OSI reports concerning HHG and POVs to
the appropriate MAJCOM. The MAJCOM conducts a review and, if applicable, recommends a
course of collection action to the JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

10.8. Pertinent Personal Property Guidance in Non-transportation Regulations.

10.8.1. Disposal of Unclaimed Personal Property. (See DOD Manual 4160.21-M)

10.8.2. Shipment of Deceased Member's Personal Property. (See AFI 34-501)

10.8.3. Non-temporary Storage of HHG Excess to Government Quarters. (See AFI 32-6001)

10.9. Payment of Carrier or Agent Services Rendered when Movement is Canceled.
Normally, services are ordered, government funds are obligated, and line-haul movement is made.
If a movement is canceled, the government must pay the carrier or agent for services rendered up
to the movement cancellation. Use the following procedures to effect payment for services
rendered:

10.9.1. Do not cancel a GBL if it has been issued. Obtain carrier or agent invoice, or DD Form
619, from the carrier or agent for services rendered. The TMO certifies services performed and
accomplished on the GBL AT ORIGIN. Annotate the GBL that NO LINE HAUL was involved
and give a brief explanation as to why movement was canceled. The documents are forwarded to
the carrier or agent for use in submitting payment for services rendered.
                                                                                              57


10.9.2. If a GBL was not issued, required, or canceled, the TMO obtains an invoice from the
carrier or agent. The invoice should show services rendered up to the time movement were
canceled. The TMO certifies on the invoice that services were performed and payment is due.
Annotate the invoice with the reason movement was canceled and why payment is being made in
this manner. Forward copies of the applicable movement orders and the invoice to the local FSO
for payment.

10.9.3. Note that the use of these procedures for local moves is normally more expensive than
using local P&C contractor rates. Therefore, local moves that use these procedures are subject to
close review by audit, IG inspection, etc.

10.9.4. Keep one copy of each applicable document in the HHG case file for each of the
situations noted in paragraph 10.9.1 or 10.9.2 above.

10.10. General Officer Moves.

10.10.1. Each TMO is responsible for monitoring Air Force General Officer (AFGO) moves.
Origin TMOs must provide complete shipment information to the destination transportation office
and the appropriate MAJCOM Traffic Management Function.

10.10.1.1. MAJCOM Traffic Management Function must consolidate and forward information to
11TRNS/LGTT, 361 Thomas Road Suite 100, Bolling AFB, DC 22032-0101. Advance
notification may be via message, e-mail, or fax. Provide a copy to HQ USAF/ILGT.

10.10.2. The 11th Transportation Squadron, 11th Logistics Group, Bolling AFB, DC acts as the
responsible agency for AFGO moves to, from, and within the National Capitol Region (NCR).
On shipments moving from and within the NCR, they provide counseling, prepare documentation,
and arrange shipment. For those shipments moving to the NCR, they coordinate the arrival and
delivery of all Air Force General Officer moves.

                                  CHAPTER 11
                    EXCESS COST RESPONSIBILITIES/PROCEDURES

11.1. Excess Cost Responsibilities. JPPSO-SAT/ECAF is the Air Force’s executive agency for
adjudicating, reviewing, and processing identified excess cost cases. TMOs are to support
JPPSO-SAT/ECAF efforts as outlined in paragraphs 11.2. through 11.4.1.

11.1.1. JPPSO-SAT/ECAF is chartered to:

11.1.2. Use information on Air Force-funded shipments with potential excess cost provided by
the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).

11.1.3. Identify excess cost on active duty, retired, USAFR, and ANG military personnel and
Department of the Air Force civilian employees.

11.1.4.  Determine which shipment or storage lot results in the least cost to the
member/employee. Notify the responsible TMO when the NTS lot is the least costly.

11.1.5. Initiate collection action by preparing DD Form 139 and submitting it to the
member's/employee’s servicing FSO or DFAS-DE, as appropriate.

11.1.6. Adjudicate excess cost rebuttals for all Air Force-funded shipments. Send final results to
the servicing FSO or DFAS-DE for appropriate action.

11.1.7. Recover unearned transportation charges when a member’s property is lost or irreparably
damaged. The carrier is not entitled to transportation charges paid on that part of the shipment.
Base claims officers mail copies of appropriate forms, for all validated claims, to JPPSO-
SAT/ECAF who determines the weight of these items and computes the charges to be recovered
from carriers.

11.1.8. The FSO or DFAS-DE effects collection if the member/employee agrees with the excess
cost computation. If the member/employee does not agree, comply with processing procedures in
11.4.1.

11.2. Excess Cost Documentation for Members/Employees in Pay Status.

11.2.1. The TMO identifies on the GBL, for members/employees remaining in a pay status, each
of the following: All excess costs incurred as a result of the member requesting higher cost
modes, special services, excess weights, excess mileage, higher release valuation, etc. (See DTR,
Part IV, Chapter 13); The total dollar amount of any local contractual service used at origin for
DPM, Codes 7, 8, J, etc. (example: "P&C Cost" $150"); The applicable aerial or water port
codes (that is, DOV to FRF; 3DK to 2HL) in the remarks column of the GBL for import or
export DPM shipments; and the authorized origin (city, state), destination (city, state), hundred
weight cost, and tariff reference for shipment involving excess distance.
                                                                                              59


11.2.2. Completes TCMD requirements with contractual service cost, pieces, weight and cube
IAW Defense Transportation System (DTS) requirements

11.2.3. Individuals exceeding their unaccompanied baggage (UB) weight allowance are advised
of the premium cost of air versus surface modes. If the member/employee, after notification,
wishes to ship surface, change the shipment mode to reduce excess cost. THIS OPTION MUST
BE MADE BEFORE THE SHIPMENT DEPARTS FROM ORIGIN.

11.2.4. Air Force policy provides automatic TP-2 approval for a member’s/employee’s inter-
theater shipment. TMOs MUST establish procedures to obtain the weights on these shipments
prior to the member’s/employee’s departure to determine if the combined shipment weights are
within the member’s prescribed weight allowance; IF NOT, counsel members/employees
regarding the EXTREME HIGH COST of TP-2 movement and allow them the option of the
cheaper surface movement. THIS OPTION MUST BE MADE BEFORE THE SHIPMENT
DEPARTS FROM ORIGIN.

11.2.5. Local Short Distance Moves. On excess costs for movement under local drayage
contracts, document and forward case file to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

11.3. Excess Cost Documentation for Members/Employees in a NON-PAY Status.

11.3.1. The origin TMO determines in advance that the member/employee is willing to be
financially responsible for all excess costs to effect movement. A member/employee who declines
this option must remove enough weight from the shipment after processing for movement or
storage to bring the weight to/below the weight allowance. All costs involved for the origin
services and re-preparation must be paid by the member/employee.

11.3.2. Advises the member that excess costs should be collected at origin. However shipment is
not routinely placed into SIT at origin pending payment.              If necessary, advise the
member/employee that the debt is turned over to the appropriate out-of-service collection for
processing if payment is not made prior to delivery.

11.3.3. Computes the excess cost. Prepare DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. Include
the appropriate accounting classification and excess cost computation. Place the case file in
suspense pending verification that charges have been paid. Tell the member/employee to give the
FSO the DD Form 1131 with one copy of the DD Form 1299 and applicable special order, with
Cash, certified cashier's check, bank or US Postal Money Order, traveler's checks, or bank draft.
Any combination of the above, in a total amount equal to the computed excess cost, is acceptable.

11.3.4. Tells the member/employee to return a copy of DD Form 1131 showing voucher number,
date, and amount collected to the TMO.

11.3.5. Annotates the original GBL or procurement document ordering the services with the
voucher number, date, and amount collected. If the original documents cannot be annotated,
60


issue a SF 1200, Government Bill of Lading Correction Notice, stating the above information
and forward a copy to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

11.3.5.1. If excess charges are discovered after a shipment departs origin, the origin TMO issues
an SF 1200 stating excess costs were not collected at origin and destination collection action
should be attempted. Forward a copy to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

11.3.5.2. Explain to members in a NON-PAY status that they should contact the destination
TMO for help with excess cost rebuttals.

11.3.6. Destination TMO notifies the member/employee of excess cost and attempts to collect
excess charges at the time of final delivery. If collection action is unsuccessful, issue a GBL
correction notice indicating excess charges were not collected and that a paying officer review is
required. Provide a copy to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF who then initiates Out-of-Service collection
action. NOTE: Property is to be delivered even if the member/employee is no longer in a pay
status.

11.4. Excess Cost Processing and Rebuttal Procedures Upon identification of indebtedness
by JPPSO-SAT/ECAF or TMO:

11.4.1. The servicing FSO complies with procedures in DFAS DEM 7073-1, Volume 1.

11.4.2. A member/employee presenting a rebuttal to an excess-cost charge for shipment of HHG
or a mobile home:

11.4.2.1. Contacts the destination TMO for proper counseling on rebuttal procedures.

11.4.2.2. Prepares a letter stating all reasons for the rebuttal. Include copies of ALL applicable
orders.

11.4.2.3. Provides legible copies of the inventories if the allegations are based on PBP&E.

11.4.2.4. Provides two copies of adjudicated DD Form 1844, List of Property and Claims
Analysis Chart, if allegations are based on missing or irreparably damaged items.

11.4.3. The destination TMO (including JPPSO/CPPSO when applicable):

11.4.3.1. Counsels the member/employee concerning "acceptable evidence" to support an excess
cost rebuttal. The following situations are generally not acceptable as evidence to provide a
lawful basis for adjustments or elimination. Member/employee states or alleges that: the
contractor, carrier, or TMO estimated the weight below the authorized weight allowances;
miscounseling; carrier overpacked the shipment; weights were not properly obtained; weight

                                     Chapter 12
                         JOINT TRAVEL REGULATIONS, VOL 2
                              CIVILIAN ENTITLEMENTS

12.1. Chapter 2 - Transportation Modes, Accommodations, Transportation Requests, and
Baggage. Contains specific entitlements to unaccompanied baggage shipments.

12.2. Chapter 4 - Travel of Employees. Contains specific entitlements for employees.

12.3. Chapter 6 - Travel Under Special Circumstances. Contains specific entitlements for
employees.

12.4. Chapter 8 - Part A HHG Transportation.

12.4.1. (C8020) Unaccompanied Baggage.

12.4.1.1. (C8020-A) General. Arrangements for shipment of unaccompanied baggage should be
made as soon as possible to minimize the requirement for expedited movement. This applies
when permanent duty travel is involved. Stateside shipments of unaccompanied baggage may be
included in the HHG shipment and treated as a partial delivery or shipped separately. When
included in employees’ HHG shipment, unaccompanied baggage MUST be identified at origin so
the carrier can describe items on the inventory as "designated items for extra pickup or delivery."
Costs associated with extra delivery, partial delivery from SIT or movement from temporary
quarters to permanent quarters is paid by civilian employee and subject to reimbursement under
JTR, par. C13215.

NOTE: Additional costs are not considered in determining an employee’s entitlement to GBL
shipment versus commuted rate system (CRS) shipment.

12.5. (C8110) Weight Allowances when Government Furnishings Are Provided. Employees
transferred from unrestricted weight areas to restricted weight areas in the same OCONUS
theater are authorized to ship their full weight allowance to the restricted weight area.

12.6. (C8115) Overweight Shipments.

12.6.1. (C8115-A3) Multiple shipment entitlements are covered in JTR, par. C8405.

12.7. (C8120) Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E) Shipment.

12.7.1. (C8120-A) Policy. The exact weight of approved professional items cannot be
determined until weighed at time of pickup by a carrier or contractor. Therefore, there is no
requirement that PBP&E weight be included in an employee’s travel order. Methods for
determining PBP&E weight are contained in the following paragraphs.
                                                                                                63


12.7.2. (C8120-B) Conditions. The employee furnishes an itemized inventory of the PBP&E
items to the authorizing official at the new PDS. That official certifies the inventory, adds the
correct appropriation, and returns it to the employee. This appropriation can be obtained from the
gaining civilian personnel office and/or the local FSO. The employee furnishes the certification to
the TMO to be made a part of the shipment file. This supports any future disagreement or
rebuttal of excess cost. If a rebuttal is based on incorrect PBP&E weights, copies of these
documents must accompany the rebuttal to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.

12.7.3. (C8120-C) Administrative Expense: The approved items must be separately packed,
marked, and weighed. A clear description of articles must be entered on the carrier or
contractor’s HHG descriptive inventory at the time of pickup. It may not be possible or practical
for the carrier or contractor to scale weigh the articles at the time of pickup. If this occurs, a
constructed weight of 40 pounds per cubic foot per inventory item is authorized. The scale
weight or constructed weight is to be entered on the same line of the inventory next to the
description. When the employee certifies the correctness of the inventory, this also certifies the
correctness of PBP&E items. An employee who does not adhere to these requirements is not
given consideration for PBP&E weight. This applies even though the necessary documents
indicating intent to ship PBP&E were obtained. Enter “__(Insert Weight)_ lbs. of PBP&E is
chargeable to __(insert appropriation)___.” in block 25 of the GBL. In block 28 PBP&E, put
“See Block 25”.        (PBP&E is treated differently for civilian employees than for uniformed
personnel. If the PBP&E is shipped as part of the HHG and the shipment is overweight, no
reduction for PBP&E is authorized. If the shipment MAY be overweight, the PBP&E should be
separated, weighed, and shipped ‘administratively’. See JTR, Chapter 8.)

12.8. PART C: HHG SHIPMENT - METHODS.

12.8.1. (C8220) Cost Comparison. Make sure that the most current rates (commuted rates
versus GBL rates) are used to determine the method of shipment. To calculate the commuted
rate you must use the AMSA Tariff STB-HGB 400 along with the commuted rate schedule
available at http://policyworks.gov/org/main/mt/homepage/mtt/trans/regs_crs.htm.

12.9. PART D: STORAGE IN TRANSIT (SIT).

12.9.1. (C8605) Time Limitations. Approval must be obtained in writing from the
authorizing/order-issuing official. (See paragraph 5.1.2. for procedures once employee obtains
approval.)

12.10. PART E: NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE (NTS) OF HHG - Section 1: Isolated
CONUS PDS Assignment.

12.10.1. (8700) Eligibility. Non-temporary storage while assigned to a designated isolated duty
station requires approval from the order approving/authenticating official that approves
assignment.12.11. Section 2: TO, FROM, AND BETWEEN OCONUS AREAS.

12.11.1. (C8825) Removing HHG From NTS.
64




12.11.1.1. (C8825-B) Government Paid Expenses. Non-temporary storage shipments are
normally located at the place of actual residence; therefore, shipment of the Non-temporary
storage property to an alternate destination almost always results in an excess cost situation.
NOTE: If there is excess cost, DFAS-DE does not accept out of service collection for civilian
personnel. The TMO must obtain the last paying office of record for the civilian employee and
send the DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher & cashiers check/money order to that
location.

12.12. Chapter 10 - Mobile Home Transportation.

12.12.1. (C10001) Reimbursement for Transportation of Mobile Homes in Lieu of Shipment of
HHG:There is no authority to ship HHG removed from mobile home to meet safety requirements
for employees.

12.13. Chapter 11 - Transportation of Privately Owned Motor Vehicles:

12.13.1. (C11005) Transportation of Replacement POV.             The approval authority for this
entitlement is HQ USAF/DPRC.

12.14. Appendix E - Part I: Invitation to Travel.

12.14.1. Part I. Invitation to Travel. Under no circumstances is an Invitation to Travel or a
Contractor Letter of Identification an authorized document to ship personal property for
contractor personnel. Shipment and/or storage of, unaccompanied baggage, and/or personally
owned vehicles addressed under this section apply to contractor personnel and ARE NOT
AUTHORIZED BY GOVERNMENT-ARRANGED METHODS. The only exception to this
policy is to those locations that are inherently military locations where commercial transportation
is not available. (For EXAMPLE: A contractor employee is going to Diego Garcia. Their
company would move their property to Travis AFB CA. The TMO at Travis would arrange for
Airlift since that is the only method of shipment for that destination.) In those instances the
contractor would be required to arrange for delivery of the personal property to the designated
APOE/WPOE for onward movement via AMC/MSC. Contracting officers must coordinate with
the local transportation office on all contract clauses’ containing a transportation agreement. For
contractor billing procedures, reference DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 7, paragraph C.7.2.

A.1.1. Air Force policy is that members assigned to restricted areas generally remain weight
restricted on departure from the area unless exceptions are made by MAJCOM supplements. This
applies if the weight restriction is lifted while the member is still assigned to that area. The
establishment of an effective date for the policy change is designed to apply prospectively, not
retroactively. Therefore, across-the-board approval of full JFTR weight shipments cannot be
authorized for these personnel. However, requests for additional weight can be considered on a
case-by-case basis under the provisions of Attachment 2, Table A2.1.

A.1.2. Normally, single and unaccompanied personnel assigned to, from, and between OCONUS
areas are authorized only UB allowance or 10 percent of full JFTR. (See paragraph 2.2. and
Attachment 3). Exceptions to this policy may be authorized under Attachment 2, Table A2.2.

NOTES:
1. The MPF advises members that the weight of items shipped and stored at government expense may not
exceed their JFTR weight allowance. This includes the weight of any authorized exceptions.
2. Member may be assigned to non-Air Force installations. Another component service may provide
government furniture support. In these cases, the senior Air Force installation commander may approve the
member’s request.
3. The losing TMO advises the MPF if split shipments are prohibited for the country of their location.
4. The MPF advises the member that use of government furniture is not authorized. The MPF forwards a
copy of the member’s approved request to the gaining Furnishings Management Office (SVD).
5. The MPF immediately advises the member to apply for command sponsorship and weight exception.
6. The MPF advises the member that the request must be supported by an appropriate document. A
marriage license, inheritance certificate/will, or medical officer approval is required.
7. The MPF counsels the member concerning exception procedures. This is done during initial
reassignment processing or when it becomes known that an exception is desired, whichever occurs first.
8. If the member was previously assigned to a weight restricted area that is subsequently changed to a full
JFTR weight area, MAJCOM/DPXs may approve a request to ship HHG from storage to full JFTR weight
areas. Members must have an approved tour extension resulting in serving a period of time equal to two
tours, and have elected to return assigned government furniture. These approvals constitute the removal of
a previous administrative weight restriction. An amended order citing current fiscal year funding is
required. Members assigned to weight restricted areas agreeing to, or having served the equivalent of two
tours, may ship additional weight upon departure from the OCONUS permanent duty station. The
MAJCOM/DPX approves up to 2,000 pounds for accompanied members. Two thousand pounds or 25
percent of full JFTR allowance or the unaccompanied baggage allowance (without 10 percent option) may
be approved for unaccompanied members. Members with dependents are not authorized this exception if
they are eligible to serve the accompanied tour and elected the shorter unaccompanied tour. Members must
have at least 12 months remaining at the oversea station on the date HHG are due. MAJCOM/DPX may
delegate this approval authority to Numbered Air Force or base level. Members “are not” subject to
payment of storage changes in excess of 180 days when removing HHG from Non-temporary storage under
these authorities (new, amended, revised, or modified orders).
9. The TMO annotates member’s request to include number and weight of HHG shipped and/or stored on
last PCS. Also, identify HHG erroneously shipped OCONUS but not returned to a proper destination in
accordance with JFTR, par. U5330-D. This weight is authorized, without exception approval, upon
subsequent PCS. Advise the MPF to include the applicable weight in the PCS order (note 1 applies). Also
include, if applicable, the estimate weight and list of items in excess of the prescribed administration weight
allowance.
10. See sample formats in Attachment 9.

 NOTES
 1. The MAJCOM/CE identifies each station or area where government quarters or furniture is not
 available for single and unaccompanied members. This information is to be consolidated and provided to
 HQ AFPC/DPMYCO quarterly through Personnel’s Zeus System 2 program to all MPFs.
 2. MPF advises members that weight of items shipped and stored at government expense may not exceed
 their JFTR weight allowances. This includes weight of any authorized exceptions.
 3. When applicable, rules 5, 7, 8, and 9 of this Attachment, Table A2.1 may be used for unaccompanied
 members.
 4. E-7s and above, without dependents, electing optional base residency, are subject to the above rules.
 They do not get a weight exception based solely on their option to reside off base.
 5. When unaccompanied members are assigned from an OCONUS station where they are authorized a
 HHG weight allowance to another OCONUS station (including Alaska and Hawaii) where they are to be
 provided with government quarters and furnishings, the special order must reflect the weight allowance at
 both stations (i.e., “Member authorized full JFTR weight allowance from Osan AB, Korea. Shipment to
 Elmendorf AFB, AK, limited to unaccompanied baggage or 10% option by surface.”) HHG excess to the
 member’s allowance at the new duty station can be shipped to Non-temporary storage or to a designated
 location in the CONUS.

NOTES:

1. Single and unaccompanied members assigned to duty stations outside the CONUS have two
options. They may ship the normal UB allowance by air or 10 percent of their full JFTR weight
allowances by surface (700 lbs for E-1 through E-4, less than 2 years). This surface option is also
authorized for the member of a military couple not authorized to ship a HHG weight allowance.
When the member elects the surface option, the shipment may include HHG. Split shipments
(part by air, part by surface) are not authorized.

2. For unaccompanied members assigned to Hardlift area, shipment of the 10 percent option, by
air, is authorized.

 NOTES:
 1. (For Entitlement Purposes Only) An origin net weight may be recorded for code 7, 8, J, or
 DPM. A gross reweigh at destination cannot be combined with the origin tare weight to produce
 a lower net weight. On such cases, the reweigh must include both gross and tare weights to be
 valid for adjustment purposes.
 2. When packing and bracing materials are erroneously included as part of the tare weight, a 10
 percent packing allowance applies.
 3. For civilian employees, see Joint Travel Regulations.

         PERSONALLY PROCURED MOVEMENT OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS

A14.1. INTRODUCTION. The personally procured method of HHG transportation is available
to military members and the next of kin of a deceased member. The personally procured method
allows members to personally procure HHG transportation and/or NTS when they have an
entitlement to ship or store HHG in connection with a PCS move, special storage, local move,
etc. A member can use any privately owned vehicle, direct hire or rental of a conveyance (with or
without operator) to move HHG. Reimbursement of actual costs or monetary allowance is
limited to what it would cost the Government to move the actual weight shipped/stored not to
exceed the member’s maximum authorized weight allowance. Under no circumstances is the use
of a Government owned and/or leased vehicle authorized for use. This method allows members
to personally procure transportation and/or NTS of HHG for either:

A14.1.1. Reimbursement of actual cost incurred when Government transportation is not available
and directed by TMO to personally procure transportation for weight moved up to the member’s
maximum authorized weight allowance,

A14.1.2. Reimbursement of actual cost incurred not to exceed the Government Constructed Cost
(GCC) for weight moved up to the members maximum authorized weight allowance, or

A14.1.3. A monetary allowance equal to 95% of the GCC.

NOTE: Under option A14.1.2, reimbursement must not exceed 100% of the GCC Under option
A14.1.3., reimbursement can not exceed 95% of the GCC. If the member’s actual cost exceeds
95% of the GCC then the member can choose option A14.1.2., and then it’s not to exceed 100%
of the GCC.

A14.2. PERSONALLY PROCURED PROCEDURES. The TMO provides members
information on the methods and procedures for performing a personally procured move. Advise
members that they may choose one or a combination of the methods below, either alone or in
conjunction with a Government arranged move. The TMO also prepares a Letter of
Reimbursement, Letter of Non-Availability, TOPS generated DD Form 2278, whichever is
applicable. (Figures A14.1, A14.2, A14.2)

A14.2.1. (U5320-D1) Government Procured HHG Transportation and/or NTS Not Available.

A14.2.1.1. Reimbursement. A member, who is directed in writing by the TMO to personally
procure transportation and/or NTS of HHG because the TMO is unable to procure Government
contractual services (GBL, DPM, etc), is authorized reimbursement of actual costs for
shipment/storage of up to the member’s maximum authorized HHG weight allowance. The TMO
must advise, and get approval from, the appropriate service MAJCOM prior to issuing the
authorization for actual cost reimbursement. NOTE: This method can be extremely costly and
should only be applied in circumstances where no transportation services are available.
                                                                                               83



A14.2.1.2. Personally Procured Authorization. The TMO provides authorization in the form of a
Letter of Non-Availability to the member when directing a member to personally procure
transportation and/or NTS of HHG for Actual Cost Reimbursement under JFTR, par. U5320-D1.
Figure A14.2.

A14.2.1.3. Advance Authorization. When a TMO directs a member to personally procure
transportation and/or NTS, the member may be provided an advance monetary allowance equal to
the commercial carrier’s written estimated expenses (JFTR, par. U5385, item a), to ship the
member’s HHG not to exceed the full JFTR weight allowance. The member must provide a copy
of the carrier’s estimated expenses, the Letter of Non-Availability and a copy of the order to the
appropriate finance office for the advance.

A14.2.1.4. (U5340-E) Special Routing and Services. Any special routing and services requested
under this section are not included as part of the actual cost and are not reimbursable.

A14.2.1.5. Storage in Transit (SIT). If the member personally procures transportation services
with a commercial company and requires/requests SIT, the member must make arrangements
directly with the carrier for storage. Without prior authorization, SIT may not exceed 90 days.
The member may later request reimbursement, for not to exceed 90 days of SIT. If the member
moves HHG and requires/requests Government SIT, the TMO must make the necessary
arrangements. In ether instance, the request for additional storage beyond 90 days is handled
IAW established SIT criteria outlined in the paragraph 5.1.2, and DTR, Part IV, Chapter 406.

A14.2.2. (U5320-D2) Government Procured HHG Transportation and/or NTS Available.

A14.2.2.1. (U5320-D2a) Reimbursement of the Actual Cost not to exceed the GCC
Transportation and/or NTS. A member who desires to personally procure transportation or NTS
of HHG is authorized reimbursement of actual costs, not to exceed the GCC for actual weight
moved up to the member’s maximum authorized weight allowance. The GCC includes all
authorized charges that would have been used to procure government contractual services
outlined in the applicable MTMC solicitation, DPM contract or BOA at point of origin.)

A14.2.2.1.1. Personally Procured Authorization. When a member requests to personally procure
transportation and/or NTS of HHG, the TMO issues a TOPS generated DD Form 2278.

A14.2.2.1.2. Advance Authorized. When a member desires to personally procure transportation
and/or NTS, the member may be provided an advance monetary allowance equal to the
commercial carrier's estimated expenses, not to exceed 100% of the GCC (JFTR, par. U5385 item
b). The member must provide a copy of the written estimate to the TMO. If the member does
not want an advance monetary allowance, the TMO enters “N/A” in applicable block under 8.a.
on TOPS generated DD Form 2278.

A14.2.2.2. (U5320-D2b) Payment of Monetary Allowance. A member who desires to
personally procure transportation and/or NTS of HHG may choose to receive a monetary
allowance equal to 95% of the GCC for actual weight moved up to the member’s maximum
84



authorized weight allowance. GCC includes all authorized charges that would have been used as
outlined in the applicable solicitation and ten dollars ($10) per hundredweight for packing. For
local moves the TMO uses the applicable local move contract rate.

A14.2.2.2.1. Personally Procured Authorization. When a member requests to personally procure
transportation and/or NTS of HHG, the TMO issues a TOPS generated DD Form 2278.

A14.2.2.2.2. Advance Authorized. Under this option if a member desires to personally procure
transportation and/or NTS of HHG for a monetary allowance, the member may be provided an
advance monetary allowance equal to 60% of the 95% GCC based on an estimated weight
provided by the member not to exceed the member’s JFTR weight allowance. (JFTR, par. U5385
item c). If the member does not want an advance monetary allowance, the TMO enters “N” in
applicable block under 8.g on TOPS generated DD Form 2278.

A14.2.2.2.3. Direct Hire or Rental of a Conveyance. When computing GCC for paragraph
A14.2.1, and A14.2.2, the cost of the direct hire or rental of a conveyance (with or without
operator and/or hire of an operator of a conveyance) is included as part of the actual cost.

A14.2.2.2.4. Storage-In-Transit. The member may make arrangements with the carrier for
temporary storage, not to exceed 90 days. The member should be advised by the TMO during
counseling that he/she is responsible for coordinating storage and payment directly with the
carrier. The member may later request reimbursement, not to exceed 90 days. If additional
storage is required, the member may request approval of an additional 90 days storage
reimbursement from the TMO. If approved, the TMO must document the approval using DD
Form 1857 in 90-day increments IAW established SIT criteria outlined in the paragraph 5.1.2,
JFTR, and DTR, Part IV, Chapter 406. The TMO may assist the member in arranging for
temporary storage if requested by the member by putting property in SIT at Government expense
and paying for storage/delivery using invoicing procedures (purchase agreement). Any storage
facility must be a licensed business.

A14.2.3. Shipments Weighing Less Than 500 lbs. If a shipment moved under paragraphs
A14.2.1 or A14.2.2 above weighs less than 500 lbs., compute GCC using the “500 lb. to 999 lb.”
baseline rate, constructed costs are calculated on actual/estimated weight. For example on a 250-
lb. shipment going 600 miles the section 3 baseline rate is $58.85 per hundredweight. Calculate
as follows: $58.85 (baseline rate) plus $10.00 (packing) times 250 lbs. equals $172.13.

A14.2.4. Use of Mail or Small Package Service. The method of movement has no bearing on the
member’s entitlement to receive a monetary allowance. If a member chooses to mail or use a
small package service the receipt/invoice must include mailing facility address, date, weight and
cost. The member must follow the procedures in A14.14. Cost of insurance is not
reimbursable.

A14.3. (U5380) NON-TEMPORARY STORAGE. Storage facilities authorized for use in the
long-term storage of HHG consist of commercial warehouses or self-storage facilities where the
                                                                                                85



general public may store property (For example, storage in a private residence or garage or on a
private lot does not constitute storage at a commercial facility).

A14.3.1. The TMO must use the lowest applicable rates contained in the current Basic Ordering
Agreement (BOA) modification, (i.e., Packing, Handle In, Drayage-In, Handle Out, and Storage).

A14.3.2. Member can obtain advance monetary allowance or reimbursement for the initial
storage. Monthly storage charges may be reimbursed quarterly or at the end of the authorized
storage period.

A14.3.2.1. The member must submit paid storage receipts to the nearest TMO along with a copy
of a letter showing the monthly storage rate.

A14.3.2.2. The TMO computes the storage charges using the GCC monthly rate times the
number of months paid by the member.

A14.3.2.3. TMO completes by identifying the government’s maximum reimbursement.

A14.4. COUNSELING. It is imperative that members, in receipt of orders, obtain
counseling/authorization for their moves from origin/local TMOs. If the member is unable to
travel to the origin/local TMO due to excessive distance or time constraints, a faxed authorization
may be provided by the TMO upon request. The TMO must maintain a copy/record of all faxed
authorizations provided.

A14.4.1. TMO bases the reimbursement and/or monetary allowance computations on estimated
weight provide by the member or actual, constructed, or authorized JFTR weight allowances
transported, whichever is less.

A14.4.2. Advise members where to find Government and commercial scales.

A14.4.3. Inform member that acceptable tare and gross weight tickets as described in paragraph
A14.7 must be submitted for final processing of reimbursement and/or monetary allowance
payment.

A14.4.4. The TMO should always brief the member that he/she is subject to excess cost for all
transportation costs arising from the services listed in JFTR, par. U5340-A.

A14.4.5. The TMO bases the monetary allowance on the remaining balance of the member’s
JFTR weight allowance when multiple shipments are involved.

A14.4.6. Active-duty, retired, or separated members may obtain advance monetary allowances to
defray expenses (see paragraphs A14.2.1.3, A14.2.2.1.2, A14.2.2.2.2, and A14.3.2.).

A14.5. MORE THAN ONE SHIPMENT UNDER THE SAME ORDER. If a member
makes more than one type of shipment (i.e., Government arranged and Personally Procured) the
86



TMO adds personally procured documentation to the member’s domestic or international case
file.

A14.5.1. The origin and destination TMO sends a copy of all personally procured move, line-
haul, NTS or local-move documentation to JPPSO-SAT (ECAF), 613 Northwest Loop 410 Suite
400, San Antonio, TX 78216-5518

A14.5.2. If the personally procured shipment is the last shipment, the TMO bases the GCC and
the monetary allowance on the part of the member’s weight allowance that remains or the actual
net weight shipped, whichever is less.

Example: MSgt with dependents ships 11,800 pounds HHG (includes 280 pounds PBP&E) by
ITGBL method and 520 pounds by parcel post from OCONUS and self procures movement of
2,500 pounds HHG from a designated CONUS location.

OCONUS GBL Move 11,800 less 280 PBP&E                                                 11,520
Less 10 % packing allowance                                                                 -
1,152
Subtotal GBL Move                                                                     10,368
Parcel post shipment (no packing allowance authorized)                                   520
Total weight shipped from OCONUS                                             10,888

JFTR Weight Allowance                                                                 12,500
Less total weight shipped from OCONUS                                                 10,888
Authorized weight remaining for personally procured calculation                        1,612

A14.5.2.1. If the Government arranged shipment is the last, the TMO enters the personally
procured move information (i.e., estimated/actual weight, shipment from/to, mileage, etc) in
remarks block on DD Form 1299.

A14.5.2.2. On the SF 1203, US Government Bill of Lading – Privately Owned Personal
Property, TMO enters “Paying Officer Review” in block 34, checks the “other” block, and enters
“Personally Procured Move” in block 25.

A14.5.3. If a member separates from the service in a non-pay status, the TMO reviews all
shipment(s) information to ensure calculation of GCC is correct prior to processing through the
appropriate Financial Service Office (FSO) for payment.

A14.6. VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. There are no restrictions as to the type of POV or
equipment used to perform personally procured transportation of HHG. Government owned
vehicles are not authorized under this program.

A14.6.1. A member who uses a personally owned utility trailer for an authorized personally
procured move may include the weight of the utility trailer in the total weight. The utility trailer
weight applies one time only if trailer is used as the means of conveyance.
                                                                                                   87




A14.6.1.1. Such a trailer includes any authorized trailer (other than a camper trailer travel trailer,
or horse trailer) that a commercial carrier could legally accept and transport as HHG.

A14.6.1.2. The member or member’s dependent must own the trailer prior to the effective date of
the PCS or TDY order.

A14.6.2. Reimbursement and/or a monetary allowance is authorized for HHG moved in
personally owned car-top carrier that would be accepted for shipment by a carrier. However, the
weight of a rented or borrowed car-top carrier for GCC cost computations is not authorized.

A14.6.2.1. The weight of a camper or POV with a previously installed camper shell, built-in
HHG and any other previously installed equipment is to be included in the tare weight of a
personally procured HHG move.

A14.6.2.2. Tare weight is defined as the weight of the POV and/or rental equipment as the
weight of the vehicle with all pads, furniture dollies, hand trucks, ramps, and other equipment
required to transport HHG.

A14.6.2.3. Packing, crating materials, drivers or passengers cannot be in vehicles at the time of
tare weighing. Drivers and passengers cannot be in the vehicle at the time of fully-loaded
weighing.

A14.7. SHIPMENT WEIGHT. Weight tickets that do not contain all increments of data in
accordance with A14.14, but appear valid and reflect the actual weight moved, must be processed
for a monetary allowance when verified by the TMO.

A14.7.1. Tell members where to submit weight tickets and other required paperwork to get GCC
and reimbursement and/or monetary allowance.

A14.7.2. TMOs may authorize/approve the use of constructed weights when circumstances listed
in JFTR, par. U5320-D3b, apply. For example:

A14.7.2.1. Government move would be paid on the basis of a factor other than weight.

A14.7.2.2. Scales are not available. (i.e., from/to/between Government quarters)

A14.7.2.3. Public and Government scales are closed because of time of day or holiday.

A14.7.3. Prior to approving the use of constructed weights for shipments described above,
TMOs must obtain a properly completed inventory of property (DD Form 1701, Inventory of
Household Goods or comparable form.). (TMOs may use and print from the JPPSO-SAT Web
site the on-line weight estimator.) This establishes constructed weight BEFORE the move is
performed. The TMO certifies the inventory to ensure all items listed qualify as HHG and that
calculations are correct.
88




A14.7.4. In other cases when a member cannot get weight tickets because of unusual
circumstances the Installation Transportation Officer, Squadron Commander, Chief of
Transportation or JPPSO Director/Deputy Director may authorize/approve the use of constructed
weights. In those instances the following documentation is required to support determination:

A14.7.4.1. DD Form 1701 or JPPSO-SAT estimator signed by the member and certified by the
TMO.

A14.7.4.2. Member certification that the listed property was transported during the move.

A14.7.4.3. A letter, from the member, explaining the reason weight tickets were not available.

A14.7.4.4. Copy of TOPS generated DD Form 2278.

A14.7.4.5. Copies of applicable travel orders, including any amendments.

A14.7.4.6. Legible copy of the vehicle rental contract if applicable.

A14.7.5. If a member includes PBP&E (JFTR, par. U5310-C) in the personally procured move, a
detailed list must be provided to the TMO at the time of counseling. This list must be
authorized/approved by TMO or designated representative using the cubic foot method. A DD
Form 1701, JPPSO-SAT estimator or similar document may be used to calculate PBP&E weight.
This establishes the PBP&E weight to be deducted from the member’s JFTR weight allowance
only and has nothing to do with computing the weight moved. Attach a copy of the approved list
to the TOPS generated DD Form 2278 and retain copy in member’s case file.

A14.7.5.1. PBP&E list must contain property as defined in JFTR, Appendix A.

A14.7.5.2. TMO must include estimated PBP&E weight on TOPS generated PPM letter.

A14.7.5.3. PBP&E is computed using 40 pounds per cubic foot.

A14.7.6. Compute the estimated GCC based on a member’s estimated weight to include PBP&E.
Advise members that FSO pursues’ collection action to recover any payment received if all
requirements have not been completed.

A14.7.7. Compute miles between authorized points based on the ‘Shortest’ point-to-point
mileage in Defense Table of Distance (DTOD).

A14.8. DOCUMENTATION. The TMO where a member first makes contact concerning a
personal procured move prepares TOPS generated DD Form 2278 and computes the GCC. This
information provides the member with an estimated dollar amount for reimbursement and/or
monetary allowance.
                                                                                              89



A14.8.1. Using applicable rates from the Domestic or International Rate Solicitation, local
drayage contract or NTS contract, complete appropriate Letter of Non-Availability TOPS
generated DD Form 2278 except for TMO certification of GCC segment at the bottom of the
page.

A14.8.1.1. Prepare two sets of documents for a round-trip TDY.

A14.8.1.2. Advise members to provide separate weight tickets for each segment of their moves.

A14.8.2. Distribute copies of TOPS generated DD Form 2278 as follows:

A14.8.2.1. TMO retains one copy in an outbound shipment file.

A14.8.2.2. The member retains the remaining copies for submission to the TMO that supports
the paying FSO.

A14.8.3. When a member sends acceptable weight tickets and TOPS generated DD Form 2278
to the TMO or applicable FSO that is identified by branch of service or gaining station, the TMO:

A14.8.3.1. Computes GCC using applicable rates.

A14.8.3.2. Use weight “break point weights” to establish the appropriate rate for all shipments
other than local moves or NTS.

A14.8.3.3. For shipments moving between CONUS and Canada or Mexico, use the base-line
percentage and tender number cited in the MTMC International Personal Property Rate
Solicitation, Chapter 10, Special Solicitation.

A14.8.3.4. For local moves or NTS shipments, use the applicable local move and NTS contract
rates.

A14.8.4. Multiply line-haul rate plus the $10.00 per hundredweight (CWT) maximum-pack
charge times the applicable weight (actual weight or member’s authorized weight allowance,
whichever is less). For local moves, NTS shipments or shipments being released from NTS
storage, TMO multiplies contract rate times shipment weight. The $10.00 packing rate does not
apply to NTS or Local move shipments. Contract rates include packing cost.

A14.8.5. The TMO or finance office that certifies actual GCC establishes a 45-day suspense from
the date of the move, and awaits receipt of weight tickets and Letter of Non-Availability or TOPS
generated DD Form 2278 from the member. If the separatee does not return the required
documents within 45 days, the TMO must advise the appropriate FSO, in writing, to take
collection action of any advance monetary allowance if appropriate.

A14.8.5.1. If the member later provides acceptable weight tickets, the TMO processes the
paperwork for payment.
90




A14.8.6. If a member makes a local-vicinity or NTS move under the personally procured method,
within or outside CONUS, the TMO uses the rate and minimum specified in the local contract
times the actual weight or member’s weight allowance, whichever is less. EXCEPTION: Moves
made incident to JFTR, pars. U5355-C, U5355-D1, U5355-D2, U5380-G2a and U5380-G2b are
authorized drayage without regard to the member’s prescribed weight allowance.

A14.8.7. For shipments releasing from NTS, a legible copy of the storage contractor’s inventory
must be used by the member to check for overages, shortages, or damage. If damage exists or if
an item is short, a DD Form 1840, Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery, is prepared.
Both parties (member and warehouseman) must sign and date the DD Form 1840, each retaining
a legible copy for their respective files. If there is no indication of loss or damage at the pick-up
point (i.e., no DD Form 1840 initiated), the member assumes all responsibility for loss or damage.

A14.9. INSURANCE COVERAGE. The TMO advises members of their rights to file claims
with the Government for loss or damage under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’
Claims Act (Title 31 U.S.C. sections 3701 and 3721). Claims are generally only paid for those
damages incurred due to circumstances beyond a member’s control (vehicle accidents, leakage,
fires, or thefts in which the member is free of negligence). Members may want to consider buying
private insurance to cover HHG being transported if they believe the basic valuation coverage by
the government ($40,000.00) is not enough to cover the value of their property. This added
protection may be especially important if the member is moving items for which the government
may pay limited maximum amounts if lost or damaged. Cost of additional insurance is not
reimbursable. Members should contact the local claims office for information on maximum
amounts.

A14.9.1. The TMO advises members who plan to use a trailer for a personally procured move to
check their automobile insurance policy to determine if they are properly covered in case of loss
or damage. Some automobile insurance companies extend coverage when trailers are towed
behind a POV; others may not. The member must procure additional insurance if required. The
Government does not reimburse insurance cost.

A14.9.2. The TMO advises members that if they are involved in accidents, the other parties may
file claims against the members or their insurance companies. In such cases, the law of the state
where the accident occurs determines liability.

A14.9.2.1. Some courts have determined that members operating privately owned or rented
vehicles on change-of-station moves are not acting within the scope of their employment. Thus,
they may not be protected by the Federal Tort Claims Act, Title 28 U.S.C. §2679(b). As a result,
members may be held personally liable if they have inadequate insurance coverage to satisfy all
damage and third-party injury claims or lawsuits resulting from an accident.

A14.9.2.2. If a member is involved in an accident, he or she should notify the staff judge
advocate at the nearest military base about the accident as soon as possible.
                                                                                             91



A14.10. PERSONALLY PROCURED MOVES OCONUS. A member may personally
procure HHG shipment services to and from OCONUS. However, the TMO should advise the
member that if choosing to personally procure transportation of HHG to an OCONUS area, that
he/she is entirely responsible for all issues related to the Status Of Forces Agreement (SOFA),
import/export processes, tariffs, customs, etc. TMO’S SHOULD DISCOURAGE THIS
UNLESS THE MEMBER IS THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH INTERNATIONAL
REQUIREMENTS.

A14.10.1. Members doing a personally procured move OCONUS should be briefed IAW
applicable International Rate Solicitation section. Shipments moving Intra-theater are computed
using the lowest MTMC linehaul rate on file as established by the local command’s procedures.
Shipment moving from CONUS to OCONUS are computed based on the lowest applicable
International Single Factor Rate (which includes packing).

A14.10.1.1. A retiree’s or separatee’s personally procured move must be computed using the
applicable Rate Solicitation based upon entitlements contained in JFTR pars. U5125, U5130,
U5360 and U5365.

A14.10.2. For shipments to Mexico the TMO uses the applicable section of the International
Rate Solicitation plus $10.00 CWT for packing if applicable. The TMO should advise the
member that a registered customs broker must process shipments for relocating dependents or if
the member is a retiree or separatee not officially assigned to duty in Mexico.

A14.10.2.1. Advise members that they must provide the customs broker with a detailed list (in
Spanish) of all property being transported into Mexico.

A14.10.2.2. Customs-broker offices are located in all border cities.

A14.11. UNAUTHORIZED ITEMS.                  See JFTR, Appendix A for definition of HHG.
However:

A14.11.1. If members choose to move unauthorized/hazardous items with their personally
procured shipment, they may do so only after establishing the net weight of the authorized items
contained within the shipment.

A14.11.2. Members who include unauthorized/hazardous items in the weight of their personally
procured moves may forfeit their monetary allowance or reimbursement and have their case files
turned over to appropriate authorities for review.

A14.12. COMBINED SHIPMENTS – MILITARY MARRIED TO MILITARY. A
husband and wife who are both military members may ship or store their combined JFTR
authorized weight allowances. A copy of each member’s order is required.

A14.12.1. Prepare two TOPS generated DD Form 2278s (one for each member).
92



A14.12.2. The TMO authorizes each member half the operating allowance based on combined
total estimated weight and each member gets half the incentive payment based on combined total
actual weight moved.

A14.13. LETTERS.

A14.13.1 Letter Requesting reimbursement for personally procured shipment (Figure A14.1)

A14.13.2 Letter of Non-Availability (TMO not available - letter from TMO stating why
government procured transportation is not available. (Figure A14.2)

A14.13.3. Personally Procured Move (PPM) Letter (TMO available) - TOPS generated DD
Form 2278is used for authorization, counseling and to compute the government constructed cost

A14.14. MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES. Members must obtain weight tickets for all
personally procured moves, regardless of weight allowance.

A14.14.1. State approved scales should provide weight tickets that contain the following
information:

A14.14.1.1. Complete name and location of the scale.

A14.14.1.2. Date of each weighing.

A14.14.1.3. Identification of weight entries as tare, gross, or net weights.

A14.14.1.4. Company or carrier identification of the vehicle or license number of POV required.

A14.14.1.5. Member’s name.

NOTE: Weight tickets that only contain segments of the information prescribed above, yet
appear to be valid and reflect the actual weight moved, must be processed for monetary allowance
payment when verified by the TMO.

A14.14.2. Axle scale weights are permitted when local or state law does not otherwise restrict
them.

A14.14.3. Members may obtain weight tickets at Government, commercial or public scales
certified for use within the state. NOTE: Typically, roadside scales located at interstate highway
weigh stations do not meet requirements for certified scales and or certified weigh masters.

A14.14.4. Members provide the original DD Form 1351-2 to the paying FSO identified in block
4g of the TOPS generated DD Form 2278.
                                                                                                93



A14.14.5. Complete Personally Procured Checklist and Certification of Expenses.

A14.15. PERSONALLY PROCURED TRANSPORTATION AND/OR NTS OF HHG
WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL. Payment of a monetary allowance may be authorized when
an event beyond a member’s control prevents prior approval and issuance of Letter of
Reimbursement, Letter of Non-availability or TOPS generated DD Form 2278 for a personally
procured HHG transportation and/or NTS move. The member must have accomplished all other
aspects of the personally procured move procedures i.e., obtained necessary weight tickets or
qualified for constructed weight; and, possessed a valid authority (special order or funded housing
assignment/termination authorization) prior to accomplishing the move (see A14.7.) A monetary
payment may also be authorized in other cases when a member cannot obtain weight tickets
because of unusual circumstances (i.e., weight tickets lost or stolen).

A14.15.1. Approval authority for the above circumstances is delegated to the Traffic
Management Officer, or equivalent. The use of constructed weights to authorize payment of
monetary allowance under these circumstances is authorized. When these operations are
contracted, the functional Director (Government personnel) having oversight of the contracted
operations must approve/disapprove use of constructed weights.

A14.15.2. Any questionable case may be forwarded to the applicable MAJCOM for review and
appropriate action.

A14.16. FINAL SETTLEMENT. Operating expense receipts are not required for submission
to finalize settlement of a personally procured move. However, it is the member's responsibility to
retain moving expense records IAW with IRS regulations. Monies paid in addition to actual
moving expenses may be taxable.
