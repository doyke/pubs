3. Definitions.
   3.1. S&T Investment Hierarchy. AFRL’s S&T Investment Hierarchy for managing work
   and resources consists of four clearly defined levels as depicted in Figure 1. All work, both
   AFRL core funded and externally funded, is to be accounted for within this hierarchy.

Figure 1. AFRL’s S&T Investment Hierarchy




       3.1.1. AFRL S&T Taxonomy. The AFRL S&T Taxonomy, as depicted in Figure 2,
       captures all resources (core and external) executed by AFRL. The highest level of the
4                                                     AFRLI61-205 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


    taxonomy consists of three portfolios: Tech Base, Capabilities, and Mission Support.
    Other portfolios can be created at the discretion of AFRL Senior Leadership (see
    paragraph 3.1.1.1).
       3.1.1.1. Portfolio. The Portfolio is the highest level of the investment hierarchy and
       is a collection of products, programs, or work units. There are three portfolios, with 2
       sub-portfolios each, to which all programs must align. There are other major
       portfolios used in planning, programming, and execution, e.g., Core Technical
       Competencies, Tech Focus Areas, and Service Core Functions. AFRL Leadership
       can exercise the option to create ad hoc portfolios. Portfolios are critical to the
       enterprise analysis of programs. Specific Portfolio attributes to input into the tool are
       defined in Attachment 2.
           3.1.1.1.1. Tech Base Portfolio. The Tech Base Portfolio captures technology
           efforts that are predominately at the basic and applied research level and are not
           tied to major customer driven demonstrations. Two sub-portfolios exist under this
           level: Science & Knowledge and Technologies.
              3.1.1.1.1.1. Science & Knowledge Portfolio. The Science and Knowledge
              sub-portfolio captures all 6.1 funded research efforts, 6.2 and other funded
              research efforts that are not planned to result in an enduring piece of hardware
              or software and is not expected to transition directly to a customer. The main
              deliverable of this technology work and analysis is a report.
              3.1.1.1.1.2. Technologies. The       Technologies     sub-Portfolio    captures
              technology efforts that are planned to result in an enduring piece of hardware
              or software and are not tied to a major demonstration for a customer.
           3.1.1.1.2. Capabilities Portfolio. The Capabilities Portfolio captures research
           efforts that are tied to major customers’ demand signals and demonstrations.
              3.1.1.1.2.1. Concepts Portfolio. The Concepts sub-portfolio captures
              technology efforts that are planned to result in an enduring piece of hardware
              or software and the efforts are tied to a major demonstration for a customer.
              All Advanced Technology Demonstrations, Joint Capability Technology
              Demonstrations and efforts designated by the AFRL Capability Council, are
              part of this portfolio.
AFRLI61-205 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                   5


Figure 2. AFRL S&T Taxonomy




                3.1.1.1.2.2. Flagships Portfolio. The Flagship sub-portfolio captures
                technology efforts that have been approved by the Air Force Requirements
                Oversight Council and designated by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force
                as a Flagship Capability Concept.
            3.1.1.1.3. Mission Support Portfolio. The Mission Support Portfolio captures
            all efforts that directly or indirectly support the Tech Base and Capabilities
            Portfolios. The Mission Support Portfolio consists of the Product Support and
            Organizational Support sub-portfolios.
                3.1.1.1.3.1. Product Support Portfolio. The Product Support sub-portfolio
                captures research directly contributing to the technical goals of the Tech Base
                and Capabilities Portfolios. This does not include Advisory & Assistance
                Services (A&AS).
                3.1.1.1.3.2. Organizational Support Portfolio. The Organizational Support
                sub-portfolio captures all the resources and funding defined by AFRL/FM as
                indirect and overhead costs.
     3.1.2. Product. Two or more programs that together produce a capability, technology,
     scientific advancement or service (services only apply to the Organizational Support sub-
     portfolio). It has a defined scope and may have a defined start and stop date. It is
     managed by cost, schedule, performance and risk. The Product level is used primarily for
     large efforts encompassing many programs, whether they are in a single technology
     directorate or across directorates. Product is further defined by a set of attributes defined
     in Attachment 3.
     3.1.3. Program. One or more work units or technical efforts that together produce a
     result that advances one or more technologies. A program has a defined scope, goal(s),
6                                                        AFRLI61-205 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


       objective(s), schedule (milestones, decision points, and may have a start and stop date),
       and is uniquely identified by a set of attributes defined in Attachment 4. This is the level
       at which AFRL corporately plans, develops AFRL’s Program Objective Memorandum
       (POM), and tracks execution. The program is managed by cost, schedule, performance
       and risk. In the Organizational Support sub-portfolio, a program is composed of one or
       more support units or efforts that provide a service.
       3.1.4. Work Unit. The basic building block of the AFRL portfolio. The smallest unit of
       technically distinct work (i.e., distinct scope and objective) that is managed by cost,
       schedule, performance, and risk. Work units are further defined by the set of attributes in
       Attachment 5. Work units are optional for use in tracking programs for planning, but
       must be recorded in IPPM to satisfy external Unified Research & Engineering Database
       (URED) and Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) reporting.
       3.1.5. Support Unit. The smallest unit of indirect or overhead work that is managed by
       cost, schedule, or performance. An example of a Support unit might be a facility contract
       or an A&AS contract. Support Units are further defined by the set of attributes in
       Attachment 6.
    3.2. Product, Program, Work Unit and Support Unit Lifecycle Phases.
       3.2.1. Strategic Planning: The period prior to the AFRL POM process. During this
       phase, the Capability Leads and TDs/711 HPW analyze the DoD and AF Visions and
       Strategies, and major customers’ gaps and needs, and create science and technology
       options as possible responses to the gaps and needs.
       3.2.2. Initiation Phase: The Initiation phase occurs between the completion of Strategic
       Planning and submission of AFRL’s POM input to Air Force Materiel Command
       (AFMC). During this phase, AFRL decides which technology option(s) to pursue to fill
       the gap or need, defines the technology effort(s) (cost, schedule and top level
       performance), and allocates AFRL resources in the POM. For work units and support
       units, this phase coincides with the planning phase.
       3.2.3. Planning Phase: The planning phase is where the detailed plan and baseline
       addressing cost, schedule, performance and risk management is developed and refined in
       preparation for the start of the Execution and Control Phase.
          3.2.3.1. POM Planning: POM Planning occurs between the submission of the POM
          to AFMC and the AF submitting the POM to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
          During this phase, the TDs/711 HPW develop their detailed technical approach,
          initial plan, draft baseline, and identify resource and facility needs for Products and
          Programs.
          3.2.3.2. Execution Planning: Execution Planning occurs within six months of
          starting the Execution and Control Phase. During this phase, the TDs/711 HPW
          accomplish detailed execution planning to include finalizing the cost, schedule,
          performance and risk baseline for Products and Programs, awarding contracts,
          creating work units and/or lower level technology efforts (if applicable), and secure
          resources and facilities commitments.
AFRLI61-205 26 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                                  7


      3.2.4. Execution and Control: The Execution and Control phase starts when technical
      work begins, with the execution of the first dollar, and ends with completion of the effort
      and delivery of its last deliverable and final report. During this phase, the TDs/711 HPW
      execute their detailed plan, measure performance against the cost, schedule, performance
      and risk baseline and make adjustments as required.
      3.2.5. Close-Out: The Close-Out phase starts as the completion of the effort nears. This
      phase involves final submission of documentation of the effort to DTIC, final data entries
      in IPPM, lessons learned, and close-out of any contracts.
   3.3. Integrated Project and Portfolio Management (IPPM). IPPM is a subset of the
   AFRL Enterprise tools for Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPB&E).
   This suite of tools enables AFRL to accomplish planning, programming, and execution of
   core and external funds received by AFRL and to manage the technical work to achieve the
   goals of the Air Force.
      3.3.1. ClarityTM. ClarityTM provides functionality for capturing and managing
      Products, Programs, work units and collections of products, programs, and work units
      called Portfolios. Products, Programs and work units are defined in ClarityTM in
      technically descriptive fields and by attributes. Where records in the Comprehensive
      Cost and Requirement System (CCaR) align to the program and/or work unit, financial
      execution data is displayed in ClarityTM
      3.3.2. Comprehensive Cost and Requirement System (CCaR). CCaR is the financial
      management tool of the IPPM suite. It captures and tracks financial execution data at the
      Program level by AFRL business rule, but is flexible enough to allow for lower level
      records such as work unit or job order number (JON). CCaR links to standard Air Force
      financial systems.
      3.3.3. Enterprise Plans & Programs (EP&P). The EP&P tool is built on the IBMTM
      COGNOS tool. It collects Program level funding data that captures programmed and
      required budget data for the POM and provides “What if?” capability for budget analysis.
      Programs must first be created, validated, and approved in Clarity TM in order for them
      to be eligible to receive planned funding in EP&P.
      3.3.4. IBMTM COGNOS Reports. IBMTM COGNOS reporting software is used for
      portfolio, program and work unit reporting, and dashboard display.
4. AFRL Business Rules.
   4.1. In order to maintain the hierarchy and consistent reporting established above and to
   allow the various tools to integrate the data for use, certain rules must be followed.
      4.1.1. A work unit links to one and only one Program when used as an integral part of
      detailed program planning and execution. This is necessary to enable the IPPM tools to
      seamlessly accomplish financial tracking.
      4.1.2. A program links to one and only one Product to enable financial roll-up in the
      IPPM tools.
      4.1.3. A product, program or work unit belongs to one and only one AFRL S&T
      Taxonomy portfolio. A product, program or work unit may belong to any number of
      portfolios outside the AFRL S&T Taxonomy.
8                                                   AFRLI61-205 26 SEPTEMBER 2013


    4.1.4. When using work units as an integral part of detailed program planning and
    execution, a work unit that dedicates a subset of defined resources or deliverables to a
    specific Tech Base or Capabilities program is linked in ClarityTM to one Product Support
    Program, eliminating the need to link one work unit to multiple programs.
    4.1.5. TDs/711 HPW will populate CCaR with their core S&T budgets and external
    funding at the ClarityTM Program level or below. All record entries must reference the
    ClarityTM unique identification (ID) number in the “IT Prog# field”. This enables the
    comparison of program execution to program planning.
    4.1.6. Any external funding must also be entered and matched to a ClarityTM Program
    ID. If there is no existing ClarityTM Program that includes the scope of the customers
    work, either create a new ClarityTM Program or expand the scope of an existing ClarityTM
    Program to accommodate the work.

                               WORK UNIT ATTRIBUTE LIST

A5.1. The Work Unit Attribute List (Table A5.1) contains the minimum data required to be
entered into the tools by the TDs/711 HPW to initiate, execute and close-out a work unit. The
required data is phased to match the maturity and lifecycle of a work unit. Work Units are
optional for use in tracking programs for planning, but must be recorded in IPPM to satisfy
external URED and Defense Technical DTIC reporting. The phases are defined in paragraph
3.2. Note: The X is marked in the first phase that the attribute is required. The attribute is
required to be updated with any changes in all subsequent phases.

A6.1. The Support Unit Attribute List (Table A6.1) contains the minimum data required to be
entered into the tools by the TDs to initiate, execute and close-out a support unit. The required
data is phased to match the maturity and lifecycle of a support unit. The phases are defined in
paragraph 3.2. Note: The X is marked in the first phase that the attribute is required. The
attribute is required to be updated with any changes in all subsequent phases.
