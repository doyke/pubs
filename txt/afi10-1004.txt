                                            Chapter 1

                                    GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this Instruction is to provide installation commanders the
appropriate guidance to host the most successful open house for their particular location. This
Instruction is written to support planning and execution by providing planning staffs relevant
interpretations of numerous regulations, instructions, organizations and functions. It supersedes
policy memoranda from AF/CV, Gen Carns (July 1994), AF/CV, Gen Moorman, (March 1996)
and AF/CVA, Lt Gen Newton (January 1997).
1.2. Goal. The Air Force hosts open houses to enhance the public awareness of Air Force
preparedness, to demonstrate modern weapon systems and capabilities, to promote positive
community and international relations, to showcase our Airmen and to support Air Force
recruiting and retention. Opening Air Force bases to the public provides opportunities for
education and generates interest in the military and its role in national security. The term "open
house" identifies a traditional activity held on military installations and may or may not include
an airshow. (The terms ―open house‖ and ―airshow‖ have been used interchangeably in the past;
this Instruction uses ―open house,‖ consistent with DoD policies and instructions (DoDD
5410.18 and DoDI 5410.19), as well as the Air Force implementing publication AFI 35-101).
The use of the term ―open house‖ is not intended to specify or dictate any predetermined level of
access to military installations. Inviting the general public onto the installation for an open house
does not, in and of itself, cause the installation to lose its status as ―closed‖ for the purposes of
controlling political or ideological speech.
1.3. Orientation. An Air Force open house is a community relations activity, which should
generally highlight the mission, resources and personnel of the host base. However, military
equipment and people from other bases and services may be invited to demonstrate additional
capabilities. The primary purpose of an open house is to educate the public, not to raise funds
for morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR), non-Federal entities (NFE), or private organizations
(PO). That does not prevent Services from raising funds in excess of those needed for open
house support or prevent authorized PO fundraising (to include authorized unit souvenir and/or
memorabilia-sale activity) as specifically provided for herein so long as fund-raising does not
become the primary objective of the event. See paragraphs 1.14.1.2, 5.3 and 7.4.4 concerning
PO fundraising and concession sales.
    1.3.1. Installation commanders will evaluate the overall open house plan to ensure the open
    house maintains a military orientation. Open houses shall not take on the character of
    commercial events, carnivals, fairs or civilian air shows or create an impression of a
    commercial, carnival or fundraising environment.
    1.3.2. Soliciting commercial sponsorship, in accordance with AFI 34-407, Air Force
    Commercial Sponsorship Program, to help fund Services MWR elements of the open house,
    including funding for a family area or ―kid zone,‖ is an acceptable practice. ―Kid zone‖
    activities should be solely for the use of children and could include attractions such as
    jumping castles and small mechanical rides like carousels and small trains. Mechanical rides
    intended for adults such as large roller coasters and Ferris wheels, along with games of
    chance or skill, are prohibited.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                      7


   1.3.3. Open houses should be no more than three days in length. A typical format is one or
   two show days in addition to a short practice day.
1.4. Commander Responsibilities. Installation commanders are encouraged to host at least one
open house each year. The installation commander is responsible for ensuring the open house
maintains a military orientation. Commanders must execute each open house with prudent
oversight that balances the issues of force protection and operations tempo with the expected
benefits of opening the base to the public. To highlight the base mission and Air Force life,
commanders may consider opening dining facilities, dormitories, maintenance shops,
classrooms, flight simulators and other unclassified facilities for public viewing. Commanders
should ensure an open house is properly funded before committing to the event. An open house
is not only an event open to the general public, but could also be a day when the commander
hosts members of one or more community groups. Consider inviting business leaders, educators,
food service workers, medical professionals, housing authorities or students to the base for an
orientation geared to the particular group.
1.5. Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstrations may be conducted by both military and
civilian fixed-wing and/or rotary-wing aircraft in public events.
   1.5.1. Military Demonstration Teams. These include DoD sanctioned demonstration and
   jump teams (USAF Thunderbirds, Blue Angels, and Golden Knights), foreign demonstration
   and jump teams (e.g., Canadian Snowbirds and Skyhawks), and MAJCOM demonstration
   and jump teams (e.g., Air Combat Command (ACC) and Navy single-ship demonstration
   teams, Heritage and Legacy Flight, and USAF Wings of Blue). All teams have support
   manuals that must be complied with during every performance.
   1.5.2. Civilian Aerial Demonstrations. Civilian performers may be invited to provide
   aerial demonstrations, flyovers, and static displays (see paragraph 6.4).
1.6. Ground Demonstrations/Displays. Ground demonstrations/displays (including military
aircraft and equipment, civilian aircraft, and other displays) may be permitted if the installation
commander determines the displays further the community relations goals of the open house.
Agreements for non-military displays should address permitted signs and liability (e.g., a hold-
harmless agreement); such displays must be informational. Limited sales may be permitted (see
paragraph 1.9).
1.7. Open House Recognition and Signs.
   1.7.1. Signs must not cause the open house to take on the character of a commercial event,
   carnival or fair. Avoid large and garish signs that create an unattractive patchwork of
   competing commercial messages. Signs must not restrict viewing of open house activities.
   1.7.2. Signs cannot promote, display, or sell commercial products or services unless being
   used for commercial sponsorship or to advertise Services concessions,.
   1.7.3. Commercial Sponsor Recognition. Signs and recognition for commercial sponsors
   will be handled in accordance with AFI 34-407 and paragraph 1.7.1 above. Commercial
   sponsorship recognition (signs/displays) must be proximate to the MWR elements of the
   open house. However, when sponsoring commercial acts or static displays, commercial
   sponsors may have a sign near the sponsored aircraft. Installations should coordinate
   commercial sponsor recognition to maximize the benefit to MWR (throughout the year), as
8                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


    well as the benefit to community relations and to the overall open house Refer to DoDI
    1015.10, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Programs, Enclosure 2, paragraph 4(g)
    and paragraph 2.9.1 for approval of commercial sponsorships.
    1.7.4. Donor Recognition. Apart from the commercial sponsorship program, other entities
    or individuals may offer the Air Force or an Air Force NAFI gift of goods and services, to
    include aerial demonstrations, for the open house. Air Force policy generally provides that
    donor/gift recognition for gifts given directly to the Air Force may not be made publicly and
    that special concessions or privileges may not be granted to these gift donors. As such,
    responses to gifts for the benefit of an open house may include a thank you letter to the donor
    from the commander authorized to accept the gift. A modest sign at the entry to the open
    house can be used to identify those donors who have helped make the event possible (logos
    should not be used on this sign). For aerial demonstrations/acts, the announcer may note the
    donor in conjunction with the start of the act during the show; PA will provide guidance to
    avoid impermissible endorsements. Consistent with PA guidance in AFI 35-101, a news
    release should not address gift donors unless mention of the gift is incidental to the story.
    Some donors seek contributions from other groups or individuals and, in turn, combine those
    contributions to make gifts to the Air Force to support the open house; the Air Force does not
    recognize those contributors in an official manner (i.e. they should not be listed on the sign
    mentioned above or in any public announcements) unless they are included as donors in the
    gift offer. Donors and. Donors and/or their contributors may be separately entitled to
    recognition through an agreement entered as part of the commercial sponsorship program.
    Donors or contributors to donors may announce a gift through a news release, publicity,
    advertising or any other means. Such announcements should not imply that the AF or its
    personnel endorse the donor or contributor.
1.8. Safety. Safety, both air and ground, is the priority at all times. Do not execute aerial
performances that endanger the safety of spectators or participants or that threaten damage to
property. Official military demonstrations will use criteria provided in AF and MAJCOM
instructions, and are subject to DoD issuances (listed in Attachment 1) and Title 14, Code of
Federal Regulations (14 CFR), Aeronautics and Space.
1.9. Showmanship and Professionalism. In developing and performing aerial events,
supervisors and participants should remember the objective is to demonstrate Air Force
professionalism and competence to the general public. Strict compliance with show lines,
procedures, and minimum altitude restrictions reflects both professionalism and good
showmanship by providing spectators, including those in the rear of the spectator area, an
unobstructed view of the aerial performance. Static display crews are required to remain with
their equipment to greet the public and answer questions. Additionally, do not inter-mingle
commercial vendors selling memorabilia with the static displays. Ensure the static displays are
separated, by a reasonable distance, from the area where commercial vendors are conducting
sales (see paragraph 6.5) The exact distance will be based on the area available and is left to
the discretion of the installation commander. Installations may only permit POs (see paragraph
1.14.6 and 6.10) and NFEs providing warbirds or other static displays to sell memorabilia near
their static displays pursuant to a concessionaire contract. Military may not conduct sales in
uniform. Installation commanders may restrict alcohol consumption by personnel in uniform
during the open house.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                     9


1.10. Fees. Installations will not charge for admission, parking, or viewing of any activities nor
shall installations permit donation jars or other suggestions that donations are encouraged for
Government services provided without charge.
   1.10.1. Open house programs with advertising may be sold, but a schedule of activities must
   be readily available at no charge (see paragraph 5.4 for possible restrictions).
   1.10.2. Charges for admission to military aircraft or other equipment are specifically
   prohibited. Photos of attendees donning military clothing or seated in military aircraft or
   equipment may not be offered for sale. Owners and/or operators of aircraft not owned by the
   Federal Government will not be permitted to impose an admission charge to view or enter
   their aircraft; however, they may post a sign over a donation receptacle stating that donations
   are accepted. Requests for donations may not imply government endorsement or benefit.
   Details of the arrangement must be addressed in the contract or other agreement for the
   display.
   1.10.3. Installations may not impose unreasonable restrictions on visitors to encourage
   purchase of services. For example, coolers may not be prohibited to stimulate soft drink
   sales. However installations may ban coolers or other carry-in packages for security or
   crowd control concerns. Installations will provide free water and restroom facilities. For
   guidance on the purchase of bottled water, see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and
   Procedures, paragraph 4.45.
   1.10.4. Fees for viewing, concession and display spaces are addressed in paragraph 1.12.
1.11. Overseas Open Houses. For U.S. military installation events open to the public outside
the continental United States, Canada and Mexico, event approval rests with the unified
Combatant Commander in whose geographic area the event occurs. The commander may
delegate the responsibility for event approval to the Air Force Component PA, and for
participation approval to the Air Force Component Commander. Critical aspects of all overseas
events should be coordinated with appropriate host nation authorities as early as possible.
Participation in open houses conducted overseas will use resources under the operational control
of the theater commander or, with concurrence of the owning MAJCOM, those on temporary
duty within the theater. The operational control of the participating MAJCOMs over their own
aircraft is not preempted or diminished. Requests for continental US (CONUS) based assets to
deploy to support overseas open houses must be made through the Unified Combatant Command
to SAF/ PAY 60 days prior to the event. Note: When reading this Instruction for guidance on
conducting overseas open houses, substitute ―host nation aeronautical agency‖ for ―FAA‖.
1.12. Reserved Space. Installations may authorize tent/booth/cabana/display space under the
permissible arrangements below. Individuals or NFEs may not have exclusive use of any part of
the open house premises during an open house unless pursuant to an authorized arrangement, as
detailed below.
   1.12.1. Commander’s Hospitality Tent. The installation may establish a single,
   commander-hosted, DV tent, offset from the center of the show paid for by Appropriated
   Funds (APF); the tent will have no sponsor or signage. Invitees are as authorized in Official
   Representation Fund (ORF) and PA guidance (see AFI 65-603, Official Representation
   Funds - Guidance and Procedures paragraph 7.2.13 restriction on combining ORF with other
   funds).. Invitations will not be used to solicit commercial sponsorship or donations. No
10                                                             AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


     charges will be imposed for admission to the commander‘s tent. (See paragraph 1.7.3 and
     6.11 for additional guidance.) Individuals and NFEs may offer enhancements to the
     commander‘s hospitality tent as conditional gifts to the Air Force
     1.12.2. Open House Operations. The installation may set aside space necessary for
     management and logistics for the open house. This category includes space for volunteer
     management and for aerial or ground event performers.
     1.12.3. Ground Displays. Exhibitors may use space to provide displays open to the public
     as part of the open house. This category includes Federal agencies, contractors providing
     ground displays, and other NFEs. All displays in this category must directly contribute to the
     open house (i.e., highlight the mission and resources of the host base and educate the public
     about the military). Community organizations and NFEs requesting exhibit space in order to
     distribute other information to attendees may receive space as Government support if their
     participation meets the test of DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER) 3-211. Per JER
     3-211, such displays must be of interest and benefit to the local civilian community or DoD
     and must support DoD community relations with the immediate community and/or other
     legitimate DoD public affairs interests; commercial marketing is not permitted in this
     category. All installations will ensure they avoid commercialization of the open house.
     1.12.4. Concessions. Services may use space to sell refreshments or merchandise, either on
     their own or through a concession agreement. Services concessionaires may use space to sell
     concessions (and for associated logistics and management) according to the terms of the
     concessions contract (see paragraph 5.3).
     1.12.5. Attendees. The installation may provide space as protection from the weather and
     bleachers or chairs for all attendees or reserved for attendees who are disabled, elderly,
     pregnant, etc. Make arrangements for handicapped spectators in accordance with applicable
     laws. Concerns for space, safety, transportation, logistics, and security will usually lead to a
     prohibition against attendees bringing personal tents to the event except for unique
     circumstances that will require approval by the installation. Do not restrict personal tents for
     the purpose of increasing the use of tent concession.
     1.12.6. Tent and Seating Concessions. Services may rent tents, bleachers or chairs as a
     concession, either directly or through a concessionaire. The concession arrangement must
     not pose an unreasonable restriction on attendees who wish to view open house events
     without purchasing the concession. Tent/seating space provided as a concession may be
     reserved, as long as the reservation process is open to the public. Accommodation space may
     include provisions for food and beverages as part of the concession if provided through
     Services. Tent space or seating may not be re-sold or used for other sales not covered by the
     concession contract (see paragraph 5.3).
     1.12.7. Commercial Sponsor Displays. Display areas may be provided (at the sponsors‘
     expense) for the use of Services MWR commercial sponsors for passive display of sponsor
     products/services pursuant to sponsor agreements (see AFI 34-407 and paragraphs 5.5 and
     6.8). No selling of sponsor products is permitted in conjunction with these displays.
     1.12.8. Space as Government Consideration Pursuant to a Contract. Both APF and non-
     appropriated fund (NAF) contracts may include reserved space as part of the Government
     consideration. The details of such an arrangement must not detract from the overall
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                       11


   community relations goals of the open house. For example, Government consideration for
   demonstrations procured via contract with Air Force funds (e.g. a warbird demonstration or
   civilian aerial demonstration) could include tent space for the performers or otherwise for the
   contractor‘s use. If alternative forms of consideration are used in NAF contracts, the contract
   must stipulate that there is a dollar value associated with the exchange and the amount must
   be stated in the payment terms Contracting Officers must determine if the consideration is
   fair and reasonable and document the file accordingly. Use of Government space during the
   open house need not relate directly to performance of the contract; however, any such tent
   space may not be used to avoid prohibitions against commercial signs, advertising, or display
   of products or services See paragraph 8.2.4.
1.13. Music Royalties. Installations will comply with all Federal laws regarding the
compensation of musicians for the use of their copyrighted music. Performers are responsible
for paying their royalties to the appropriate licensing agency. If the base creates a performance
that requires copyrighted musical support the installation will be responsible for paying the
royalties associated with their event only. The International Council of Air Shows (ICAS) has
negotiated rates with the three major licensing agencies: Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Society of European Stage Authors
and Composers (SESAC). Installations can make their own arrangements or take advantage of
the ICAS rates. Another option is to have a local radio station broadcast from the event. Music
royalties may be funded by APF only for performances otherwise supported by APF. Note:
Reference to ICAS or their products does not imply an endorsement by the Air Force. Any
interaction with this organization is optional.
1.14. Private Organizations and Non-Federal Entities. POs and other NFEs can have a
limited role in organizing and funding an open house; however, the installation commander and
the open house staff will retain overall control of the event. All inherently Governmental
functions must be performed by Air Force personnel. POs and NFEs may, for example, raise
funds and accept donations from outside sources, donate funds and in-kind gifts to the
Government, fund expenses not ordinarily borne by appropriated or nonappropriated funds,
provide voluntary services to support the open house (see paragraph 7.6 for procedures), and
offer publicity separate from the event itself in exchange for donations. AF personnel may not
solicit NFEs or POs to fundraise for the purpose of gifting items/funds raised to the Air Force.
PO or NFE involvement in an open house must be pursuant to a specific permission or
agreement (based on statutory or regulatory authority applicable to the type of involvement),
such as a contract, gift acceptance, agreement for gratuitous services, commercial sponsorship
agreement (AFMAN 34-416, Attachment 2, Standard Sponsorship Agreement).
   1.14.1. Private organizations are governed by AFI 34-223, The Private Organization
   Program. POs are base-chartered, self-sustaining special-interest groups, set up by people
   acting exclusively outside the scope of any official capacity as military members, employees,
   or agents of the Federal Government. POs are not Federal entities and are not to be treated as
   such. They operate on Air Force installations with the written consent of the installation
   commander.
       1.14.1.1. While POs normally are required to carry insurance coverage, PO members
       will still be personally liable to civil lawsuits in the event of a serious accident. For this
       reason, POs should not be used to contract for aerial acts or other activities that could
       expose the members to personal liability.
12                                                             AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


        1.14.1.2. A PO composed primarily of Government employees is generally unable to
        enter into APF contracts because Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 3.601(a)
        prohibits contracts with a Government employee or a business concern or other
        organization owned or substantially owned or controlled by one or more Government
        employees. In accordance with FAR 3.602, the agency head, or a designee not below the
        level of the head of the contracting activity, may authorize an exception to the policy in
        FAR 3.601(a) only if there is a most compelling reason to do so, such as when the
        Government's needs cannot reasonably be otherwise met. This does not bar PO operation
        of a concession pursuant to a Services or concessionaire contract (AFI 34-262, Services
        Programs And Use Eligibility, paragraph 2.9.1.8).
     1.14.2. As the term ―non-Federal‖ implies, an NFE is composed of individuals acting outside
     the scope of any official capacity as officers, employees, or agents of the Federal
     government. NFEs operating outside the Air Force private organization program have fewer
     constraints than do POs. Examples of such NFEs include professional military organizations,
     local chambers of commerce, commercial entities, or organizations of community or business
     leaders formed for the specific purpose of promoting an open house.
     1.14.3. Avoid giving the public the perception a PO or NFE is hosting the overall event, or
     any portion of it. Air Force, PO and NFE websites and other publicly disseminated media
     must clearly convey to the public the fact the PO or NFE is only supporting the installation
     with the open house and no Federal endorsement is implied. Do not incorporate the name of
     an NFE in the name of the open house.
     1.14.4. NFEs and POs must make clear, to all prospective donors, that they do not represent
     the Air Force. They may not extend commercial sponsorship or other recognition benefits or
     advertising privileges on the installation, or suggest Air Force endorsement of sponsors or
     sponsorship arrangements or official involvement in obtaining them.
     1.14.5. A DoD employee who is an active participant in an NFE (including a PO) or has
     been an officer of the NFE (including a PO) within the last year or who has a financial
     interest in the NFE is generally prohibited from engaging in any official activity in which the
     NFE or PO is a party or has a financial interest. These rules apply to personnel who have
     official responsibilities in connection with an open house. See paragraph 7.4.5.1 for
     definitions; consult the installation legal office for ethics advice on conflicts of interest.
     1.14.6. Unless restricted by state or local law, an NFE may raise funds and accept donations.
     Fundraising activities on an Air Force installation must comply with the requirements of JER
     Sections 3-210 and Section 3-211 and AFI 36-3101, Fundraising within the Air Force. A PO
     or unofficial activity, as defined in AFI 34-223, paragraph 1.1, must also comply with the
     provisions of that instruction, including the limits of on-base solicitation. DoD employees
     are subject to further restrictions including soliciting from subordinates or prohibited sources
     and using DoD position, title or authority for NFE fundraising.
1.15. Joint Bases. Open houses at joint bases will be conducted according to supporting
Component regulations, policies, and procedures, except for the operation, safety, and security of
mission assets, which will follow supported component regulations, policies, and procedures.
1.16. Contracting. The installation and Air Force non-appropriated fund instrumentalities
(AFNAFIs) may accomplish some open house functions via APF and NAF contracts. Overall
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             13


event management or individual services may be contracted. Before contracting an open house
function, consider whether the duties are inherently governmental (per existing contracting
regulations). Combined APF-NAF contracts must segregate the two categories of funds and
corresponding contract products/services.

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Under Secretary of Defense, Policy (USD(P)). Under Secretary of Defense for Policy
(USD(P)) has event approval authority for International Air Shows and Trade Exhibitions, as

                                        OPERATIONS

4.1. Operational Criteria. Safety must be the primary consideration at all times. Do not
engage in activities that compromise the safety of spectators, participants/performers or
that could damage or destroy property. This Instruction provides general guidance on open
house air operations within the current boundaries of Air Force guidance. Individual performers
might have more restrictive operating limitations. It is imperative to match weather and altitude
operating limits with the performers and the airfield environment.
Note: Military jet teams and single-ship demonstration teams will comply with their specific
regulations and instructions (for example ACCI 11-USAFADS series and single-ship
demonstration team AFI 11-246 series volumes and their supplements), which take precedence
over this Instruction.

Note: Air National Guard flight profiles outside the purview of AFI 11-246 are published in the
ANG supplement to AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events Procedures, Air Force Aerial Events.
   4.1.1. Altitude Minimums. The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202 Volume 3,
   General Flight Rules, AFI 11-209 and 14 CFR Part 91 are still applicable. The FAA may
   grant a certificate of waiver for an open house authorizing an altitude lower than normally
   authorized. In certain cases, such as for military or civilian demonstration team
   performances, the FAA may specifically waive the altitude requirements above. Even if the
   FAA authorizes a lower altitude, USAF fixed wing aircraft must not be flown lower than 500
   feet AGL IAW AFI 11-209, except for military demonstration teams as noted above.
   4.1.2. Rotary Wing Altitudes. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish altitudes lower than
   the minimums specified in paragraph 4.1.1 for operating command rotary wing aircraft in
   the execution of approved aircraft demonstration profiles when the lower altitudes are
   necessary to properly demonstrate capabilities. Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for
   the safe operation of their assets. The approved aircraft demonstration profiles must conform
   to the guidance in the AFI 11-246 series of instructions and/or MAJCOM instructions.
   4.1.3. Airspeed Limitations. Airspeed guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3 applies to all
   aerial events. The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed wing AF aircraft
   participating in any open house is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft configuration.
   Airlift aircraft used in demonstrating standard, approved tactical procedures such as assault
   takeoffs or assault landings, may be flown at lower airspeeds, but not at airspeeds lower than
   specified in technical order publications. The FAA may grant a certificate of waiver for an
   open house authorizing airspeeds higher than normally authorized. In this case, the
   maximum airspeed is limited to .90 MACH, or a lower airspeed if stipulated in a governing
   FAA waiver, for all aerial demonstrations except for approved record flights and
   demonstration teams.
   4.1.4. Weather Minimums. Weather must allow operations under Visual Flight Rules
   (VFR) in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3,
   [MDS Specific] Operations Procedures. Weather minimums are flyover minimum altitude
   plus 500 feet and 3 miles visibility. The air operations officer may set higher minimums

     based on the nature of the event, local terrain, or other factors. The AFI 11-246 series
     contains weather minimums for single-ship military demonstration team profiles.
        4.1.4.1. Flight demonstrations should not be conducted unless the ceiling is at least 1,500
        feet, and the visibility is at least 3 statute miles at the time of the demonstration.
        However, the air operations officer, after coordinating with the FAA inspector-in-charge
        (IIC) and the air boss, may adjust the minimum ceiling and visibility requirements at
        his/her discretion, but no less than 1,000 feet and 3 statute miles if:
            4.1.4.1.1. Except for North American military performers, aerobatic maneuvers are
            conducted by Category III aircraft (see Table 4.1) only within an operations area
            having a diameter of no more than 2 statute miles; and
            4.1.4.1.2. Originally scheduled aerobatic maneuvers are not modified or conducted in
            close proximity to the surface as a result of the reduced weather conditions.
        4.1.4.2. Both the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the Canadian Force Snowbirds have ―flat‖
        shows that require 1,000 feet and 3 miles of visibility. Civilian performers may have a
        preapproved ―flat‖ routine. These should be addressed in advance and minimums
        established prior to execution.
     4.1.5. Time Limitations. Due to safety concerns and reduced public relations benefit, aerial
     events are authorized only between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of
     evening civil twilight. The USAF Academy Wings of Blue parachute team is authorized an
     exception to this policy provided a FAA waiver (FAA Form 7711-2, Certificate of Waiver or
     Authorization Application) is obtained for each night jump in accordance with 14 CFR Part
     105.21. AF/A3O is the approval authority for waiver requests IAW AFI 11-209.
        4.1.5.1. Installation Commander has the approval authority for any civilian acts that
        occur after evening civil twilight.
4.2. Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration includes virtually every type of aerial
participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft at an open house. Military demonstrations are
intended to provide the public a demonstration of the aircraft‘s unique characteristics,
capabilities, and mission. Civilian demonstrations must be an adjunct to military activities and
are further defined in 4.2.5
     4.2.1. Aerobatic Flight. For open house purposes, the definition of aerobatic flight in 14
     CFR, Part 91.303 would normally be restrictive. Therefore, a waiver to 14 CFR Part 91.303
     must always be requested on the FAA Form 7711-1. For guidance in determining what
     maneuvers are considered aerobatic, reference FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6. For
     overseas open houses, check with host nation aeronautic agency.
     4.2.2. Critical Aircraft/Critical Wingman. The critical aircraft or critical wingman is that
     aircraft closest to a spectator area.
     4.2.3. Flyby. For open houses, the FAA‘s definition of a flyby is a non-aerobatic pass or
     series of passes, performed by one or more aircraft. Refer to AFI 11-209, paragraphs 1.6.4
     and 1.6.7 for restrictions on airspeeds and minimum distance to spectator areas. In any case,
     altitudes and distance from spectators will not be less and airspeeds will not be greater than
     the limits imposed by the FAA FSDO in the certificate of waiver.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                     25


  4.2.4. Warbirds. A warbird is defined as a privately-owned vintage military aircraft (or
  likeness thereof) that has been used in a military conflict or which is of significance in the
  history of military aviation. Warbirds could be a US military aircraft or that of a foreign
  government. The narration during the show must clearly note the aircraft‘s military
  significance. Warbirds will be painted in a military paint scheme, a minor sponsor logo is
  permitted keeping in mind the need to avoid commercialization of the event. See
  Attachment 6 for a list of approved warbirds. Installations can staff requests to designate
  additional aircraft as warbirds through their MAJCOM/A3 to AF/A3O-AO for consideration.
  4.2.5. Civilian Aerial Demonstrations. Civilian demonstrations include civilian aircraft
  static displays and/or flying demonstrations. Aircraft listed in Attachment 6, but not painted
  in a military scheme as referenced in 4.2.4. above, will be categorized as civilian air
  acts/displays only. Civilian aerial acts are permitted if they enhance or supplement the
  military activities. Civilian demonstrations may contribute to the attraction of the overall
  event, which may afford greater military recruiting potential and stimulate interest in national
  defense. Air races by fixed wing, rotary wing aircraft or hot air balloons are prohibited.
  Refer to paragraphs 2.13.6 and 6.4 and Attachment 4 for additional considerations and
  funding requirements.
     4.2.5.1. Commanders, in consultation with their staffs, must give careful consideration to
     avoid selectively benefiting civilian enterprises when deciding to invite civilian
     demonstration teams to participate in their open house activities.
     4.2.5.2. Commanders and other officials responding to requests for transportation not
     specifically authorized by DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, shall make no
     commitments concerning prospective travelers or cargo until they receive all required
     approvals. When commercial airlift is unavailable, incapable, or unsuitable, and it is in
     the best interests of the Air Force, military airlift to support civilian aircraft (to include
     their aviation team(s)) may be requested on a case-by-case basis as an exception to DoD
     air transportation policy. Exception to policy requests, with regard to transporting
     civilian aircraft and their aviation team(s), will be submitted in accordance with DoD
     4515.13-R, Paragraph C10.2 and AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement. Exception to policy
     requests will be submitted by the base hosting the civilian aircraft and their aviation
     team(s) through their MAJCOM to AF/A3O (info SAF/PA and AF/A3O-AO) for staffing
     to the CSAF and/or Vice CSAF (VCSAF) for approval consideration. Exception to
     policy requests should arrive at HQ USAF no later than 30 days prior to the desired date
     of movement of the civilian aircraft and/or aviation team(s).
     4.2.5.3. Performer Qualifications (CONUS events only). The FAA IIC is responsible for
     ensuring the FAA qualification of civilian performers and their aircraft. The IIC may
     accomplish this when reviewing the application for waiver. These qualifications include:
         4.2.5.3.1. Valid pilot certificate.
         4.2.5.3.2. Valid medical certificate.
         4.2.5.3.3. A current FAA Form 8710-7, Statement of Acrobatic Competency, or
         Transport Canada Aviation (TCA), Form 26-0307, Statement of Aerobatic
         Competency.
26                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


            4.2.5.3.4. Formation and safety team (FAST) card or formation flights annotated on
            the statement of aerobatic competency if performing formation.
                       Note: Non-DoD aircraft are required to have a DD Form 2401, Civil
                       Aircraft Landing Permit. Obtaining this permit is the responsibility of the
                       host base and aircraft owner/operator. See AFI 10-1001 Civil Aircraft
                       Landing Permits.

        4.2.5.4. Civilian Aerobatic Formation Flight (CONUS events only). Formation
        aerobatics may be performed only if the team meets the practice and proficiency
        requirements established in FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6. All teams or
        individuals conducting formation aerobatics must have demonstrated or substantiated
        their skills and have the ―formation aerobatics‖ notation placed on their statement of
        acrobatic competency.
        4.2.5.5. Non-Aerobatic Formation Flight (CONUS events only). Civil pilots who
        wish to conduct non-aerobatic formation flight in waivered airspace for an open house
        must possess a FAST card or a similar valid host nation formation training and evaluation
        credential that is acceptable to the FAA.
        4.2.5.6. Civil Fly-Ins. Civil aircraft operators may be invited to fly their aircraft to an
        Air Force airfield for a base open house to foster better relations with the local aviation
        community. Refer to AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, for civil fly-in
        procedures. According to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) policy (DESC-P-6,
        Authorized Customers and Cash Sales), ―If civil aircraft owners request aircraft fuel, the
        installation may authorize Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) fuel cash sales for
        aircraft pursuant to DESC policy guidance.‖ DESC is the fuel manager for the entire
        DoD.
4.3. Parachute Demonstrations. Parachute demonstrations are restricted to appropriate events
over airports, open bodies of water, or areas of land where adequate crowd control can be
assured. Only one parachute team or club from each service may take part in the same public
event. This restriction does not apply to static line paratroop drops.
     4.3.1. DOD-Sanctioned Parachute Team. DOD has officially sanctioned the U.S. Army
        Golden Knights parachute team. The team has two units designated as Black Team and
        Gold Team--jumping at two different locations.
        4.3.1.1. The DOD-sanctioned military team determines site acceptability, effect of wind
        conditions, and location of exiting the aircraft. This includes the decision to exit over a
        spectator area and the determination of authorized passengers onboard the aircraft during
        performances.
        4.3.1.2. An application for a certificate of authorization must be submitted to the
        jurisdictional FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). Ensure the application for
        waiver contains a statement that the military command or service has determined that
        adequate safety margins exist at the site for the scheduled demonstration by the specific
        team on a specific date.
     4.3.2. Non-sanctioned DOD Parachute Teams. Other military jump teams, such as the
     U.S. Navy's Leap Frogs and Chuting Stars and the U.S. Air Force Academy's Wings of Blue,
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   27


   are not DOD-sanctioned. They may be allowed to perform the same jumps as civilians with
   a United States Parachute Association (USPA) class D license. To jump over or into a
   congested area the unit is required to meet the same standards as DOD-sanctioned teams and
   hold a USPA class D license.
4.4. Foreign Military Teams (CONUS events only). The considerations and procedures of
this chapter also apply to military teams sanctioned by other countries and approved by the FAA.
Only the FAA may issue the letter of approval for foreign military teams. Generally, Flight
Standards personnel will observe a private demonstration performance before the approval is
issued. Submit requests for foreign aircraft or foreign military demonstration team participation
in unit open houses to SAF/PAY for coordination. Performances at Air Force installations
should be at no additional cost to the government. Questions regarding performances by foreign
teams in the United States may be addressed to SAF/PAY.
4.5. Inspector-in-Charge (IIC). The FAA IIC is the aviation safety inspector (ASI) who
conducts the feasibility study, participates in the preseason evaluation meeting, evaluates the
application for waiver or authorization, recommends issuance or denial, and conducts the
surveillance of the aviation event (See FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 6, Chapter 10).
4.6. Planning Considerations.
    4.6.1. Crowd Line. A crowd line is a physical barrier or a line marked on the ground that
    serves as a restraining line. The crowd line is placed at a specified distance from the show
    line. The restraining line and any necessary policing must prevent spectators or other non-
    participating people from getting too close to the show line. The ground operations officer
    with the help of Civil Engineering and Airfield Manager will establish the crowd line
    including the DV seating area, primary viewing section and distance needed from the show
    line to meet FAA standards and Air Force runway standards for specific aircraft. Snow or
    foreign object debris (FOD) fencing should be use for the crowd line barrier to prevent FOD
    from blowing onto the taxiways. The fencing may be anchored with concrete ―jersey‖
    barriers (see Figure 4.1. below).
28                                                          AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


Figure 4.1. Aerobatic Box




      4.6.1.1. Safety. Safety must be the primary factor in selecting spectator areas. Attempt
      to center the spectator area on show center. The spectator area should be oriented so that
      it offers an unobstructed view of the show line in both directions. The DV area should be
      offset from the center of the show area. Movable objects, such as vehicles or aircraft,
      which would obstruct spectators‘ view of the show line, should be repositioned.
      4.6.1.2. Primary Spectator Area. The primary spectator area is the main area
      designated for spectator use. Safety must be the primary factor in selecting spectator
      areas. It is bounded by the crowd line and has lateral limits (ends) that are well defined.
      This is the area where the public is generally expected to view the open house. The
      primary area may be partitioned or divided due to physical constraints associated with the
      location. Aircraft must not fly over the designated spectator area less than 1000 feet
      above the highest obstacle in that area unless specifically granted a waiver by the FAA
      and the parent MAJCOM.
      4.6.1.3. Secondary Spectator Area. The secondary spectator area may be any other
      area where people have a natural tendency to gather to observe the event for example,
      along a road adjacent to base. The open house staff and the IIC should identify
      secondary spectator areas before the aviation event begins and develop a plan to assure
      they are outside of the aerobatic box. These are also areas where it may not be
      completely possible to control the presence of people. However, Security Forces will
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  29


     make every effort to prohibit secondary spectator areas within jurisdiction limitation. No
     aircraft is permitted over any secondary spectator area less than 500 feet above that area.
     4.6.1.4. Static Display. All static display aircraft should be positioned well behind the
     crowd line.
  4.6.2. Corner Markers. Corner markers are natural landmarks or identifying panels placed
  500 feet from each end of the primary spectator area along the extended crowd line. They
  depict the minimum distance performers may approach the crowd. They should be easily
  identifiable objects starkly contrasting with the environment. If using panels, they should be
  10‘ by 10‘.
  4.6.3. Show Center. The show center is a visible reference point along the show line
  usually denoting the center of the aerobatic area. If possible, locate show center in a highly
  visible area such as a taxiway or intersection of a runway. Show center should also be
  aligned with a building, road, or other feature identifiable from the air (see Figure 4.1).
     4.6.3.1. The optimum position for show center is directly opposite the seating area and
     centered along the length of the crowd line. The show center marker should be a large,
     highly visible vehicle or marker; white, blue, or orange, or other color that starkly
     contrasts with the environment.
     4.6.3.2. Arrange the marker so it faces perpendicular to the show line and faces the
     primary spectator area. This orientation will give the pilots a readily identifiable set of
     points increasing comfort levels and ensuring the highest degree of safety.
     4.6.3.3. Large snowplows, buses, and semi-truck trailers all serve well as markers.
     4.6.3.4. If the edge of the runway is the show line, the vehicles should be placed at least
     100 feet off the runway so as not to interfere with takeoff or landing.
     4.6.3.5. A notice to airmen (NOTAM) may be required for placement of the markers if
     near an active runway. Check with the local airfield manager.
     4.6.3.6. Show center markers must not be sited earlier than practice day and will be
     removed after the last public performance or prior to resumption of normal airfield/flying
     operations. The location and duration of these markers must be temporarily waived IAW
     the provisions of United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport
     Planning and Design.
  4.6.4. Bomb Burst Cross Point. Bomb burst cross points are used by demonstration teams.
  The cross point for the bomb burst must be located on the show line, at a distance from show
  center specified by the team. The area beneath the bomb burst run-in must not be densely
  populated nor used for parking.
     4.6.4.1. The bomb burst cross point must also be marked with a highly visible object
     (preferably white or orange with high contrast to the surrounding area). If using vehicles,
     the vehicle must be located on, and facing parallel to, the show line. If the edge of the
     runway is the show line, the vehicles will be placed a minimum 100 feet off the runway.
     4.6.4.2. Like show center, the bomb burst cross point should be located in a highly
     visible area.
30                                                           AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


        4.6.4.3. Bomb burst cross point markers must not be sited earlier than practice day and
        will be removed after the last public performance or prior to resumption of normal
        airfield/flying operations. The location and duration of these markers must be
        temporarily waived IAW the provisions of UFC 3-260-01.
     4.6.5. Control Point. Control point is the specified location where the air boss, air
     operations officer and IIC manage the event. The appropriate communication system
     required to control the aviation event must also be located at this site. The staff should
     position its open house operations center near the control point.
     4.6.6. Show Line. The show line is a readily visible reference positioned the required
     distance from the spectators and enhances pilot orientation during the performance. The
     show line also serves as the longitudinal axis for the show. Small rivers, roads, and runways
     all make excellent natural show lines. Snow fences spread flat on the ground may also make
     acceptable references, depending on the visual contrast. Lines of parked buses, cars, or
     boats, although less desirable, may be the only alternatives when natural show lines are not
     available. Special attention must be given to delineating show lines properly for high
     performance jet aircraft. Large vehicles should be used to designate show center and the
     bomb burst cross point to ensure they stand out from the terrain. A surveyor or airborne
     observer should ensure the artificial show line is straight (see Figure 4.1).
        4.6.6.1. To enhance safety, the show line may be moved toward or away from the
        spectator area to give the performer a more identifiable reference. However, the show
        line will not be moved closer to the primary spectator area than the minimum distance
        specified.
        4.6.6.2. Establish the minimum show line distance from the spectator area for all
        participating aircraft using Table 4.1. Under the circumstances listed below, the
        minimum distance can be reduced, as follows:
            4.6.6.2.1. To 1,000 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the intended
            airdrop impact point, or to the drop zone boundary, whichever is greater, for the
            following: 1) on-base equipment airdrop demonstration; 2) on-base container
            delivery system demonstration; and 3) on-base airdrop demonstration of personnel
            using round canopies, also known as tactical airborne demonstrations or personnel
            airdrops. Tactical airborne demonstrations are conducted by paratroopers assigned to
            tactical units (e.g., the 82nd Airborne) and employ standard military equipment and
            procedures.
            4.6.6.2.2. To 500 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the show line for
            helicopter operational demonstrations, and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault
            takeoff demonstrations.
            4.6.6.2.3. To 50 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the landing target for
            the airdrop of precision parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of
            Blue) when steerable, square main and reserve canopies are used. The airdrop may
            include a high altitude low opening (HALO) demonstration.
            4.6.6.2.4. To 15 feet, minimum, between the spectator area and the landing target for
            the airdrop of DoD sanctioned teams (Army Golden Knights or Navy Leap Frogs) or
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    31


         precision parachute demonstration team members who hold United States Parachute
         Association PRO-ratings when steerable, square main and reserve canopies are used.
     4.6.6.3. For demonstrations flown over water, an artificial show line must be
     constructed. Two boats in this case may define the artificial show line. Boats that are 35
     feet long and larger are easier to discern by high-speed aircraft, especially if they are
     white in color. One boat should be anchored at show center and another at the bomb
     burst cross point. Each demonstration team will have specific requests concerning these
     markings.
         4.6.6.3.1. Whether using boats or some other markings, ensure they will be in the
         same exact location each day. This can be accomplished by using a global
         positioning system (GPS), buoy markers, etc.
         4.6.6.3.2. Enlist the assistance of the Coast Guard or lake patrol to ensure other boats
         do not enter the demonstration area.
  4.6.7. Show Lines and Spectator Areas. Pilots performing flight demonstrations must
  maintain minimum distances from the primary spectator area.
     4.6.7.1. For aerobatic and other flight demonstrations show lines must be established at
     prescribed minimum distances from the designated spectator area. These show lines are
     used as a reference by performing pilots or, in the case of a formation flight, by the
     formation leader. Flight demonstrations must not cross over these show lines toward any
     spectator area.
     4.6.7.2. For formation flight demonstrations, the formation leader must adjust his/her
     ground track so that the critical wingman remains beyond the appropriate show line.
     4.6.7.3. With the exception of the BD-5J, any turbine engine powered airplane will be
     required to perform on or beyond the Category I show line according to FAA Advisory
     Circular 91-45C. AETC‘s T-6 Texan II trainers are authorized to use the Category II
     show line.
     4.6.7.4. Show line categories, speeds, and distances are shown in Table 4.1 below.
     These speeds are only for determining assignment to a show line, not maximum
     performing speeds.
  4.6.8. Establishment of Show Lines. As described in Table 4.1, three different show and
  reference lines might be required when all three categories of aircraft are participating at a
  show site.
     4.6.8.1. Establish the show and reference lines first, preferably using natural markings;
     then set the appropriate crowd lines and designate spectator areas. It is important for all
     show and reference lines to be well marked.
     4.6.8.2. The optimum situation is when prominent show lines such as runway
     centerlines, tree lines or other geographical features are 500, 1,000, or 1,500 feet from the
     spectators. These distances from the show and reference lines to the crowd line for each
     category of aircraft are the standard. Under some conditions the distances may be
     altered. The best choice is a natural show line that runs along or parallel to and within
     200 feet laterally of a runway or taxiway. Considerations for moving show lines are as
     follows.
32                                                           AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


        4.6.8.2.1. Antennas, windsocks, tree lines and other obstacles that are hazards to the
        performers often necessitate moving a show line; even in these cases, the show line
        may not be moved any closer than the prescribed altered minimums.
        4.6.8.2.2. The minimum 500-foot reference line for Category III aircraft will not be
        waived.
        4.6.8.2.3. For North American military jet teams, both the Category I and Category
        III show lines must be discernible at least two miles from show center at an altitude of
        200 feet.
     4.6.8.3. Category I Show Line. The optimum show line distance from the spectator areas
     for Category I aircraft will be 1,500 feet or greater.
        4.6.8.3.1. If the only well defined show line is closer than 1,500 feet to a spectator
        area and it is not possible to move the spectator area, the FAA may waive the show
        line down to a minimum of 1,200 feet.
        4.6.8.3.2. When there is a reduction in the distance from the show line to the primary
        spectator area, a similar reduction will not be permitted for the secondary spectator
        area side of the show line.
        4.6.8.3.3. In no case will there be less than 2,700 feet between the primary and the
        secondary spectator areas.
     4.6.8.4. Category II Reference Line. The optimum show line distance from spectator
     areas for Category II aircraft is 1,000 feet or greater. Aircraft will not cross this reference
     line.
        4.6.8.4.1. If the only well defined show line is closer than 1,000 feet to a spectator
        area and it is not possible to move the spectator area, the FAA may waive the show
        line to an absolute minimum of 800 feet.
        4.6.8.4.2. When there is a reduction in the distance from the show line to the primary
        spectator area, a similar reduction will not be permitted for the secondary spectator
        area side of the show line.
        4.6.8.4.3. In no case will there be less than 1,800 feet between the primary and the
        secondary spectator areas.
        4.6.8.4.4. In no case will any part of the aircraft cross this reference line. In the case
        of formations, flight leaders must adjust their ground track so that the critical
        wingman is no closer to the spectator area than the Category II show line.
     4.6.8.5. Category III Reference Line. The show line will not be closer than 500 feet
     from the primary or secondary spectator areas. Aircraft will not cross this reference line.
        4.6.8.5.1. The 500-foot show line may also be used for Category I or II aircraft being
        flown non-aerobatically and parallel to the primary and/or secondary spectator area.
        In this case, the show line must be clearly delineated for high performance aircraft.
        4.6.8.5.2. An arc directed away from the crowd, a pass in review maneuver, may be
        flown provided the aircraft remain at least 500 feet from the primary and secondary
        spectator areas.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                         33


             4.6.8.5.3. If there is less than 1,800 feet between the primary and any secondary
             spectator areas, the site cannot be considered for an airshow waiver.
             4.6.8.5.4. If there is less than 500 feet between the show line and the spectators, the
             site cannot be considered for an airshow waiver.
             4.6.8.5.5. In no case will any part of the aircraft cross this reference line. In the case
             of formations, flight leaders must adjust their ground track so that the critical
             wingman is no closer to the spectator area than the Category III show line.

standard temperature and pressure at sea level at maximum certified gross weight for:
reciprocating powered airplanes 75 percent power, turbine powered airplanes – 85 percent
maximum continuous power. These are not limiting speeds for maneuvers.
      4.6.9. Aerobatic Box. The aerobatic box is the area over which the aerobatic
      demonstrations are approved to be performed. It is usually centered on the show center;
      however, sometimes an offset show center is required. The width is determined by aircraft
      category and the length is dependent on the performer. This is an important planning factor
      and should be considered when contracting with performers. Some U.S. jet teams require as
      much as 12,000 feet; consult the team‘s support manual. The Snowbirds and civilian teams
      typically require a shorter box. The aerobatic box is also known as the aerobatic
      maneuvering area (see Figure 4.1).
         4.6.9.1. The FAA requires that the aerobatic box be void of all people not specifically
         participating in the demonstration. This includes homes, businesses, roads and secondary
34                                                             AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


        spectator areas. The authorization for each person forward of the crowd line must be
        approved by the FAA IIC and air boss.
            4.6.9.1.1. Personnel may be allowed in the box providing they are necessary to the
            operation of the event, are properly briefed, are in communication with the air boss,
            and all participants are aware of them. These personnel should be kept to a
            minimum.
            4.6.9.1.2. The safety of spectators is of the utmost importance. The strict nature of
            this FAA guidance means that access to this area must be controlled, and all
            spectators kept from entering the area. The aerobatic demonstration cannot begin, or
            may possibly be terminated, if unauthorized personnel access the area.
            4.6.9.1.3. Consideration should be given to those businesses and homes that may lie
            within the aerobatic box. Bases should consider making special arrangements for the
            affected parties to ensure cooperation and assurance that the box is clear. This may
            include inviting them to the commander‘s DV area. The PA office can assist in
            notification and coordination.
     4.6.10. Orientation Flights. Guidelines for orientation and PA flights on Air Force aircraft
     are contained in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 35-101, Chapter 19.
     MAJCOMs may restrict orientation flights during open houses. At no time will passengers
     be onboard any civilian aerial demonstration aircraft or warbird while flying in an open
     house performance. No orientation flights in civil aerial demonstration aircraft or warbirds
     participating in the open house will originate from or terminate at the installation. Exception:
     personnel identified in the FAA authorization to fly in warbirds performing Heritage Flights
     (HF) as dissimilar formation safety and program assurance observers are authorized to fly in
     HF warbirds originating from or terminating at the installation.
     4.6.11. Approved Maneuver. Aerobatic maneuvers may not direct energy toward any
     spectator area or fly over the designated spectator area(s) below 1,000 feet above ground
     level (AGL) unless approved by the FAA. The FAA approves maneuver packages for the
     US military demonstration teams, and Canadian Forces Snowbirds annually. Civil and/or
     foreign military teams, flights, or individual acts must submit sufficient information about a
     single maneuver or series of maneuvers to the FAA for approval before performing these
     types of maneuvers. For a more detailed discussion of approved maneuvers, reference FAA
     Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6. Certain related maneuvers and procedures, however,
     may be authorized as outlined below.
        4.6.11.1. Approved maneuvers that are completed prior to reaching a point where the
        rollout and trajectory of the aircraft or the scatter pattern would not endanger the
        spectators if a catastrophic failure were to occur. Approved maneuvers are maneuvers
        that have been approved by the FAA for a specific performer and aircraft. Upon request
        from the FAA, performers are required to present evidence of the approval.
        4.6.11.2. For the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the
        Snowbirds, approved maneuvers include level or climbing (normal rate) wings level
        flight over designated primary spectator area generally from front to back or back to
        front; however, in no case will the altitude of the aircraft be less than 500 feet AGL over
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   35


     primary spectator area. All other performers must be at or above 1,000 feet AGL over
     primary spectator areas unless they hold approval for the maneuver from the FAA.
     4.6.11.3. Maneuvers on an oblique line that passes 500, 1,000, or 1,500 feet to either side
     of a spectator area as appropriate to the category of aircraft being flown during oblique
     aerobatic maneuvers.
     4.6.11.4. All category aircraft performing non-aerobatic or photo passes may use the
     500-foot show line and the corner markers.
  4.6.12. Engine Run Areas. Aircraft engines will not be started and aircraft will not be
  taxied in designated spectator areas or static display areas unless adequate measures are taken
  to protect the spectators. For hearing protection, the distance from the aircraft to the
  spectators should be 150 feet minimum or as required by local base bioenvironmental
  regulation. For physical protection, there should be a physical barrier to keep spectators
  away or use wing-walkers, marshallers or crowd control monitors who can prevent entry to
  the area by unauthorized people. Areas where engines and propellers will be turning must be
  at least 150 feet from the spectator area and areas where rotors are turning must be at least
  200 feet from the spectator area. If moving aircraft from the static display area during the
  open house, moveable crowd barriers and crowd control monitors will provide a flexible
  means of securing the area.
  4.6.13. Aircraft Parking Plans. Identify parking locations for all attending aircraft and
  ensure pavement classification number of movement surfaces (taxiways, parking aprons,
  etc.) is adequate for planned operations. Consider crowd control operations and emergency
  vehicle access when determining parking locations. Also, consider whether aircraft should
  be refueled before or after the event. Take into account the possibility of an explosion
  caused by fuel vapors in empty tanks versus full fuel tanks. Installation commanders may
  grant non-DoD performers use of available hangar space. Non-DoD aircraft will not be
  given preference over military aircraft.
  4.6.14. Maintenance Facilities. For safety of flight maintenance, installation commanders
  may designate work areas to be used by non-DoD personnel for repairing an aircraft, grant
  access to shop facilities, and if requested, permit assistance by qualified Air Force
  maintenance personnel on a strictly voluntary basis. FAA certified maintenance personnel
  from either a civilian or warbird organization will supervise all maintenance personnel. The
  Air Force and any of its volunteer maintenance personnel will not be liable for any
  maintenance so performed. Coordinate with the staff legal officer before any work is
  accomplished to ensure liability is waived correctly through the use of an appropriate written
  waiver.
  4.6.15. Temporary Flight Restrictions. Temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) are a means
  to protect the aerial performers from airspace incursions by non-participating aircraft. The 5
  statute mile Class D airspace ring is a good boundary for a TFR. Make the request by
  following     the     procedures    listed   on    the    FAA     website,     currently   at:
  http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/airshow/tfr/.
  4.6.16. Communications. If practical, use discrete frequencies to control aerial
  performances. The communication plan should also have discrete frequencies for ground
  operations, security/emergency forces, and supervision. Coordinate frequency requirements
36                                                              AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


     with the host base frequency manager. In addition, attempt to avoid takeoffs or landings
     during any demonstration, as this may result in radio distraction and a safety of flight hazard.
     If takeoffs or landings must occur during a demonstration, it must be briefed to the
     performers prior to the performance to minimize distraction. The use of a common very-high
     frequency (VHF) for air boss is recommended. Some civilian aircraft are unable to tune
     certain VHF frequencies and should be consulted prior to selecting the frequency.
     4.6.17. Special Events and Flights of a Spectacular Nature. Special events (e.g., car
     versus aircraft race, etc.) or flights not covered in AFI 11-209 or AFI 11-246 MDS specific
     volume will require SAF/PAY and AF/A3O approval, after the MAJCOM has accomplished
     appropriate operational risk management assessments.
     4.6.18. Aerial Event Survey. An aerial event survey is a feasibility survey of the airfield.
     It is the first step in creating the FAA waiver request and the DD Form 2535. It includes the
     following:
        4.6.18.1. Identify the aerobatic box. The show lines define the width of the box. The
        performers define the length of the box. The aerobatic box is usually centered on show
        center. Remember this area must be unpopulated during the performances.
        4.6.18.2. Identify airspace constraints such as Class B, C, and D airspace, airways, traffic
        patterns, other airports, special use airspace, controlling agencies.
        4.6.18.3. Identify local constraints, for example, obstructions (natural or man-made),
        noise sensitive areas, environmentally sensitive areas, roads, secondary spectator areas
        (including parking areas), and ingress/egress routes for demo teams.
        4.6.18.4. Identify local air traffic. Determine departure and arrival fields and routing.
        4.6.18.5. Identify other local events on same days -- fairs, races, festivals, etc.
        4.6.18.6. Identify impact on airfield tenants.
        4.6.18.7. Create an airfield diagram.
     4.6.19. Airfield Diagram. Open house staffs must produce a diagram of the airfield/show
     site. Provide a copy to Civil Engineering to create any building/digging permits that might
     be required. Coordinate changes to the diagram with all functional staff (see Figure 4.1).
        4.6.19.1. As a minimum, the airfield diagram should depict:
            4.6.19.1.1. The complete aerobatic box.
            4.6.19.1.2. The primary spectator area and crowd line; the Category I, II, and III
            show lines with distances to the crowd line; corner markers and their distance to the
            end of the crowd line; and any secondary spectator areas.
            4.6.19.1.3. Show center and bomb burst cross points and latitude-longitude
            coordinates.
            4.6.19.1.4. Magnetic (MAG) bearing of the runway, depiction of magnetic north, and
            the scale of the diagram.
            4.6.19.1.5. Active and closed runways, performer parking, taxiways and run-up
            areas.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                        37


           4.6.19.1.6. The location of the aviation event control point, police dispatch,
           ambulance, fire-fighting equipment, first aid locations.
           4.6.19.1.7. Parachute landing areas.
           4.6.19.1.8. Pyrotechnic areas.
           4.6.19.1.9. Towers, vertical obstructions and no-fly or restricted zones or airspace.
       4.6.19.2. Each military demonstration team will have additional requirements for items
       to depict on the diagram.
       4.6.19.3. C-2 maps (showing building numbers and ground-relief lines) provided by civil
       engineering, or installation grid maps, are an excellent choice for the basis of the airfield
       diagram. Airfield master plan charts or aerial photographs may be useful as well.
4.7. The Airshow Waiver (CONUS events only). A waiver to FAA regulations is required to
conduct aerial demonstrations and non-standard operations at open houses. The waiver is
requested using a FAA Form 7711-2, available on the FAA website
(http://www.faa.gov/library/forms/). See paragraph 4.7.1 and Figures 4.2a and 4.2b for
examples of how to fill out the form for an open house. The application is due 90 days prior to
the event, but 120 days is recommended. See FAA Advisory Circular 91-45C and FAA Order
8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6 for assistance. Also, the local FSDO may assist in the preparation
of FAA Form 7711-2; however, the preparation and submission of FAA Form 7711-2, as well as
all of the necessary supporting documentation, are the responsibility of the open house staff. The
FAA will respond with FAA Form 7711-1 and the special provisions for the event. Carefully
review the FAA Form 7711-1 to ensure it grants the appropriate waivers and that compliance
will not be an issue. The air operations officer or the air boss must ensure the performers have
read and understand the special provisions.
   4.7.1. Completing the Application for Certificate of Waiver Authorization.
       4.7.1.1. Items 1 and 2 - name of organization and open house director.
       4.7.1.2. Item 3 - permanent mailing address and phone number.
       4.7.1.3. Item 4 - list all 14 CFR parts for which waivers are being requested. Reference
       14 CFR Part 91.905 for a list of sections eligible for waiver. Also talk to potential
       performers and determine which sections they will need waived.
       4.7.1.4. Item 5 - state what type of performances will be taking place, e.g., ―Annual
       airshow featuring non-aerobatic high and low speed flyovers, USAF demo teams,
       parachuting‖.
       4.7.1.5. Item 6 - define the area and altitude of the flight maneuvering airspace, e.g.,
       ―Five mile radius from LAT/LONG (ABC AFB), surface to 15000 MSL‖. Note: military
       demonstrations teams require 15,000 AGL.
       4.7.1.6. Item 7 - date and time of all arrival shows, practices, and performances. Include
       a buffer on both sides of the time window to allow for slippage.
       4.7.1.7. Item 8 - list information as completely as possible and add at the bottom, ―a final
       list of pilots and parachutists will be provided on date”. Be sure to comply with
       established deadlines.

                                          SERVICES

5.1. Open Houses. Open houses are community relations programs designed to educate the
public about the mission of the Air Force and the base. Generating revenue is not the primary
objective of conducting such events. Services MWR elements, while not required to do so, may
use NAF support to provide recreational events/activities, and entertainment held in conjunction
with the open house. However, installation commanders need to ensure the use of NAF does not
negatively affect long-term support for MWR programs. Units must adhere to the provisions
outlined in AFI 34-262. Services may sponsor recreational events and activities held in
conjunction with the open house, and may provide full or partial NAF support for activities like:
   5.1.1. Non-flying entertainment such as musical bands, fireworks, children‘s break areas.
   Consider the appropriateness of non-flying entertainment which may cause the open house
   to take on the character of a commercial event, carnival or fair.
   5.1.2. Civilian aerial demonstrations must be an adjunct to military activities. Commercial
   sponsorship of civilian demonstrations may be solicited under the same conditions as other
   commercial sponsorship. See paragraphs 6.4 for funding guidance.
   5.1.3. Bleachers or chairs in support of Services MWR booths, displays, events, or
   entertainment performances. See paragraphs 1.12.6 and 5.3 for concessionaire guidance.
   5.1.4. Public address systems for the Services MWR elements of the event.
   5.1.5. Open house reception open to the entire base population.
   5.1.6. Family area or kid‘s zone. Mechanical rides intended for adults such as large roller
   coasters and Ferris wheels, along with games of chance or skill, are prohibited. ―Kid zone‖
   activities are provided or contracted for by Services NAF Contracting and should be solely
   for the use of children. Activities can include attractions such as inflatable jumping castles,
   small mechanical rides like carousels and small trains, face painting, rock climbing walls,
   etc. Only Services may contract for these activities/attractions and charge a fee.
   5.1.7. Inclement weather or rain insurance for the Services MWR elements of the event.
   Refer to AFI 34-208, Property and Casualty Program, paragraph 32.
   5.1.8. Food, beverage, souvenir and other concessions, operated directly by Services or by
   concessionaire contract. Refer to AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program, for information
   regarding serving of alcoholic beverages.
   5.1.9. Payments to unofficial activities or private organizations for operating Services MWR
   concession booths (when included in a services or concessionaire contract).
   5.1.10. Marketing and publicity for Services MWR programs or events.
   5.1.11. Souvenir programs for direct sale by Services MWR activities.
5.2. Restrictions. Services cannot subsidize mission-related elements of the open house or
provide NAF or commercial sponsorship support for elements not related to Services MWR
involvement. Do not provide funds, or allow funds generated from open houses, to be used for:
42                                                             AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


     5.2.1. Socials, receptions, seating, or tents for exclusive use by certain groups or individuals
     except as allowed in paragraphs 1.12, 5.3 and 6.11.
     5.2.2. Transportation or lodging for military members or individuals not connected with
     Services MWR-related events.
     5.2.3. Any cost for which APFs are authorized. Installations may request waiver of this
     restriction per paragraph 2.10.1.1.
     5.2.4. Insurance for APF-funded aerial or other demonstrations.
     5.2.5. Essential elements of the open house that would exist regardless of Services MWR
     participation. Such elements include basic health, sanitation, safety, security, and comfort of
     the attendees.
5.3. Concessionaire Contracts.
     5.3.1. Services may enter into one or more concessionaire contracts. Services MWR NAF
     concessionaire contracts must adhere to the provisions of Air Force Non-Appropriated Fund
     Contracting requirements IAW AFMAN 64-302, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Contract
     Procedures. Only warranted contracting officers are authorized to negotiate with vendors.
     NAF concessionaire contracts must be competed to the maximum extent practical. Sole
     source contracts are not allowed unless fully justified in writing and approved by the local
     SJA and contracting officer. Proceeds from concession contracts go to the NAF to support
     MWR elements and cannot be converted or diverted to support essential elements to the open
     house. Installations should consider including in the statement of work a requirement for a
     low-priced meal for children e.g., a sandwich, chips and drink or other discounted meal
     options. The only mechanism for an NFE to become a concessionaire on a military
     installation is through a NAF concessions contract.
     5.3.2. When entering into exclusive contracts (i.e., only a single awardee will sell food
     and/or souvenirs), consider including exceptions to allow sale of specific memorabilia near
     static displays and to allow for food provided to performers, volunteers, within the
     commander‘s tent or within tents provided as a concession.
     5.3.3. In addition to products such as food and merchandise, Services may use
     concessionaires to provide chairs, bleachers or tents (see paragraph 1.12.6).
     5.3.4. Consider using an existing umbrella contract for all Services concessions.
     5.3.5. Automatic teller machines are not Services concessions, but may be obtained pursuant
     to the rules in DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Vol. 5, Ch. 34.
5.4. Souvenir Programs. Souvenir programs may be produced and sold by Services or through
a concessionaire contract provided:
     5.4.1. APFs are not used for their publication or distribution.
     5.4.2. The ―No Federal endorsement of advertisers/sponsors is intended or implied‖
     disclaimer accompanies recognition of advertisers or commercial sponsors.
     5.4.3. If there is a requirement in the previously negotiated civilian enterprise base
     newspaper contract to print such programs produced by Services or a concessionaire
     contract, then programs cannot be sold. Note: A program printed by a newspaper contractor
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    43


   may be different in form and quality from a souvenir program contemplated by a
   concessionaire.   Installations (JA, PA and Contracting) can determine whether a
   concessionaire program will in fact conflict with a contractual requirement for a newspaper
   contractor.
5.5. Commercial Sponsorship. Commercial sponsorship involves accepting money, goods, or
services from commercial sponsors in support of an event, in exchange for sponsor recognition
and advertising privileges. Commercial sponsorship recognition should be greater than other
donors, refer to paragraph 1.7.4. Commercial sponsorship may be used to pay for only the
MWR elements of an open house. For example, Services could obtain commercial sponsors for
a concert or civilian air act in conjunction with an open house. See AFI 34-407, Air Force
Commercial Sponsorship Program for detailed guidance on commercial sponsorship.
Delegation authority was provided to SecAF requiring at a minimum SES or GO (AF/A1S)
approval authority for commercial sponsorship of MWR eventsat open houses IAW DoDI
1015.10.
   5.5.1. Banks as Commercial Sponsors. Banks may be commercial sponsors and may
   receive commercial sponsor sign and display benefits. However, DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 5,
   Ch. 34, 340404 prohibits off-base financial institutions from distributing competitive
   literature or forms on the installation. DoDI 1015.10 limits promotions by off-base financial
   institutions to product lines and services not offered by the applicable on-base bank or credit
   union.
   5.5.2. Agency and Commercial Sponsorship. A commercial entity may authorize another
   entity to act as its agent in arranging for commercial sponsorship via a power of attorney or
   agency agreement authorizing the agent to negotiate for and commit support to the MWR
   elements of the event. An agency agreement does not prevent Services personnel from
   contacting a potential sponsor directly. Installations services and legal offices should verify
   the legitimacy of any purported agency agreement, and/or terms of specific agreements to
   ensure the Air Force NAFI receives the promised funds, goods or services in exchange for
   the agreed recognition and advertising. Services should advertise the event sponsorship
   opportunity locally to ensure all businesses have an equal opportunity to become sponsors.
   5.5.3. Develop a commercial sponsorship plan for the Open House and consider whether
   commercial sponsorship of events at open houses will reduce the level of commercial
   sponsorship available for other MWR activities at the installation. Survey other bases and
   local events to determine fair market value of sponsorship for similar benefits at similar
   events. Installations will address these considerations in any commercial sponsorship
   proposal and forward them through their respective MAJCOM who will request AF/A1S
   approval.
   5.5.4. To limit the financial risks of contracting for an event intended to be paid through
   commercial sponsorship, consider arranging for the commercial sponsor to contract directly
   for the event and offer it as an in-kind commercial sponsorship. Alternatively, if the NAFI
   contracts in advance for the event, include a contract clause allowing the NAFI to cancel the
   contract if sufficient commercial sponsorship is not arranged by a specified date.

                                            Chapter 6

                                FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

6.1. General Funding Guidance. Appropriated funds are available to finance various aspects
of open houses. APFs are authorized for those portions of an open house that exist to inform the
public about the capabilities, equipment, training and professionalism of the Air Force and its
people. While some aspects of an open house are entertaining, the primary purpose of the event
is not entertainment. Services can sponsor, with full or partial NAF support, recreational events
and activities (i.e. food and entertainment) held in conjunction with the open house.
6.2. Military Aerial Demonstration Teams. The expenses incurred by installations supporting
all military crews flying DoD-owned aircraft taking part in aerial demonstration at an open house
are financed with APFs (operations and maintenance (O&M) funds). Typical expenses include
lodging, meals, transportation, pyrotechnics used in the demonstrations and other requirements
as established in the Thunderbirds, Blue Angels, AF single-ship demo team and heritage flight
support manuals. The term ―meals‖ does not include snacks, refreshments and bottled water
consumed during the event. These are considered a personal expense (covered by pay,
allowances and per diem) and may not be purchased with APF.
6.3. Funding Vintage Military Aircraft (Warbirds) Performances or Displays. Warbird
crews and their aircraft, which belong to NFEs or individuals and which are contracted to
perform at open house events, may be financed with APFs (O&M funds). Because of their
military significance, warbirds may be funded with APF to affect the public affairs and
community relations purpose of an open house. The expenses would be those normally
associated with a non-personal services contract. Typical expenses that may be funded are
lodging, meals, transportation (at the open house location), and any pyrotechnics used in the
demonstration. Snacks, refreshments and bottled water may be provided if required by the
contract. Fuel (aviation gas [AVGAS]/JP-8) for the flight to and from the open house location,
rehearsals and actual performances may be provided at Government expense pursuant to the APF
contract. In lieu of a direct monetary gift, an NFE or individual may provide a warbird
performance as a gift to the Air Force. The NFE or individual will conduct business directly
with the warbird owner/operator and then donate the performance to the Air Force.
6.4. Funding Civilian Aerial Performance or Display (Non-warbird). APFs are not
authorized to fund any costs incurred by crews or the aircraft of civilian aerial performance
individuals or teams. All costs, including lodging, meals, transportation, may be funded with
non-Federal/private funds either donated or provided through the NAF commercial sponsorship
program for civilian aerial demonstrations at the open house involved. Use of commercial
sponsorship for civilian aerial performance or display requires AF/A1S approval (see paragraph
5.5). In the case of individual donations, gifts will be processed for acceptance by the Air Force
through the Air Force's agent (installation commander or designee). Pursuant to a NAF contract,
the Government may provide fuel for the flight to and from the open house location, rehearsals
and actual performances. Absent a Government contract, the installation may authorize DWCF
fuel cash sales for aircraft, vehicles, and equipment that are on display and/or perform at an open
house pursuant to DESC policy guidance. Vehicles and equipment other than those actually on
display or directly involved in the open house performance may not purchase DWCF fuel.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                       45


6.5. Ground Displays. Ground displays (including military aircraft and equipment, civilian
aircraft, and other displays) may be permitted IAW paragraph 1.9. Military aircraft and other
military equipment ground static and mobile displays and warbirds are funded with APFs.
Civilian aircraft and other non-military ground displays may be funded through NAFs derived
through commercial sponsorship of that particular event, or given as gifts to the Air Force.
Displays, other than aircraft or military equipment, may be funded through APF, NAF
commercial sponsorship program or non-Federal sources, depending on the purpose of and
authority for the particular display.
6.6. Facilities and Accommodations. Essential elements of expense for open house facilities
and accommodations are those expenses that would be incurred if there were no Services MWR
participation. Essential accommodations and facilities such as sanitation (trash containers, refuse
collection), health, safety, security (phones, radios), power outlets, professional public address
systems and announcer, and general comfort of the public are funded with APF only. Other
elements of general expense may be funded by APFs, NAFs, or private funds depending on the
part of the open house being supported -- tents/booths (see paragraph 1.12.), tables/chairs,
bleachers, golf carts, portable rest rooms, generators, lighting, stage, public address system (other
than the main system required for general safety and security). See Attachment 4, Funding
Source Guide matrix.
6.7. Crowd Control, Security, and Health/Safety. Expenses incurred to ensure security,
provide first aid, and facilitate safe movement and control the crowds attending the event are
funded with APFs. Typical expenses are for air-to-ground radios, first aid materials, lost and
found, fences, ropes/stanchions, transportation, barriers, parking/parking passes and shuttles (no
cost to public), and signs and badges.
6.8. Publicity. Air Force open houses receive extensive local news coverage via print, radio,
and television throughout the United States. It is often one of the premier attractions in the
region and may be well publicized by the Chamber of Commerce in many areas. Consequently,
the use of Government-funded advertising, upon review by and approval from PA, requires
substantial justification for using APFs before it could be considered a necessary expense.
Evaluate carefully before committing APF to advertising. Public service announcements (PSAs)
should be used to the maximum extent before resorting to paid advertising. Paid advertising may
be donated or simply provided at the donor‘s expense. Do not incorporate the name of an NFE
into the name of an open house. NAF may be used for advertising MWR programs and events.
Installation PA offices should monitor non-Air Force advertising of open houses for accuracy.
   6.8.1. Programs. The installation must provide a free schedule of the day‘s events, readily
   available to attendees; costs are funded with APFs. Separately services may develop a
   souvenir program, to be sold or distributed, that covers all elements of the open house (see
   paragraph 5.4 above). This may be done directly or through a concessionaire contract. It
   may include commercial sponsor and advertising recognition for those who directly or
   indirectly (contributor recognition must be limited to purchased advertising) provide funds,
   goods or services in support of the open house. Determine whether the base newspaper
   contractor has the rights to such publications and the nature of the program contemplated by
   the newspaper contractor. If the base newspaper has the rights to a free open house program
   as part of the base newspaper contract and plans to produce a souvenir program, Services
   may produce a souvenir program for sale only with the contractor‘s consent. Follow

     AFMAN 34-416, Air Force Commercial Sponsorship and Sale of NAFI Advertising
     Procedures and AFI 34-407.
     6.8.2. Open House Website. Incorporate open house information into the installation‘s
     public Web site. Exercise appropriate Government control over Government Web sites
     operated through contracts.
6.9. Entertainment. Events which are intended solely as entertainment are funded either by
NAF or gifts of private funds. Typical entertainment, which is incidental to the primary purpose
of the event, may be fireworks, concerts, and/or kids‘ play area.
6.10. Concessions. The sale of food, beverages (including beer) and souvenirs or other
amenities such as chairs or shaded viewing areas is restricted to Services. Procurement is with
NAFs, including NAFs resulting from commercial sponsorship, and the receipts are accounted
for in the NAF system. Non-Federal entities providing static displays, including warbirds, may
accept donations, but they may only sell souvenirs (that do not compete with Base Exchange
items) pursuant to a Services concessions contract. Only Services or authorized concessionaires
may sell commercial products and services. The display, promotion, or advertisement of
commercial products and services must be reviewed by base legal and approved by the
installation commander.
6.11. Commander’s Hospitality Tent. A commander‘s hospitality tent, as well as civic and
social events occurring at the time of the open house, are considered protocol activities and may
be supported by official representation funds (ORFs) if they comply with AFI 65-603.
Admission to the commander‘s hospitality tent as a ―reward‖ to attract or encourage sponsorship
or donations is prohibited. The commander‘s hospitality tent is not to be ―sponsored‖ and there
are to be no sponsor or supporter signs in the area (in accordance with paragraphs 1.12.5 and
1.12.6) . Concessionaires may not provide a commander‘s hospitality tent (or similar APF
related support) in conjunction with receiving a NAF contract. While the installation
commander and other dignitaries are permitted to visit with commercial sponsor representatives,
a visit cannot be guaranteed and included as a 'benefit' in the commercial sponsorship agreement.
6.12. Funding Sources. Attachment 4 provides a funding source guide for specific Air Force
open house requirements.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                       47


                                            Chapter 7

                                      LEGAL GUIDANCE

7.1. Introduction. This chapter highlights some common legal issues that may arise during
open houses. Due to the unique circumstances in planning and conducting an Air Force open
house, legal coordinators must be involved at all stages of the process. The information
presented is not all-inclusive and should not be considered a substitute for proper legal oversight
by trained personnel.
7.2. Command Authority During an Open House
   7.2.1. Installation commanders have inherent authority to restrict political and dissident
   activity on a military base (DoDD 1325.6, Guidelines for Handling Dissident and Protest
   Activities Among Members of Armed Forces, paragraph C(5)(e); Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S.
   828 (1976); OpJAGAF 1993/21, 3 Mar 93). Holding an open house does not change this
   fundamental concept. Thus, the notices and warnings posted at an installation‘s gates about
   restrictions on conduct, which are applicable to those who enter a Federal installation, apply
   even when the public as a whole is invited onto the premises. If attendees are bussed onto
   the installation, consider placing similar signs at the point of embarkation to ensure proper
   notice.
   7.2.2. Military bases are generally not public forums. Therefore, commanders should
   prohibit demonstrations inside an installation that could result in interference with or
   prevention of orderly accomplishment of the mission of the installation, or present a clear
   danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of military forces (see DoDD 1325.6, paragraph
   C(5)(e); AFI 51-903, Dissident and Protest Activities, paragraph 6). If a demonstration or
   unauthorized activity begins to take place during an open house, commanders and Security
   Forces must be ready to respond immediately.
   7.2.3. Base open houses do not turn a base into a public forum for purposes of First
   Amendment rights. See Persons for Free Speech at SAC v. United States Air Force, 675 F2d
   1010 (8th Cir 1982), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1092 (1982); see also Shopco Distribution Co. v.
   Commanding General, Camp Lejeune, 885 F2d 167 (4th Cir 1989). However, portions of a
   base which are generally open to the public may be public forums for First Amendment
   purposes. See U.S. v. Gourley, 502 F2d 785 (10th Cir 1974). The key is whether the Air
   Force ordinarily exercises control over the area. If non-DoD personnel are normally
   restricted from freely accessing the property in question, an open house will not change the
   commander‘s inherent authority limit demonstrations and control civilian activities in that
   area.
   7.2.4. Installation officials must anticipate that demonstrations, dissident activities, political
   speeches, and other unauthorized or disruptive behavior may occur during the open house.
   Security Forces should refer to AFMAN 31-201, Vol 6, Civil Disturbance, for further
   instructions. Both the legal coordinator and Security Forces coordinator should develop an
   operations plan to respond to and control persons who seek to disrupt the event, damage
   government property, or harm event participants. Planning will involve coordination with
   local law enforcement personnel, as well as with the appropriate United States Attorney and
   district attorney‘s office, or foreign equivalent if overseas.
48                                                             AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


7.3. Standards of Conduct Considerations
     7.3.1. The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) establishes uniform standards of conduct
     (―ethics‖) rules for the entire Executive Branch of the Federal Government. The ethics rules
     are the minimum standards of ethical conduct within the U.S. Government and serve as the
     starting point for ethical conduct.
     7.3.2. DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), is the DoD‘s regulation on standards of
     conduct. It incorporates the OGE rules into DoD policy and supplements them with rules
     unique to DoD personnel.
        7.3.2.1. The JER addresses individual ethical conduct; that is, what employees may and
        may not do as they carry out their official (and sometimes personal) activities. It
        regulates conduct concerning personal gifts, conflicts of interest, use of government
        resources, use of one‘s government position, and other work-related activities.
        7.3.2.2. For agency conduct, all of the DoD and Air Force publications listed in
        Attachment 1 impact Air Force activities in holding an open house. The publications
        that deal most directly with community relations are DoDD 5410.18, Public Affairs
        Community Relations Policy, DoDI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy
        Implementation, and AFI 35-101.
        7.3.2.3. It is important to follow agency regulations closely because violations could
        trigger punitive measures. For example, misusing public office and/or official resources,
        giving preferential treatment, violating fiscal law principles, or not addressing conflicts of
        interest could lead to disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice
        (UCMJ) for military members and personnel regulations for civilian employees.
        7.3.2.4. The legal coordinator must be involved in all stages of event planning, from the
        first meeting to the after-action report. Some fiscal and JER issues are counterintuitive
        and often can only be spotted and evaluated with the help of a trained attorney.
     7.3.3. 10 U.S.C. § 2783(b) provides that violations of policy for the management and use of
     nonappropriated funds (including those derived from commercial sponsorship) carry the
     same penalties as similar transgressions involving the misuse of appropriated funds.
     Violations by personnel subject to the UCMJ are punishable under the UCMJ.
7.4. Key Ethics Considerations
     7.4.1. Endorsement. DoD personnel may not officially endorse, or appear to endorse, any
     non-Federal entity, event, product, service or enterprise.
        7.4.1.1. The term ―non-Federal entity‖ includes: charities; non-profit associations;
        private organizations (including those chartered on military installations); professional
        groups; commercial endeavors; foreign governments; contractors; and non-government
        individuals.
        7.4.1.2. To ―endorse‖ means to promote, support with approval, or sponsor without
        authority. This means personnel cannot use their official office, title or position to
        suggest Air Force support of a private entity.       Personnel are also prohibited from
        personally endorsing any non-Federal entity if their actions are connected to their official
        position in any way.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   49


  7.4.2. Preferential Treatment. DoD personnel shall act impartially and not give
  preferential treatment to any non-Federal entity or individual.
     7.4.2.1. Thus, according to the JER, when official support is provided to one non-Federal
     entity, the approving official must be able and willing to provide support to comparable
     non-Federal entities. If similar support cannot be granted to all comparable entities, or an
     official is unwilling to support a particular comparable entity, the most prudent course of
     action in most cases is to refrain from supporting any entity.
     7.4.2.2. Many organizations seek affiliation with the Air Force, particularly in
     conjunction with open houses. It can be difficult to determine whether an individual‘s or
     a non-Federal entity‘s goals are altruistic, personal or commercial. Therefore, Air Force
     officials should seek guidance from their staff judge advocate prior to entering into any
     relationship or agreement with, or providing any support to, any non-Federal entity.
  7.4.3. “Quid Pro Quo” Arrangements. The term ―quid pro quo‖ means literally
  ―something for something,‖ or the giving of one valuable thing for another valuable thing.
  Except for duly appointed Contracting Officers, AF personnel do not have legal authority to
  bind the Government to any financial obligation.
     7.4.3.1. While there are certain exceptions to this rule (e.g.. the Services MWR
     commercial sponsorship program), avoid any arrangement that appears to be a quid pro
     quo arrangement without the advice of a judge advocate or contracting officer.
     7.4.3.2. Be extremely careful not to commit the Air Force to an obligation with an
     outside organization without legal and contracting advice and clear authority to do so.
  7.4.4. Fundraising. Private organizations may engage in fundraising pursuant to AFI 34-
  223 Private Organizations and AFI 36-3101, Fundraising within the Air Force. When
  deciding whether to approve a PO fundraiser, the installation should consider the fundraising
  proposal‘s relation to the overall open house and the impact on NAF sales or concessions.
  7.4.5. Conflicts of Interest. Air Force employees are prohibited by criminal laws from
  participating personally and substantially in any official matter that may impact their
  financial interests or the financial interests of someone with whom they have a covered
  relationship (such as a close family member, potential employer, or private organizations).
  Even the appearance of a conflict of interest must be avoided.
     7.4.5.1. Air Force employees must also remain impartial or recuse themselves in dealing
     with official issues that involve a private organization with which they are associated in a
     personal capacity. Employees are generally prohibited from engaging in any official
     activities in which a private organization is a party or has a financial interest if the
     employee is an ―active participant‖ in the private organization or has been an officer
     within the last year.
         7.4.5.1.1. The term ―active participant‖ includes service as an official of the
         organization, such as a committee chairperson or organization spokesman. It also
         includes significant time devoted to promoting specific programs, including
         fundraising efforts. Thus, an Air Force official who takes an active role in a base-
         affiliated private organization cannot make a decision in an official capacity that will
50                                                             AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


            directly affect the private organization‘s financial status. Acting in both capacities
            (official and personal) violates the conflict of interest rules.
7.5. Gifts to the Air Force.
     7.5.1. A Federal statute (10 U.S.C. § 2601) authorizes the SECAF to accept and use gifts of
     personal or real property or services to carry out the Air Force mission. Gifts may be
     conditional (with restrictions) or unconditional (no restrictions). The Secretary has delegated
     his authority to accept gifts to designated subordinate officers, down to and including
     installation commanders.
     7.5.2. AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, establishes the procedures for
     receiving, processing and accepting gifts. Although most gifts are processed under this
     guidance, other instructions govern different types of gifts. , limits on the use of APF do not
     normally limit Air Force authority to accept gifts pursuant to AFI 51-601
        7.5.2.1. Gifts to a non-appropriated fund instrumentality -- see AFI 34-201, Use of
        Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). Use this authority only if the gift is offered directly to
        the specific NAFI, rather than the Air Force.
        7.5.2.2. Gifts to religious funds -- see AFI 52-101, Planning and Organizing.
        7.5.2.3. Gifts from foreign governments to individuals -- see AFI 51-901, Gifts From
        Foreign Governments.
        7.5.2.4. Gifts to individuals -- see JER, Chapter 2.
        7.5.2.5. Gifts of travel benefits -- see 31 U.S.C. § 1353; 41 CFR Part 304-1, Payment of
        Travel Expenses From a Non-Federal Source – Authority.
     7.5.3. Ordinarily, officials may accept gifts offered to the Air Force unless acceptance would
     not be in the best interest of the Air Force. The authority to accept a gift depends upon the
     value of the gift. As a rule of thumb, gifts valued over $50,000 may only be accepted at the
     Secretarial level. A gift of tangible or intangible personal property of $50,000 or less, that
     does not require more than negligible expenditure for its acceptance and maintenance, may
     be promptly accepted or rejected by a commander at the MAJCOM and FOA level. These
     commanders may re-delegate their authority to subordinate commanders, but not lower than
     installation commanders. Notwithstanding any such re-delegation, commanders of Air Force
     installations may accept or reject gifts of personal property with a value of $5,000 or less.
     AFI 51-601 provides detailed guidance for personal property gifts and other types of gifts
     that might be offered to the Air Force. Where a single non-Federal entity gifts multiple items
     toward an open house, the value of all gifts is aggregated when determining the acceptance
     authority. In other words if three gifts each valued at $20,000 are given by an NFE, they
     must be forwarded for acceptance at the Secretarial level.
     7.5.4. In order to protect both the Air Force and the donor, all gifts (regardless of value)
     must be processed in accordance with AFI 51-601 (or AFI 34-201 for gifts to an AFNAFI).
     Staff the gift acceptance package according to those instructions (depending on the type and
     value of the gift) and send a written acceptance or rejection letter to the donor. Where gift
     acceptance requires staffing to a higher authority, ensure ample time is allowed for
     processing and avoid as much as possible the need for last-minute approvals. Installation
     legal staffs should be kept up to date on anticipated gifts so that they can in turn advise
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   51


   higher-level gift acceptance authorities so that potential issues are identified and addressed
   well in advance
   7.5.5. Soliciting Gifts. DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Vol. 12,
   Ch. 30, 300502 directs that DoD personnel shall not solicit, fundraise for, or otherwise
   request or encourage the offer of a gift to DoD and that acceptance authorities shall not
   accept gifts offered contrary to this policy. However, once an offer has been initiated by a
   NFE, AF personnel may follow up with specific guidance and information, to include
   installation needs.
7.6. Voluntary and Gratuitous Services. Voluntary services are accepted by the installation
commander or designee on behalf of the Air Force, where authorized by law (see 31 U.S.C.
1342). The Air Force may accept gratuitous services pursuant to an advance written agreement.
A volunteer may not be used to fill a vacant, paid civilian position. OpJAGAF 1991/6, 1986/62.
DoDI 1100.21, Voluntary Services in the Department of Defense, provides additional guidance
for voluntary services accepted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 1588. While that statute is not the
exclusive authority for accepting gratuitous services (see OpJAGAF 1987/7), it provides Federal
Employees Compensation Act and tort liability coverage for volunteers providing services listed
in 10 U.S.C. § 1588(a). Some services at an open house may fall into the statutory category of
―services to members of the armed forces and the families of such members.‖. The DoDI directs
use of DD Form 2793, Volunteer Agreement for Appropriated Activities or Nonappropriated
Fund Instrumentalities. Airman and Family Readiness Centers generally manage volunteers for
Air Force units. AFI 36-3009, Airman and Family Readiness Centers, para. 3.11.
7.7. Overseas Considerations. For overseas events careful consideration must be given to host
nation laws and regulations that impact open house activities. Of special concern are tax
considerations that may restrict sales of items imported tax free for use of the United States
forces. As the legal issues vary from country to country, a careful study of individual national
agreements and requirements is necessary.
7.8. Indemnification, Liability and Insurance.
   7.8.1. Under an indemnification agreement, one party promises, in effect, to cover another
   party‘s losses or liability. Contracts or other agreements for indemnification without limit
   would violate the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341.
   7.8.2. POs, contractors and other NFEs are not entitled to sovereign immunity defense by the
   Department of Justice or similar legal protections accorded to the Air Force or to
   nonappropriated fund instrumentalities.
   7.8.3. The Air Force must obtain from any civil air performer landing at or taking off from
   an installation airfield a hold harmless agreement (DD Form 2402) and a certificate of
   insurance (DD Form 2400) prior to issuing a landing permit. See AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft
   Landing Permits.

                                             Chapter 8

                                        CONTRACTING

8.1. General. Identification of purchase requirements early in the planning for the open house
is critical to success. An experienced contracting person will be assigned to the open house staff
to provide business advice, help with the development of requirements, and ensure compliance
with acquisition regulations and laws.
8.2. Local Purchase Support for Open Houses.
     8.2.1. Local purchase requests (e.g., staff support, performers, etc.) for open house
     requirements should be coordinated with Contracting and Finance as early in the planning
     process as possible. The Contracting Officer/coordinator will ensure the FAR to include all
     Supplements and laws are followed to ensure adequate competition, fair and reasonable
     pricing, and small business requirements, etc. Only contracting officers have the authority to
     enter into contracts on behalf of the Government. The open house director and his staff shall
     not book vendors/demonstrators without consulting with the contracting officer/coordinator
     assigned to their team. Improperly entering into an agreement or contract could result in an
     unauthorized commitment and may result in disciplinary action.
     8.2.2. Vendors/performers should not be paid in advance of services performed, although a
     reasonable deposit may be made to contract performers (refer to FAR 32.4). The performer
     may have the right to a settlement if an open house is cancelled and a contract to perform is
     terminated
     8.2.3. The open house director and staff should consult with FM and Services on which
     requirements should be procured with APF and which with NAF, see the Funding Source
     Guide at Attachment 4. All purchases made with the Government Purchase Card (GPC)
     will comply with AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program.
     Consult with the base GPC program manager for advice on proper use of the GPC.
     8.2.4. Both APF and NAF contracts may include Government consideration other than
     money payments; in kind consideration may result in a lower overall cost to the Government.
     Examples include arranging for food, fuel, use of on-base lodging, or use of Government
     space or equipment. Such consideration need not be directly related to the goods or services
     the contractor is to provide the Government. If alternative forms of consideration are used in
     NAF contracts, the contract must stipulate that there is a dollar value associated with the
     exchange. The amount must be stated in the payment terms of the contract and the
     Contracting Officer must determine if the consideration is fair and reasonable and document
     the file accordingly. For example, in a NAF contract, Government consideration for a
     civilian aerial demonstration could include a reserved tent space for the contractor and an
     exception from an otherwise exclusive food concession to allow the contractor to bring
     catered food into the tent space (see paragraph 1.12.8). Any contractor signage in tent
     space must be internal and not visible to the general public. Display of products or services
     are prohibited. Use of Government property (including both real property and personal
     property such as a tent) in APF contracts is covered by FAR Part 45 (NAF contracts are not
     governed by the FAR). FAR 45.102(b) allows contracting officers to provide property to
     contractors only when it is clearly demonstrated 1) to be in the Government's best interest; 2)
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                     53


   that the overall benefit significantly outweighs the increased cost of administration, including
   property disposal; 3) that providing the property does not substantially increase the
   Government's assumption of risk; and 4) that Government requirements cannot otherwise be
   met. The contracting officer‘s determination concerning these factors should consider
   whether providing Government property is the only way to meet Government requirements
   within the limits of available funding. Planners should consult with JA and FM
   representatives to ensure compliance with applicable contracting, ethics, and fiscal laws and
   regulations when acquiring goods or services with in-kind contractual consideration.
   8.2.5. Because a variety of unique aerial demonstrations, ground displays and Services
   entertainment events could be appropriate for an open house, consider using a public
   solicitation (via a Request For Proposal (RFP)) to identify a variety of choices.
8.3. Base Service/Support Contracts. Additional service/support requirements for an open
house (e.g., transient alert) should be coordinated well in advance of the event with contracting
and the functional owner of the service (e.g., Maintenance Operation Squadron). These
requirements may require contract modification and additional funding depending on the nature
of the requirement and structure/scope of the contract.
8.4. Key Fiscal Considerations.
   8.4.1. Congress regulates virtually all Executive Branch programs and activities through the
   appropriations process. Congress has enacted fiscal controls, which, if violated, subject the
   offender to serious adverse personnel actions and criminal penalties. This means that all Air
   Force officials must be conscious of funding issues throughout the planning and execution
   stages of open houses.
   8.4.2. The Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. § 1341, 1342, and 1517) prohibits any Government
   officer or employee from:
       8.4.2.1. Making or authorizing an expenditure or obligation in excess of the amount
       available in an appropriation.
       8.4.2.2. Making or authorizing expenditures or incurring obligations in excess of formal
       subdivisions of funds, or amounts permitted by regulations.
       8.4.2.3. Incurring an obligation in advance of an appropriation, unless authorized.
       8.4.2.4. Accepting voluntary services except as specified (see paragraph 7.6.).
54                                                           AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


                                            Chapter 9

                                            SAFETY

9.1. Introduction. Safety must be a prime consideration at all times during all phases of open
house planning and execution. The base safety staff will continually coordinate with the open
house staff during the planning and execution of the open house to ensure all safety criteria and
concerns are met and addressed. The safety staff, alone, cannot identify every safety concern or
ensure all guidelines are followed. Operational risk management (ORM) is a commander‘s
program, and as such, ORM trained facilitators from every functional area will help identify any
hazards and mitigate unnecessary risks via an ORM assessment and assist with the open house as
directed by the open house director (Ref: AFPD 90-9, and AFI 90-901, Operational Risk
Management). Ensure the open house director and safety staff are notified of any unresolved
safety issues/questions as well as all mishaps that involve injuries or property damage before,
during, and after the open house. Every functional area will assist in compiling the ―after action‖
report to identify lessons learned and any safety concerns.
9.2. References. There are many regulations and publications that address safety considerations
during open houses. Table 9.1 provides a general listing of regulations/publications that address
safety related procedures or safety concerns at open houses. All applicable regulations must be
reviewed to ensure the appropriate safety precautions and stipulations are followed. The
guidance contained in the listed regulations is not a replacement for common sense; the guidance
will dictate that certain steps or procedures are followed, but it cannot encompass every
eventuality. Activities or procedures not addressed by published guidance should be reviewed
with safety in mind, and appropriate caution and sound judgment should be exercised. See
Section A2B Planning, Air Show General Safety Requirements for additional considerations
(e.g. no airborne concessions (helium balloons and no handouts/flyers).
9.3. General Responsibilities for all Involved Agencies.
     9.3.1. Assist the open house director in managing risks. Risk management is the effective
     use of available resources (i.e., time, manpower, and funding) to prioritize and complete
     actions required to reduce risk. Four principles govern all actions associated with the
     management of risk. These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, during,
     and after all tasks and operations.
        9.3.1.1. Accept no unnecessary risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate
        return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All Air Force missions and
        daily routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are
        those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the
        lowest acceptable risk.
        9.3.1.2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the
        appropriate level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or
        failure of the mission must be included in the risk decision process.
        9.3.1.3. Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs. All potential benefits should be
        compared to all potential costs. The process of weighing risks against opportunities and
        benefits helps to maximize capability. However, ORM cannot be used to violate safety
        standards or requirements.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    55


       9.3.1.4. Integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels of the open house. To
       effectively apply risk management, dedicate time and resources to integrate ORM
       principles into planning and operational processes. Risk assessments of operations are
       mission supportive when they are done as a normal way of conducting a mission, not an
       add-on process performed by people not otherwise involved. To support these principles,
       the open house director will apply ORM during all aspects of preparation (planning,
       organizing, training, equipping, and sustaining) and employment of open house
       resources. (Reference: AFPD 90-9 and AFI 90-901).
9.4. Ground Safety Responsibilities. Ground Safety will coordinate with all functional areas
during the planning and execution phases of the open house. Particular coordination is required
with the following agencies emphasizing the stated areas:
   9.4.1. Traffic Engineer. Normally responsible for on and off-base traffic plans, visitor-
   parking plan, open house worker parking, crowd control, pedestrian routes, emergency
   vehicle parking and routes, vehicle and golf cart use on aircraft ramp and open house area.
   Ensure planned re-supply routes for vendors are designed to minimize vehicle movement
   through crowds. Traffic and parking plans should be created in conjunction with Security
   Forces and the installation anti-terrorism officer. Prohibit hazards such as bicycles, skates,
   animals, rollerblades, and skateboards in the spectator area.
   9.4.2. Contracting. Ensure proper Federal Acquisitions Regulation safety clauses are
   included in all open house contracts (as identified by Safety coordinator). Vendors must
   comply with all applicable Federal, state and local safety requirements, laws and regulations,
   as well as any base requirements. Obtain from Civil Engineering applicable local, state, etc.,
   regulations and ordinances and existing sanitation standards established by local or state
   authorities. When contracting mechanical rides for kid zones ensure the rides meet any
   Federal, state or host nation inspection requirements.
   9.4.3. Services, NFEs, or POs. Ensure all booth workers are trained for booth operation,
   including fire, safety and health issues. Booths must be properly equipped and properly
   staffed. Coordinate on the plan for booth location and required equipment. Cooking booths
   will be located at least 50 feet from the aircraft display areas. Both booths and tents must be
   properly secured to prevent damage from high winds. Bleacher seating must comply with
   US Consumer Product Safety Commission Publication #330, Guidelines for Retrofitting
   Bleachers, current Uniform Building Codes (chapter 4, Section 1008 of ubc), local laws, and
   National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Life Codes. Minimize tent lines/anchors intrusions
   into the public walkway. When anchors (spikes) intrude into the walkway, anchors and lines
   must be properly identified/marked to alert personnel of their presence. If tasked to provide
   mechanical rides in a ―kid zone,‖ ensure adequate fall zones are provided and that equipment
   has been properly inspected. Pre-mix soft drink dispensing systems that contain a
   pressurized carbon-dioxide (CO2) gas cylinder are prohibited. Post-mix systems (Bag ―N‖
   Box) with CO2 gas cylinders are authorized for use.
   9.4.4. Fire Department. The installation fire chief ensures proper type and location of
   firefighting equipment, emergency response vehicles and routes, fire extinguishers and fire
   safety requirements. Emergency vehicles will be pre-positioned at designated locations prior
   to flight operations and will be so located as not to be ―trapped‖ behind the crowd control
   lines. Vendor booths providing food services, and those provided with electrical power will
56                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


     be inspected. Those booths requiring fire extinguishers will be supplied by the vendor.
     Ensure all cooking fuel sources meet safety requirements, designated smoking areas are
     identified and that no smoking or open flames or sparks are allowed near any aircraft or fuel
     source per AFIs and AFOSH Standards. If pyrotechnic displays are to be employed by any
     performers, closely coordinate with the performer/contractor and ensure all applicable safety,
     transportation, storage, and employment requirements are met.
     9.4.5. Bioenvironmental Engineering. Ensure all health requirements are met and identify
     any ergonomics issues. All hazardous materials used for the open house are required to be
     identified and properly handled, including those used by civilian vendors. Adequacy and
     access to potable drinking water for the public and for open house workers must be
     considered. Water vulnerability assessment is covered in paragraph 3.1.11. Ensure
     adequate public access to toilets for the size of the estimated number of visitors to the open
     house. Determine work/rest cycles for open house personnel and heat index.
     9.4.6. Public Health. Ensure food is safely prepared and food service workers are qualified
     and trained according to Air Force and local requirements.
     9.4.7. Ground Operations Officer. Ensure static display aircraft comply with T.O. 00-
     80G-1, Make Safe Procedures for Public Static Display, AFI 11-209, Attachment 3, and the
     appropriate aircraft -2 series/equipment technical orders. The display/parking plan for
     aircraft and equipment and vendor areas will be identified. Ensure all command and local
     guidance on static displays is implemented. Safety of all operations and events is of utmost
     importance. If public has access to aircraft hangars, remove all equipment such as
     maintenance stands, aerospace ground equipment, and coordinate with base fire chief to
     ensure hangar fire suppression systems are made safe. Lock and tag out hangar door controls
     as necessary. Ensure open house planning addresses the need to provide shelter to attendees
     in the event of adverse weather (e.g., lightning within 5 miles), per AFOSH Standard 91-66,
     General Industrial Operations. Ensure safe plan for re-supply of vendor areas and safe
     movement of vehicles in the open house area. If golf carts are used, drivers will be properly
     trained according to local requirements. Maintenance stands used for public access to
     aircraft must be serviceable and properly secured. Limit the number of people allowed on
     stands to avoid exceeding maximum weight limits.
     9.4.8. Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Director. The EOC Director is the MSG
     Commander or other senior representative designated by the Installation Commander. The
     EOC Director provides oversight for the Installation Commander to support and control
     emergency response to incidents, implements procedures outlined in the comprehensive
     emergency management plan (CEMP), activates the EOC and required control centers at a
     predetermined time to support emergency operations during the open house. Ensures
     emergency support function (ESF) coordinators and EOC representatives are on-base, in
     uniform and ready to react and support any and all incidents, mishaps, or emergency
     responses. Dedicated emergency response providers and support teams should have
     distinguishing individual and vehicle markings to allow for movement to designated
     incidents, appropriate control centers, or supporting areas during emergencies. CE Readiness
     and Emergency Management Flight members will position and staff the mobile emergency
     operations center (MEOC) to conduct operations per the air show plan or CEMP.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                  57


  9.4.9. Medical. Adequate medical stations should be set up and manned as necessary to
  handle disaster response and worker and public illness and injuries. Necessary emergency
  medical transportation will be available as needed including ground and air transport. Report
  all injuries to the open house director and the safety staff.
  9.4.10. Vehicles Operations. Ensure adequate vehicles are assigned and bus routes are
  identified. Operators will be properly licensed and trained. Limit or prohibit vehicles in
  crowd areas and along pedestrian routes. Arrange for safe vehicle refueling or electrical
  recharging. Seat belts will be worn at all times. Personnel will not ride in the bed of trucks
  with the exception of tactical operations IAW DoDI 6055.4 . Air DoD Traffic Safety
  Program.. Only military, civilian employees, approved civilian contractors, and NAF
  employees will be allowed to operate low speed vehicles e.g., golf carts, during the open
  house.
  9.4.11. Fuels. Ensure proper fuel is available for open house aircraft. When outside fuels
  are brought on base to support open house aircraft, take steps to ensure fuels are not
  dispensed to the wrong aircraft or commingled. Ensure AVGAS bought meets quality
  requirements IAW T.O. 42B-1-1, Quality Control of Fuels and Lubricants. If an R-11 or
  drums are used as the storage/issue point, follow conversion/flushing guidance, sampling
  requirements for different type of receipts, and use limits are met IAW T.O. 42B-1-1.
  Fueling is not allowed in the static display area when the public is present (within 100 ft).
  Guidance in AFOSH Standard 91-38, Hydrocarbon Fuels-General, must be followed.
  Ensure routes for refueling vehicles are identified.
  9.4.12. Engineering. National Electric Code or host nation electrical requirements should
  be identified for required electrical power in the open house area and booths. Ensure
  electrical cables are approved for outdoors use and do not present a tripping hazard. All
  circuit breakers should be closed and secured to prevent unauthorized access.
  9.4.13. Weather. Atmospheric and environmental conditions must be addressed for safe air
  and ground operations as well as personnel safety. Take into consideration factors such as:
  severe weather, heat stress, lightning, and winds.
  9.4.14. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). EOD is responsible for rendering safe
  aircraft explosive hazards, military munitions and terrorist use of improvised explosive
  devices (IED). EOD requirements will be closely coordinated with air/ground operations
  officers and emergency response coordinators. Air Force standards must be met when
  employing support; however, EOD capability is comparable regardless of branch of service.
  EOD requirements must be incorporated into response planning and integration into the
  antiterrorism working group (ATWG) is recommended. Two major response areas to
  consider are aircraft mishaps and force protection requirements. The number of teams
  required will be based on force protection and risk assessments however two teams are
  recommended to minimize movement through crowds, and meet response requirements.
  Emergency response vehicles will be pre-positioned at designated locations prior to flight
  operations. Response teams and equipment will not be multi-tasked for demonstrations or
  static displays. If pyrotechnic displays are to be employed by any performers, closely
  coordinate with the performer/contractor and ensure all applicable safety requirements are
  met.
58                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


9.5. Flight Safety Responsibilities
     9.5.1. Much of the existing guidance addressing aerial demonstrations, flyovers, etc. is
     aimed at establishing a safe flying environment for the aircrews, the spectators, and the
     surrounding community. The air operations officer and air boss must be familiar with
     applicable publications, and ensure the planned open house activities conform to them. Most
     of these publications are listed in Table 9.1. The base flight safety office will closely
     coordinate with the air operations officer and air boss to help resolve any flight safety
     issues/challenges raised during open house planning/execution. Each flying day, the air
     operations officer, air boss, announcer, tower chief, wing chief of safety and fire chief will
     attend the crew briefing and review the accident/incident plan.
     9.5.2. The flight safety office will carefully review the local bird conditions approaching an
     open house. Coordinate with the bird aircraft strike hazard (BASH) team to step up bird
     harassment in and around the runway environment in the 4-5 days approaching the open
     house, and to closely monitor the bird condition during the open house.
     9.5.3. Recommended Precautionary Measures.
        9.5.3.1. AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
        Operations Table 7-1 requires a major accident exercise based around an air show
        scenario be planned and executed prior to the installation‘s open house. Work with the
        exercise evaluation team chief in the development of this scenario. This exercise should
        include off-base emergency response forces that will be participating in the open house.
        The inclusion of all response personnel from military and civilian agencies will provide a
        unity of effort in the event of an actual incident as outlined in the Department of
        Homeland Security, ―National Incident Management System (NIMS)‖. Preparedness
        requires a unified approach to emergency management and incident response activities.
        To achieve this, components of NIMS should be integrated within a jurisdiction‘s or
        organization‘s emergency management and incident response structure. Specifically,
        preparedness should be integrated into communications and information management,
        resource management, and command and management to form an effective system.
        Additionally, the unified-approach concept is at the core of the Command and
        Management component, as it is based on chain of command, unity of command, unity of
        effort, and when implemented, Unified Command.
        9.5.3.2. Identify the interim safety board (ISB) members and their planned operating
        location prior to the open house. They should be on call, preferably on base, during any
        scheduled aerial demonstrations or flyover to facilitate a quick response. ISB members
        should have distinguishing individual and vehicle badges to allow SF to authorize their
        movement to the designated assembly area following a mishap/emergency.
     9.5.4. Airfield Operations/Manager. Coordination is required with Airfield Operations
     Flight commander and airfield manager.
        9.5.4.1. Ensure all activities, structures, etc. conducted or located within the runway
        lateral clearances, clear zones, taxiway and apron criteria and accident potential zones are
        in compliance with airfield design criteria or applicable temporary waivers are approved
        by the installation commander. These zones may affect planned activities within 3,000‘
        of the runway centerline. Ensure coordination with the airfield manager for planned use
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   59


       of all land around and near the runways. Planned pyrotechnic displays are an example of
       one activity that may be affected by these zones.
       9.5.4.2. Coordinate a thorough airfield inspection after the open house and ensure all
       FOD, equipment, and temporary facilities are cleared from the airfield and it is in
       compliance with applicable directives covering normal airfield criteria/operations.
9.6. Weapons Safety Responsibilities.
   9.6.1. Commanders should perform a commander‘s risk assessment as identified in AFMAN
   91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, which includes the importance of documenting
   operational risk acceptance procedures as identified in AFI 90-901 for all open house
   operational hazards, including explosives safety.
   9.6.2. Coordinate the requirements of DoD 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives
   Safety Standards, and AFMAN 91-201, with command and base-level safety office for all
   open house events to ensure that weapons and explosives hazards are properly addressed to
   reduce the risk of injury or property damage to civilian and/or military resources. Contractor
   supported explosives operations are required to be approved in accordance with these
   regulations.
   9.6.3. Common areas of review during the commander‘s risk assessment include compliance
   with AFMAN 91-201 for the use of explosives associated with static and public displays,
   fireworks displays, aerial demonstrations, etc. Table 9.1 provides some references for these
   common areas of explosives concerns but should not be used in lieu of the reading of the
   proper regulations.
   9.6.4. EOD and weapons safety will coordinate on explosives used in any pyrotechnic or
   explosive demonstration. If a civilian company is used for the demonstration, EOD teams
   will familiarize themselves with the explosives used by the demonstration team the day the
   explosives arrive on the installation. In the event of an accident/incident, the contractor is
   responsible for commercial explosives they provided and must make every possible effort to
   remedy the situation. If the contractor cannot return the area to a safe condition, the EOD
   team will have to resolve or render safe the commercial explosives which are not military
   specification nor common to military explosives. Report property damage and Government
   response costs to Contracting and Legal so that they may assess contractor responsibility for
   the damage or costs.
9.7. Pyrotechnical Displays During Open Houses. If pyrotechnic displays are used by any of
the demonstrations scheduled for the open house, the overriding emphasis has to remain on the
safety of all in attendance and maintain a minimum separation distance of 1,250 ft from the
pyrotechnic display and the crowd line, as well as those who use the airfield after the event is
over. Compliance with AFMAN 91-201 and NFPA standards is required. Pyrotechnical
displays used to support military aerial demonstrations must be supervised by Air Force
personnel.
   9.7.1. Considerations. There are numerous safety considerations that must be considered in
   the planning, employment, and execution of a pyrotechnic demonstration. The following is
   not an all-encompassing list of potential risks, but merely serves to highlight some areas for
   increased awareness and closer scrutiny:
60                                                              AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


        9.7.1.1. Grass fires (pre, during, and post release).
        9.7.1.2. Unplanned/premature detonation during transportation, set-up, operation, and
        teardown.
        9.7.1.3. Unauthorized personnel straying into the pyrotechnic area.
        9.7.1.4. Shrapnel from detonator pieces, nearby rocks, sticks, wooden stakes etc. causing
        injury/damage to spectators, aircraft, or staff.
        9.7.1.5. Air blast/pressure wave damage to structures, aircraft, or personnel.
        9.7.1.6. FOD to runways/taxiways following the demonstration.
        9.7.1.7. Exceeding authorized capacity of available storage facilities.
     9.7.2. Risk. The desire for a crowd-pleasing show must not lead to the acceptance of undue
     risk. Ensure the use of pyrotechnics, both in number and size of detonations, is limited to the
     minimum required to achieve the desired affect and that the display is adequately displaced
     from the crowd in accordance with AFMAN 91-201. The open house safety staff must be
     aware of the risks inherent to a pyrotechnic demonstration and ensure that appropriate risk
     management measures are discussed with/implemented by the demonstrator/contractor.
     Primers that addresses these issues in more detail are AFMAN 91-201 and Pyrotechnics and
     Special Effects for Air Shows, a publication of the ICAS.
     9.7.3. Grass Fire Hazard Mitigation vs. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
     Mitigation. There is significant potential for an unplanned grass fire when pyrotechnics are
     used in conjunction with open house demonstrations. Several methods of mitigation are
     discussed below. Ultimately there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the pyrotechnic display
     fire hazard, and all effects (both immediate and delayed) must be considered in selecting the
     appropriate mitigation option(s). Whatever method(s) are used to mitigate the fire hazard,
     have fire department personnel present during setup to allow for familiarization and standing
     by at a safe distance near any pyrotechnic demonstration to quickly respond to any resulting
     fire.
        9.7.3.1. Mowing. The standard height for grass on airfields is 7-14 inches. The purpose
        of this standard is to minimize the threat to aircraft from birds and other wildlife. The
        greatest fire threat during a pyrotechnic expenditure is from any dried thatch left over
        from previous mowing. Plan the mowing schedule for the pyrotechnics area to provide a
        well-maintained length and to limit the accumulation of dried thatch prior to the open
        house. Local vegetation and environmental conditions will dictate the best mowing
        schedule. In every case, any dried thatch should be removed from the pyrotechnic area(s)
        prior to the open house.
        9.7.3.2. Pre-Burning, Pre-Soaking, and BASH Considerations. Many purveyors of
        pyrotechnic displays advocate pre-burning the area to prevent grass fires in the aftermath
        of the display; however, this decision cannot be made in a void. Any portion of the
        airfield that is burned, either in preparation for, or following the expenditure of the
        pyrotechnics will serve to attract birds and negatively affect the airfield‘s BASH efforts.
        The larger the burned area, the greater the negative effect.
            9.7.3.2.1. From a BASH perspective, pre-soaking would be preferable to pre-
            burning, provided it is not over-done resulting in standing water, as this would also
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    61


          attract birds. Field conditions, access in/around the pyrotechnic area, as well as
          contractor access requirements prior to the pyrotechnic expenditure may render this
          option impractical. Early planning and coordination with affected parties is key.
          9.7.3.2.2. Pre-burning the pyrotechnic area is a viable option in many cases, but
          should only be pursued after careful consideration. All pre-burning will adversely
          affect the BASH threat at the airfield. The bird hazard greatly increases for at least 2
          weeks following a burn. Plan the burn so that the increased BASH threat will
          diminish prior to the open house. Timing of prescribed burns is critical to the
          vegetative cover. Burning during dry seasons can lead to long term damage, thereby
          increasing bird hazards for several successive years. Burning too early in the year
          when the grass has just gone dormant will leave bare and exposed soil for extended
          periods of time. Dormancy can begin as early as late summer in some locations. All
          locations, vegetation, and climates vary, so be sure to consider all implications before
          implementing a pre-burn plan. Coordinate with local agricultural agencies and the
          base civil engineering office on the timing and effective methods for a controlled
          burn. Any decision to burn must be approved by the base fire chief and be consistent
          with applicable state or local government open burn restriction in effect at the time
          and state open burn laws. Additionally, local laws/regulations may require the
          procurement of a burn permit.
          9.7.3.2.3. If pre-burning is to be pursued, work with the contractor/demonstrator to
          limit the affected area to the smallest area practical. Being conservative in the size,
          intensity, and footprint of the pyrotechnic display can limit the size of the affected
          area and the intensity of the resultant bird attraction.

                                            Chapter 10

                                     FORCE PROTECTION

10.1. Overview. Installation commanders use the contents of this chapter as a guide for
planning force protection prior to and during events. The safety of Air Force personnel and the
protection of Air Force aircraft and other resources is paramount. Force protection measures
should always be taken into consideration, whether participating in flyovers, aerial
demonstrations, aerial reviews, or conducting static displays. It is imperative all Air Force
members at all levels consider the situation and potential threat to Air Force personnel, aircraft,
and resources when deciding to participate in or host any military or civilian event. Refer to
AFMAN 31-201, Volume 3, Flight Operations, AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
Program (FOUO), AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism and current installation plans (AT, ISP, CEMP &
MCRP) for force protection considerations prior to planning a base open house.
10.2. Force Protection Planning. The plan should follow current Air Force planning guidance
and have all necessary annexes. Proper planning gives the installation commander a true picture
of equipment and personnel requirements to offset vulnerabilities. Use MAJCOM staffs and any
other available Air Force assets as necessary to assist in planning. As a minimum, the plan
should be for official use only (FOUO) or classified if appropriate. If multiple day events are
held, take measures to ensure security plans are not compromised and adequate resources are
available to support the event.
10.3. Assessments. The installation Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) will lead a targeted
vulnerability assessment team prior to an open house. Searches for vulnerabilities must be
conducted inside and outside the installation. Use all assets available to conduct assessments on
and off base to identify vulnerabilities. Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public Health should
be consulted to conduct vulnerabilities of water and food sources respectively. Planners should
refer to vulnerabilities already identified in the Core Vulnerability Assessment Management
Program (CVAMP) as the baseline for conducting this assessment. In addition to the CVAMP,
planners must ensure they continue to evaluate current threat information.
     10.3.1. Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI). Use local AFOSI resources to
     address and obtain counter-surveillance and counter intelligence operations and information
     as necessary. In addition, have OSI work with local state and Federal agencies to ensure
     counter intelligence and threat information is presented to the ATWG as an updated threat
     assessment (TA). Also, AFOSI may work with civil law enforcement agencies to provide
     support for events.
     10.3.2. Civil Authorities. Use of civil authorities will give the installation a fresh view.
     The more vantage points used, the better the installation can identify vulnerabilities. Use all
     assets available to assess on and off-installation topography (helicopter views or assessments
     if possible). Consider use of off-base patrols in conjunction with civil authorities to identify
     and mitigate vulnerabilities and cover the surface-to-air missile footprint. Ensure Legal is
     involved in jurisdictional issues and Posse Comitatus Act concerns. If an installation has a
     waterway as a boundary, consider establishing an exclusionary zone. Coordinate
     exclusionary zones with the United States Coast Guard or local marine authorities as
     necessary.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                         65


10.4. Integrated Base Defense (IBD). IBD doctrine and methodology, when properly applied,
allows installation commanders and Security Forces to harness the entire base population and
technology to see first, understand first, and act first. Use the following IBD mission effect areas
during the planning process.
   10.4.1. Operations Security. Operations security maximizes options. Obviously publicity
   (open/close times, aircraft on display, etc.) is necessary, but don‘t give the operational plan to
   the public. Only share the plan with personnel who have a need to know and provide only
   the amount of information necessary for each organization to perform its particular function.
   10.4.2. Deter. Make consequences clear and discourage potential enemies. PA should
   advertise certain security measures such as search stations for hand carried items and
   restrictions of large bags, coolers, etc. to facilitate a smoother transition onto the installation.
   Ensure all personnel working the event are in uniform; encourage military personnel
   attending the event to wear a uniform. Note: The wear of uniforms for some Security
   Forces personnel may detract from their assigned protection mission. The installation‘s
   Defense Force Commander (DFC) may locally determine what Security Forces personnel
   will be in civilian attire.
   10.4.3. Anticipate. Anticipate what an adversary may do to disrupt operations or create
   mass casualties. Plans for disruptions and mass casualties should be practiced and rehearsed.
   ATOs will assign specific random antiterrorism measures to all units 24 hours prior to open
   house/air show to increase situational awareness and identify any shortfalls.
   10.4.4. Deny. Consider limiting or prohibiting large hand carried items such as coolers,
   backpacks, handbags to reduce the chance of introduction of unauthorized weapons,
   explosives, etc. Deny access to ―off-limits‖ portions of the installation using barriers and
   effective traffic management. Enforce routing and parking of vehicles an adequate distance
   from critical installation resources and the event site (where spectators are massed) to
   provide adequate standoff distance in the event of the use of a vehicle borne improvised
   explosive device. This action is crucial to limiting mass casualties at the event site.
   10.4.5. Detect. See all potential threats first. Purses, diaper bags, etc., will need to be
   brought into the event site area, so inspection stations at event areas are encouraged in order
   to detect any unauthorized items. If magnetometers are available, use them at the inspection
   stations. Non-government vehicles that will be driven or parked in close proximity to public
   access area, to include delivery vehicles, must be inspected before entry. Consider walking
   explosive detection dogs through parking lots. Ensure all critical facilities are manned with
   unit personnel in order to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity.
   10.4.6. Delay. Layer security to prevent the use of space as a means of adversary attack.
   Distributing forces throughout the base increases detection, response, and continuity of
   forces needed to neutralize potential threats. Consider the use of barriers or obstacles to
   channel crowds and provide delaying capabilities.
   10.4.7. Assess. Analyze the effect of layered defenses and the emergency response plans.
   This leverages intelligence and enables defending forces to influence an adversary‘s
   decision-making and course of action cycles.
   10.4.8. Deploy. Pre-positioning of disaster response capabilities gives the installation
   instant response. Maintain the capability to deploy with advantage to any incident. Ensure
66                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


     the emergency operation center and emergency response forces are on base and able to
     deploy to any situation. Installations with emergency services teams (ESTs) and close
     precision engagement (CPE) teams should use these capabilities for high-risk incident
     responses. If these teams are not available, coordinate with local authorities to use their
     special weapons and tactics (SWAT) teams under existing MOAs. Consider posting Security
     Forces and CPE teams on rooftops and other key observation points as observers. ESTs
     should be kept in reserve to rapidly respond to a hostile incident. These teams should be
     staged close enough to the event site to decrease hostile contact closure rates when
     employment becomes necessary.
     10.4.9. Neutralize. Posted Security Forces, CPE, EST, and/or SWAT teams (if formally
     trained and certified) should be in place and ready to neutralize any threat. These specialized
     teams should be able to render the enemy ineffective if they should decide to strike during
     the event. These forces should be capable of neutralizing hostile threats with lethal and
     nonlethal force, acting on criminal activities, and capable of controlling crowds.
     10.4.10. Mitigate. Have evacuation plans and notifications in place to allow spectators an
     escape route for any emergency. Have emergency response (police, fire and medical)
     capabilities available for mass casualty response if necessary. Determine wind direction
     before the event in order to mitigate loss of life in the case that a chemical, biological,
     radiological, nuclear or high yield energy (CBRNE) attack or accident occurs. This
     minimizes the effect of adversary successes and takes the advantage away from the enemy.
10.5. Antiterrorism Working Group (ATWG). The ATWG is a multi-discipline group
designed to work long-term FP related problems and solutions and make timely
recommendations to the installation commander on security matters. It‘s the installation
commander‘s tool to ensure maintenance of a safe and secure environment. Further, the ATWG
should meet regularly and as close as possible to the start of an event to provide information
and/or make recommendations to the installation commander concerning possible threats,
adversary actions, and actions for IBD. In addition, the ATWG is a key instrument in security
policy development prior to and during events. NOTE: Ensure the air boss is brought into
planning with the ATWG and provides names of open house participants for proper security
screening.
     10.5.1. Threat Working Group (TWG). Continuous updates from AFOSI, local, state, and
     Federal law enforcement agencies are necessary for a successful event. The TWG receives
     these updates and can provide the ATWG and installation commander with all intelligence
     data relevant to the installation and static display aircraft.
     10.5.2. AFOSI. AFOSI should work closely with all local, state, and Federal agencies to
     ensure a current TA is presented to the TWG. This action gives the installation continuous
     intelligence updates on the threat.
10.6. Manpower for Force Protection Requirements. There must be enough manpower
available to ensure a safe and secure environment during the event. Installation commanders
should consider the event day(s) a normal workday for all military personnel. All base personnel
are part of the integrated base security team and used as part of the force protection capability.
Installation commanders should consider activating Security Forces augmentation duty program
personnel to provide an additional armed presence and enhance response capabilities. The DFC
must ensure they know what to look for and what the current threat picture is for the installation.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    67


They should be briefed in mass on what to look for and how to report suspicious personnel and
activities. Also, brief the current local and national threat as appropriate.
   10.6.1. Active Duty Military and Civilian Employees. All active duty military personnel
   and base civilian employees should be considered part of the security and safety team. These
   personnel should be directed to work in accordance with the installation commander‘s
   directives. Enough active duty military personnel should be on duty to meet all manpower
   and contingency requirements. Civilians employees will be used at the installation
   commander‘s discretion and only after ensuring they are properly trained for proposed duties.
   Ensure enough personnel are available and on-duty to conduct post and meal relief for the
   duration of the event.
   10.6.2. Other Manning Sources. Bring personnel assets and specialized support teams
   (EOD, military working dog [MWD], etc.) in TDY if necessary. Consider manning
   assistance from sister services, tenant organizations, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve,
   Civil Air Patrol, and civilian police, fire and medical personnel. For those installations
   providing aircraft for static display, coordinate with the respective home station Security
   Forces unit to provide personnel for aircraft security, if possible.
10.7. Installation Entry and Circulation Control Procedures. During events, consider not
opening the entire installation by creating sterile corridors and ingress/egress points. Maintain
control of visitors and only allow them access to the areas of the installation intended for the
event. Consider using ink stamps or colored wristbands to readily identify spectators and
vendors who have been screened. Do not allow visitors to disrupt normal day-to-day functions.
Channel visitors to secure areas for the event. This will require base personnel at every possible
roadway or trail to ensure event visitors stay within the channel area and do not deviate from the
assigned travel routes. Chase vehicles may be required at key locations throughout the
installation. Installation PA must advertise all information about parking and entrance
requirements. Note: Be prepared for visitors and guests who show up early so as not to back-up
installation gates and roadways or allow an unauthorized vehicle access.
   10.7.1. Parking.
       10.7.1.1. Spectator Parking. Base personnel should direct parking. Vehicles should be
       channeled into the parking area(s) and parked sequentially. This will ensure all spaces
       are used and allow for more vehicle parking capacity. Additionally, handicapped parking
       capabilities and transportation for handicapped individuals from parking areas to the
       event site must be considered. Consider using off-base parking areas or an isolated area
       away from the event site for visitors. Off-base or isolated parking minimizes installation
       exposure to possible explosive devices. If off-base parking is available, use buses to
       transport visitors from the parking area(s) to the event site. Military personnel should be
       on each bus as a host and to conduct security checks prior to the visitors boarding the
       buses. These hosts act as a first line of defense for spotting suspicious persons and can
       sound the alarm if necessary. Ensure weapons (guns, knives, etc.) and (if prohibited),
       coolers, large handbags, backpacks, etc., are not taken to the event site. If magnetometers
       are available, use them to screen visitors prior to allowing them on the buses. Allow
       spectators to place prohibited items not allowed at the event site in their vehicles. Buses
       should run from the parking area to the event site continuously during the entire event for
68                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


        the convenience of visitors. If possible, select a single gate on the installation for buses
        transporting visitors to and from the event.
        10.7.1.2. Base Personnel Parking. Parking areas on base should be available for
        military and civilian base personnel. This precludes them having to drive off base for
        mass transit back onto the installation. Military and civilian base personnel are required
        to follow the same guidelines as visitors and are not allowed to take prohibited items into
        the event site.
        10.7.1.3. Performer Parking. Arrangements will be made that allow performers
        unobstructed access to the show site. Each performer will be given a specific vehicle pass
        and unique identification that will enable access to a designated performer parking area
        as well as their aircraft.
        10.7.1.4. Commercial Sponsor Parking. Authorized MWR commercial sponsors will
        require access to the installation and event site to set up their display on the ramp.
        Sponsors will be given a specific vehicle pass and unique identification that will enable
        access to a designated parking area. See paragraph 10.7.4 for vendor security screening
        requirements.
     10.7.2. Crowd Control. AFOSI is a non-uniformed law enforcement agency that could be
     used to monitor the spectators, and report suspicious personnel or activities to Security
     Forces personnel. In addition, the DFC can place Security Forces investigators or other
     trained Security Forces in civilian attire to complement and augment this mission. Although
     not normally a problem at such events, riot control requirements should be considered. Post
     observers to monitor the crowd and key points. Observers should utilize binoculars, cameras
     and recorders to detect and report suspicious personnel and activities to the Base Defense
     Operations Center (BDOC) using available communication systems. Consider establishing
     apprehension teams and detainment areas if apprehensions become necessary. Ensure
     personnel performing these duties are properly equipped and available to respond when
     necessary.
        10.7.2.1. In conjunction with JA, Security Forces should plan for the disposition of
        dissidents or protestors. Installation officials must anticipate that demonstrations,
        dissident activities, political speeches, and other unauthorized or disruptive behavior may
        occur during the open house. Security Forces should refer to AFMAN 31-201, Vol 6,
        Civil Disturbance, for further instructions. Both the legal coordinator and Security
        Forces coordinator should develop an operations plan to respond to and control persons
        who seek to disrupt the event, damage government property, or harm event participants.
        Planning will involve coordination with local law enforcement personnel, as well as with
        the appropriate United States Attorney and district attorney‘s office, or foreign equivalent
        if overseas. - This means political and dissident activities, rallies, etc. not approved by
        the installation commander, or other activities involving demonstrations or public
        activism, are not permitted on the installation during an open house.
        10.7.2.2. Security Forces should escort offenders to a pre-established holding area or
        turn them over to civil authorities and bar offenders from the installation. As a minimum,
        establish a process with local law enforcement agencies to rapidly process offenders in
        accordance with jurisdiction agreements.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                      69


   10.7.3. Traffic Control. Traffic control sentries may be required at key intersections and
   roadways leading into areas where visitors are not allowed access. Ensure this is planned for
   prior to the event and that sentries are posted accordingly. Consider utilizing airmen other
   than Security Forces for this duty to allow for more effective use of Security Forces
   manpower.
   10.7.4. Vendor Access. Authorized vendors (e.g., food concessionaires) will require access
   to the installation and event site to set up displays, and each vendor must be identified prior
   to allowing entry. Ensure procedures are established for vendor screening, thus expediting
   entry to the installation and event site. Vendor arrival times should be coordinated to ensure
   security personnel are available to conduct security checks and route vendor and commercial
   trucks to one central location for inspections.
10.8. Aircraft Security. As soon as the number and type of aircraft that will be on static
display is determined, identify security requirements for the aircraft attending. NOTE: Planners
should consolidate like protection level aircraft in one large restricted area until configured for
static display just prior to the event. Some aircraft will require armed Security Forces and
temporary restricted areas. Establish temporary restricted areas as required by the Protection
Level designation of the aircraft IAW AFI 31-101. .Aircraft commanders are responsible for
ensuring uniformed aircrew members are present at the aircraft to answer questions and assist
with security during the event.
10.9. Dignitary Support. All such events will have dignitaries present and procedures for their
protection must be established. Designate a separate area away from other spectators for
dignitaries to view the event. Use an entry control point to restrict access to the dignitary
viewing area in order to detect unauthorized personnel. Have escorts, evacuation plans, travel
routes, and notification procedures in place to allow an escape route during emergencies. A safe-
haven should be established for use in case evacuation becomes necessary. Ensure the security
and safety of dignitaries while traversing the installation. Note: Protection of High Risk
Personnel (HRP) is the responsibility of AFOSI.
10.10. Emergency Response Exercises. All emergency response actions will be planned and
rehearsed prior to the event IAW CEMP 10-2. The rehearsal should be conducted during a mass
casualty tabletop or field exercise. Consider conducting this exercise in conjunction with local
authorities. The exercise can be combined with the major accident exercise required in AFI 10-
2501, Table 7-1.
10.11. Safety Emergency Response. The Emergency Operation Center, CE Readiness and
Management, EOD, Security Forces, medical, and fire department personnel should be on base
and have a pre-determined rally point to respond to any emergency during the event.
10.12. Communications. Communications in time of emergency are essential. Proper
communications can ensure a potential threat is neutralized prior to the threat affecting the event.
Communications should be available and emergency response personnel should be linked to
ensure proper command and control. Security Forces, AFOSI, local civil authorities, and
emergency response elements should be able to talk to each other directly or through a combined
command communications center. Communication systems should include all on- and off-base
agencies supporting the event. If common radio channels are not available, a communications
center will be required so all response efforts can be coordinated. Also, consider the use of cell
phones if available. Unsecured radio and cell phone/wireless transmissions can be easily

monitored and exploited; therefore encrypting security channels to mitigate exploitation of
communications should be considered. If public phones are not available, consider establishing
off-base telephone access at informational and assistance kiosks or through other information
and assistance providers.
10.13. Recommended Equipment Items. Following is a list of equipment items that can be
used to enhance an installation‘s ability to ensure force protection during events. Installations
should consider purchasing/renting/leasing these items to prevent weapons from being
introduced into the event site.
     10.13.1. Light Weight Walk-Through Magnetometers. There are versions of walk-
     through magnetometers that can be used at screening locations. They operate on 115 volts
     alternating current (VAC) and cost approximately $5K per unit.
     10.13.2. Portable X-Ray Screener. These come in lightweight tabletop configurations and
     can be used for checking hand carried items. They operate on 115VAC and cost
     approximately $15K per unit.
     10.13.3. Hand-Held Metal Detectors. Hand-held metal detectors can be used at screening
     locations for checking personnel entering the event site.10.13.4. ION Scanners. Portable
     ION scanners operate on batteries. They may be used to check purses, diaper bags, etc. for
     explosive material prior to allowing entry to the event site.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                   71


                                          Chapter 11

                                PUBLIC AFFAIRS SUPPORT

11.1. Introduction. The Air Force conducts comprehensive, active public affairs programs at
all levels of command to provide Airmen, the public, Congress and the media information that
contributes to awareness and understanding of the Air Force mission. Community relations
programs like open houses are designed to enhance the Air Force‘s reputation as a good neighbor
as well as highlight the attributes of a respected professional organization charged with
protecting U.S. national security.
11.2. Responsibilities. PA support to the open house program involves providing advice and
guidance to the open house director and installation commander, ensuring the internal audience
is kept well informed of the event, working with local media to maximize exposure of the event,
and ensuring the base continues to be a good neighbor to the local community. PA should also
be prepared to offer guidance and respond quickly in the event of an accident or other
emergency. AFI 35-101, Chapter 7, Crisis Communication, has specific guidance for emergency
situations. The PA checklist in Attachment 2 provides additional guidance on public affairs
activities at an open house.
11.3. Community Relations. Although an open house is considered a community relations
event, there are several specific areas of concern that should be addressed during the planning
process. These include: providing open house exhibits, coordinator and commercial points of
contacts with community groups, industry representatives, and other MAJCOMs for potential
ground displays; in coordination with protocol, ensuring key community leaders are invited to
DV receptions and the event DV viewing area; developing a plan to reach out to community
groups and businesses to aid in publicity of the event; and scheduling performers for key
recruiting and goodwill visits to local schools and hospitals.
   11.3.1. Although protocol usually is the lead agency in planning key DV receptions and
   arrangements for the commander‘s viewing area during the show, it is important to ensure
   PA remains actively engaged. At many locations, the local Chamber of Commerce military
   affairs committee will be interested in sponsoring a reception for key event performers and
   other invited guests. When this happens, PA will coordinate military support and
   participation in the DV event.
   11.3.2. Many open house plans lend themselves to having a practice show the day before the
   base is open to the general public. This show allows the base to invite members of the
   general public who have special needs and may not be able to attend the show in a large
   crowd. Open house staffs should consider extending invitations to special needs schools,
   senior citizen homes. Having fewer people on the flightline will allow these guests to be
   dropped off within a short distance of the seating area. When inviting people with special
   needs, be sure to provide handicapped accessible seating that is in close proximity to
   bathroom facilities, a covered area to escape the heat, and access to water. Groups should be
   encouraged to bring their own snacks. Consider opening a limited number of concession
   booths for the group‘s convenience.
11.4. Internal Information. The base residents and work force must be kept informed of open
house activities and plans. Use all available information avenues to include, but not limited to,
72                                                            AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010


the base newspaper, marquees, commander‘s access channel, e-mail and social media to ensure
personnel are kept aware of road closures and security concerns, as well as the particulars of the
event.
11.5. Inserts and Programs. PA coordinators must review the base newspaper contract and/or
MOA, if applicable prior to the open house to determine if the publisher has a contract to
produce an event insert prior to the event. If the publisher has a contract for the insert, it is
unlikely the base will be able to produce an independent souvenir program. However, if the
publisher does not have the insert in the contract (preferred), programs may be published in-
house, or contracted to an independent printer. Services may choose to develop a souvenir
program to be sold that contains elements of the open house. See paragraphs 5.4 and 6.8.1.
11.6. External Outreach. The open house gives the Air Force an opportunity to make a
favorable impression on the thousands of people who attend. Engaging the local media,
however, provides an opportunity to reach many thousands, or even millions more, who learn
about the Air Force from the newspapers, magazines, internet, radio and television. PA should
devise a marketing strategy and publicize the event through all available media. Publicity
opportunities can also include interaction with the local Chamber of Commerce, tourism board,
and industry forums in the region.
     11.6.1. PA professionals should use all means available to get the best exposure possible and
     to achieve the widest publicity.
     11.6.2. An important aspect of media relations is taking care of the media while they are on
     base. While the open house is ―open‖ to all, recommend providing the media with access
     badges; arranging for a centrally located media center with amenities; providing media
     risers/lifts; arranging special parking and/or providing options for loading/unloading of
     equipment; and providing transportation around the flightline or base to facilitate interviews
     and stories. Ensure a suitable number of PA representatives are available to work with the
     media, facilitate interviews, and answer questions.
     11.6.3. Generally, credentials for media are only required if the media is being provided
     special access. PA personnel should give great care to ensure that only bona fide media
     representatives, freelance writers, photographers and videographers are credentialed. If the
     media badges allow access to areas closed to the general public, a PA representative must
     remain with the media at all times when they are in a restricted/closed area. Coordinate
     media badge procedures and access with Security Forces prior to the event.
11.7. Demonstration Team Requests. Demonstrations by the military jet teams are flown only
over airports, large bodies of water, or unpopulated areas. Aerial demonstrations for open
houses are requested with a completed DD Form 2535 from the open house director to their
MAJCOM/PA. Requests for performances of the USAF Thunderbirds must be entered online at
www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil and received by SAF/PAY no later than 1 August to be considered
for the following calendar year‘s schedule. USAF Thunderbird scheduling gives priority
consideration to two day airshows versus one day shows.
     11.7.1. Non-Air Force Requests. Requests for the Navy‘s Blue Angels and the Army‘s
     Golden Knights are submitted to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army PA offices indicated on page
     4 of DD Form 2535. Requests for the Canadian Forces‘ Snowbirds are submitted to the
     431st Air Demonstration Squadron, PO Box 5000, Moose Jaw, SK S6H 7Z8. For more

   information and copy of             the    request    form,   visit   the    team‘s    website
   http://www.snowbirds.dnd.ca.
   11.7.2. Cancellations. A unit canceling a performance by the Thunderbirds at its base must
   immediately send a message listing the date the performance was scheduled, place, reason
   for cancellation, and person canceling performance (with phone number and affiliation, if
   possible, for civilian site). The cancellation notice should be routed through PA channels to
   the appropriate headquarters with the following as information addressees: SAF/PAY,
   AF/A3O, and ACC/PA/A3.
11.8. Recruiting Involvement. Personnel from the local recruiting squadron should be present
at the open house to capitalize on the gathering of so many people with positive attitudes towards
the military. Recruiting normally has interesting displays, simulators, etc., to inform the public
about Air Force life. Contact information for recruiting organizations is in Attachment 5.

Terms
NOTE—: To avoid changing traditional terminology used by the Air Force to discuss aviation
support, the Air Force term aerial event as used in this Instruction is synonymous with the DoD
term aerial demonstration and the Air Force term aerial demonstration is synonymous with the
DoD term aerial activity.
Aerial Demonstration—Aerial Demonstration is a generic phrase that includes (except for static
display, aerial review and flyover) virtually every type of aerial participation in military or public
events: aerobatics, assault landing/takeoffs, aircraft weapons or tactics demonstrations, USAF
vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration teams, airdrop demonstrations of personnel
or equipment, in flight refueling demonstrations, or aircraft capabilities demonstrations, AFPT
performances, CSAR demonstrations and helicopter flight demonstrations consisting of steep
approach, quick—stop landing, hovering, fire suppression, and personnel AIE. Aerial
demonstration is synonymous with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft demonstration, aircraft
capabilities demonstration, and aircraft CAPEX.
Aerial Demonstration Team—An officially designated DoD demonstration team such as the
USAF Thunderbirds, US Navy Blue Angels, and US Army Golden Knights, etc. This term can
be applied to USAF vintage aircraft (ACC heritage flight program and AETC T-6A Texan II
aerial demonstration team) and MAJCOM single-ship demonstration teams.
Aerial Event—Aerial event, synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Any aerial activity, including static displays and
Air Force parachute team demonstrations, by Air Force aircraft or personnel taking part in
military events, public events, or community relations programs.
Aerial Performance—A generic phrase including virtually every type of aerial participation in
military or civilian events: Flyover, aerial review, aerial demonstration and aircraft capabilities
demonstration.
Aerial Review—A subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four aircraft, or of
multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service or nation,
regardless of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements. An aerial review may include
civilian aircraft. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve precision
maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be individual aircraft,
formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations. A single element flyover
involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS of the same type from the same military service
is not considered an aerial review.
Aerobatic Box—The area over which the aerial demonstrations are approved to be performed. It
is normally centered on the show center, and is also known as the aerobatic maneuvering area.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                    83

illustrating a takeoff technique used for departing short runways employing maximum takeoff
power and climb rate for the aircraft. Also referred to as ―Maximum Performance Takeoff‖ or
―Maximum Effort Takeoff.‖
Aviation Support—Aviation support, synonymous with aerial event, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of
aerial activities.
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Normally associated with
aircraft demonstrating unique characteristics of a weapon system or group of weapon systems. A
capabilities demonstration is one that shows the aircraft conducting maneuvers usually
associated with its employment and is common to the airframe being shown.
Civilian Aerial Demonstration (or Act)—-An aerial demonstration or act not flown to
demonstrate military capability or history, but with the purpose of showcasing piloting skill or
primarily to entertain the spectators.
Commercial Sponsorship—The outside partial underwriting of an MWR event (as an element
of Air Force Services) by a consumer product/service company using money, goods and/or
services to obtain limited recognition and advertising benefits.

                                 PLANNING CHECKLISTS

The following checklists are intended to support the overall planning of the event, however, they
may not include every action to be considered by the open house staff.

Table A2.1. General Planning
Consideration                                                           OPR        Complete
Long-term planning.
Determine a date(s) for the event. Consider events being held in the
local community, historical significance, and availability of guests.
Consider backup dates for demonstration team availability.
Determine whether the event is one day or multiple days.
Determine start and end times for the event. Most events start in
late morning and finish mid-to-late afternoon.
Determine practice requirements. Recommend practice day on/near
same timeline as the event day(s) to ensure a similar environment
(daylight, sun position, circadian rhythm, etc) as possible.
Determine exhibit locations. Can exhibits be located, both from on
base and from the community?
Determine off-limits/restricted areas.
Determine whether the facility has the capacity for the expected
crowd.
Clear the event with Numbered AF, MAJCOM, and HQ USAF as
required.
Appoint staff and committees to handle open house functions.
Ensure committee assignments are explicit and inclusive.
Plan and execute table-top exercise.
Ensure recruiters have been brought into the planning.
Obtain good airfield or site layout diagram.
Submit DD Form 2535 to MAJCOM PA for submission to SAF/PA
(SAF/PA requires the DD Form 2535 by 1 Aug of each year for
consideration in the Air Force Aerial Demonstration Squadron
scheduling for the following year).
Event Planning
Coordinate with airfield management and have regular meetings to
keep them abreast of developments and requirements.
Arrange for construction and electrical permit if needed.
Arrange for necessary barricades, snow fencing, ropes, stanchions
and other crowd-control devices to be purchased, leased or
borrowed, delivered and installed in a timely manner.
Work with appropriate chairmen to determine locations of all static
displays and provide for necessary security and crowd control.
Work with concession chairman to establish a plan for the location
of concession booths. Make sure required electrical power is

Consideration                                                           OPR   Complete
available where and when needed.
Military aircraft, tanks, and other weapons displays often have
unusual weight requirements. Coordinate with airfield management
to use appropriate ramps and access roads.
Set up and clearly mark parking areas and traffic routes on site.
Arrange for rental of portable lavatories. Rental contract must
include provisions to pump and re-supply with chemicals and toilet
paper for each day of use.
Drinking water is essential. If drinking water is not readily available
on site, implement a solution for providing drinking water that is
acceptable to the local health department to pipe or transport
sufficient quantities of water to the open house site. If possible,
arrange for stand-by sprinklers for spectator cool-down in the event
of extremely hot weather.
Arrange for conveniently located trashcans for spectators‘ use.
Ample numbers will greatly lessen post-show clean up. Prompt and
thorough cleaning of the site will leave a good impression on the
public
Arrange for emptying of trash barrels throughout the day and for
trash removal from the site at the end of each day of use.
Create facilities diagram showing staging sites of all emergency
vehicles and locations of first aid stations/medical units, information
center, lost & found, food/beverage/souvenir stands, lavatory
facilities, display areas and crowd lines. Publish as a separate
handout to arriving spectators and/or as an insert or published page
in the program. Each volunteer should have a copy and copies
should be posted in all spectator service areas.
Coordinate with the installation traffic engineer to make sure traffic
cones, lane dividers, and entrance locations are properly set up.
Provide personnel to meet and direct early-arriving volunteers,
concessionaires, static display crews and exhibitors; and provide
each arrival with a diagram that shows the location of their assigned
site or reporting station.
Coordinate with Security Forces to ensure areas that are off limits to
spectators are properly marked and secured. Actual marking and
security of off limits areas is an owner/user responsibility.
Arrange for a sound system that meets all requirements for the
event . Coordinate power requirements, location of speakers and
cable runs. Make sure the sound system covers all spectator areas
including DV areas.
Provide an announcing platform that allows good visibility for the
open house announcer and assistants.
Plan entrance and exits for emergency vehicles and emergency
aircraft.
Plan alternate entrances and exits for emergency vehicles in the

event primary routes are blocked.
Plan spectator exit in case of an emergency
Plan a route for performing aircraft to get from overnight hangars to
the flight line or staging area.
Locate the commander‘s hospitality tent on the flight line, but leave
room for the public to enjoy clear viewing areas.
Designate a central headquarters for resolving problems. Staff with
a decision maker who has the authority to take action.
Set aside specific areas for ground demonstrations (K-9 skills, etc.)
and sponsor displays.
Work with Legal and Security Forces to establish procedures for
responding to protestors, vandals, and others who may need to be
apprehended.
Coordinate with the wing antiterrorism office to ensure all force
protection requirements are met throughout event planning and
execution.
Identify timelines for communications support and implementation
at the initial planning meeting.
Transportation Issues
If using buses for shuttles or other transportation needs, get cost
quotations early from charter bus companies, school districts or
other sources. Prior to any Government representatives making a
verbal or written agreement, all information gathered for
transportation needs to be coordinated with the contracting
officer/coordinator to ensure compliance IAW Federal Acquisition
Regulations. Publish routes, schedules and locations of stops for
distribution to volunteers, drivers and passengers. Assign volunteers
as necessary and monitor regularly throughout operation.
Working with the hospitality coordinator, estimate vehicle
requirements as early as possible (six months in advance is not too
early). Refine requirements as show dates near.
Determine alternate sources to meet vehicle support requirements
(GOV or GSA motor pool support or, if Government support is
unavailable, rentals). While NFEs/donors may not be solicited to
provide vehicle support, this need can be a subject of discussion
once a prospective donor has indicated a desire to support the event
with a gift
Arrange for any car rentals to be reimbursed by the AF—e.g., cars
rented by performers or others pursuant to contracts or invitational
travel orders.
Determine early whether dealers will shuttle vehicles to the open
houses‘ distribution point or whether a volunteer pick-up and return
brigade is necessary. Organize accordingly, ensuring that volunteer
drivers meet state licensing law and dealer‘s driver age
requirements; and that shuttle transportation is arranged.

Establish a central distribution center with trained personnel to issue
vehicles and brief drivers.
Prepare vehicle allocation schedule.
Arrange and determine funding source (see Attachment 4 Funding
Matrix) for refueling of rental vehicles. Explain specific procedures
to each recipient.
Brief each driver of his/her responsibility to return the vehicle and
keys at a specified time to a specified location, and to maintain it in
good condition. Verify license and insurance.
Provide each driver with emergency phone numbers where the
transportation chairman and/or authorized designee can be reached
around-the-clock in case of breakdown or emergency.
Prepare checklist of all cars returned. Check for damage. Arrange
for cleaning and refueling of each vehicle prior to its return. May
need to arrange with donor for volunteers to accomplish these tasks
on cars provided by NFEs via gift
It is vital to stage vehicles required by military demonstration teams
in position upon their arrival. This is a manual requirement and is
non-negotiable. Check the team support manual for exact numbers
and types of vehicles and staging requirements.
If helicopters are to be used for DV transportation, work with the air
operations officer, FAA and hotel and airfield/airport managers to
arrange for safe and efficient operations.
Review procedures for accommodating disabled visitors.
CHECKLIST -- Other Ground Displays
With PA, coordinate military recruiting involvement and make sure
an area is set aside for booths at the event, both inside and outside.
Recruiting contact information is in Attachment 5
Invite base organizations to set up a display in a hangar, or suitable
location, for the public to learn more about the Air Force and escape
the heat of the day, if applicable. Be sure it‘s easily accessible by
the public.
Consider setting up a stage to highlight other base agencies, e.g.,

Section A2. Public Affairs

PA personnel are involved in many aspects of the open house set-up. Although the PA officer is
not appointed as the open house director, open houses are community relations events. PA
should be involved in most of the decision-making process.

A strong PA effort can often provide the most cost-effective tool for ensuring the general public
knows about the open house.

Strong attendance is key to the success of any open house. In large measure, attendance will
depend directly on the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

Prior to the open house, give time and attention to the media, both internal and external, for pre-
event promotion and publicity. At the open house itself, pay attention to the media‘s needs.
Event coverage brings people from their homes to the event site. Post-event publicity tells
people what they missed and encourages future attendance. Internal media should have same
access and consideration as external media.

Nearly all open houses produce some type of souvenir program. Check all contracts for PA
products to determine if any contractor has sole rights to develop an open house program. If not,
Services may produce and sell a souvenir program, funded by the sale of advertising. Souvenir
programs contain photos and articles about featured military and civilian performers and aircraft,
and information about and/or diagrams showing the locations of important facilities and
spectator services (see paragraphs 5.1.11, 5.4, 6.8.4 and 11.5). It may contain a schedule of
Services activities. In the event a program is sold, a free copy of the performance schedule must
be available to the general public.

Photo coverage of the event is an important aspect of internal and external pre- and post-
publicity. It also provides a historical record of the day‘s events.

Long-term planning and coordination

        companies, and other merchants in the community to
        promote the event.
        Identify locations (e.g. local businesses, hotel/theater
        lobbies, schools, civic organizations, buses, taxis, etc.) and
        methods for distribution of posters, flyers, etc.

               Utility companies may include informational flyers
               in their scheduled mailings

Notes
1      APF may be used to cover costs for warbird participating in the open house. Lodging,
       meals and transportation may be included as part of the contract. May be paid by non-
       Federal/private organizations and offered as a gift to the Air Force.
2      Installation commanders may designate work areas to be used by non-DoD personnel for
       repairing an aircraft, grant access to shop facilities, and, if requested, permit assistance by
       qualified USAF maintenance personnel on a strictly volunteer basis. Also, hangar space
       may be made available to non-DoD aircraft on a space available basis for protection from
       inclement weather.
3      NAFs are authorized through the Commercial Sponsorship Program (must be approved by
       AF/A1S per paragraph 2.9.1). May be paid by non-Federal/private organizations or
       offered as a gift to the Air Force. (Paying for food for military members or APF employees
       is not commercial sponsorship).
4      Unless the Government (including an AF NAFI) has contracted to provide fuel, the
       installation may authorize Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) fuel cash sales for
       aircraft pursuant to DESC policy guidance.
5      May be funded with APF, NAF or private funds depending on part of the show being
       supported. Essential elements (sanitation, health, safety, security, comfort of attendees etc.)
       are paid only with APF. Essential items are those that would be done even if there were no
       Services MWR/NFE participation. Items in support of Services MWR/NFE concessions or
       Services MWR/NFE provided entertainment can be supported with NAF or funds
       raised/donated by a private organization. When APFs are proper fund source, NAF assets
       may be used as long as APFs cover all incremental costs associated with their use for that
       purpose (maintenance, fuel, wear and tear, etc.). See paragraphs 1.12 and 6.6.
AFI10-1004 18 FEBRUARY 2010                                                                 111


6    APF can be used but PA should maximize the use of free Public Service announcements.
     NAF may be used to advertise MWR programs and events. Commercial ads promoting the
     open house can be paid for by sponsors (those same sponsors can be listed on the ad itself)
     and off-base establishments that serve as sponsors can acknowledge their support in their
     own promotional endeavors prior to the actual event. Paid or donated advertising must
     contain the disclaimer ―No Federal Endorsement Intended.‖
7    Event guides (i.e., schedule of events) are APF funded. NAF/private funds can be used to
     print programs for Services/MWR events occurring at the open house (e.g., concert) or if the
     NAFI determines the MWR benefit or expected increase in NAF concessions profit justifies
     the expense. Open house souvenir programs can be NAF/private funds if the base
     newspaper contractor does not have the rights. These may contain paid advertisements to
     cover the costs of printing. PA must provide a free ‗schedule of events‘ when souvenir
     programs/event guides are provided with NAF/private funds.
8    APF supported public base website can be used to provide open house information (use
     appropriate disclaimers for links to unofficial sites). An outside organization (e.g., non-
     Federal/private) may establish a website to promote the event. The site must clearly state
     that it is not an official Air Force website.
9    The impression must be that the event is conducted in an orderly manner by the United
     States military. Inappropriate signage would be extremely large or garish signs. Signs
     cannot block view of activities. Non-Federal/private supporters may be provided name and
     logo recognition for their donations and contributions pursuant to paragraph 1.7.4.
     Commercial sponsors of Services MWR elements of the event may be provided the various
     kinds of recognition authorized for commercial sponsors.
10   DV functions (e.g., commander's hospitality tent, as well as civic and social events
     occurring at the time of the open house) are a protocol activity and may be supported with
     Official Representation Funds if in compliance with AFI 65-603 or through a gift to the AF
     (see paragraph 1.12.1). DV tent should be offset from the center of show area. The DV
     area is not sponsored nor can any sponsor signs reside in the area.
11   Gifts/mementos for DVs and VIPs, to include welcome baskets, may be provided to
     qualifying individuals and supported by Official Representation Funds (ORF) if they
     comply with AFI 65-603 or Special Morale and Welfare Funds if they comply with AFI 34-
     201, Chapter 12.
12   TDY fund sources depend on the function being supported. TDY in support of APF
     elements of the open house should be funded with APFs. TDY in support of NAF elements
     of the open house should be funded with NAFs
13   NAF can be used for event insurance for the Services MWR elements of the event.
14   Liability insurance must be in-force for entertainment attractions, rides and fireworks
     provided by Services MWR contractors and non-Federal/private entities (either directly or
     through contractors). All contractors must have insurance.
15   Commercial sponsorship can only be used for the Services MWR elements of the event.
16   APF or NAF may provide food only pursuant to a contract provision requiring food as part
     of the Government‘s consideration.
