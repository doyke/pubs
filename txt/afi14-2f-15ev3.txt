                        EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. There are two types of EIT: Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT) and Force
Protection Intelligence Training (FPIT). AIT will be coordinated with the wing/group tactics
flight or officer. FPIT will be coordinated with force protection (FP) organizations (e.g.,
Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)) as defined in AFI 14-
119, Intelligence Support to Force Protection (FP). (T-2)
3.2. SIO Responsibilities. The SIO will:
   3.2.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems, projected
   wartime/Air and Space Expeditionary Force tasking and base/deployment location(s). (T-2)
   3.2.2. Appoint in writing an EIT program manager to oversee program execution. (T-3)
   3.2.3. Assign only qualified trainers to conduct unsupervised EIT events. Specialized
   training requirements and evaluation criteria for EIT trainers are identified in AFI 14-2F-
   15E, Volumes 1 and 2. (T-3)
   3.2.4. Develop written guidance outlining procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
   evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. List specific training objectives for each major
   area of intelligence training and the training method and resources used to satisfy each
   objective. (T-3)
   3.2.5. Coordinate EIT written instructions with all applicable commanders. Written
   guidance will be coordinated with any agency that assists intelligence personnel in providing
   training, as well as, any agency for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly
   scheduled basis. (T-3)
   3.2.6. Determine if other unit personnel require EIT and modify training requirements as
   appropriate. (T-3)
3.3. EIT Program Manager. The EIT program manager will:
   3.3.1. Build an effective training program, including training plans, with input from
   operational squadrons, tactics representatives, aircrew flight equipment (AFE) personnel, SF
   personnel, AFOSI, and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) specialists, as
   appropriate. (T-2)
       3.3.1.1. Effective training methods will be used and can include, but are not limited to:
       briefings, demonstration-performance, formal and informal lectures, and academic
       training sessions.
       3.3.1.2. Training resources can include, but are not limited to: threat briefings, current
       intelligence briefings, theater orientation briefings, CDs/DVDs or web-based training
       materials, and weapons system videos.
   3.3.2. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training cycle.
   (T-3)
   3.3.3. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
   requirements. (T-3)
 8                                                               AFI14-2F-15EV3 5 JULY 2012


     3.3.4. Conduct trend analysis following each training cycle; document lessons learned and
     apply those lessons during subsequent cycles. (T-3)
     3.3.5. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group EIT program to the appropriate
     commander(s) at the end of each training cycle. The written evaluation will include at a
     minimum: the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (e.g., high miss
     questions, weak areas); and corrective actions taken. Incorporate feedback as applicable. (T-
     3)
3.4. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT is EIT provided to the units assigned and attached
aircrew. The assigned Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC) or Intelligence Sensor
and Weapons Instructors Course (ISWIC) graduate will be directly responsible for the
management of the AIT program. When an IWIC or ISWIC graduate is not assigned, the SIO
will manage the AIT program.
     3.4.1. Flying squadron intelligence personnel provide input to and execute the AIT program.
     (T-2) They will provide questions and answers specific to the squadron's mission for the unit
     master question file (MQF), administer AIT tests to aircrew at the end of each training cycle,
     and document AIT provided. Documentation of AIT will include the names of personnel
     receiving training, date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name of the
     trainer conducting the training. In addition, they will provide a written evaluation of the
     squadron’s AIT program to the squadron commander and the EIT program manager (see
     Attachment 5). (T-3)
     3.4.2. The AIT plan will be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission requirements. Each
     item in the AIT training plan will be taught at least once during the training cycle. The plan
     will ensure the objectives for each AIT category outlined in the below paragraphs are
     evaluated with a test. All aircrew covered by the training plan will pass each test with a
     minimum score of 85% correctable to 100% via a review of the missed test items with a
     qualified trainer. (T-3)
     3.4.3. Prorate training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW AFI 11-2F-15E,
     Volume 1. Details of the prorating schedule must be outlined in the AIT Plan and/or other
     written instructions. (T-3)
     3.4.4. Aircrew intelligence training categories include threat knowledge, visual recognition
     (VR), personnel recovery (PR), and collection and reporting. Additional categories can be
     added based on the unit’s operational mission. (T-2)
        3.4.4.1. Threat Knowledge Training. Develop specific threat knowledge training
        objectives tailored to the F-15E, unit mission, local area, deployment base(s) and forward
        operating locations. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for
        direct unit involvement. The minimum standards for F-15E AIT threat briefings are in
        attachment 3. The references listed at the beginning of this instruction can be
        supplemented with other classified and unclassified publications such as National Air and
        Space Intelligence Center products, Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country
        Studies, etc. when developing threat knowledge training materials.
        3.4.4.2. Visual Recognition Training. Develop specific VR training objectives tailored
        to the F-15E, unit mission, base and forward operating locations.             Include
        enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems that may be encountered in the
AFI14-2F-15EV3 5 JULY 2012                                                                           9


       operational environment, based on unit mission and operations plan/concept of operations
       plan (OPLAN/CONPLAN) tasking. Identify key differences between friendly weapons
       systems and threat weapon system look-alikes. Incorporate all aspects/angles, theater
       specific paint schemes, national markings and various configurations. Include examples
       of weapons employment to illustrate to aircrew how threats might appear when employed
       (e.g., muzzle flashes, smoke plumes, burst patterns). Training should teach aircrew how
       to describe threats they encounter to assist intelligence personnel in positive
       identification.
       3.4.4.3. Personnel Recovery Operational Support Training. When assigned, a SERE
       specialist will conduct PR operational support training. The SERE specialist will
       coordinate PR operations support training requirements with intelligence and AFE
       personnel and document these requirements in a memorandum of agreement (MOA).
       Units without SERE personnel will coordinate an MOA with AFE and operations. This
       category will be omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational
       support training to aircrew. If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support
       training, address as a minimum: PR materials (e.g., Isolated Personnel Report
       (ISOPREP) maintenance and review, evasion plan of action (EPA) preparation) and
       theater combat recovery procedures.
       3.4.4.4. Collection and Reporting Training. Collection and reporting training will focus
       on items necessary to enable aircrew to initiate aircrew-originated reports (e.g., In-flight
       Report (INFLTREP)) and familiarize them with the information requirements of the
       intelligence-generated Mission Report (MISREP) and other intelligence reports. A
       critical component of this training will be the unit’s essential elements of information
       (EEIs). Training will identify and describe theater-specific and peacetime reporting
       requirements.
3.5. Force Protection Intelligence Training. FPIT is EIT provided by the host unit
intelligence function to the unit’s SF and other FP support agencies (e.g., AFOSI, Civil
Engineering). FPIT will be conducted IAW AFI 14-119 and supporting documents. When
possible, a Force Protection IFTU graduate will be responsible for the management of the FPIT
program. If the intelligence function is not part of the host unit, the tenant unit responsibilities in
AFI 14-119 will be adhered to.
   3.5.1. The FPIT plan will ensure FPIT is conducted in accordance with AFI 14-119 and will
   be specifically tailored to meet unit/mission FP requirements. Each item in the FPIT training
   plan will be taught IAW the FP customers objectives. (T-3)
   3.5.2. All FPIT will be documented to include the names of personnel receiving training,
   date training was accomplished, the topic taught, and the name of the trainer conducting the
   training. In addition, provide a written evaluation of the FPIT program to the appropriate
   unit commander and the EIT program manager. (T-3)
   3.5.3. FPIT categories include intelligence roles and responsibilities, area of responsibility
   (AOR) hotspots, hostile forces, ground threat, landmines and improvised explosive devices.
   Additional categories can be added based on the unit’s operational mission. FPIT will meet
   the standards found in attachment 4. (T-3)

AFI14-2F-15EV3 5 JULY 2012                                                                       21


Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment—An analytical methodology
employed to reduce uncertainties concerning the enemy, environment, and terrain for all types of
operations. Intelligence preparation of the operational environment builds and extensive data
base for each potential area in which a unit may be required to operate. The database is then
analyzed in detail to determine the impact of the enemy, environment, and terrain on operations
and presents it in graphic form. Intelligence preparation of the operational environment is a
continuing process.
Intelligence Reports—Reports generated by intelligence personnel to provide information to
higher headquarters (e.g., MISREPs and INTREPs).
Internal Training Program—The internal intelligence training program is a unit-developed and
maintained program. It is intended to facilitate all personnel in maintaining their qualifications
and currencies. This volume provides a basic starting point for F-15E intelligence units and may
be modified by the SIO based on the unit’s requirements.
Mission Briefing—A briefing to provide unit operators with the latest intelligence affecting the
mission. Accurate and timely intelligence information should be provided on the general
situation since the last briefing, mission information, general situation in the CAP/objective area,
en route and mission area threats (e.g., SAMs, ADA/AAA, air, naval, DEW) and other factors
essential to mission success.
Mission Package Construction—The mission package provides the operator with the
intelligence materials necessary to accomplish the mission. The mission package includes route
maps, threat information and other local mission package requirements.
Mission Planning—The planning accomplished by intelligence personnel to support the
operational mission. Mission planning provides operators with the intelligence materials
necessary to accomplish the mission and may include route maps, imagery, and other local
mission folder requirements. Aircrew should receive the latest intelligence and most accurate
information available on routes, CAP area, targets of strikers being supported, threats, evasion
and recovery and other factors essential to planning the mission.
Mission Tracking—Maintaining situational awareness of ongoing missions by monitoring
mission execution and communicating with other mission related agencies and coordination
centers.
Personnel Recovery—The aggregation of military, civil, and political efforts to obtain the
release or recovery of personnel from uncertain or hostile environments and denied areas
whether they are captured, missing, or isolated.
Senior Intelligence Officer—The SIO is the highest-ranking Air Force officer holding the 14N3
or 14N4 AFSC or Series 0132 Civilian serving in an Air Force intelligence position. The SIO's
authority extends to all directly subordinate units. Installations with intelligence activities in
different chains of command will have separate SIOs. In this capacity, the SIO provides senior
guidance on all policy development, interpretations, and applications.
Situation Briefing—The briefing which provides the latest intelligence to assist commanders,
staff and aircrew in their decision making. It incorporates significant military and or political
events, enemy force disposition (e.g., ground, air and air defense, naval), indications of

impending enemy attack, enemy tactics and or employment strategies, potential course of enemy
action, local area situation (e.g., terrorism, sabotage, subversion threats).
Step Briefing—A briefing given to aircrew immediately prior to departure for tasked mission.
The step briefing provides the aircrew with last minute intelligence affecting their mission and
highlights changes in the intelligence situation since the mission briefing.
Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM
Director.
Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or
program degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
Waivers may be granted at the Wing/DRU/FOA/CC level.

                     AIRCREW INTELLIGENCE TRAINING REPORT

MEMORANDUM FOR XX SQ/CC

FROM: [UNIT]

SUBJECT: Summary of Squadron Aircrew Intelligence Training (AIT)

1. Of the 25 combat mission ready (CMR) aircrew assigned to the xx Fighter Squadron, 78
percent have received all of their required intelligence training topics for this training cycle. The
status of intelligence training is listed below:
XX FS Training Summary
Total aircrew                                                                    25
Avg. complete:                                                                   78%
Most common topics not completed:                                                SA-2
                                                                                 MiG-25
2. IAW the AIT Plan, all aircrew are required to be trained on each training item at least once
each training cycle. At the completion of the training cycle, the following aircrew members have
not completed the annotated training items:
Name                                       Intelligence Training Item
John A. Doe                                SA-2, MiG-25, Su-27
Susan L. Smith                             MiG-25
Zane G. Thomas                             SA-2/3/8, MiG-25
Ed. D. Tyler                               PR, ISOPREP
3. The annual Intelligence MQF test was administered on [DATE]. All CMR aircrew have
taken the 100 question test (50 questions and 50 visual recognition slides). While not all aircrew
obtained the minimum passing score of 85 percent the first time around, all tests have been
corrected to 100 percent. A total of 25 aircrew took the test. The initial average test score for
the squadron was 95 percent.
XX FS Intelligence Test Results

Knowledge questions—average score                                           92%
Knowledge questions—most commonly missed                                    5 (SA-2)
                                                                            8 (SA-6)
                                                                            13 (MiG-29)
                                                                            14 (Collection)
                                                                            21 (Reporting)
Visual Recognition Slides                                                   50
Visual Recognition —average score                                           98%
Visual Recognition —most commonly missed                                    MiG-21
4. The most commonly missed questions were #5, 8, 13, 14 and 21. After further review of
questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded

and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-2, SA-6, and MiG-29
respectively. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems
during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times
each question was missed.
