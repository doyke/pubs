SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised. Wing orientation brief and executive inbrief
terminology, use and content are clarified. The requirement for wing wide theater style out-
briefs is deleted. Terminology was modified to address any type of formal HHQ inspection.
1. General. HQ USAF or HQ PACAF Inspector General (IG) teams will visit Eielson AFB for
the purpose of performing evaluations, with or without advance notice. These inspections
 2                                                           354FWI90-203 11JANUARY 2012


include, but are not limited to, Compliance Inspections (CI), Operational Readiness Inspections
(ORI) and Initial Response Readiness Inspections (IRRI).
     1.1. The goal of the 354 FW is to welcome visiting teams on arrival, provide maximum
     available support during the inspection and assist in their departure as outlined in this
     instruction. This instruction is a guideline for expected actions. Wing and/or unit leadership
     may direct additional or reduced actions to comply with inspection team requirements.
     1.2. Each tasked unit will appoint an officer or NCO as point of contact (POC). Unit POCs
     will develop and update checklists or Operating Instructions as required to implement this
     instruction. Particular attention should be given to contingency plans to cover additional
     requirements. POCs must be familiar with this instruction and their unit’s supporting
     checklists.
     1.3. This plan is primarily chronological and focuses on initial notification responses,
     reception, bed down and departure actions.
2. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The 354 FW/XP is the OPR for receiving higher
headquarters inspection teams to Eielson AFB and is the single point of contact for coordinating
inspection team support requirements. Offices of coordinating responsibility are 354 FW/CCE,
354 OG/CC/CCE, 354 MSG/CC/CCE, 354 MXG/CC/CCE, and 354 MDG/CC/CCE.
3. Plan Activation. The 354 FW/CC activates this plan through the Command Post (CP) and
354 FW/XP in response to notification of the impending arrival of a HHQ inspection team.
3.1. Reception of Tenant Unit Inspection Teams. If Eielson AFB tenant units receive
notification of an inspection and desire any of the services outlined in this instruction, their
commander must immediately contact the 354 FW/CC and request those services. If approved,
the 354 FW/CC will initiate actions to provide the requested services. Tenant unit commanders
or designated representatives will greet their respective teams upon arrival.
     3.2. Notification may come from a number of different sources. The inspection team may
     notify the 354 FW/XP or CP of arrival at the Fairbanks International Airport (FAI), arrive
     directly on the airfield by military aircraft, or arrive without any notification at the
     installation main gate. Regardless of the method of arrival, immediate notification to the CP
     and the wing commander is critical.
        3.2.1. 354 OSS (Airfield Management Operations) will immediately notify the CP
        whenever an aircraft with an inspection team on board is scheduled to land and upon its
        arrival at Eielson AFB.
        3.2.2. 354 SFS will immediately notify the CP whenever an inspection team arrives at
        the main gate.
        3.2.3. 354 FW/CP will contact the 354 FW/CC upon notification of an inspection team
        arrival. CP will determine and record inspection team arrival time(s)/location(s) as well
        as wing orientation brief and executive inbrief times. At the direction of the 354 FW/CC,
        CP will notify senior leadership and key personnel (CCC, CCE, CCP, PA, SE, and XP)
        via telephone. CP will email arrival details to wing leadership and relay the 354
        FW/CC’s intent and implementation of actions outlined in this instruction. CP will
        distribute PACAF Letters of Instruction to wing leadership via email upon receipt and
354FWI90-203 11JANUARY 2012                                                                    3


       will immediately disseminate the inspection team roster to the 354 FSS Lodging Desk,
       354 FW/CCP, 354 SFS and 354 FW/XP.
       3.2.4. 354 GP/CCs: Notify personnel tasked under this plan and direct implementation.
   3.3. Entry Authorization List (EAL) The inspection team EAL is not valid for restricted
   area entry until it is authenticated and endorsed by the 354 SFS in accordance with 354 FW
   Instruction 31-101.
   3.3.1. 354 FW/CP will receive the EAL via e-mail, verify the EAL with the HQ inspection
   team Command Center and forward a copy to the 354 SFS authentication and endorsement.
   3.3.2. 354 SFS will obtain the EAL from CP. After authentication and endorsement,
   security forces will reproduce and distribute the EAL to security forces and other personnel
   responsible for controlling access to restricted areas and priority resources.
   3.4. 354 FSS and 354 FW/PA will change the base marquees and commanders channel to
   welcome the inspection team. 354 FSS will change NAF marquees based on availability of
   advertising space.
   3.5. 354 OSS (Airfield Management Operations) will change the airfield marquee to
   welcome the inspection team if the team arrives at Eielson AFB via military aircraft.
3.6. ALL UNITS will comply with deliverable instructions as stated in the PACAF LOIs.Unless
otherwise specified, deliverables will be delivered to the 354 FW/XP or IG work center (IGWC).
4. Inspection Team Composition. A list identifying all team members (team roster/EAL) may
be faxed or e-mailed to the 354 FW/XP prior to arrival for ORIs and UCIs. Because of the no-
notice nature of IRRIs, the team roster may be provided upon or just before arrival. For planning
purposes, typical PACAF inspection team size is as follows:
   4.1. CI: 140 team members, including Aircrew Standards/Evaluation (ASEV) and Air
   Traffic Systems Evaluation Program (ATSEP) team members if conducted concurrently.
   4.2. ORI: 80-100 team members.
   4.3. IRRI: 15-35 team members.
5. Initial Reception (POCs: 354 FW/CC/CCE/CCC/XP/CCP, 354 LRS/CC). Once notified
of inspection team arrival, the 354 FW/CC or designated representative will respond to the
inspection team’s arrival point to greet the team. If the team is scheduled to arrive at FAI, the
354 FW/XP normally meets the team. The inspection team lead normally designates the times
for the wing orientation brief and executive inbrief.
   5.1. 354 LRS will dispatch the transportation package containing sufficient number of buses
   to support the entire inspection team, a covered baggage transport vehicle and a baggage
   handling team transport vehicle (8-9 PAX, IAW para 5.2.) to pick up the 354 FW/XP
   members and baggage detail at the IGWC. The transportation package must arrive at the
   IGWC in sufficient time to load baggage handlers/greeters and meet the inspection team at
   their arrival point in a timely manner. If picking up inspection team from Fairbanks Airport,
   Vehicle Dispatch will call SFS desk prior to departure. All transportation drivers will remain
   with vehicles and assist with baggage. The inspection team will be transported to lodging,
   the dining facility or the orientation briefing location depending on arrival time and
   schedules.
 4                                                           354FWI90-203 11JANUARY 2012


     5.2. 354 FW/CCC will coordinate development of a baggage detail consisting of one senior
     NCO and eight Airmen. Upon activation, the baggage detail will immediately report to the
     IGWC to receive instructions from the 354 FW/XP.
        5.2.1. The baggage detail will proceed to FAI or the AMC terminal, gather the inspection
        team’s luggage, obtain team room assignments from the lodging office and deliver the
        baggage directly to team members’ assigned rooms. If rooms are not available, baggage
        will be stored in the lodging secured baggage holding area until they become available.
        The detail NCOIC will coordinate with the lodging office for access to the rooms. The
        NCOIC will report to the 354 FW/XP when task complete.
     5.3. 354 FW/CCP, assisted by the baggage detail, will deliver all DV baggage to assigned
     DV quarters. CCP will report task completion to 354 FW/XP.
     5.4. 354 FW/IG/XP will greet the inspection team as directed and escort the inspection team
     representative to the CP for EAL authentication, if necessary. The XP is the POC for all
     exercise deliverables and will establish suspenses to meet inspection requirements.
6. Wing Orientation Briefing (POC: 354 FW/XP). The entire inspection team will receive a
mass orientation briefing. The purpose of the orientation briefing is to orientate the inspection
team to the base services/layout, provide a standard operating baseline and to coordinate
administrative in processing. Room key issue, vehicle key issue and other administrative tasks
will be accomplished as part of the orientation. The primary location for the orientation briefing
is the Joint Mobility Complex; however, based on team size, arrival points and other
considerations, the briefing may also be held at the IGWC, base theater or other venues.
Normally, expect the orientation briefing to occur 2 hours after inspection team arrival at FAI or
as determined by the inspection team led. The briefing times may differ if the team arrives no-
notice or by military air. All elements of the wing orientation briefing should be prepared to give
a make-up orientation briefing for inspectors arriving after the main body.
6.1. 354 FW/XP maintains the wing orientation brief. The briefing outline in attachment 2
should be used as a guide. The OPRs identified in attachment 1 will provide updated
information/slides no later than 2 hours prior to the scheduled briefing in both hard copy and
Microsoft PowerPoint format. The OPRs will ensure a representative(s) from their unit are
available at the orientation to brief their respective areas, answer questions and issue equipment
as applicable.
     6.2. 354 FW/CCP will issue DV vehicle keys, quarters assignments/keys and DV welcome
     packages upon completion of the wing orientation briefing or other designated place and time
     as directed by the 354 FW/XP.
     6.3. 354 FSS will provide lodging representatives to issue quarters assignments/keys upon
     completion of the wing orientation briefing or other designated place and time as directed by
     the 354 FW/XP.
     6.4. 354 LRS will provide a vehicle representative to issue vehicle keys upon completion of
     the wing orientation briefing or other designated place and time as directed by the 354
     FW/XP.
