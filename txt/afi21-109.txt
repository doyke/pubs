This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management Policy, and
DoD Instruction 4660.2, Communications Security (COMSEC) Equipment Maintenance and Mainte-
nance Training, June 3, 1992. It provides the directive requirements for the Air Force’s implementation of
the COMSEC Equipment Maintenance and Training program ensuring only qualified technicians repair,
maintain, or approve installation of communications security (COMSEC) equipment; it authorizes
on-the-job training (OJT) on selected ancillary equipment maintenance tasks; and it authorizes special-
ized training packages (STP) to train technicians with certain Air Force specialty codes (AFSC). It pre-
scribes the minimum training requirements for all personnel who load cryptographic key; set equipment
configurations; or maintain secure telecommunications equipment, equipment that contains COMSEC
components, or performs cryptographic functions. It does not alter OJT training (proficiency or qualifica-
tion training) described by enlisted specialty training directives. It describes DD Form 1435, COMSEC
Maintenance Training and Experience Record and DD Form 2625, Controlled Cryptographic Item
(CCI) Briefing. This instruction applies to all Air Force personnel, including Air National Guard units
and members and contractor personnel performing maintenance on Air Force COMSEC equipment.
Maintain and dispose of all records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with
AFMAN 37-139, “Records Disposition Schedule.”
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision corrects unit identification and address information for ordering Specialized Training Pack-
ages (STP) and generally updates terminology and unit designations. Table A2.1, STP Courses and Table
A3.1, Cryptographic Equipment Training Requirements Listing has been revised to add/remove equip-
ment as applicable and updated course changes. Table A4.1, Authority for Exemptions to Certification
and Training Policy has been revised to allow technicians to work on additional COMSEC equipment.
Requirements for employees of companies or corporations under contract who require Air Force training
was added.
