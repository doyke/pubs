This instruction implements AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medical Program, AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury,
and AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual. It establishes Travis AFB responsibilities and procedures to pre-
vent adverse effects of heat stress. This instruction establishes policies and rules for all personnel who are
assigned to Travis AFB and perform non-flying (ground) operations and duties during periods of hot
weather. It does not apply to contractor personnel. It defines the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)
Index, WBGT monitoring and reporting procedures, Heat Stress Index, Heat Stress posting, and unusual
clothing stipulations. During mission essential, contingency or emergency operations, commanders may
waive the provisions of this instruction; however, when commanders waive procedures they must ensure
all supervisors exercise caution, make certain all subordinate personnel are aware of heat injury symp-
toms and take actions to protect the health of their personnel. (Note: See Attachment 1, Glossary of Ref-
erences and Supporting Information, associated with this instruction.) Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will
convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended changes

       3.2.2. If an organization is open after duty hours and/or weekends, they will check the Heat Stress
       Advisory hourly via the Heat Stress Hot Line.
    3.3. Monitoring and Notification of Heat Stress Index:
       3.3.1. When the ambient temperature reaches and remains at or above 85o F, the Heat Stress Index
       will be monitored at least hourly by BEF until the Heat Stress Index reached 84.9 o F and below.
       3.3.2. Heat Stress Advisories will be disseminated every time the Heat Stress Index changes IAW
       Table 1.
       3.3.3. The BEF will notify Command Post and Weather when change in Heat Stress Index occurs.
       3.3.4. Heat Stress Hot Line: Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight will update the answering
       machine which will be a dedicated phone line that base personnel can call to receive the most cur-
       rent Heat Stress Advisory. This message will say: “Heat Stress Advisory. IAW TAFBI 48-102, the
       current Heat Stress Index for (day, month, and time) is (__._) degrees F. This is within the
       _______ zone. This information is updated at least hourly. During duty hours, direct any questions
       to Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight. After hours, contact Bioenvironmental Engineering
       Flight technician on-call via the DGMC Emergency Room.”
    3.4. Guidelines for Occupational Heat Exposures:
       3.4.1. Personnel who routinely perform their jobs while exposed to hot environments (such as air-
       craft maintenance, ground maintenance, and repair work in steam pits and tunnels) are occupa-
       tionally exposed.
       3.4.2. Supervisors of occupationally exposed personnel should use Attachment 1 to plan work
       and rest cycles for individuals under their control per AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury. When the
       Heat Stress Index reaches the temperatures shown in the attachment for the category of workload,
       supervisors should initiate the work rest regimen. Attachment 2 provides a glossary of
       3.4.3. Heat Stress Index exposures above 90o F should be allowed only when performing mission
       essential duties and only then with caution.
       3.4.4. When necessary to accomplish a task, two or more details should be arranged to work in
       sequence to ensure each crew receives the proper work and rest cycle.
       3.4.5. Failure to comply with the recommended work and rest cycles may result in a notice of vio-
       lation under the general duty clause, Section 5a(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
       1970.

4. Heavy, Restrictive Clothing.
    4.1. Wear of overly bulky and restrictive clothing (e.g., chemical warfare defense ground crew
    ensemble: CWDE) places an added heat stress burden on individuals. If personnel are wearing CWDE
    or other heavy, restrictive clothing, a correction factor must be added to a reported Heat Stress Index
    to account for added physiological stress. See Attachment 1 for guidance.

5. Supervisor/Individual Considerations.
    5.1. Ability to adjust and tolerate heat varies with the individual. Some of these factors are:
       5.1.1. Acclimatization (body’s ability to adjust to heat).
TRAVISAFBI48-102 19 DECEMBER 2006                                                                        5


      5.1.2. Duration of exposure.
      5.1.3. Amount of work to be performed.
      5.1.4. Air movement and humidity.
      5.1.5. Type of clothing worn.
      5.1.6. Physical fitness.
   5.2. Recognition of Heat Stress Disorders. When one or more of the following symptoms occur, an
   evaluation by a physician should be sought.
      5.2.1. Impaired mental function.
      5.2.2. Increased sweating or complete absence of sweating.
      5.2.3. Increase in pulse rate.
      5.2.4. Weakness, dizziness, or headaches.
      5.2.5. Faintness or unconsciousness.
      5.2.6. Muscular cramping or convulsions.
   5.3. Prevention of Heat Stress Illness or Injury:
      5.3.1. Acclimatization - This is of the utmost importance for new arrivals from cooler climates.
      This process takes ten to fourteen days and is directly related to the heat stress imposed on the
      individual. A period of acclimatization is required for all personnel regardless of each individual’s
      physical condition. An individual is considered acclimatized if he or she has undertaken regular
      exercise for longer than 10 days in the same environmental conditions as the proposed activity.
      5.3.2. Encourage Water Intake. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring water is available. Water
      must be available within a maximum of 200 feet of a primary work area. Do not use thirst as an
      index of how much to drink; drink more than you think you might need. Small amounts of water
      (one pint every hour) are encouraged during periods of moderate activity when exposed to hot
      temperatures. Milk and coffee do not make up for water loss. Carbonated beverages, while con-
      taining water, are not effective in keeping the body hydrated. Electrolyte solutions, such as sport
      drinks are highly recommended whether commercial or home made.
      5.3.3. Obtain adequate rest before physical exertion.
      5.3.4. Avoid strenuous exercise during hottest hours.
      5.3.5. Wear loose clothing to permit the passage of air.
      5.3.6. When possible, schedule heavy work during the early or late hours of the day when temper-
      ature becomes cooler. More frequent rest periods may be necessary.

6. Sport Drink Fluid Supplements.
   6.1. A plentiful supply of water, adequate work planning and rest cycles are primary effective mea-
   sures in sustaining healthful working conditions. Personnel working in extreme heat may also benefit
   from the consumption of additional diluted sports drinks.

    6.2. Units in which members perform heavy work in Heat Stress Category 3 (Yellow or higher) may
    be authorized use of O&M funds to purchase sports drinks through competent medical authority rec-
    ommendation (60 MDG/CC) and authorization as specified in AFMOA/CC Policy Letter, Revised
    Policy on the Role of Sports Drinks in Prevention of Dehydration and Heat Illness, dated 23 Aug 01.
    If sports drink procurement through O&M funds is approved, appropriate work controls and rest
    cycles should continue to be feasibly enforced.
    6.3. Carbohydrate content of sport drinks should not exceed 15% prior to dilution. Dilution should be
    half strength (1 part water, 1 part beverage or 2 parts water: 1 part beverage powder). The purchase of
    individual sized containers is recommended over powder beverages.
    6.4. Undiluted portions of open sports drinks should be refrigerated. Beverages should be consumed
    within 8 hours if refrigerated or 4 hours if warm and then discarded.
    6.5. Reusable containers must be washed and sanitized at the end of each work shift.
    6.6. Sports drinks should be kept cool (60-70? F) and shaded if possible.
    6.7. Sports drinks should not be added directly to canteens or bulk storage such as water buffaloes or
    tanks. They should be added to drinking cups or larger washable containers for group access.
    6.8. Potable water will be made available and collocated with the cooled sports drinks. In order ensure
    the beneficial effects of sports drinks, proper water intake must be emphasized to affected members.

Terms
Acclimatization—A period of adjustment an individual’s body requires to become accustomed to
working in hot environments. Full acclimatization occurs through progressive degrees of heat exposure
and physical exertion. Personnel may need two weeks of increasing exposure to become substantially
acclimated and may retain most of their adaptation for about one-week after leaving a hot climate.
Workers in good physical condition acclimatize more quickly.
Heavy (Hard) Work—Examples include: Walking on hard surface at 3.5 mph with >40 lb load, and
walking on loose sand at 2.5 mph with load, armament crew, heavy aircraft repair , and NBC
reconnaissance.
Heat Stress—Heat stress is the combination of environmental and physical work factors that constitute
the total heat load imposed on the body. The environmental heat stress factors are air temperature, radiant
heat exchange (example, sunlight), air movement, and relative humidity. Physical work contributes to
total heat stress through the body’s production of heat (metabolic heat) as it burns energy to sustain the
work. This production of metabolic heat depends on the intensity of the physical effort, which is affected,
in turn, by body size, muscular developments, physical fitness, and age.
Light (Easy) Work—Example include: Walking on hard surfaces at 2.5 mph with <30 lb load, weapons
maintenance, manual of arms, tower operations, pilot ground activities, marksmanship training, and drill/
ceremony.
Moderate Work—Examples include: Walking on hard surface at 3.5 mph with <40 lb load, walking on
loose sand at 2.5 mph with no load, patrolling, refueling, low crawl, high crawl, defensive position
construction, and field assaults.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index—The WBGT Index is a combination of temperature
measurements which consider dry air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant heating. The equation
for the WBGT Index uses dry bulb (DB) temperatures, natural wet bulb (NWB) temperatures, and globe
(GT) temperatures. Heat Stress Index is synonymous with WBGT Index.
