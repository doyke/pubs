                            POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES



Note: Air Force Weather (AFW) is used as a convenience term throughout this document. It
refers to the AF’s weather functional community that supports national, Joint, USAF, and US
Army operations. It is inclusive of all forces, units and specialties that are involved in conducting
weather operations and providing weather services. It does not imply any organizational or unit
alignment, nor an Air Force Specialty (AFS) alignment. This document cites specific
organizations, specialties and units only when critical to understanding and technical accuracy.

1.1. Introduction. This instruction establishes minimum requirements to ensure AFW forces
providing support to the USAF and US Army are adequately trained to achieve and maintain
Basic Qualification (BQ) and Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status. CMR is a functional
specific term used by multiple USAF career fields. This instruction defines how CMR will be
considered for AFW forces. Certain elements of weather specialty training must be standardized
to ensure common capabilities in weather forces worldwide. Commanders of weather forces are
responsible for ensuring the standardized USAF training practices and programs in AFI 36-2201,
Air Force Training Program and AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development are
correctly applied to meet qualification standards as stated in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) and the officer and enlisted Career Field Education and
Training Plans (CFETP).
1.2. Policies. The training and performance standards referenced in this instruction facilitate the
employment of AFW forces to effectively and efficiently accomplish their peacetime and
contingency duties and responsibilities. This instruction provides guidance for conducting a
training program in accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Each
organization’s weather training program will be defined in local procedures. The program will
define steps to achieve BQ and CMR status and will be tailored to meet those missions identified
in the unit’s Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement (if applicable).

           1.4.6.6. Ensure Non-Combat Mission Ready (NCMR) individuals receive remedial
           training at the earliest opportunity and document training actions in AFTR to return
           individuals to CMR status.
1.5. Documentation. Training documentation is important to personnel at all levels of
operations because it validates the status of training and task qualification. Documentation also
helps leaders assess mission capabilities and readiness; and to satisfy operational requirements
with fully qualified Airmen.
       1.5.1. All officers O-3 and below, all enlisted Airmen E-8 and below will have training
       accounts created in AFTR. All civilian personnel who directly support the execution
       phase of operations will have training accounts created in AFTR. Organizations will
       document training and job qualification/certification for these personnel in AFTR as
       outlined in AFI 36-2201. NOTE: Personnel assigned to purely staff positions (e.g.,
       MAJCOM staff) may not have specific traditional job qualification/certification standards
       per the CFETP. These personnel will maintain their training record in AFTR to
       document any weather and/or other formal training received while assigned to a staff
       position.
       1.5.2. Detailed training and documentation guidance on using AFTR can be found on the
       AFWKC in Courses and Library, and under the Training Tab in AFTR. AFTR must
       contain the following documents, in addition to any locally determined requirements:

                                  BASIC QUALIFICATION

2.1. Basic Qualification (BQ) Training. BQ training requirements are designed to ensure
weather personnel are qualified to perform weather operations without regard to mission-specific
Operations Plan (OPLAN) and Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) taskings (as
applicable). The BQ training process begins with each permanent change of station (PCS). BQ
status will be awarded by the organization’s weather leadership upon confirmation by the
individual’s supervisor that he/she has satisfied all applicable BQ training requirements, is fully
qualified to perform all required garrison duty position tasks and has successfully completed all
duty position checkrides (receive a ―Go‖ rating). Table 2.1 provides an example of a potential
BQ timeline.
     2.1.1. All AFW personnel supporting the execution phase of operations will undergo BQ and
     recertification annually and document the results in AFTR. Supervisors will document all
     certifications IAW AFI 36-2201. BQ minimum MTLs are published for each AFW-
     approved common duty positions on the AFWKC.
     2.1.2. Following the award of BQ status, individuals tasked to perform UTC-specific and
     deployed-in-place weather operations will be entered into CMR training.

                             COMBAT MISSION READINESS

3.1. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) Training. CMR training is designed to ensure weather
personnel achieve CMR status to perform UTC-specific deployed and deployed-in-place weather
operations; this includes training for their assigned organization’s OPLAN and AEF taskings (as
applicable). All applicable CMR training requirements must be met no later than the end of the
spin-up window of an individual’s first deployment eligibility period or within 180 days of an
individual’s CMR training start date for active duty personnel (CMR training is Just-in-Time
Training for the ANG), whichever comes sooner. Note: For Battlefield Weather (BW), Special
Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) will start when the member is entered into CMR training and
available for contingency operations at the discretion of the unit commander IAW AFI 36-3017,
Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP) Program. CMR training will consist of the following:
   3.1.1. Personnel must be trained and certified on all JQS/CFETP and additional training
   requirements for their assigned UTC.
   3.1.2. Accomplish USAF-directed ancillary deployment training requirements IAW AFI 10-
   403, Deployment Planning and Execution (e.g., Law of Armed Conflict, self-aid and buddy
   care, small arms). IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, BW personnel are classified
   as Arming Group A and will complete training on all weapons with which they are armed.
   IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, BW personnel require
   ―Use of Force‖ training conducted IAW AFMAN 31-222, Use of Force Manual.
   3.1.3. Document incomplete or lapses in CMR training applicable to CT and/or CMR
   certification in the individual’s AFTR on the AF IMT 623A. This documentation will
   explain why a member may not be CMR certified within the required timeframe and may be
   beyond the organization’s ability (e.g., AF-support personnel will complete weapons training
   once tasked to deploy).
3.2. Combat Mission Ready. Weather leadership will award initial CMR status after the
certifier confirms that the member has satisfied all applicable BQ training and CMR training
requirements and is fully qualified to perform supported organization’s UTC mission-specific
weather operations and individual AEF taskings (as applicable). Individuals must satisfy all
applicable CT requirements to maintain CMR status. Table 3.1 lists training courses that may be
used to provide many of the JQS requirements and estimated training times to meet CMR status.
ANG BW personnel will be scheduled for CMR training when tasked with a deployment as part
of their spin-up training phase. Note: Personnel postured as BW deployment augmentees will
meet the CMR training requirements as part of the spin-up training phase of their deployment
cycle.

4 training days      Evasion, Conduct-After-Capture S-V88AL; Note: Army support UTCs
                     only.
4 training days      Ancillary training requirements.
   3.2.1. Prior to PCS to an overseas location into a position that will fill a UTC postured as an
   in-place requirement (e.g., Korea), personnel will complete all formal courses required for
   CMR. The gaining MAJCOM Weather Functional is the waiver authority and may waive the
   requirement if course slots are not available. These members will complete final checkrides
   on UTC tasks within 60 days of arriving at PCS location for award of CMR status.
3.3. Deployments. Personnel tasked with a deployment will complete CMR training and satisfy
all training line remarks prior to deployment. Upon return to duty at home station, individuals
will resume normal training. Commanders will ensure that personnel postured against weather
UTCs complete a checkride on tasks aligned with that UTC during the spin-up phase of their
respective AEF block. Officer and enlisted CFETPs identify all UTC-aligned tasks. This may
be accomplished by another organization if there is no organic capability to certify tasks (e.g.,
BW tasks for augmentees).
   3.3.1. Task certifiers will document UTC-aligned task checkrides on AF Form 1098. Task
   certifiers will document all pass and fail results.
   3.3.2. Task certifiers will immediately notify the supervisor, deployment manager and
   commander of a UTC-aligned checkride failure. The commander will use appropriate
   management and administrative tools to ensure all personnel are prepared to deploy. In the
   event that personnel are not CMR-certified prior to deployment, the individual’s commander
   will advise the Installation Deployment Readiness Center (IDRC) of the individual’s status
   and proceed with appropriate actions outlined in AFI 10-403.
   3.3.3. Weather leadership will make every attempt to assist BW personnel and BW
   augmentees to participate in all training events in the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN)
   with the unit they will support.
3.4. Deployed Weather Systems Training (DWST) Process. DWST is designed for personnel
who do not have home-station equipment training resources. DWST is conducted primarily by
2nd Combat Weather Systems Squadron (2 CWSS) at Hurlburt Field, Florida.
   3.4.1. Combatant commander-validated deployment training requirements will appear as
   Deployment Requirements Manning Document (DRMD) line remarks.
AFI15-127 14 MARCH 2012                                                                          11


     3.4.1.1. Organizations will contact their MAJCOM Weather Functional Area Manager
     (FAM) to schedule DWST. In the request, provide preferred primary and alternate
     training class dates.
     3.4.1.2. MAJCOM Weather FAMs will forward requests to afwaa3t@offutt.af.mil for
     scheduling.
  3.4.2. In some cases, the individual selected for deployment may have recently received the
  training required to satisfy the line remarks (e.g., within the last 12 months). In this case, the
  individual’s IDRC should send a DMRD waiver request IAW AFI 10-401.
  3.4.3. Units that cannot meet the training line remarks will contact the IDRC to initiate a
  training waiver request.

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Continuation Training (CT). Accomplishing CT ensures individuals receive sufficient
recurring training on perishable skills to maintain qualification and is a key component of
individual technical development. Weather organizations will use AFWA and OWS published
training resources to the greatest extent possible. Individual weather organizations will arrange
for members to participate in training events/exercises that ensure individuals awarded CMR
status receive sufficient CT to maintain that status. CT requirements for personnel deployed to a
combatant command in support of contingency operations are highly encouraged but will depend
on mission priorities and availability of training resources. Personnel ―deployed-in-place‖ will
fulfill continuation training tasks, as required. CT will be conducted quarterly. This will allow
routine refresh of seasonal, perishable weather and tactical skills. Quarterly CT will cover, at a
minimum:
   4.1.1. Meteorological techniques and procedures. Meteorological CT will encompass both
   knowledge and task items and will include a focus on seasonal forecasting challenges.
   4.1.2. Manual observing skills and procedures. Training will include, at a minimum,
   observing using assigned/available tactical sensors, observing techniques for manual cloud
   height, type and ceiling determination, manual determination of prevailing, variable
   prevailing and sector visibility using both day and night markers, observing local phenomena
   (e.g., sea fog, blowing dust), descriptive remarks use, encoding, and dissemination of the
   observation both local/longline.
   4.1.3. Supported missions (e.g., mission profiles, tactics, planning/execution cycle,
   sensitivities of platforms, mitigation/exploitation of environmental impacts).
   4.1.4. Unique meteorological phenomena and synoptic/regional weather features for both the
   installation and likely expeditionary locations.
   4.1.5. Set-up and operation of assigned tactical meteorological equipment (TACMET).
   4.1.6. CT completion will be documented in AFTR.
4.2. Continuation Training Resources.
   4.2.1. AFWA and OWSs will make CT material readily available to other weather
   organizations through the AFWKC or any other commonly accessible means. When the
   capability exists, posted training content will migrate to an Air Force weather web enterprise
   service.
   4.2.2. AFWA and OWSs will make CT material readily available to other weather
   organizations through the AFWKC, other AFW-approved/used web enterprise systems,
   and/or commonly accessible means.
AFI15-127 14 MARCH 2012                                                                 13



  4.2.3. Weather organizations will coordinate through their functional chain of command to
  resolve any training shortfalls.
