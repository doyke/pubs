SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision defines Functional Check Flights (FCF)/ Operational Check Flight (OCF), High
Speed Taxi, (HST) and clarifies preparation of aircraft records. Some paragraphs were
renumbered and minor administrative corrections made. A margin bar indicates newly revised
material.
 2                                                            919SOWI21-102 20 JUNE 2011


1. Functional Check Flights (FCF)/Operational Check Flight (OCF)/High Speed Taxi
(HST) definitions:
     1.1. FCFs are performed to ensure an aircraft is airworthy and capable of accomplishing its
     mission. FCFs will be flown by FCF qualified aircrew members as required by applicable
     technical orders or as directed by the Maintenance Group (MXG) Commander (919
     MXG/CC).
     1.2. OCFs are defined as flights to determine safe or required operation when it cannot be
     accomplished by means of ground or shop tests. OCFs will be flown by qualified aircrew
     members when an operational check is required by applicable technical orders or when
     maintenance has been performed that does not require an FCF.
     1.3. HST checks may be utilized in-accordance with Technical Order (TO) 1-1-300,
     Acceptance / Functional Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks instead of FCFs
     with MXG/CC and Operations Group OG/CC authorization, high speed taxi checks may be
     utilized when a maintenance ground operational check requires aircraft movement at higher
     than normal taxi speeds on runway to operationally check completed maintenance or for
     troubleshooting purposes.
        1.3.1. To minimize brake and tire wear, configure aircraft with the minimum Dash-1
        operational fuel requirements.
        1.3.2. Ensure aircraft is prepared for flight and the exceptional/conditional release is
        signed off.
2. Check Flights and Taxi Check. The 919th Maintenance Operations Center (919
MXG/MOC), Plans and Scheduling section, schedules the FCF/OCF/HST with the 919
Operations Support Squadron Supervisor of Flying (919 OSS/SOF) and notifies 919 Operations
Group/Standardization Evaluation (919 OG/OGV).
     2.1. Quality Assurance (QA) supervises the FCF program, reports on any trends shown by
     FCF histories, and provides FCF checklists and procedures manual to the aircrew. 919
     OG/OGV will maintain a list of qualified FCF aircrew members, and will ensure all FCF
     aircrews are qualified to perform the scheduled FCF/OCF.
     2.2. FCF/OCF Crew Composition. Structure of the flight crew is as shown in T.O. 1-1-300
     and may be changed to include specialists needed to perform or observe in-flight checks.
     Maintenance personnel who are to fly on the FCF must contact 919 OSS/SOF to initiate
     supporting forces letter.
        2.2.1. HST crew composition will consist of a qualified FCF members.
     2.3. All FCF/OCF work is performed in designated Military Operations Areas as defined by
     Flight Information Publications (FLIP). Any flight requirements outside these areas are
     cleared through 711th Special Operations Squadron (711 SOS) operations. Stall entry and
     recovery is done at a minimum of 10,000 feet above ground level (AGL). Engine shutdown
     is done at a minimum of 2500 feet AGL.
     2.4. See TO 1-1-300, paragraph 4.9. for governing directives in relation to combining
     training missions with FCF/OCF’s.
919SOWI21-102 20 JUNE 2011                                                                     3


3. Scheduling of FCF/OCF/HST Checks. The production superintendent coordinates with QA
and Plans and Scheduling when an aircraft requires an FCF/OCF/HST. The Plans and
Scheduling section coordinates with 919 OSS/SOF to set up date and time for the flight and will
notify 919 OG/OGV; once it is known when the aircraft will be ready.
4. Preparation of Aircraft Maintenance Records and Briefing Prior to
FCF/OCF/HST. The crew chief provides QA office with the current maintenance record, Air
Force Technical Order (AFTO) Forms 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document,
and binder when all maintenance has been completed, including the maintenance preflight
Inspection and the exceptional release. QA office reviews the records to see that all entries or
transcriptions are completed. Transcribed forms accompany the aircraft AFTO Form 781A to
QA office so the discrepancy resulting in the FCF/OCF and corrective action will be available
for review.
   4.1. Crew Briefing. QA office briefs crewmembers prior to flight on what is significant to
   the FCF/OCF/HST and any special information. Complete crew briefing at one time, if
   possible, but engineer preflight, etc, may dictate individual briefing. This briefing is
   conducted in the QA office, unless situation dictates otherwise.
   4.2. Crew Debriefing. QA office debriefs crewmembers after flight. QA will ensure all
   checklists and forms are completed by aircrew prior to release. Aircrew must return to QA
   for debrief after FCF/OCF/HST is completed, unless previously agreed to by 919 MXG/CC
   and 711 SOS/CC. This does not pertain to aircraft being flown to validate primary aircraft
   systems as defined in TO 1-1-300, paragraph 4.1. This briefing is conducted in the QA
   office, unless situation dictates otherwise.
5. Controls and Accomplishment of AFTO Form 781A and FCF/OCF Checklist.
   5.1. When FCF/OCF/HST's performed include checking specific equipment of systems; only
   applicable parts of the checklist are used. QA indicates during briefing which sections of the
   checklist are applicable for the FCF/OCF/HST.
   5.2. Whether the FCF/OCF/HST is completed or not, the checklist and aircraft AFTO Forms
   781A are returned immediately by the crew to the debriefing area. QA office assists in
   debriefing the crew and determines if all requirements were accomplished. QA office checks
   the checklist and the aircraft AFTO Forms 781A for accuracy and ensures all other required
   forms have been completed and signed.
   5.3. When an aircraft has been released, QA forwards the checklist to plans and scheduling
   for filing.
