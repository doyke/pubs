                                            Chapter 1

                                   CONCEPT AND POLICY

1.1. Combat Logistics Operations (CLO) Organizational Structure. The CLO is 23 AF
logistics component of the Command and Control (C2) system within the 623d Air Operations
Center (AOC). The CLO is a functional branch of and directly supports the 623d Combat
Operations Division (COD) and is located within the 623 AOC. It works in unison with the 23
AF and Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC Logistics Maintenance Divisions (A4M), 623 AOC and HQ
AFSOC Logistics Readiness Divisions (A4R), 635th Supply Chain Management Group
(SCMG), and Combat Operations Division (COD) to affect the most rapid recovery.
1.2. Primary Objective:
    1.2.1. The CLO is a 24-hour operation whose objective is to provide command, control, and
    logistics support for AFSOC and AFSOC-gained mission aircraft that are away from home
    station, not mission capable (NMC) or partially mission capable (PMC), and requiring
    support beyond the capability of the base or facilities where the aircraft is located. CLO is
    primarily concerned with mission aircraft that cannot meet their scheduled departure time for
    the assigned mission due to logistical reasons. To accomplish this objective, the CLO is a
    functional part of the 623 AOC Command and Control (C2) System. CLO will aggressively
    support off-station NMC and PMC aircraft recoveries through tasking of various units for
    manpower, parts, equipment support, and timely transportation requirements. Note: CLO
    does not provide support for off-station contract aircraft. That responsibility resides with the
    owning unit.
    1.2.2. The CLO is the focal point for aircraft logistics matters affecting current operations in
    the 623 AOC C2 system. The CLO can be reached via phone at (DSN) 579-8925,
    (commercial)       850-884-8925,          1-800-451-7705;           e-mail       (unclassified):
    AFSOF.AOC.CLO@hurlburt.af.mil, (classified): AFSOC.A4CLO@afsoc.af.smil.mil;
    FAX (DSN) 579-2122, (commercial) 850-884-2122.
    1.2.3. The CLO’s success in rapidly supporting NMC aircraft in peacetime and wartime
    depends upon accurate and timely communication from the field units. When recovering
    aircraft, the telephone (DSN and commercial) is the primary means of relaying information
    between the recovery site and the CLO. When normal telephone communication is not
    available, some of the following can be used to communicate maintenance and supply actions
    to the CLO: Satellite Communications (SATCOM), Email: (Non-secure Internet Protocol
    Router (NIPR) and Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR), and Global Decision Support
    System 2 (GDSS 2).
    1.2.4. Unit response is paramount to successful aircraft recovery. When requested by the
    CLO to recover an aircraft, field units will provide any assistance necessary to expedite the
    recovery. The group commander/senior maintenance representative at each base/unit is
    responsible for recovery tasking accomplishment. The CLO in coordination with the owning
    unit MXG/CC through the maintenance Operations Center (MOC) is the only authority for
    dispatching Maintenance Readiness Team (MRTs) and recovery resources. If a disagreement
    exists, then it should be elevated to the 23 AF/CC.
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    5


       1.2.4.1. When directed by CLO, all AFSOC home station, en route and deployed unit
       assets will be made available for lateral support of AFSOC deployed aircraft, regardless
       of ownership.
       1.2.4.2. The CLO considers all geographically assigned assets in the decision process to
       achieve the most expeditious recovery. If it’s determined to be the best course of action,
       the CLO will request other units to provide recovery resources in cases where they
       possess the most timely resources or unique capabilities.
       1.2.4.3. The owning unit will provide all funding for recovery and support of its aircraft.
   1.2.5. The CLO does not support not-mission aircraft in depot or modification facilities, off-
   equipment mission capable (MICAPs), Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) MICAPs, or
   provide replenishment for Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP). CLO will provide
   spare engine MICAP support for aircraft deployed in support of major contingencies.
   1.2.6. The CLO will utilize MRTs for Crash Damage or Disabled Aircraft Recovery
   (CDDAR) of AFSOC assets where en route capability is limited or does not exist. The CLO
   will coordinate with weapon system functional managers to determine MRT composition and
   equipment requirements.
       1.2.6.1. Home stations must be prepared to rapidly deploy crash recovery equipment and
       personnel for their Mission Design Series (MDS) as deemed necessary by the CLO to
       recover AFSOC assets.
1.3. Personnel Policies.
   1.3.1. The CLO is composed of maintenance (Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 2A5XX),
   Material Management (AFSC 2S0X1), and transportation (AFSC 2T2X1 and AFSC 2T0X1)
   personnel on an around-the-clock basis. Personnel assigned to the CLO, as a minimum, are
   fully qualified to the 7-skill level in their primary AFSC, possess excellent communication
   skills. Because this organization is not identified on the Air Force Global Wing
   Organizational Structures, the MAJCOM Functional Area Manager (FAMs), and the AOC
   Superintendent, must coordinate on any manpower restructuring.
1.4. Management of Files. The CLO maintains current regulations, memorandum of
agreements and operating instructions needed to perform their duties.
   1.4.1. The CLO will maintain an historical archive for 1 year of all aircraft support requests.

                                           Chapter 2

                COMBAT LOGISTICS OPERATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General Responsibilities. CLO is the single point of contact and directly responsible for
timely aircraft recoveries and aggressive management of logistic support requirements for en
route and deployed NMC or PMC aircraft. All CLO controllers have authority from 23 AF/CC,
623 AOC/CC and the AOC Senior Duty Officer (SDO) to request subordinate unit personnel,
equipment, and resources for the expeditious recovery of NMC aircraft.
    2.1.1. The CLO maintains current logistics and support history for off-station aircraft in the
    Global Decision Support System 2 (GDSS 2) for the following delay criteria:
       2.1.1.1. Current aircraft overall estimated time in commission (ETIC) exceeding the
       mission time.
       2.1.1.2. Aborted or diverted aircraft for maintenance.
       2.1.1.3. Maintenance requirements exceeding local capabilities.
       2.1.1.4. Supply requirements exceeding local capabilities.
       2.1.1.5. Parts Cannibalization (CANN).
    2.1.2. The CLO briefs the HQ AFSOC/A4, Director of Logistics, daily regarding the status
    of off-station aircraft recoveries, logistics impact of HOMELINE and BEELINE messages,
    logistics concerns reported on daily SITREPs/LOGREPs, and status of all AFSOC home
    station aircraft, when requested.
    2.1.3. The CLO performs emergency notification, recall, and other C2 duties as directed by
    the AOC SDO.
    2.1.4. The CLO supports the AFSOC Crisis Action Team (CAT) as the 24-hour logistics
    representative. When directed by the SDO, the 623 AOC Command Center controllers have
    the responsibility of contacting the ―Regular CAT‖ including the HQ AFSOC/A4 (CAT L).
    CLO will not contact the HQ AFSOC/A4 (CAT L) without prior approval from the
    AOC/SDO.
    2.1.5. The CLO deploys personnel to Moody AFB, GA or a designated alternate location for
    remote operations in preparation of anticipated hurricane evacuations. CLO operations will
    transfer, if necessary, to the deployed team for continued off-station aircraft support. Note:
    Due to limited manpower at deployed site, only NMC MICAP and equipment support will be
    provided.
2.2. Recovery Responsibilities. The CLO in coordination with the owning unit MXG/CC, the
CLO has authority to request subordinate unit personnel, equipment, and resources for
expeditious recovery of NMC or PMC aircraft. If a disagreement exists, then it should be
elevated to the 23 AF/CC.
    2.2.1. Research/Sourcing. CLO takes initial support requests from customers via telephone,
    fax, e-mail, and documents required data to start the recovery process.
       2.2.1.1. Conduct area supply searches, to include local manufacture capability.
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                               7


     2.2.1.2. Verify part numbers, stock numbers, including interchangeable and "suitable
     substitutes," and technical order references. AFSOC has many MDS specific parts that
     are not always identified in T.O.'s, FEDLOG, or the Air Force Master Item Identification
     Database (D043). If inconsistencies arise during the verification process, the customer
     must resolve them to the fullest extent possible, to determine requirements.
     2.2.1.3. Utilize 635 SCMG for sourcing via Enterprise Supply Solution (ESS) to
     determine availability and location of required part(s). Contact 635 SCMG to process the
     asset for shipment. Note: Before using AFRC or ANG resources, the CLO obtains
     approval from the supporting unit logistics representative.
     2.2.1.4. If the request is for a non-supply item, CLO will coordinate sourcing actions
     with the appropriate base MOC or equivalent. When requesting assistance from Air
     Mobility Command (AMC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF),
     or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) units, the CLO will coordinate with the
     respective MAJCOM Logistics Operations Control Center, Readiness Center, or
     equivalent to request such support. The CLO will normally task an AFSOC unit before
     requesting assistance from a non-AFSOC unit due to the unique weapon systems and
     funding issues to support mission requirements.
     2.2.1.5. Ensure applicable items being shipped via Air Mobility Command (AMC) are
     shipped as prescribed in AMCI 23-102, Expeditious Movement of AMC VVIP, and
     marked ―AMC MICAP Very Very Important Parts (VVIP)‖ or through World Wide
     Express (WWX) for items being shipped via commercial carriers. Use project codes as
     prescribed to ensure proper handling.
     2.2.1.6. Coordinates with the appropriate Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS)
     Distribution Section (LGRDD) and aerial ports to ensure proper handling of support
     items.
     2.2.1.7. In the event assets are not available through supply channels, CLO will contact
     the customer to discuss option and feasibility of CANN action.
  2.2.2. CANN action. The CLO has the coordination authority, per HQ AFSOC/A4, to
  request CANN actions of aircraft parts in support of deployed aircraft.
     2.2.2.1. Upon determination of CANN requirement, the CLO will coordinate with the
     appropriate unit MOC (or Battle Staff, if activated) for the CANN actions. The CLO will
     normally request CANN action from the owning AFSOC unit, however, another AFSOC
     unit will be tasked if it can provide the most expedient support to recover the aircraft.
     The CLO will task the MOC/Battle Staff verbally and by FAX request for the CANN
     action. The MOC/Battle Staff will in turn task the appropriate Aircraft Maintenance Unit
     (AMU). Note: CANN of AFRC and ANG aircraft parts is restricted. The CLO will
     request CANN authority through the HQ AFRC Command Center or the ANG Readiness
     Center prior to such action. AFRC and ANG Aircraft Commanders may not authorize
     CANN actions.
     2.2.2.2. When the CLO requests the CANN of an aircraft due-in-from-maintenance
     (DIFM) part, it is mandatory to process the part at the home station LRS Customer
     Service as a serviceable asset. This allows shipment of the part under the requisition
8                                                       AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009


       number from the deployed logistics function or 635 SCMG, which ever applies, and for
       the unit to obtain DIFM credit for the part.
       2.2.2.3. When the CLO requests the CANN of an aircraft expendable (XB3) part,
       maintenance personnel will turn-in the part to the LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD)
       with DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document.
       2.2.2.4. After the part is turned in to the local LRS Customer Service section, or the LRS
       Distribution Section, the MOC/Battle Staff will immediately notify the CLO when and
       where the part was turned in. In order to achieve Total Asset Visibility (TAV), all parts
       requiring commercial or government transportation must transit through the base level
       distribution section.
    2.2.3. Transportation. The CLO arranges the most expeditious transportation for parts,
    equipment, and personnel to the recovery site. Note: Commercial airlift of personnel is the
    responsibility of the tasked unit.
       2.2.3.1. Commercial Air Transportation. WWX carriers will be utilized for premium
       transportation of MICAP parts and support equipment to support recovery of en route and
       deployed NMC aircraft.
           2.2.3.1.1. The packaged cargo must meet the carrier’s shipping requirements, i.e.
           size, weight, classification, etc. and have an acceptable delivery time to meet the
           recovery aircraft’s mission requirements.
       2.2.3.2. Military Air Transportation. AMC or AFSOC missions will be utilized when
       they are the fastest and most available means to ship parts, equipment, and personnel to
       recover en route and deployed NMC aircraft.
       2.2.3.3. Commercial Ground Transportation. The CLO will coordinate with LRS
       Distribution Section (LGRDD) for all commercial ground transportation requirements.
       2.2.3.4. Military Ground Transportation. When deemed necessary, the CLO will request
       unit vehicle operations to provide timely ground transportation to move parts, equipment,
       and personnel to support mission requirements.
    2.2.4. Provide shipping information to the requestor, 635 SCMG and owning unit MOC.
    2.2.5. Coordinate with appropriate 623 AOC or HQ AFSOC/A4 staff when technical
    expertise is beyond the capability of the CLO.
    2.2.6. Advise subordinate units, via the unit’s MOC/Battle Staff or command post, when
    aircraft diversion or maintenance requirements are being directed to their station.
2.3. MRT Tasking Responsibilities. The CLO assists/dispatches MRTs as follows:
    2.3.1. Conduct area searches and generate a request to the nearest supporting unit that can
    provide the best and most expedient support. Note: Before using AFRC and ANG
    resources, obtain approval from the local logistics representative or applicable HQ
    AFRC/ANG Readiness Center/Operations Center.
    2.3.2. Notify the tasked unit’s MOC/Battle Staff of MRT support requirements. Follow-up
    with written, emailed or faxed copy of CLO’s Support Information Checklist detailing all
    personnel, equipment, and parts requirements for the recovery.

                                  UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Maintenance Group Commander/Senior Maintenance Representative. The AFSOC
unit Maintenance Group (MXG/CC) or senior maintenance representative is responsible for
deploying tasked MRTs and equipment to recover aircraft at remote locations, as directed by
CLO. Unit resources, including personnel, supplies, and equipment, will be made available as
tasked to support en route aircraft recoveries, regardless of aircraft ownership. The MXG/CC or
senior maintenance representative shall consider providing local supplementary MRT guidance
in a maintenance operating instruction (MOI). Supplementary guidance should build upon MRT
responsibilities, requirements, and Team Chief qualifications covered in this chapter. The
MXG/CC or senior maintenance representative will:
     3.1.1. Ensure equipment resources, as authorized by applicable allowance standards and
     home station minimum requirements, are not exceeded.
     3.1.2. Ensure individuals selected for MRTs are qualified to perform and complete all
     anticipated tasks, including In-Process Inspections and Red X sign-offs. Consider the
     experience level of the individuals selected when the need is identified to troubleshoot
     repeat/recurring discrepancies, especially those that caused in-flight emergencies or involve
     safety of flight.
        3.1.2.1. Once identified, ensure the MRT Chief is aware of his/her responsibilities.
     3.1.3. Prior to deployments or planned TDYs, coordinate establishment of a Material
     Management account at the deployed location with the unit resource advisor or, as a

     advisor and ensure form accompanies the senior maintenance representative, material
     management representative, or Aircraft Commander to be used to establish a supply account
     at the deployed/transient location if possible.
     3.1.4. In cases in which transient aircraft requiring support are at a location where no
     Transient Alert (TA) or Air Force supply activity exists or cannot be established, CLO
     sources the required part(s) from home-station, home-station maintenance will be required to
     order the requested part(s) and turn into LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) with DD Form
     1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document as directed by CLO. Note: Emphasizing
     Positive Inventory Control efforts, the use of DD Form 1149 for non-expendable parts is
     prohibited.
        3.1.4.1. If the part is not available at home-station or CLO determines procurement from
        another base will be quicker, home-station maintenance will be required to establish a
        due-out document number in Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) with text code ―Z‖
        and provide that number to CLO to use to procure and ship the part(s).
3.2. MOC/Battle Staff. The MOC/Battle Staff is the focal point for the CLO to affect recovery
of AFSOC aircraft and will:

     3.2.4.3. Brief the MRT/Team Chief using Attachments 2 and 3 to this instruction.
     Ensure that MRT meets all theater requirements for the recovery location, as applicable.
     If more in-depth information on recovery site is required concerning terrorist threat,
     medical, and mobility bag requirements, ensure local unit agencies, i.e., intelligence, OSI,
     Medical Group, and Individual Protective Equipment sections are contacted to provide
     briefings and equipment prior to MRT departure. Units supplementing this checklist to
     meet local needs or unique mission capabilities shall incorporate them into an MOI.
     Note: If additional information is required, CLO may either coordinate this information
     or authorize the MRT to contact the AC/flight engineer/crew chief/senior AFSOC
     representative for information.
     3.2.4.4. Advise local Command Post of requirement to move an MRT to the support
     location, as required. Ensure travel orders are properly prepared for the MRT. MRT
     orders will include MRS authority or MEGP authority as applicable. Priority
     transportation is authorized for all resources in both travel directions.
     3.2.4.5. Ensures required supplies are ordered or manufactured as necessary and
     prepared for shipment. Items available at the supporting unit location are ordered or
     obtained locally by the MRT and moved with the MRT. Items not available are referred
12                                                          AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009


        to CLO for CANN action determination or procurement and shipment from another
        station to the recovery site. Process parts through the host LRS (issue/shipment,
        replacement order, and turn-in) and move them with the MRT whenever possible.
        Reparable items shipped to the recovery site where an Air Force supply activity exists
        must be received and issued to maintenance to account for the charge for parts. The
        reparable item must be turned in at recovery site to clear DIFM details. If asset has repair
        capability back at home station, have the local logistics function force shipment back to
        home station. If no Air Force logistics system exists or parts were not issued at the
        recovery site, return the reparable parts to the issuing base to clear the DIFM records and
        to account for parts charges.
        3.2.4.6. Verbally verify and document with team chief or member of supporting unit that
        all test and support equipment was inventoried, calibrated, and fully operational prior to
        dispatch, that all Material Management issues were visually checked to verify contents
        match attached documentation, and that all CLO directed system function/bench checks
        were accomplished on aircraft parts.
        3.2.4.7. Ensure that all items are assigned a transportation control number (TCN) and
        marked as ―AMC MICAP‖. Include applicable project codes. Small items may be hand-
        carried by MRT to prevent loss. Do not check hand-carried items as baggage unless
        absolutely necessary.
        3.2.4.8. Notify CLO of all TCNs for all equipment/tools/parts processed for shipment.
        3.2.4.9. Validate with CLO that all support equipment is processed for return with the
        MRT and keep MXG/CC informed of status of MRT and support equipment. Coordinate
        with LRS Equipment Accountability Office concerning deployment of accountable
        equipment, ensuring positive accountability of equipment items.
        3.2.4.10. Advise the applicable base agencies of the requirement to move an MRT and to
        generate TDY orders for the MRT. MRT orders are the responsibility of the tasked unit.
        Ensure the following authorizations are included: Mission Route Support (MRS) and
        MEGP. MRS permits the removal of cargo to allow space for the MRT and their
        equipment (see AMCI 24-101, Volume 14, Military Airlift-Passenger Service). MEGP
        enables the MRT to bypass passenger terminal processing. Advance per diem,
        commercial travel authorization, and variations authorized will be included. Priority
        transportation is authorized for all resources in both travel directions.
        3.2.4.11. Notify CLO when MRT personnel and all deployed equipment return to home
        station.
3.3. MRT Chief. The MRT Chief will:
     3.3.1. Be responsible for expeditious aircraft recovery and control of all deployed parts,
     equipment, and personnel.
     3.3.2. The MRT chief will ensure all test and support equipment is inventoried, calibrated, is
     fully operational, contains all necessary accessory items (i.e. test leads, adapters, etc.), and if
     applicable, is loaded with the correct software to support the MDS (block and serial number)
     to be repaired, prior to dispatch. The MRT chief will also ensure proper technical data is
     available or carried with the team to complete the task.
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                13


  3.3.3. When transportation is provided by military aircraft, coordinate with port operations
  to ensure all required supplies and equipment are assembled, inventoried, properly
  manifested, and loaded on the support aircraft. The MRT chief physically validates the
  presence and condition of assets when possible.
  3.3.4. When directed by CLO, coordinate traveling arrangements with the host LRS
  Distribution Section (LGRDD). Notify CLO of specific travel plans when confirmed. Note:
  Do not self-procure commercial transportation. Travelers that self-procure commercial
  transportation will not be reimbursed unless they can prove that self-procured transportation
  was the only way to meet mission requirements.
  3.3.5. Notify the CLO upon arrival at the recovery site and inform the CLO of duty phone,
  duty location (to include shipping address), rest location, and rest phone.
  3.3.6. Supervise all other MRT members during the TDY period. In cases where the MRT is
  dispatched to a location with AFSOC maintenance support, the MRT is responsible to the
  senior maintenance representative and reports directly to the CLO through the host MOC on
  all progress, status changes, and further support requirements. In cases where no AFSOC
  maintenance exists, the MRT reports directly to the CLO by the most expedient means.
  3.3.7. Establish duty hours for the MRT as prescribed in AFI 21-101, section 1.17., and
  14.18.7., Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management. As the senior on-scene
  supervisor, the MRT Chief is responsible for assessing the conditions at the recovery site and
  establishing a safe duty schedule.
     3.3.7.1. MRT will start work immediately upon arrival, dependent upon availability of
     the aircraft, field operating hours, and length of MRT duty day. Note: As a minimum,
     each MRT member is provided the opportunity for 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep,
     exclusive of transportation to and from the billeting location and time to eat.
     3.3.7.2. Proper rest is essential to safe maintenance operations. The 16-hour maximum
     duty period may be exceeded only when individuals are en-route to recovery site. After
     16-hour initial duty period, the MRT is only required to:
         3.3.7.2.1. Contact the A/C, local MOC, MXG/CC/senior maintenance representative,
         and flight line production superintendent, and CLO as applicable.
         3.3.7.2.2. Provide billeting location and phone number to CLO, local MOC, and A/C.
  3.3.8. Report maintenance progress to the CLO as follows:

     3.3.9. Ensure the local MOC coordinates with CLO prior to assigning the MRT work on
     aircraft not supported by the CLO. The CLO is the releasing agent for the MRT.
     3.3.10. MRT Termination Procedures:
        3.3.10.1. Prior to returning to home station, ensure all equipment, parts, and supplies are
        accounted for and the return transportation has been coordinated with aircraft mission
        commander or local LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) and CLO.
        3.3.10.2. When parts are sent with the MRT, return the reparable items to the MRT’s
        home station for DIFM processing. If any items were ordered and issued at the recovery
        site, turn in those reparable items at the recovery site before return. If the MRT has
        questions about disposition of any items, CLO will advise them where to return reparable
        items.
        3.3.10.3. Contact the CLO to advice of commercial travel arrangements or for help in
        arranging military air travel. Note: Commercial return transportation is responsibility of
        the recovery personnel.
        3.3.10.4. Report to MOC upon arrival at home station.
        3.3.10.5. If applicable, submit parts for material deficiency reporting (MDR)
        immediately upon return to home station.
3.4. Cannibalization Procedures. If parts cannot be provided by other sources, CLO will
request CANN action. Cannibalization procedures are as follows (if a unit is tasked with a
CANN action and the CANN action is not feasible, coordinate with CLO for resolution):
     3.4.1. The MOC will record the following details provided by CLO upon receipt of a CANN
     action: Aircraft MDS and tail number, location, parts requirements, technical order, figure,
     and index, part number, national stock number, nomenclature.
     3.4.2. The MOC will contact the applicable production superintendent and pass the CLO
     tasking to them to select donor aircraft or engine and initiate CANN action. The production
     superintendent will coordinate disposition of parts per CLO direction.
     3.4.3. Notify CLO when coordination is complete and pass on all TCNs. Notify CLO when
     the tasked parts are ready for movement and at LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD).
     Immediately notify CLO in the event of difficulties with the tasking.

     maintenance -to-maintenance issue and pull part from LRS stock. The AMU will take
     possession of the part, prepare DD Form 1149 and take part to LRS Distribution Section
     (LGRDD) with DD Form 1149 for shipment. For DIFM parts, the AMU will contact LRS
     after shipping the part to ensure processing of DIFM status code ―AXC‖ to prevent false
     accumulation of repair cycle days and to allow Material Management to properly track DIFM
     parts. The aircraft commander will ensure all reparable parts shipped to him/her are returned
     to the aircraft’s home station for maintenance/LRS processing. Note: Emphasizing Positive
     Inventory Control efforts, the use of DD Form 1149 for non-expendable parts is prohibited.
     5.4.3. If the best source of supply is another Air Force base, CLO will contact the home
     station MOC. The home station MOC will direct the appropriate AMU to establish a memo
     (TEX Z) MICAP due-out for the applicable NSN. Use TEX Z to prevent on-hand assets
     from releasing to the due-out (exception: do not use TEX Z in cases of cannibalization from
     another home station aircraft). CLO will contact the 635 SCMG to obtain a requisition
     number for lateral shipment from the desired base. The LRS ships the required part directly
     to the aircraft location with a supplementary address marked for the aircraft commander.
     The aircraft commander ensures repairable items are returned to the aircraft’s home station
     for material management processing. Receipts and Due-out-release (DORs) will be
     processed at home station, immediately upon confirmation of parts arrival at aircraft location.
5.5. Logistics procedures for deployed aircraft with MRSP kits transferred to a supporting
LRS (Attachment 8).
     5.5.1. If the logistics activity has connectivity to SBSS, the logistics function will:
        5.5.1.1. Establish memo due out in SBSS.
        5.5.1.2. Source MRSP kits within local Area of Responsibility (AOR) by running an
        open inquiry. If found, contact owning unit for lateral support and process special
        requisition (SPR).
        5.5.1.3. If not found, update ES-S bullet with statement ―MICAP VERIFICATION
        COMPLETE…CLO MICAP PLEASE WORK‖ or similar and contact the supporting
        635 SCMG. The 635 SCMG will process the requisition and forward the MICAP request
        to CLO for action. It is essential for the deployed Material Management function to
        ensure information requested in paragraphs 4.1.3.1. through 4.1.3.5. of this publication is
        relayed to CLO as soon as it is known so that CLO can begin sourcing immediately.
        5.5.1.4. CLO will source and direct shipment. CLO will provide continuous current
        updates to the 635 SCMG so that ES-S bullets can be updated.
        5.5.1.5. Notify CLO immediately upon receipt. Clear MICAP requirement from ES-S.
     5.5.2. If the Material Management function does not have connectivity to SBSS, the Material
     Management function will:

     5.5.2.1. Contact the supporting MAF. MAF will enter the requisition into SBSS and
     forward the MICAP request to CLO for action.
     5.5.2.2. Contact CLO and provide information requested in paragraphs 4.1.3.1. through
     4.1.3.5. of this publication so that CLO can begin sourcing the MICAP.
     5.5.2.3. Notify CLO and the 635 SCMG immediately upon receipt. The 635 SCMG will
     clear MICAP requirement from ES-S.

                                             Chapter 6

                     MAINTENANCE RECOVERY RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. Standard Recovery Procedures:
     6.1.1. There are many variations as to how aircraft recovery should flow. The following are
     basic guidelines to cover a routine support request. Deployed/transient units will exhaust
     local/host base capabilities prior to contacting the CLO. Attachments 6-8 are flow charts
     outlining routine support requests.
     6.1.2. Prior to all deployments/temporary duty stations (TDYs), units should get with their
     resource advisor and establish a Material Management account at the deployed location to be
     used to order aircraft parts, if possible. As a minimum, the senior maintenance representative
     traveling with the aircraft or Aircraft Commander should obtain an AF Form 616, Fund Cite
     Authorization, from the unit resource advisor to be used to establish a material management
     account at the transient location if necessary.
     6.1.3. Requests for support fall into two fundamental categories: (1) The aircraft is at an Air
     Force Base (AFB) using that base material management system, (2) The aircraft is not at an
     AFB or is not using an Air Force Material Management system, whether at an AFB or not.
        6.1.3.1. The simplest type of support occurs when the aircraft is at an AFB and is in
        transient status. Transient usually means the aircraft is just passing through or diverted in
        to that particular base. This usually allows the use of the local base Transient Alert (TA)
        for ordering the required parts. Per T.O. 00-20-1, chapter 8, paragraph 8.3.1.1., TA can
        order required part(s) if the exchange price for the reparable is $20,000 or less. If the
        item is available through the transient base’s LRS, it will issue to the transient
        maintenance or aircrew. If the part is DIFM controlled, the reparable will be turned back
        in to the local LRS under the issuing document number and will not have to be hand
        carried back to the aircraft's home unit for turn in. If not available, it must be
        backordered through the local LRS or MICAP section. CLO will then assume lateral
        support duties from the LRS or 635 SCMG and source and ship the part. If TA cannot
        support, establish an organization code and order part through the normal SBSS channels
        IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Part 2, Chapter 11, Attachment 11C-12.
            6.1.3.1.1. An aircraft that is at an AFB and performing missions (exercise,
            contingency, or training) from that base is not usually considered transient, but rather
            "deployed," and most TA's cannot support these aircraft. The best way for CLO to
            support this scenario is for the deployed unit to establish an aircraft organization code
            (using AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization obtained from the unit resource advisor
            prior to departing home station) with the local LRS. The type support would then be
            identical to the one above and DIFM parts ordered and received using this account
            could be turned in to the local LRS. During some deployments (normally longer than
            30 days) aircraft MRSP and logistics responsibility may be transferred to the local
            LRS or 635 SCMG in which case the LRS or 635 SCMG would be considered the
            local logistics function.
        6.1.3.2. If the aircraft is deployed and MRSP kits are not transferred to an LRS, or if TA
        does not exist or cannot support, or if not capable of setting up an organization code, then
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                     21


       the aircraft and support will be IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Pt 2, Chapter 11,
       Attachment 11C-12. In this case, the AC or senior maintenance representative must
       contact the CLO with all pertinent information and the CLO will source the required
       parts. CLO will determine the best source of support based on asset availability and
       available transportation.
          6.1.3.2.1. If CLO opts to pull the part from the aircraft’s home-station, CLO,
          through home-station MOC/BattleStaff, ensures the home-station maintenance unit
          orders the part. Home-station maintenance representative will ensure the part is taken
          to LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) with DD Form 1149 for shipment. CLO will
          coordinate shipment to the deployed/transient location. The deployed/transient
          maintenance representative will notify CLO when the item is received.
          Deployed/transient personnel must ensure the reparable is returned to home-station to
          clear DIFM accountability. Note: Emphasizing Positive Inventory Control efforts,
          the use of DD Form 1149 for non-expendable parts is prohibited.
          6.1.3.2.2. If CLO opts to pull the part from another location other than the aircraft’s
          home station, CLO, through home-station MOC/BattleStaff, ensures home-station
          maintenance establishes a due-out document number through ES-S /SBSS. CLO will
          obtain a TCN from the 635 SCMG and will coordinate shipment to the
          deployed/transient location. The deployed/transient maintenance representative will
          notify CLO when the item is received and CLO will notify the home-station LRS to
          process receipt of the item. Deployed/ transient personnel must ensure the reparable
          is returned to home-station to clear DIFM accountability.
   6.1.4. If an MRT is to deploy to recover a NMC aircraft, the MRT orders all required parts
   while at the home unit and accompanies the items to the recovery site. Since the MRT Chief
   is responsible for all DIFM parts, hand-carrying is an acceptable mode of transportation,
   though tracking control is jeopardized.
       6.1.4.1. Parts required by the MRT after arrivals are ordered through local LRS, if it
       exists, at the recovery location through TA or using a separate aircraft organization code
       for that aircraft. Any parts required for recovery, but not available at the supporting unit's
       location are referred to the CLO after back-ordering through the local LRS. The 635
       SCMG sources the required parts and ships them to the recovery location.
       6.1.4.2. If the aircraft is not able to use the local TA or no Air Force material
       management account exists at the recovery location for the aircraft, the MRT contacts the
       CLO to request the required parts. CLO will source and ship requested parts as in
       paragraph 5.1.3.2. The MRT will ensure all reparable parts and equipment sent to
       support them are returned to the supporting base. The MRT Chief will contact the CLO
       with disposition instructions for the reparable parts and equipment.
6.2. Munitions Requirements. When munitions items (e.g. squibs) are required to support
aircraft recovery, order them through the appropriate host munitions activity. The munitions
activity will prepare all munitions for shipment under an ―FV‖ prefix TCN. Under no
circumstances should local maintenance requisition the items and arrange for shipment on their
own. If a host munitions activity is not available, contact CLO for assistance.
6.3. Transportation Procedures:
22                                                        AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009


     6.3.1. Transportation of parts/equipment/MRTs is different in every situation dependent
     upon location of recovery aircraft; size, weight, dimensions, and location of parts required;
     mission requirements; transportation availability; and costs.
        6.3.1.1. The CLO can coordinate special requirements for asset delivery, such as
        diverting an aircraft, delaying scheduled departure, tasking AFSOC units to provide
        additional missions to support recoveries, tasking local LRS vehicle dispatch, working
        with LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) for WWX carriers, and commercial trucking.
     6.3.2. Consider commercial transportation when military airlift is not available or is
     untimely. Coordinate through the host LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) to arrange for
     commercial transportation based on the size, weight, dimensions, and destination of the parts
     and equipment.
6.4. CLO Support for Reserve and Guard Aircraft. All AFSOC and AFSOC-gained Reserve
and Guard aircraft receive full AFSOC/CLO support. The AC or senior maintenance
representative is responsible for ensuring CLO is notified of aircraft status while away from
home station.
     6.4.1. CANN from AFRC aircraft is restricted. In unusual cases where CANN is deemed
     operationally or logistically appropriate, CLO will coordinate requests with the HQ AFRC
     Command Center or ANG Readiness Center, as appropriate, for final approval/disapproval.
     6.4.2. Aircraft commanders cannot authorize CANN.
6.5. Aircraft Maintenance Status Reporting. The CLO is responsible for obtaining daily
aircraft maintenance status of AFSOC’s fleet from each home and deployed unit
MOC/BattleStaff. Off-station aircraft status is briefed daily to the 23 AF Commander and
AFSOC Director of Logistics and to other Command Staff as requested. A daily aircraft status
report is provided to SOCOM.
     6.5.1. Unit MOC/BattleStaff will notify CLO immediately of known status changes of off-
     station aircraft.
     6.5.2. CLO will immediately notify the appropriate unit MOC/BattleStaff of known status
     changes of its off-station aircraft.
     6.5.3. If a deployed MOC is established, it will be responsible for relaying aircraft status to
     CLO every 8 hours or as requested by CLO.
     6.5.4. When AFSOC or AFSOC-gained aircraft are deployed in support of contingency
     operations each deployed location’s established MOC will provide daily aircraft status to
     CLO unless a joint or centralized MOC is established, in which case the joint or centralized
     MOC will provide daily aircraft status to CLO. CLO must be able to provide the most
     current aircraft maintenance status to the 23 AF Commander and 623 AOC as requested so
     timely receipt of status from the field is imperative.
        6.5.4.1. The deployed MOC will keep CLO informed of known status changes of
        AFSOC or AFSOC-gained aircraft.
        6.5.4.2. If a MOC is not established, the deployed senior maintenance representative is
        responsible for relaying aircraft status to CLO every 8 hours or as requested by CLO.

       A2.1.1.8. Mode of transportation and projected date/time of departure. CLO will
       evaluate capabilities and determine the best mode of transportation (AMC airlift, AFSOC
       mission, commercial, or government vehicle). If commercial transportation is selected,
       see A2.4.
       A2.1.1.9. Passport/Visa/Immunization requirements for personnel.
   A2.1.2. Contact the applicable maintenance supervisor to review requirements and task the
   responsible units to assemble an MRT.
   A2.1.3. Brief MRT personnel concerning the following duties and responsibilities to include
   the passport/visa/immunization/terrorist/criminal/intelligence threat requirements at recovery
   site. If necessary, contact local agencies, i.e., intelligence, medical group, and OSI, to gather
   required briefing information.        Ensure the MRT team chief understands his/her
   responsibilities and has a copy of AFSOCI 21-108, Attachment 3, MRT Chief
   Responsibilities, as well as AFSOCI 21-108, Attachment 4, MRT Chief Tasking Checklist.
   Emphasize the following:
       A2.1.3.1. The MRT Chief is required to call the CLO upon arrival to coordinate work
       hours and provide a phone number and e-mail address where they can be contacted.
       A2.1.3.2. The MRT Chief is responsible for all equipment and parts. Return of all items
       must be coordinated with CLO. The MRT will:
          A2.1.3.2.1. MRT chief and squadron senior maintenance representative verifies
          necessary parts are available. Open each container to ensure the right part is in the
          box prior to departure.
          A2.1.3.2.2. Check special tools, support and test equipment for serviceability and
          calibration prior to departure.
28                                                        AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009


     A2.1.4. Generate TDY orders for MRT. Consider the following authorizations and provide
     as required:
        A2.1.4.1. Mission Route Support (MRS) or Mission Essential Ground Personnel
        (MEGP).
            A2.1.4.1.1. MRS permits the bumping of cargo to allow space for the MRT and their
            equipment.
            A2.1.4.1.2. MEGP allows MRT to bypass passenger terminals processing. Aircraft
            commanders are the approval authority.
        A2.1.4.2. Advance per diem.
        A2.1.4.3. Commercial travel.
        A2.1.4.4. Rental car.

     A2.1.5. Direct the squadron senior maintenance representative to order the required parts
     and select the required equipment items. If requirements are not known, make contact with
     the POC to determine what items are required. All parts will be issued to the MRT Chief to
     hand-carry to the deployment site.
        A2.1.5.1. Items too large or heavy to be carried will be coordinated with CLO and
        processed by squadron senior maintenance representative and given to the LRS
        Distribution Section (LGRDD) for shipment. Note: The Packing and Crating section at
        each station maintains a block of TCNs and assigns them as required for property being
        shipped. Note: LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) will not issue TCN numbers for
        MILSTRIP assets. For shipment by AMC airlift, equipment items and parts are
        coordinated with Packing and Crating section. In this case, the parts are considered
        "maintenance property" and not "supply parts‖. Equipment and parts being shipped
        commercially are coordinated with LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD). The squadron
        senior maintenance representative will:
            A2.1.5.1.1. Prepare shipping documents, DD Form 1149 using the SAF/ILGD
            directed system at https://Isotools.wpafb.mil/dd1149. Include POC and phone
            number plus an in the clear address to include building number, street address and US
            or host nation zip code.

        or CANN action.
     A2.1.6. Notify the CLO when coordination is complete, or immediately in the event of
     difficulty. Provide the following:
        A2.1.6.1. MRT names, rank, SSN, name of team chief, Air Force specialty and skill
        level of MRT personnel, and whether MEGP authorization is being utilized.
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                               29


       A2.1.6.2. TCNs for parts and equipment processed for shipment.
A2.2. Equipment Items (MRT not required). The MOC/Battle Staff will:
   A2.2.1. Record all details provided by CLO to include:
       A2.2.1.1. Aircraft MDS and tail number.
       A2.2.1.2. Location.
       A2.2.1.3. Equipment requirements.
       A2.2.1.4. Mode of transportation and projected departure date/time. CLO will
       coordinate with LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) to evaluate capabilities and
       determine the best mode of transportation (AMC airlift, AFSOC mission, commercial, or
       government vehicle). If commercial transportation is selected, see A2.4.
   A2.2.2. Direct the squadron senior maintenance representative to select the equipment items,
   prepare them for shipment, and coordinate with Packing and Crating section of LRS
   Distribution Section (LGRDD). The squadron senior maintenance representative will:
       A2.2.2.1. Prepare shipping documents, DD Form 1149. Include POC and phone number
       plus an in the clear address to include building number, street address and US or host
       nation zip code.
       A2.2.2.2. Deliver equipment to Packing and Crating section.
       A2.2.2.3. Brief on shipping requirements, destination, and mode of transportation.
       A2.2.2.4. Record the TCNs.
   A2.2.3. Notify CLO when coordination is complete, or immediately in the event of
   difficulties. Provide TCNs.
A2.3. Part(s) (MRT not required). When local LRS does not have the required parts in stock
to support a non-mission capable aircraft, all possible maintenance sources must be evaluated.
The MOC/Battle Staff will:
   A2.3.1. Record all details provided by the CLO to include:
       A2.3.1.1. Aircraft MDS and tail number.
       A2.3.1.2. Location.
       A2.3.1.3. Parts requirements.
          A2.3.1.3.1. Tech order, figure, and index.

        determine the best mode of transportation (AMC airlift, AFSOC mission, commercial, or
        government vehicle). If commercial transportation is selected, see A2.4.
     A2.3.2. Search all possible maintenance sources for required parts.
        A2.3.2.1. In-shop supply points.
        A2.3.2.2. CANN action. If parts cannot be provided by other sources, coordinate with
        CLO for resolution, i.e. lateral support or CANN action.
     A2.3.3. Coordinate ordering of parts with the appropriate home-station maintenance unit as
     requested by CLO when the aircraft is transient/deployed to a location that does not have a
     transient alert or Air Force stock record account established. In this case, the aircraft’s
     home-station maintenance unit must either order the part or establish a MICAP due-out
     document number (see flow chart in Attachment 7).
     A2.3.4. Coordinate the turn-in of parts to LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) for shipment
     to recovery site, as applicable. If the CLO sources or directs a CANN from the aircraft’s
     home station and the recovery site is not supported by an Air Force Material Management
     account, the home station senior maintenance representative will prepare DD Form 1149 and
     take part to LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) to ship the part directly to the AC. Note:
     Emphasizing Positive Inventory Control efforts, the use of DD Form 1149 for non-
     expendable parts is prohibited
     A2.3.5. Notify CLO when coordination is complete, or immediately in the event of
     difficulties. CLO will coordinate with LRS to ship by the most direct means.
A2.4. Commercial Transportation. Commercial transportation of a MRT and equipment is, in
many cases, the most expeditious method. CLO will advise when this is necessary. The
MOC/Battle Staff will:
     A2.4.1. Coordinate with CLO and local LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD) to determine
     the best mode of transportation and scheduled itinerary. Consider the following:
        A2.4.1.1. Airline.
        A2.4.1.2. Surface (bus, rail, limousine, truck).
        A2.4.1.3. Air Express Small Package Service.
     A2.4.2. Coordinate transportation requirements with LRS Distribution Section (LGRDD).
     Review the following:
        A2.4.2.1. Destination, support of AMC aircraft, and priority.
        A2.4.2.2. Selected mode of transportation and itinerary.
        A2.4.2.3. Names of MRT personnel and nomenclature of equipment items and parts.
        A2.4.2.4. Authorization for excess baggage allowance if necessary.
        A2.4.2.5. Record TCNs, government bills of lading, and any applicable billing or
        shipment numbers.
        A2.4.2.6. Shipment of large or heavy items by commercial airline mandates prior
        coordination with airline personnel by LRS Passenger Movement Element Passenger
        Movement Element (LGRDAP) and the CTO. Parts/equipment must be hand-carried or
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                              31


     checked as baggage to maintain control. If an item is not accepted as carry-on luggage it
     must go as checked baggage. Advance coordination with the airline is the key to a
     successful movement without unnecessary delays.
  A2.4.3. Maintain contact with the MRT or the unit responsible for the parts/equipment
  shipment to ensure that all resources arrive in time to make the scheduled departure.
  A2.4.4. Notify CLO when coordination is complete. Notify the CLO immediately in the
  event of difficulties.

                                     MRT HELPFUL HINTS

A5.1. Travel Arrangements. Your MOC has responsibility to coordinate your team travel to
the recovery site. Your orders should contain fund cites to allow for travel on military aircraft as
MEGP, as Mission Route Support, or on civilian aircraft if necessary. To accommodate travel
on civilian aircraft you should submit a travel request in the Defense Travel System (DTS). If
you require assistance contact your resource advisor. MRS authority distinguishes you as
essential for airlift mission support. If you have trouble at military terminals securing space on
the aircraft for your team or equipment, contact the terminal supervisor and advise them that you
need to invoke MRS authority. Contact the CLO and advise them of your problem. MRS or
MEGP authority does not apply to civilian aircraft.
A5.2. Getting Parts. Most of the parts required for recovery should have been sent with you.
If you require additional supplies after arrival contact one of the following, in the order listed:
     A5.2.1. MOC at the recovery site.
     A5.2.2. Transient Alert at the recovery site.
     A5.2.3. CLO. Any parts supplied by the MOC or Transient Alert should have DIFM
     accountability at that base, so turn in reparables there. All parts brought with you and parts
     shipped to you by the CLO have DIFM accountability back at your home station so return
     them with your team. If DIFM accountability is not as explained above, the CLO should
     advise you of proper disposition instructions.
A5.3. Use of Equipment. Hopefully you will have all needed equipment with you. If use of
equipment at the recovery location has been pre-coordinated, you will have been briefed as such
by your MOC. If after arrival you decide that you require the use of additional equipment, check
with local maintenance facilities for availability. If the equipment is available from a US
Department of Defense agency and they will allow its use, simply advise the CLO of its use on
your next call. If the equipment is available from any other source (e.g., civilian contractor,
allied military unit, etc.), contact the CLO. To alleviate any billing conflicts, CLO will ensure
that usage is approved. The AC is authorized to contract for needed equipment using AF Form
15. Any equipment that is not available will be provided to you by the CLO.
A5.4. Communication. Upon arrival at the recovery location, call the CLO at DSN 579-8925,
toll free, (800) 451-7705, or commercial collect, if necessary, at (850) 884-8925 and notify the
local MOC. You are required to maintain contact with the CLO at all times during your travel.
All contacts with the CLO are mission essential and you are authorized to use IMMEDIATE
precedence. Advise the operator of your precedence and request their assistance in placing the
call. Use phones at one of the following:
     A5.4.1. MOC.
     A5.4.2. Transient alert.
     A5.4.3. Base operations.
     A5.4.4. Senior maintenance representative at recovery site.
     A5.4.5. Allied military organizations.
AFSOCI21-108 10 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  37


   A5.4.6. Commercial telephones (call collect if necessary), (850) 884-8925 or 1-800-451-
   7705. Telephone services are often difficult to arrange at off-line recovery sites. Use the
   most convenient, expeditious method available. The AC is responsible to assist you in
   communications if necessary. Remember that HQ AFSOC constantly monitors recovery of
   aircraft. Up-to-date information is necessary, so report at the required intervals. If you have
   difficulty contacting the CLO directly, call your home station MOC to relay information.
A5.5. Responsibility to CLO. While assigned to the MRT you are responsible directly to the
CLO and should contact them for resolution of any problems. You are the expert; do not take
maintenance instructions from any agency without first coordinating with the CLO. If the
recovery is at another base with AFSOC units, coordinate with the CLO and the local MOC; if at
a base without AFSOC units or non-USAF location, coordinate with the CLO and either the on-
station TA or the AC.
A5.6. Signing Off Discrepancies. If you should need a discrepancy cleared on a system for
which no one on the team is qualified, call the CLO. CLO will contact the group commander at
the aircraft’s home station and coordinate approval for the flight engineer to clear the
discrepancy.
