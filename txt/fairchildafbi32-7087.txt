This instruction establishes procedures for operation and maintenance of Fort George Wright Cemetery.


1. Who is Eligible to be Interred in Fort George Wright Cemetery. Fort George Wright Cemetery is
a military cemetery that has accommodated active duty, retired and dependents of military members since
1899. Due to space limitations new burials may only be accommodated under two instances:
   1.1. Military or family members who previously made reservations at the time when a qualifying
   family member was buried. These reservations must be recorded in the Official Interment Record
   Book kept and maintained by Fairchild AFB Mortuary Affairs, 92 SVS/SVMM.
   1.2. Family members may elect to have their cremated remains, contained in an urn, buried in the
   same plot as an eligible relative who is already interred in the cemetery. No more than two of these
   additional interments will be allowed per plot.

2. Reserving Gravesites. Two plots are available in Fort George Wright Cemetery, which limits new res-
ervations.

3. Procedures for Conducting Interments. The following steps will be followed when an eligible per-
son is to be buried in the cemetery:
   3.1. When a burial is necessary, 92 CES/CEVN and/or 92 SVS/SVMM will be contacted by the fam-
   ily of the deceased or the funeral home to ensure that the person has a reservation and to begin the pro-
   cess necessary for the interment of the individual.
   3.2. The 92 CES/CEVN will process an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, to
   obtain approval of the Fairchild AFB Civil Engineer Commander. The proper gravesite will also be
   delineated for the funeral home.
   3.3. Family members are responsible for contacting a local funeral home to handle all arrangements
   for burial, in addition to the following requirements.

       3.3.1. For a full casket burial Fairchild AFB requires the funeral home to arrange for the grave
       opening, installation of a concrete vault, closing of the grave and placement of the sod over the
       grave. Excess soil will be properly disposed of offsite by the funeral home or their contractor. Any
       needed awning, chairs or other items related to the funeral service are the responsibility of the
       funeral home and will not be provided by Fairchild AFB.
       3.3.2. The family will bear all costs.

4. Permitting Disinterment. The cemetery permits disinterment only when the next of kin furnish valid
reasons, in writing, or when a court order directs disinterment. Anyone wishing a disinterment must apply,
in writing or in person, to 92 CES/CC, 100 West Ent Street, Fairchild AFB WA 99011. The next of kin or
estate must pay any expense related to the disinterment.

ment of these veteran markers. All headstones will be upright and of white marble or light gray granite
type, refer to VA Form 40-1330 for an example and dimensions if a private firm is to provide the marker
for other than veterans. If a marker is desired when cremated remains are buried in an existing grave, a flat
marker will be installed as a footstone. Markers are the responsibility of the next of kin and placement will
be coordinated with 92 CES.
