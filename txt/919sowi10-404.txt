SUMMARY OF CHANGES

OPR updated offices symbols in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, minor administrative over sites and updated
publication dates.
1. General: The Exercise Evaluation program is a very important aspect of the 919 SOW
readiness program. It establishes and provides the groundwork for a solid evaluation and
training process that will ensure successful preparation and responses to real world contingencies
and readiness operations. The goal is to ensure an environment of teamwork and cooperation
throughout the wing. The cross functional sharing of lessons learned through periodic planned
exercise scenarios, assistance visits and cross-feed/self-inspection programs will be the
cornerstones to the program’s success.
     1.1. The exercise evaluation program will be administered in accordance with AFI 10-
     2501/AFRC Sup 1, Full-Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations, AFI
     10-403, Deployment Planning, and 919 SOW 91-201, The Explosives Safety Monitor
     Program for Field Training Exercises, as required.
     1.2. The overall wing OPR will be 919 SOW Chief of Combat Readiness (CVZ).
     1.3. The Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Chief is the 919 SOW Chief of Combat Readiness
     (CVZ) and is the responsible agent in the implementation of this program.
     1.4. The 919 SOW CC will appoint the Team Chief in writing.
2. The Team Chief will:
     2.1. Provide overall direction and instruction to team members.
     2.2. Schedule EET planning and coordination meetings prior to the start of each exercise.
     Prior to each exercise, the specific team composition will be determined (from master
     appointment list) based upon the exercise scope and objectives.
     2.3. Brief the team on the scenario, the observation format and suspense for inputs will be
     established.
     2.4. Conduct an exercise out brief after each exercise, or as deemed necessary by the Wing
     Commander.
     2.5. Prepare and review the contents of the final report and ensure the 919 SOW/CCO is the
     approving authority for the lessons learned after action report.
     2.6. Publish an annual exercise schedule and include it in the Wing’s annual calendar.
     2.7. Attend and/or ensure attendance at Host Base EET meetings and/or training.
     2.8. Keep the Readiness Board abreast of the exercise evaluation program through periodic
     briefings and updates.
     2.9. Administer the exercise program, utilizing applicable Air Force Instruction and trained
     EET members from selected functional areas.

     team member and functional area being observed.

   3.3. Appoint to the EET highly qualified personnel in their respective specialties who
   possess a high level of integrity, in order to conduct impartial evaluations of unit and
   subordinate organizations.
   3.4. Ensure team members possess at least a Secret security clearance and:
       3.4.1. Primary exercise planners consist of EET Chief and representatives from Safety
       (SE), Readiness Flight (CEX), Logistics Plans, Wing Plans and additional functional
       representatives as deemed necessary by the team chief.
       3.4.2. Planners are responsible for planning, coordinating, and identifying the objectives
       of the exercise. Written risk assessments will be accomplished prior to the start of the

     list) to assist the evaluation team planners in coordinating the logistics support needed for

     and observations documented in the exercise lessons learned after-action reports. For
     deployment related exercises (OREs, ORI, weapons issue, etc.), the Unit Deployment
     Managers meeting conducted during the UTA will suffice.
     5.4. Observations (write-ups) identified during the evaluation will be made a part of each
     units’and/or work centers’ cross-feed/self-inspection program.
