    2.1. AMU scheduling section will:
       2.1.1. Schedule all assigned aircraft to be washed every 30 days.
       2.1.2. Schedule aircraft for wash in conjunction with all phase, periodic or isochronal
       inspections, and prior to aircraft paint.
       2.1.3. Inform Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO) weekly of all early/overdue (5
       days or more) aircraft washes.
       2.1.4. Do not schedule aircraft for wash until mid-cycle has elapsed since the last date
       washed. The only exception will be short-notice VIP or cross-country tasking, when
       directed                                     by                                      the

           Force Command (PACAF) approved rinse cycle waiver is in effect (to terminate
           rinsing after last flight of the day, based on Okinawa water table level), a 15-day
           CWR will be completed as a minimum.
       2.1.6. Coordinate with 18th Maintenance Operations Squadron (18 MOS) Plans and
       Scheduling and Structural Maintenance Superintendent to develop a monthly paint
