3. LST Operational Requirements:
   3.1. Major Launch Anomaly. The LST will assist the IC and EOC with response to a
   launch vehicle land impact. EOC response to an emergency is covered in the Vandenberg
   Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2 and shall be coordinated with the IC,
   MFCO, and OSM to assure a safe, timely, and effective response. ISBP roles and
   responsibilities are addressed in 30SW Oplan 91-204.
30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014                                                                         17


   3.2. Responsible Launch Agency. The responsible launch agency shall provide the
   required launch vehicle support personnel necessary to support the LST Chief at the fallback
   area at the required time IAW the LSP.
4. Safety Control Areas. Launch operations are the most hazardous activities on Vandenberg
AFB necessitating establishment of a Safety Control Area to control the hazard and prevent
public exposure. The paragraphs below provide specific information on Safety Control Area
requirements for missile and space launches.
   4.1. Potential Hazard Zone. A PHZ is a planning zone established prior to a specific
   operation to assess risk should an accidental cold spill or unplanned release, or a hot spill
   catastrophic abort occur. The zones are based upon the worst-case credible emission rate or
   source strength for a specific operation. A PHZ may have a Zone 1, 2 or 3 for nitrogen
   tetroxide/nitrogen dioxide vapor (N2O4/N02) and hydrochloric (HCl) gas. A PHZ may have
   a Zone 2 or 3 for hydrazine-family propellants. Hot Spill coordinates are provided
   electronically or by FAX by 30 SW/SELF to the LST. The decision on whether or not to
   compute a PHZ will be made on a case-by-case basis by 30 SW/SE. The LST Chief
   maintains a generic base grid map, 1" = 3000' and a color map with overlays of the
   FHA/FCA. These maps are maintained at the fallback area.
   4.2. Toxic Hazard Zone. Toxic Hazard Zone is a generic term describing an area in which
   predicted concentration of propellant or toxic byproduct vapors or aerosols may exceed
   acceptable tier levels. Predictions are based on analyzing potential source strength,
   applicable exposure limit, and prevailing meteorological conditions. THZs are plotted for
   potential, planned and unplanned propellant releases, and launch operations.
   4.3. Radiological Hazard Corridor. For launch operations when a minor radioactive
   source is present, a Radiological Hazard Corridor will be established as determined by the
   Radiation Protection Officer (Bioenvironmental Engineer) and 30 SW/SEAL. If a corridor is
   required, this information will be provided to the LST Chief who will publish a Health
   Physics Addendum to the LSP.
   4.4. Hazard/Danger Area. During portions of pre-launch processing, certain tasks create
   potentially hazardous or dangerous conditions requiring evacuation of all nonessential
   personnel, and in some cases, all personnel from within the hazard/danger area. The size of
   this area depends on the potential hazard involved.
   4.5. Flight Hazard Area (FHA). The FHA, as defined in EWR 127-1/AFSPCMAN 91-
   710, is an area of potentially significant danger to personnel and equipment if a malfunction
   occurs during the early phase of launch vehicle flight. This restricted ground and air space
   extends to an unlimited altitude and includes the entire area where the risk of serious injury,
   death, or substantial property damage is so severe it is necessary to exclude all personnel and
   equipment not directly supporting the launch operation. The dimensions of the FHA will
   vary with the missile or space system involved. The applicable LSP will include the FHA for
   the particular launch operation. Use the FHA shown in the LSP for pre-launch planning
   purposes. The FHA, if required, may be enlarged using launch day atmospheric calculations.
   The FHA may be expanded, but never reduced from the LSP size without appropriate risk
   analysis by 30SW/SEL and LDA approval. Immediately relay any expansion of the FHA by
   the MFCO to the LST Chief to evaluate possible area control changes. The only personnel
   allowed inside the FHA will be those essential personnel inside a hardened shelter (i.e.,
18                                                                30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014


  Launch Operations Blockhouse (LOB). The number of personnel allowed within the
  hardened shelter (i.e., LOB) will not exceed the man loading of facility or the number for
  which a two hour supply of breathing air is available. The LSP may contain additional safety
  requirements.
  4.6. Flight Caution Area (FCA). The FCA, as defined in EWR 127-1/AFSPCMAN 91-
  710, is a hazardous launch area outside the FHA where injury or property damage could
  occur due to a missile flight failure. The area dimensions will vary with the missile or space
  system involved. The LSP will reflect the FCA for the particular launch operation and will
  be used for pre-launch planning purposes. The FCA, if required, may be enlarged using
  launch day wind calculations. The FCA may be expanded, but never reduced from the LSP
  size without appropriate risk analysis by 30SW/SEL and LDA approval. The LSP may
  contain additional safety requirements.
     4.6.1. The FCA is a restricted area, and only essential personnel are allowed to remain in
     the FCA during launch operations. All organizations will submit EAL requests to for
     essential personnel located within the FCA. Provide a launch support personnel EAL to
     the LST Chief NLT the LST Briefing. The cover letter (Attachment 3) and EAL
     (Attachment 2) must be in the approved electronic format. The EAL must include name,
     rank, location, and telephone number at T-0.
     4.6.2. When possible, all personnel within the FCA will be in hardened shelters;
     however, essential personnel may occupy other facilities at the discretion of 30 SW/SE,
     in coordination with Flight Analysis. This approval will only be granted after review of
     launch area analysis products available to the MFCO. In instances where a greater than
     reasonable risk is involved, coordination with the LDA will be necessary before launch.
  4.7. Additional FHA/FCA requirements:
     4.7.1. Access to and movement within the FHA/FCA will be granted during pre-launch
     and post-launch operations only when such actions are essential to the missile/space
     launch mission and will be under the direct control of the LST Chief and MFCO.
     4.7.2. The FHA and FCA will remain in effect until damage assessments and emergency
     actions are completed. Security Forces personnel, under control of the LST Chief and in
     coordination with the OSM, will control access. The primary concern is to protect life,
     and then to secure government assets. Launch anomalies or non-catastrophic mishaps
     will require securing the launch facility or Space Launch Complex (SLC) by the LST
     Chief, and establishing area control by Security Forces. After initial safety concerns are
     addressed, the LST Chief, in coordination with Security Forces and the OSM, may
     remove or adjust roadblocks as necessary for the specific hazardous condition noted
     during post-launch safing operations. Security concerns must be addressed before
     removing roadblocks.
     4.7.3. The LST is responsible for developing and maintaining an accurate headcount and
     location of all personnel inside the FHA/FCA. This information will be relayed to the
     EOC and the ISBP prior to launch and following a launch anomaly.
     4.7.4. All military or civil service personnel located inside or passing through the
     FHA/FCA during emergency egress will have either an Emergency Life Support
30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014                                                                       19


     Apparatus (ELSA) or Hooded Demand Valve (HDV) immediately available, as
     designated in the LSP.
  4.8. Impact Limit Line (ILL). The ILL, as defined in EWR 127-1/AFSPCMAN 91-710, is
  the outermost boundary for containment of missile debris or specified debris fragments from
  a launch anomaly. The is always constructed conservatively during the early launch
  planning phase so as to exclude nonessential personnel groupings to the maximum extent
  possible. Remaining personnel groups within the ILL, including Distinguished Visitors
  (DVs) and media representatives, require prior approval from the 30th SW/CC and are subject
  to limitations of numbers and locations during the planning cycle. Additionally, further
  review for risk management purposes and possible relocation may be required on launch day.
  Wind conditions may be such on launch day that population centers outside of the may
  likewise require risk management actions. Depending on the level of risk assessed, this may
  include off-base areas under memorandum of agreement with the base. Personnel within the
  ILL are strongly encouraged to have appropriate breathing apparatus (ELSA/HDV) for
  emergency evacuation purposes.
  4.9. Fallback Area. Fallback Areas are activated for all launches and static fire operations.
  During launch operations, fallback areas are restricted to mission essential personnel and
  equipment as authorized by the LST Chief. Site recovery and/or payload recovery teams will
  not be co-located with LST at the fallback area. Because of variable meteorological
  conditions, some fallback areas fall within the PHZ, and should an accident occur, might be
  within the toxic plume. The LST Chief directs all activities related to safe operations within
  the PHZ. Additionally, all military and civil service personnel assigned to emergency
  response teams will have appropriate breathing apparatus (ELSA/HDV) in their possession
  during launch countdown operations.
  4.10. Distinguished Visitor (DV), Media, and Public Viewing Areas:
     4.10.1. North Vandenberg: Ronald Reagan Viewing Area (Del Punta) is the DV, media,
     and public viewing area for Minuteman and Ground-Based Mid-Course Defense
     launches. For launches from SLC-2 and 576E, the launch viewing area will normally be
     located at the bleachers adjacent to the Vandenberg Weather Station, Bldg. 21150, off of
     Corral Rd.
     4.10.2. South Vandenberg: Bldg. 1521 (Rod & Gun Club). The DV and Media viewing
     area is located at Optical Site 45. Another commonly designated viewing site is the
     gravel pit (off Terra Rd.).
     4.10.3. Personnel departing the base main cantonment area for the purpose of observing
     missile and space launches must proceed to their designated observation site and may not
     congregate in undesignated areas or park on road shoulders. Whenever possible,
     personnel should view missile launches from official observation sites.
  4.11. Vehicles and Equipment Located in Launch Operations-Related Safety Control
  Areas (SCAs). To limit the risk of damage to government, contractor, and privately owned
  vehicles or high value equipment in launch operations-related SCAs to include the ILL,
  FHA, FCA, and Explosives Clear Zones, the following criteria applies:
     4.11.1. Government and Contractor Owned or Rented Vehicles. Government and
     contractor owned or rented vehicles directly supporting operations are authorized for use
 20                                                              30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014


      in SCAs. When practical, remove roadworthy non-essential vehicles and high value
      equipment from hazarded areas.
      4.11.2. Placarding of Unattended Vehicles. The intent of vehicle placarding is to inform
      Pad Safety, during area clearance, that no personnel are associated with the asset.
      Unattended government and contractor owned or rented vehicles will be identified to and
      approved by Pad Safety prior to the start of the operation. Each vehicle will display an
      approved placard identifying the owning organization and contact information.
      4.11.3. Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs). POVs are not authorized in launch
      operations-related safety clearance zones. POVs and other roadworthy vehicles found
      without an approved placard may be towed from the SCA at the direction of the LST
      Chief, with concurrence from the MFCO during launch/landing operations, or 30 SW/SE
      for all other SCA operations.
      4.11.4. Potential Hazard Zones (PHZs). Normally, any vehicle outside FHA, FCA, ILL,
      or other Hazard and Danger Areas but inside a PHZ will not require removal. However,
      if removal is deemed appropriate, 30 SW/SE concurrence is required prior to towing.
      4.11.5. Roadworthy equipment, especially high value equipment which can be easily and
      economically moved, should not be left in the FHA, FCA, ILL, or SCA. The owning unit
      will decide what equipment may or may not be moved within this category, and will be
      the sole responsibility and liability of the contractor or commander concerned. For all
      government launches, the contractor or commander will provide a hold harmless letter
      (attachment 11) accepting responsibility and liability of remaining equipment to 30
      SW/SEAP NLT 48 hours before launch operations commence.
      4.11.6. The presence of unauthorized (nonessential) vehicles in a SCA will be sufficient
      grounds to require a "NO GO" or safety hold until they can be removed, or until the
      requirement is waived according to procedures governing override of a Safety Hold.
      During launch operations, the SMFCO analyzes the situation and makes an action
      recommendation to the LDA for approval.
      4.11.7. Auxiliary locations. Non-mission essential launch team members, trainees,
      equipment, and associated augmentees who do not have a direct role in launch operations
      at T-0 will be positioned at auxiliary locations outside the ILL.
5. LST Actions During Launch Abort, Misfire, or Hangfire:
   5.1. The LST will remain in place ready to support an anomaly response based on direction
   of the IC and/or EOCD. Access to the launch pad/facility will be coordinated through the
   OSM and will be based on specific procedures for the launch system involved. Once the
   mishap site is determined safe and secure, and with IC/EOCD approval, the LST Chief will
   adjust or lift roadblocks as necessary and release the LST.
   5.2. The launch agency will coordinate an Anomaly Response Plan with the LST. This plan
   will be included in the LSP.
6. Briefings and Meetings:
   6.1. LST Briefing. Prior to each launch, 30 SW/SEAP presents a LST briefing. This
   briefing provides LST members and affected agencies with information regarding evacuation
   of safety control areas, EALs, a chronological order for LST safety actions,
30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014                                                                         21


  facilities/personnel locations inside the ILL, fire danger status, bio-environmental hazards,
  vehicle/payload hazards, and LST procedures for post-launch or abort contingencies. This
  briefing is co-chaired by the 30 SW Chief of Safety and 30 MSG Commander or their
  representatives.
  6.2. 30 SW/SE Pre-Brief to . This briefing is conducted by 30 SW/SE to cover mission
  unique safety requirements for each launch. This briefing may include booster/payload
  hazards, processing hazards, local hazard areas, launch control areas, railroad protection,
  Interim Safety Board and mishap investigative authority information.
  6.3. 30 SW Launch Readiness Review (LRR) and Pre-LRR Briefing. Prior to launch,
  wing organizations and the launch agency convene a readiness review for the LDA.
  Information briefed may include significant events, key personnel, and the location and
  number of personnel inside the FCA/FHA/ILL at T-0. The review may also include mission
  overview, major preparatory actions required and completed, significant problems identified,
  launch constraint parameters, a summary of range operations required to satisfy objectives,
  and/or items of significant interest. Briefing agencies (government and civilian) certify to the
  completion of preparatory and test order annex actions and readiness for launch.
  6.4. EOC Director’s Situational Awareness Briefing. Once the LST is formed at the
  fallback area and roadblocks have gone hard, the EOCD will receive a Situational Awareness
  Briefing on location at the fallback area. The briefing will cover countdown status; actual
  number of personnel stationed inside the FCA/FHA/ILL, personnel accountability worksheet,
  and updated toxic hazard zones when applicable. Following the situational awareness
  briefing, the EOCD will relocate to the EOC. The EOC is located at the 30 CES Readiness
  Facility, Bldg. 11165. The alternate EOC location is the Hot Shot Facility, Bldg. 860.

Entry Access List (EAL) Request and Cover Letters—The EAL request letter is submitted
from an organization to 30SW/SEAP to gain mission-essential personnel access inside the ILL
during the day of launch. The primary Air Force launch agency is responsible for the collation
and submission from both launch agency and launch support contractor EALs. The agency
submitting an EAL is responsible for ensuring all personnel listed are essential to the launch
operation. 30SW/SEAP will combine the submitted launch agency and range EALs to create the
final launch EAL. The EAL (Attachment 2) is created in Microsoft Excel format and consists
of each individual’s full name, rank/grade, location within the controlled area at T-0, and contact
information. EAL inputs will be submitted to the LST Chief NLT the LST Briefing. The EAL
and cover letter must be submitted in the approved electronic format. The cover letter will be
submitted 20 days prior to launch (Attachment 3) and will list the agency information in the
heading. The body of the letter will contain support locations within the ILL, the number of
support personnel, and contact information for each location.
Emission Hazard Zone (EHZ)—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
Explosives Clear Zone—A circular controlled surface area centered on the launcher or SLC.
The specific dimensions vary with each missile or space system.
Fallback Area—An area outside the launch vehicle FHA activated for all launches that contain
mission-essential personnel supporting the launch. During launch operations, fallback areas are
restricted to emergency response personnel (with required PPE) and equipment only. The
Fallback Area position for each LF or SLC is listed in the RSOR document.
Flight Caution Area (FCA)—The FCA is a controlled area outside the FHA where injury or
property damage could occur due to an in-flight launch vehicle failure. During launch operations
the FCA is restricted to mission-essential personnel equipped with an ELSA or HDV in their
immediate possession.
Flight Hazard Area (FHA)—The FHA is an area where significant danger to personnel and
equipment would exist in the event of a malfunction during early phases of launch vehicle flight.
The FHA includes the ground and air space extending to an unlimited altitude where the risk of
serious injury, death, or substantial property damage is so severe it necessitates exclusion of all
personnel and equipment not directly needed to support the launch operation. Personnel required
to be in the FHA during launch operations must be located in approved blast-hardened shelters
with adequate breathing protection.
Hang Fire—A condition that exists when the ignition signal is known to have reached an
initiator but ignition of the propulsion system is not achieved.
Hazard Area—A controlled area where hazardous operations or conditions exist. This area
normally extends to the affected LF or SLC perimeter fence. Examples of hazardous operations
include; igniter installation, fuel/oxidizer loading, destruct package installation, etc. Only
authorized essential personnel may enter the area during hazardous operations.
Hazard Period—The time period encompassing the time when a hazard area is activated.
Hardened Shelter—A facility is considered to be hardened when it is designed and constructed
to provide resistance to blast and fragment damage and, when applicable, protects personnel
 26                                                                 30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014


inside from blast overpressure. A hardened shelter does not provide protection from atmospheric
contamination. Personnel assigned to hardened shelters inside the FHA will be equipped with
auxiliary breathing air in sufficient quantity to ensure their survival in the event of a launch
mishap or fire.
Hot Spill—Release of toxic propellants through propellant combustion or liquid fuel system
catastrophic failure during launch operations.
Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH)—The current National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) definition for IDLH is “a condition that poses a threat
of exposure to airborne contaminants when that exposure is likely to cause death or immediate or
delayed permanent adverse health effects or prevent escape from such an environment.” The
level of exposure for the IDLH “is to ensure the worker can escape from a given contaminated
environment in the event of a failure of the respiratory protection equipment.” The effects at
these levels are based on an exposure time of 30 minutes to add a safety margin. However,
workers should not stay in the environment any longer than necessary. Evacuation should take
place immediately.
Impact Limit Line (ILL)—The line defining a limit beyond where a hazardous launch vehicle
and/or payload debris shall not be allowed to impact. The ILL may be adjusted on the day of
launch to account for wind/weather conditions. Only mission-essential personnel listed on the
EAL are allowed inside the ILL. Nonessential personnel desiring access to the ILL require prior
approval from the 30th SW Commander.
Incident Commander (IC)—Following a catastrophic event, the Fire Chief assigned to the LST
at the fallback area becomes the IC and directs all immediate emergency actions in response to
the event. The IC maintains situational control until relieved by the EOCD.
Launch Agency—Any organization conducting launch activities on Vandenberg Air Force
Base.
Launch Anomaly Resolution Team—A team of technicians and advisors pre-positioned for
rapid response to launch anomalies and malfunctions. This team, under the direction of 576
FLTS/TEA, conducts on-site investigations of anomalies for 576 FLTS launches.
Launch—Essential Personnel—The minimum number of persons necessary to successfully and
safely complete a hazardous or launch operation and whose absence would jeopardize the
completion of the operation; this designation also includes people required to perform emergency
actions according to authorized directives, persons specifically authorized by the Space Wing
Commanders to perform scheduled activities, and those personnel in training; the Range Users
and Space Wing Commanders jointly determine, with Range Safety concurrence, the number of
launch-essential personnel allowed within safety clearance zones or hazardous launch areas.
Launch Decision Authority (LDA)—The individual vested with the authority to authorize
launch from Vandenberg AFB. Normally this is the 30 SW Commander or designated
individual.
Launch Support Team (LST)—The LST, under the direction of 30 SW/SEAP, is a multi-
discipline team of trained technical personnel pre-positioned to control the ILL and provide rapid
response to emergencies and site recovery during missile or space launch operations.          The
initial reaction of the LST following a catastrophic anomaly is to verify the survivability of all
30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014                                                                          27


personnel within the ILL and to direct evacuation of manned locations and the fallback area (if
required). The LST Chief will then assist the EOCD as necessary and assume the role as the
EOC’s on-scene safety representative.
Launch Support Team Chief—The LST Chief is responsible for preparing and coordinating
the LST Briefing, creating the LSP, and coordinating the EAL while providing overall LST
leadership during pre-launch and launch operations. On day of launch, the LST Chief directs pre-
and post-launch activities to ensure key personnel and equipment are in place and ready to
support the mission and ensures area safety by validating the launch site, FHA, FCA, and ILL
areas are clear of all nonessential personnel prior to launch.
Misfire—A condition where a known ignition signal was sent but not received at the initiator.
Mission—Essential Personnel—See Launch-Essential Personnel.
Mission Flight Control Officer (MFCO)—The MFCO is responsible for overall launch hazard
assessment, determines safety readiness to support the launch, and monitors Flight Termination
System checkout procedures. The MFCO monitors in-flight launch vehicle performance and
initiates flight termination actions when the launch vehicle violates flight safety criteria. The
MFCO, with the Senior MFCO’s concurrence, provides the safety readiness GO/NO-GO
decision to the Range Operations Commander.
Nonessential Personnel—Personnel not required for successful completion of a specific
operation or personnel who do not meet the criteria for mission-essential or essential personnel.
Operations Safety Manager (OSM)—The OSM, in coordination with the LST, is responsible
for ensuring the FHA and FCA are clear for launch. The OSM is also responsible for site safety
and reports site safety status as appropriate. The OSM controls site aural/visual warning devices,
status and alert lights, and has control availability of pad video. The OSM is responsible for
SLC/LF safety aspects to include countdown, pad clearing, and post-launch/anomaly re-entry.
Operations Safety Technician (OST)—During the launch or static fire cycle, the OST is the
designated individual appointed to assist the OSM with site clearance and the LST with ILL
clearance. The OST ensures safety functions are accomplished during pre- and post-launch
activities.
Payload Recovery Team (PRT)—The PRT’s basic function is to locate and secure the payload
following a launch anomaly resulting in land impact. At the direction of the 30 SW/CC, the PRT
may be co-located at the fallback area with the LST for immediate response to a catastrophic
launch anomaly. During emergency response, the PRT will follow direction from the IC.
Equipment/debris will not be moved without approval from the ISBP or Safety Investigation
Board President.
Potential Hazard Zone (PHZ)—The PHZ is a safety zone established prior to a specific
operation to minimize risk in the event of an accidental cold spill or unplanned release, or a hot
spill from a catastrophic abort. The zones are based upon the worst-case credible emission rate
or source strength for a specific operation.
Radiological Hazard Corridor—A corridor/area established encompassing all known or
suspected radiological contamination.
Range Operations Commander (ROC)—The ROC is the senior WR representative for launch
operations and serves as the liaison between the launch agency and the WR. The ROC manages,
 28                                                                 30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014


directs, and controls WR resources, ensuring all instrumentation is capable and ready to support
all phases of launch operations. This includes WR instrumentation support, contingency support
requirements, aircraft and seacraft support, and support by off-range assets. The ROC certifies
WR readiness and provides the launch agency with the final overall WR GO/NO-GO
recommendation.
Range Safety Operations Requirements (RSOR)—The RSOR describes the 30th Space
Wing’s Range Safety requirements for protecting the public, recovery personnel, and supporting
operations on the Western Range.
Safety Control Areas (SCA)—SCAs are areas under the control of the LST/OSM with
assistance from the OST and Security Forces during missile build-up, hazardous operations,
static fire, and pre- and post-launch activities. These areas include the LFs, SLCs, FHA, FCA,
ILL, RHC, Flight Line, Fallback Areas, Danger and Hazard Areas, and Explosives Clear Zones.
Safety Hold—A directive to either prevent an operation from starting, or stopping an operation
already underway. Safety holds may be called if safety criteria cannot be assured or maintained,
safety criteria is jeopardized, or an imminently dangerous situation exists. As necessary, the
Launch Director will react to verbal inputs from the OSM or MFCO to enter a hold or prevent
launch.
Tier 1—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
Tier 2—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
Tier 3—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ)—A generic term used to describe an area where predicted
concentration of propellant or toxic byproduct vapors or aerosols may exceed acceptable
exposure concentrations. THZs are expressed as Tier 3, 2, or 1 with Tier 3 representing higher
concentrations and Tier 1 the lowest. Plume predictions are based on an analysis of potential
source strength, applicable human exposure limit, and prevailing meteorological conditions.
THZs are plotted for potential planned and unplanned propellant releases and launch operations.
THZs are referred to as Operational Hazard Zones (OHZs), Potential Hazard Zones (PHZs), and
Emission Hazard Zones (EHZs). Refer to 30 SWI 91-106 for additional information.
      Potential Hazard Zone (PHZ)—A planning zone established prior to a specific operation
      to assess risk of an accidental cold spill or unplanned release, or if a hot spill from a
      catastrophic launch abort should occur. The zones are based upon the worst-case credible
      emission rate or source strength for a specific operation.
      Zone 3—An area where the airborne concentrations of any toxic product range from a low
      defined by Tier 3 to an unknown high. This zone can result from either a hot or cold spill.
      Tier 3—An airborne exposure level (maximum concentration) based on the NIOSH IDLH
      values. Tier 3 separates Zone 3 from Zone 2.
      Zone 2—An area where airborne concentrations of any toxic product are equal to or
      exceed Tier 2 levels but are less than Tier 3 levels. This zone can result from either a hot
      or cold spill.
      Tier 2—An airborne exposure level (maximum concentration) that may cause short-term
      symptoms most individuals could endure without experiencing or developing irreversible
30SWI91-101 7 MAY 2014                                                                          29


      or other serious health effects or symptoms or could impair their ability to take protective
      action. Tier 2 separates Zone 2 from Zone 1.
      Zone 1—An area where airborne concentration of any toxic product equals or exceeds
      Tier 1 levels but are less than Tier 2 levels. This zone can result from either a hot or cold
      spill.
      Tier 1—An airborne exposure level (maximum concentration) posing no hazard to the
      general population but which may affect certain sensitive individuals (e.g., asthmatics,
      individuals with emphysema, and other lung-diseased people). Tier 1 separates Zone 1
      from the area where no controls are required.
      Operational Hazard Zone (OHZ)—The toxic hazard zone established following an
      accidental cold spill, unplanned release, nominal launch, or catastrophic launch abort,
      based upon actual or worst-case credible source strength. Zones 1, 2, and 3 are
      established for an OHZ as appropriate.
      Emission Hazard Zone (EHZ)—The toxic hazard zone established before a planned
      release of propellants into the atmosphere; e.g., propellant tank venting, scrubber venting,
      or Hydrogen Chloride release from solid propellant combustion during nominal launch
      operations. An EHZ is based upon the worst-case credible rate or source strength.
Zone 1—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
Zone 2—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
Zone 3—See Toxic Hazard Zone (THZ) for related definitions.
