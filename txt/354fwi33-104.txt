1. General Information:
     1.1. This Instruction provides guidance for all personnel using the 354th Fighter Wing Video
     Teleconferencing (VTC) suite and procedures for coordinating the use of RED FLAG-Alaska
     (RF-A) and Airman and Family Readiness Center (AFRC) VTC suites. These facilities
     provide support to the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and Pacific Command (PACOM) area of
     operations, around the clock VTC capability for real-world contingencies, command and
     control exercises and official duty requirements. In order to provide that service, cooperation
     and accurate information is required from all customers. These procedures were developed
     to ensure the necessary information is collected to prepare for each VTC event.
     1.2. The 354th Fighter Wing video conferencing systems, consisting of FW, RF-A and
     ARFC VTC suites, can provide support for the following types of mission up to classification
     SECRET (FW and RF-A only) by adhering to strict coordination procedures through the
     facilitators and schedulers:
        1.2.1. Support disaster relief operations.
        1.2.2. Allow briefings to and from high-level military and government officials.
        1.2.3. Increase participation in technical meetings and possible reduction in travel funds.
        1.2.4. Host and participate in regularly scheduled meetings.
        1.2.5. Attend and conduct conferences that could not be economically justified to attend
        in person.
        1.2.6. Train geographically separate or isolated forces.
        1.2.7. Conduct program management reviews.
        1.2.8. Morale conferences for deployed members and their families.
     1.3. The 354 FW VTC suite is available to Eielson AFB personnel and PACAF Numbered
     Air Force users with prior scheduling and only for official duty. RF-A VTC is available for
     use when not being utilized for RED FLAG Exercise or 18 Aggressor ACMI playback
     support. AFRC VTC suites are available for official use, as well as personal use of deployed
     members and their families.
2. Scheduling participation in a VTC:
     2.1. Most VTCs at Eielson AFB are downward directed. In the event an Eielson AFB
     customer needs to be the host for a VTC, please refer to paragraph 3 for hosting instructions.
     Normal procedures for scheduling participation in a VTC at Eielson AFB are as follows:
        2.1.1. The customer must request the use of a secure or non-secure VTC suite from the
        VTC manager. Send request to the following:
                 354 CS/SCOKP
                 Attn: VTC Manager
                 354 Broadway, Suite B-60
                 Eielson AFB AK 99702
                 DSN: 317-377-2117
                 Comm: (907) 377-2117
                 E-mail: 354cs.vtc@eielson.af.mil
   354FWI33-104 5 AUGUST 2010                                                                       3


           2.1.2. The VTC manager verifies the availability of the 354 FW VTC suite and, if
           available, reserves the timeframe for the customer. If the 354 FW VTC suite is
           unavailable, the VTC manager will coordinate with RF-A and/or AFRC to schedule the
           use of their VTC suites.
           2.1.3. The VTC manager will notify the customer which VTC suite will be used and the
           appropriate VTC site information.
           2.1.4. The participant will provide the host unit/base VTC manager with the appropriate
           site information of the VTC suite being used.
           2.1.5. For VTCs requiring secure connection, the key to the KIV-7 Encryption Module
           will be signed out to a member with a minimum of a Secret security clearance of the
           participating unit. No personnel without a current security clearance of Secret or higher
           are authorized to sign for the key. Instructions for dialing a secure connection are in
           attachment 1. The member must report to the VTC manager in Amber Hall, room B-60,
           NLT 45 minutes prior to the start of the VTC (1 hour if a general officer is involved) to
           sign for the key. The member must maintain positive control of the key at all times and
           return it to the VTC manager within 2 duty hours of completion of the VTC. The
           participating unit is responsible for providing the VTC manager an access list signed by
           their unit security officer of personnel taking part in the VTC to verify the proper
           clearance is held by all participants.
NOTE: 354 CS VTC Manager reserves the right to cancel events scheduled for the 354 FW VTC
suite to support General Officer or SES level meetings. This rarely happens but please be advised
that it is possible. The VTC Manager will work with the POC and the other VTC suites to
reschedule the event in another suite, when available.

RF-A facilitators will link all secure VTCs.

   3. Hosting a VTC:
       3.1. The customer must request the use of a secure or non-secure VTC suite from the VTC
       manager as far in advance as possible. Send request to the following:
             354 CS/SCOKP
             Attn: VTC Manager
             354 Broadway, Suite B-60
             Eielson AFB AK 99702
             DSN: 317-377-2117
             Comm: (907) 377-2117
             E-mail: 354cs.vtc@eielson.af.mil
       3.2. The customer will provide the VTC manager with the date, time, participants’ names
       and ranks, and the VTC desired, utilizing the worksheet at attachment 2.
       3.3. The VTC manager will coordinate with the VTC managers of the participating locations
       to ensure scheduling is accomplished.
       3.4. The VTC manager will notify the customer when/where the VTC has been scheduled
       within 3 duty days.
 4                                                              354FWI33-104 5 AUGUST 2010


     3.5. For hosting VTCs requiring secure connection, the key to the KIV-7 Encryption Module
     will be signed out to a member with a minimum of a Secret clearance with the participating
     unit. The participating unit is responsible for providing the VTC manager an access list
     signed by their unit security officer of personnel signing for the CIK key to verify the proper
     clearance is held. No other personnel are authorized to sign for the key. Instructions for
     dialing a secure connection are in attachment 2. The member of the hosting unit must report
     to the VTC manager in Amber Hall, room B-60, NLT 45 minutes prior to the start of the
     VTC (one hour if a general officer is involved) to sign for the key. The member must
     maintain positive control of the key at all times and return it to the VTC manager within 2
     duty hours of completion of the VTC.
4. Changes/Cancellations.
     4.1. Changes to the scheduled VTC will be requested 48 hours in advance of the scheduled
     time. Send changes to the VTC manager organizational email account (see paragraph 2.1.1.
     or 3.1.). For any change requested within 24 hours prior to the scheduled VTC, the
     participant notifies the VTC manager. The VTC manager will submit the request to the VTC
     host for approval/coordination. If the change cannot be accommodated the VTC manager
     will notify the participants immediately.
     4.2. Cancellation of a scheduled VTC will be requested at least 24 hours in advance of the
     scheduled time. Failure to inform the VTC manager of a cancellation will result in wasting
     valuable air time. Send cancellation requests to the VTC manager’s organizational email
     account. If scheduled time is less than 24 hours, notify the VTC manager verbally at 377-
     2117.
5. VTC Participation.
     5.1. Two days prior to event, customer will contact the VTC manager to ensure there are no
     conflicts that have occurred since confirming original request.
     5.2. No later than 45 minutes prior to the start of the VTC (1 hour if a general officer is
     involved), the customer will sign for the room key, conduct the setup procedure checklist
     (located in suite or attachment 3) and KIV-7 key (if necessary) from the VTC manager in
     Amber Hall, room B-60. The customer will be responsible for opening the VTC suite room
     and testing the VTC system.
     5.3. No later than fifteen minutes prior to the start time, the customer will dial the phone
     number provided to initiate the VTC session and perform a communications and video check
     with the distant end to ensure the system is working properly.
     5.4. Once the VTC is started, the customer will contact the appropriate work centers if any
     problems develop. The work center contact information is on the assigned setup procedure
     checklist. If the work centers do not respond, the customer will contact the VTC manager.
     5.5. When the VTC is finished, the customer will disconnect or “hang up” the VTC call,
     clean the VTC suite room and ensure the door to the room is secure. See attachment 1 for
     detailed instruction.
     5.6. The customer will return the room key, setup procedure checklist and KIV-7 key to the
     VTC manager following completion of the scheduled VTC. The customer will return all
     keys to the VTC manager within 2 duty hours of completion of the VTC.
354FWI33-104 5 AUGUST 2010                                                                       5

   instructions for system set up according to the type of presentation to be presented.
   8.2. Video-conferencing can be “point-to-point” between two sites or “multi-point” joining
   up to 20 sites on a voice-activated bridge. When a VTC consists of more than two
   participants, the location that is talking will be displayed on the VTC system.
   8.3. The system uses three Basic Rate Interface Integrated Service Digital Network circuits
   operating at 128 KBps for a combined bandwidth of 384 KBps. The phone numbers
   associated with the VTC are setup as a high priority to keep the lines connected and give
   them priority to make a call. These circuits currently run through the switch here at Eielson
   AFB to the switch at Elmendorf AFB and then through Hickam AFB.
   8.4. Room set-up for classified:
      8.4.1. Before personnel can participate in a classified briefing, they must make sure
      appropriate classification signs are on the front of the door prior to start of the briefing.
      While previewing a classified briefing ensure all doors are closed and locked so the
      material will not be compromised to unauthorized personnel. Beepers, personal digital
      assistants (PDA), cell phones and radios are not allowed in the briefing room during a
      classified briefing.

Next press the Green call button on the remote control.




Dial the number given through the DISN website using the number pad on the remote. Dial the
straight number with no spaces unless otherwise instructed.

Press the Green Call button again. A message stating “calling…” will appear. After a few seconds
the system will state “negotiating…”. When the letters “MCU” appear on the title bar the system
is connected.

Perform an Audio/Visual check to confirm connection with distant end sites. State “Good
morning/evening, this is Eielson doing an audio/visual check”. The host will respond in kind if the
system is working properly.

Await participants to arrive and instruct them on how to operate the remote control. This is the
only device they will need during the VTC. The only button the customer needs to know about is
the “MUTE” button. It’s the yellow button.




Note: If the blinking microphone is visible in the top right hand corner of the screen then your
side of the VTC is not audible to the other participating sites. If it is not blinking then the other
sites can hear every word you say.

Step 3: Disconnecting
Once the customer is done and the conference is over, disconnect by pressing the red “Cancel”
button. A message will display stating “Call Cleared” or “Disconnected”.




After the disconnected message is displayed set the Tandberg to standby by pressing the “Cancel”
button. Press it again and the camera will turn to the right and go into sleep mode.
Turn off monitors.

Troubleshooting an Unclassified Call
If you receive an error that states “the call was rejected” make sure you have the correct number
and redial.

If the dial number is correct make sure you are dialing in at the appropriate time. DSVG Pearl
Harbor will not allow you to dial in more than 30 minutes ahead of time.

If still unable to dial the VTC call the conference owner (PACAF) and let them know you are
having difficulty dialing in to their conference.

Call DSVG Pearl Harbor and inform them of the difficulty and they will troubleshot with you step-
by-step or give you an alternate number to dial.

NOTE: Sometimes mishaps occur such as phone line being cut or power outages. These are
beyond your control. Let the customer know there is nothing you can do at this point until systems
are back up and running. Inform PACAF there is/was an outage.
