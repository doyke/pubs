       specific FOD within their areas.
   1.4. Wing Safety: Assist in the FOD incident investigations.
2. Specific FOD Prevention Practices: The major sources of foreign objects are poor
housekeeping and poor work habits. Loose objects resulting from either source are capable of
causing catastrophic damage to aircraft, and/or loss of life. In addition to the FOD prevention
practices listed in AFI 21-101 AFRC Sup1, the following procedures will be followed:
   2.1. Local policy on wear of hats on the flightline: No hats are authorized for wear on the
   flightline except as noted in this paragraph. Tight fitting knit caps may be worn during
   extreme cold weather. If hats are worn within 25 feet in front of or 250 feet to the rear of an
   operating engine they must be secured by ear muffs, chin strap, or a communication style
   headset. The Niagara Falls Flightline is defined as all surfaces (aircraft parking ramps,
   taxiway and runways) south of the fence surrounding the airfield to include the maintenance
   hangar approaches.
   2.2. Units must continuously assess themselves for sources of foreign objects to include
   housekeeping and work habits.
   2.3. Wearing of loose clothing, to include USAF Restricted Area Badges when performing
   intake/inlet/exhaust inspections is prohibited.
   2.4. All personnel will take actions to preclude foreign object entrapment during assembly
   sequencing, maintenance, and/or manufacturing. After completing work inside a panel,
   personnel will immediately clean the area to include wiping out and or vacuuming the area if
   required prior to closing the panel.
   2.5. Throttle quadrant covers must be installed when maintenance is performed in the
   throttle quadrant area, unless movement of the throttles / condition levers is required. When
   this is the case, every effort will be made to cover unused areas of the throttle quadrant to
   prevent entrance of foreign objects.
3. FOD Prevention Walks.
   3.1. Flightline FOD prevention will be comprised of squadron/flight using the Dual FOD
   Boss sweeper weekly in conjunction with mandatory weekly FOD walks. Due to weather
   restrictions, the weekly FOD Boss requirement will be suspended during the months of
   November thru March, unless commander directed to do under special circumstances.
   Weekly FOD walks will be conducted on Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends (when
   commanders determine time is available) and once during the week. The Maintenance
   Officer will make the determination to cancel and reschedule the FOD walks in case of
 4                                             NIAGARAFALLSARSI 21-114 18 JULY 2012

       discovery will notify the Engine Shop Supervisor, who will notify the MOC. The MOC
       will then notify Quality Assurance.
       6.1.4. If FOD or suspected FOD is found in the AGE (aerospace ground equipment) shop
       the individual making the discovery will notify the AGE Shop Supervisor, who will
       notify the MOC. The MOC will then notify QA. Each incident will be reported to the
       Wing FOD Monitor in QA within 24 hrs of the incident. Initial reports may be via
       phone, email, or Fax.
   6.2. The MXG/QA will ensure that all FOD incident reports are submitted to MAJCOM.
7. FOD Prevention Committee Meetings. This is a forum for senior leaders and FOD
monitors to review the AW FOD prevention successes, incidents, and statistics. It also is an
opportunity to formulate new ideas to improve the AW FOD prevention efforts.

8. FOD Fighter Program
     8.1. The intent of the ―FOD Fighter of the Quarter‖ program is to increase foreign object
     damage awareness within the installation. The winner will be recognized at the quarterly
     FOD prevention meeting.
     8.2. Throughout the quarter, each squadron/flight FOD representative will have members of
     their squadron/flight submit foreign objects discovered accompanied by a brief description of
     the circumstances surrounding their discovery. Individuals developing a procedure or a
     process that reduces FOD potential or increases awareness are also eligible for nomination.
     8.3. The Wing FOD monitor will then choose the quarterly winner.
     8.4. Benefits of the program are immediate exposure of the FOD program within the
     installation among all agencies with flightline operations while increasing awareness and
     decreasing potential damage. The program also reinforces basic FOD prevention practices
     driven home during technical training and eliminates the risk of unintentional FOD.
