SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revision
changes Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) to Emergency Management (EM) and Chemical
Biological Radiological Nuclear High Yield Explosive (CBRNE) to Chemical Biological
Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) throughout publication.
1. General Information. Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) provides
funding for the purchase of CBRN equipment and supplies. These funds are administered under
PEC 55166, and are managed by the 944 CES Emergency Management (944 CES/CEX) flight.
 2                                                                 944FWI10-202 7 JUNE 2011


The 944 CBRN working group determines what equipment or supplies are needed and this
information is submitted to HQ AFRC/CEXR. Based on those requirements, funds are then
flowed to the unit for purchase of items.
2. CBRN Working Group. The working group is the key to the success of the program. This
group is made up, as a minimum, of the 944 LRS/LGRM Air Reserve Technician (ART), and the
EM ART. Other members may include representatives from EOD and 944 LRS/LGRR. CBRN
working group will meet at least twice per year, in November to establish the annual budget
requirements and then again in July. The EM ART will schedule the meetings, establish the
agenda (Attachment 2), and distribute the meeting minutes. Note: Ensure everyone attending
sign-in for minute’s distribution.
     2.1. Group Mandate. The prime function of the group is to determine CBRN equipment and
     supply needs to meet mobility and training requirements. Prior to meeting, the group
     members will review their needs and be ready to present those needs and associated costs at
     the meeting. Once a consensus on needs is achieved, the listing will be prioritized and given
     to the 944 FW Finance (944 FW/FM) for review. After review, the listing will be given to
     the EM ART, who will transfer the requirements to the AFRC spreadsheet and forward it to
     HQ AFRC/CEXR for review and approval. Copies of the spreadsheet will be forwarded to
     EM ART and LRS/LGRM so they can forward copies to their counterparts at 10th Air Force
     (10 AF) and AFRC. 944 FW/FM adds the CBRN/PEC 55166 requirements to the wing’s
     annual Financial Plan and Operations and Maintenance Unfunded Request listing and
     forwards to 10 AF and AFRC Finance (AFRC/FM), as requested.
3. Ordering Steps. When AFRC grants funding authority, the approved purchase listing will be
returned to the EM ART and the ordering process can begin. Funds may not be present at the
time of approval; however, funds must be loaded and available before documents are processed.
The two key areas, LRS Materiel Management and EM may begin procuring the items via the
appropriate method.
     3.1. Supply Account:
        3.1.1. AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request.
        3.1.2. CAM/SBSS Interface.
     3.2. Local Purchase:
        3.2.1. AF Form 9, Request for Purchase.
        3.2.2. Government Purchase Card (GPC).
     3.3. Items below the $2,500 threshold and approved for purchase using the GPC will be
     requested using a 944 FW Form 5, Government-Wide Purchase Card Request and Checklist,
     submitted to the authorized GPC cardholder for PEC 55166 program.
