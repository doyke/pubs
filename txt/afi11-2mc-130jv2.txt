examinee on the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable
evaluation criteria, prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning.
If an Operations Planning Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning,
the examinee is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning
paperwork. Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission
folders, and any additional items they deem necessary.
     1.7.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
     to initial/requalification evaluations.
     1.7.2. Unless requested by examinee and approved by squadron supervision, the examinee
     will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation.
     1.7.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
     but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
     1.7.4. Under no circumstances will a pilot flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow to below
     one engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca), regardless of airspeed tolerances
     listed for specific areas.
     1.7.5. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
     critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations,
     area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
1.8. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Vol 2,
as supplemented and this volume. Examiners will use the criteria contained in this volume to
accomplish all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and
objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
criteria.
     1.8.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
     (Q/Q/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
        1.8.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
        knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
        1.8.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
        Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or
        jeopardize flight safety.
        1.8.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
        parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected
        mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
        area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of
        the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s
        performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief
        the examinee.
     1.8.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
     member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
     receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
AFI11-2MC-130JV2 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                   7


   also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by (Critical) in the area title and by shading
   of the Q- block on the appropriate AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet.
1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crew members are contained in Tables 2.1 and 4.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1.
Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew
specific chapter defines required events. Evaluation methods are identified by notes in the crew
specific tables and include: in-flight only; in-flight and/or in simulator (see Paragraph 1.8.1);
and in-flight and/or alternate methods (see Paragraph 1.8.2). For areas without a note, flight
examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are not observed, then
the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.
   1.9.1. Simulator. Weapon System Trainers (WST) with a C or greater certification (or
   Training Value Code of 3 or greater) for all areas evaluated as determined by simulator
   certification may be used to accomplish evaluations. Simulator certifications will be located
   at the AFSOC/A3T website. Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the simulator.
   (Exception: Instrument (INSTM) evaluations). Initial mission and special qualification
   evaluations must be accomplished in the aircraft.
       1.9.1.1. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in-flight, and the event is
       certified for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to
       complete the evaluation.      Document in the comments section of AF Form 8/8a,
       Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, which portion(s) of evaluation were conducted in
       the simulator.
   1.9.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in-flight due to
   equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, the
   area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., procedural trainer or verbal examination).
   If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate
   method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
   1.9.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
   grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when
   the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner
   judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative
   deviations when determining the overall grade.
       1.9.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
       aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee
       applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety.
1.10. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the
examiner’s Flight Duty Period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules
maximum FDP for an un-augmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must assume the
examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels the
examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the
examinee’s duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties, assign a
Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.

     1.10.1. Evaluators      must     report     deviations/discrepancies     from      established
     procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to squadron
     or group commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action, IAW
     AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and MAJCOM supplement.
1.11. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training,
at their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and
MAJCOM supplement. Any approved training device or medium may be used.
     1.11.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation,
     provided the unique situation presents a valuable training opportunity (i.e., crosswind
     landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3
     evaluation. This option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The
     examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.12. Rechecks. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the
one who administered the original evaluation.
1.13. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that
are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations may be
conducted separately or in conjunction with the qualification/mission evaluations. After
qualification, areas can be graded as part of periodic Mission Evals. There are no requisites for
special qualification evaluations unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew position for any
special qualification evaluation requirements.
     1.13.1. Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8/8a. Document IAW AFI 11-202, Vol
     2, as SPOT evaluations. Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew members
     qualified, this documentation is still required due to interfly and permanent change of station
     issues.
1.14. Multiple Qualification. MC-130J basic/mission qualified aircrew can accomplish
MC130J qual/mission events IAW AFI-11-2MC-130J, Vol 1 or equivalent, minus any
restrictions on their AF Form 8 on any EC-130J (non-Commando Solo) or C-130J aircraft; a
separate mission evaluation is not required. See AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol 1, Aircrew Training (or
equivalent), for difference training and currency requirements for multi-qualified aircrew.

                                    ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions
and all evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required
duties safely and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW
applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.
2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1 and applicable
areas in Table 4.1 and tables defined for individual crew positions in subsequent chapters.
   2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
   as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and applicable supplements.
   2.2.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). An EPE is a requisite for all
   Qualification (QUAL) and Mission (MSN) evaluations except special mission evaluations.
   EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined
   by the examiner or unit stan/eval. OGVs may develop EPE guides for each crew position for
   flight examiner use. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew
   position. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s qualification and
   experience level. Examiners should include other general knowledge areas as well. For
   mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations. EPEs will include
   sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the examinee’s knowledge of systems
   and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.
       2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
       examinee must recite all boldface items from memory and should provide the initial steps
       of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time for
       reference.
       2.2.2.2. Grading criteria for EPE are outlined in area 5 of General Grading Areas.
   2.2.3. Publications Check. Required for all QUAL or combined QUAL/Mission
   evaluations as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas.
   2.2.4. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290,
   Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, crew resource management skills
   will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all
   phases of flight; therefore, no specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are imbedded
   within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew
   coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task management, and
   briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills
   Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for
   evaluations.
   2.2.5. Formal Course Evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated for the type of
   evaluation flown, IAW guidance in this volume. Grade training objectives and related areas
   using the performance criteria in this volume.
 10                                                      AFI11-2MC-130JV2 20 AUGUST 2013


   2.2.6. Air Education Training Command (AETC). AETC instructors are considered
   qualified in both the HC-130J Rescue Squadron (RQS) and MC-130J Special Operations
   Forces (SOF) missions once they have completed the 58th Special Operations Wing (SOW)
   differences training program. Therefore, a QUAL and MSN evaluation in one aircraft counts
   as qualification in the other aircraft.
   2.2.7. 14th Weapons Squadron. For the purposes of eligibility to attend the MC-130
   Weapons Instructor Course, HC-130J (RQS) pilot and Combat Systems Officer (CSO)
   instructors are considered qualified in both the HC-130J RQS and MC-130J SOF missions
   (except formation) once they have completed a MAJCOM-approved differences training
   program.

                             PILOT/COPILOT EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. All pilots and copilots require an INSTM and QUAL evaluation. MSN qualified
pilots/copilots require a separate MSN evaluation. Copilots will be evaluated to the same area
standards as pilots unless specified otherwise. Copilot crew coordination will not include duties
and responsibilities expected of an aircraft commander. Instructors will demonstrate instructor
duties on all periodic evaluations.
5.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for general, Chapter 3 for instructor, and Chapter 4
for common grading areas and criteria. Pilot/copilot required areas and criteria follow in this
chapter.
5.3. Instrument. See Table 5.1 for required INSTM evaluation areas. Requisites (prerequisites
for initial/requalification evaluations) include Instrument examination. The INSTM evaluation
will be conducted in-flight or in a WST.
   5.3.1. The evaluation profile will include: one precision approach; one non-precision
   approach; one Category (CAT) II approach (if qualified); holding or procedure turn; circling
   pattern (traffic and weather permitting); missed approach; and simulated engine-out
   instrument approach. Do not combine the precision and CAT II approaches. One of the
   approaches will be flown without use of the autopilot and autothrottles. Initial CAT II
   qualification evaluations require an approach to a missed approach and an approach to a
   landing. CAT II procedures may be evaluated on a CAT I approach in VMC conditions only.
   5.3.2. Initial/Requalification. Individuals with an Instrument Qualification on any C130J
   variant are considered instrument qualified on any other C-130J variant after completion of
   appropriate differences training.
   5.3.3. Periodic. Evaluations may be conducted on any C-130J variant, if the examinee is
   qualified/difference trained in the aircraft.
5.4. Qualification. See Tables 4.1 and 5.1 for required QUAL evaluation areas. Requisites
(prerequisites for initial/requalification evaluations) include Qualification Open and Closed Book
examinations (or Formal School End-of-Course examinations), EPE, and boldface examination.
This evaluation is normally accomplished in combination with an instrument evaluation. The
QUAL evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in a WST.
   5.4.1. The evaluation profile will include: Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern; 100%, 50%,
   and 0% flap landing (conditions permitting, aircraft commanders/first pilots/instructors
   should accomplish 0% flap landings); touch-and-go procedures; simulated engine-out go-
   around, and simulated engine-out landing. FPs should accomplish a maximum effort take-off
   and landing in order to maintain this qualification. Document this portion of the evaluation in
   the remarks section of AF Form 8.
   5.4.2. Initial/Requalification. Individuals with an Instrument Qualification on a C-130J
   variant may perform tasks associated with that instrument qualification on any other C-130J
   variant after completion of differences training.

   5.4.3. Periodic. Evaluations may be conducted on any C-130J variant, if the examinee is
   qualified/difference trained in the aircraft.
       5.4.3.1. Copilot. Evaluate appropriate areas from the right seat.
       5.4.3.2. First pilot. Evaluate appropriate areas from the left seat.
       5.4.3.3. Aircraft commander. Evaluate appropriate areas from the left seat.
5.5. Mission. See Tables 4.1 and 5.2 for MSN evaluation areas and subparagraph below for
requirements. Requisites (prerequisites for initial/requalification evaluations) include Mission
Open and Closed Book examinations and EPE.
   5.5.1. Initial/Requalification. The evaluation profile will include NVG low-level,
   HAAR/TAAR (see Paragraph 5.5.5), formation, and AAR (see Paragraph 5.5.4). The
   following areas will also be evaluated:
       5.5.1.1. Formation will include NVG HAAR/TAAR option one/two (actual) and
       formation airdrop (actual or simulated). Minimum interval landing is preferred, but not
       required; if not observed in-flight, it will be evaluated through an alternate method (e.g.,
       ground evaluation on procedures).
       5.5.1.2. HAAR/TAAR lost contact/no visual contact procedure.
       5.5.1.3. Tactical recovery/SCA.
       5.5.1.4. Maximum effort takeoff and landing (see Paragraph 5.5.3).
       5.5.1.5. NVG takeoff and landing.
       5.5.1.6. A threat reaction.
       5.5.1.7. CARP airdrop (actual or SATB).
       5.5.1.8. Copilots will accomplish a NVG takeoff and landing using normal procedures
       (non-maximum effort).
       5.5.1.9. TOT/TOA will be to one of the events above.
       5.5.1.10. Events in the appropriate subparagraph below will be evaluated.
   5.5.2. Periodic. The evaluation profile will include:
       5.5.2.1. A single-ship NVG low-level to a TOA/TOT. As a minimum, on every other
       evaluation, mountainous terrain will be evaluated. Document in the comments section of
       the AF Form 8 when accomplished.
       5.5.2.2. A maximum effort takeoff and landing (see Paragraph 5.5.3).
   5.5.2.3. NVG takeoff and landing.
       5.5.2.4. A threat reaction.
       5.5.2.5. Tanker air-to-air refueling .
   5.5.3. Maximum Effort (ME) Takeoff and Landing. ME landings will not be evaluated in
   the WST. This event is normally accomplished as part of the mission evaluation. ME
   procedures are not required if it was previously evaluated during the qualification evaluation.
   For mission evaluations, first pilots/copilots accomplish the maximum effort takeoff and
AFI11-2MC-130JV2 20 AUGUST 2013                                                                35


   landing evaluation by demonstrating the duties required in the copilot position. As a
   minimum, thoroughly debrief first pilots/copilots on ME procedures. NVG takeoff/landing
   may be credited if flown to ME standards. For ME qualified FPs, see Paragraph 5.4.1.
   Note: One go-around is permitted, provided the aircraft does not touchdown short of the
   zone.
   5.5.4. Reciever Air-to-Air Refueling.
       5.5.4.1. Initial/Requalification. The evaluation profile will include a rendezvous, join-
       up, contact, and breakaway.
             5.5.4.1.1. If unable to accomplish AAR due to scheduling or equipment shortfalls, a
             statement to this affect will be inserted in the Comments section of the AF Form 8. A
             SPOT evaluation will be accomplished at the gaining unit IAW the timeline
             established in AFI 11-2MC-130J, Vol 1 (or equivalent guidance).
       5.5.4.2. Air-to-Air Refueling qualification is only required in one C-130J MDS. Once
       AAR qualified, Air-to-Air Refueling may be conducted in any AAR capable C-130J
       variant in which the pilot is qualified/differences trained.
   5.5.5. Tanker Air-to-Air Refueling.
       5.5.5.1. Initial/Requalification. The evaluation profile will include: a rendezvous; join-
       up; contact with an actual receiver; and a lost contact/no visual contact procedure.
       Copilots may be evaluated performing only copilot duties during rendezvous and join-up
       and will demonstrate flying ability during contact.
       5.5.5.2. Periodic. The evaluation profile will include: rendezvous, join-up, and contact
       procedures to an actual receiver or another aircraft acting as the receiver. Copilots may
       be evaluated performing only copilot duties during rendezvous and join-up and will
       demonstrate flying ability during contact. An actual receiver is recommended for at least
       every other evaluation.

   current and qualified in NVG low-level as a Navigator, CSO, or Electronic Warfare Officer
   (EWO) in an MC-130 variant, the low-level must be at least 30 minutes). A tactical event is
   considered to be HAAR/TAAR, airdrop, or SCA. Though only one TOA/TOT is required,
   all three events must be observed. The CSO must be actively directing the aircraft during the
   low-level. Mountainous low-level is required. If the timed tactical event is a high-speed
   airdrop or TAAR, then a separate slow-speed TOA/TOT is required. In that case, the
   evaluator will determine the length of the additional low-level.
   6.3.2. Periodic. Required in-flight events are the same as initial/requalification evaluations
   noted above with the following exceptions: The low-level must be at least 30 minutes;
   mountainous terrain is required on at least every other evaluation. A TOA/TOT and threat
   reaction is required on all periodic evaluations. The TOA/TOT may be timed to either a
   high-speed airdrop, HAAR/TAAR, or slow-speed event. A tactical event is considered to be
   HAAR/TAAR, airdrop, or SCA. Two different tactical events will be observed. Though only
   two tactical events are required, all three are preferable. The third event, if not observed in-
   flight, will be evaluated through an alternate method. Do not miss the same tactical event on
   consecutive evaluations. Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the WST.
