1. Program Responsibilities.
   1.1. The Readiness Emergency Management (EM) and Plans :
2                                                         59MDWI10-201 4 JANUARY 2012


       1.1.1. Provide assigned Unit Information Centers (UICs), concept of operations training,
       guidance, and staff assistance for establishing and maintaining a unit recall program for
       general, telephonic, and communications-out (comm-out) recalls. Note: UICs are
       identified as the information hub for a specific squadron/group. Usually, assigned
       Superintendent performs this role within the 59 MDW.
       1.1.2. Ensure the 59 MDW meets quarterly recall exercise requirements (exercising each
       category at least once a year) in accordance with AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness
       Program Management.
          1.1.2.1. Verifies squadron/group recalls are documented by the UIC, deficiencies
          identified and corrective actions monitored through the Medical Readiness
          Committee (MRC) until closed.
    1.2. Group and Squadron Commanders will:
       1.2.1. Develop a recall system (with coordination by Readiness Plans) for personnel
       assigned, including Residents.
          1.2.1.1. Maintain a separate, up-to-date telephone recall roster for assigned military
          (also separate by military service), civilians, and contractors. Note: Recall rosters
          should include an “(E)” after the name(s) of all members classified as “essential”
          personnel (See Attachment 4).
              1.2.1.1.1. Ensure newly assigned personnel are tracked by                    their
              sponsor/supervisor until member is formally placed on the recall roster.
       1.2.2. Ensure recall rosters are validated no later than the fifth (5) duty day of each
       month, and electronic copies forwarded to the Medical Control Center (MCC) at
       59mdw.mcc@us.af.mil.
       1.2.3. Designate a central location within each unit or duty location where personnel
       report for sign-in.
          1.2.3.1. Use discretion in recalling shift personnel during exercises. Personnel
          scheduled for Medical Readiness Training (MRT) the day of a recall can report for
          training according to the normal MRT schedule. Members are considered “present
          for duty,” for accountability purposes.
       1.2.4. Conduct at least one recall per quarter.
       1.2.5. Instruct their UIC (when advised by the 59 MDW/CC, 59 MDW/CV, or
       designated representative) to recall personnel from pass, leave, and temporary duty
       (TDY), by the most expedient means possible.
          1.2.5.1. Recall all personnel who are on ordinary leave or TDY, not due to
          contingency, manning assistance, formal technical training school and Professional
          Military Education courses. Listed below are two avenues that can be utilized to
          recall personnel from leave and TDY:
              1.2.5.1.1. Telephone contact. The following is an example of a leave, TDY or
              pass recall statement: “Airman Jones, (i.e., grade, name, and office symbol) you
              must immediately return to your place of duty. Conditions exist that require
              termination of your absence. Return by the most immediate means available.

     corrective actions identified by the UIC (See Attachment 5, Post Recall Report).
         1.2.6.1. Instruct UIC to forward electronic copies of recall reports to the MCC within
         5 duty days post recall.
  1.3. There are two types of recalls: Total and Selective recalls.
     1.3.1. Total recalls may involve telephone notifications to all assigned personnel to relay
     important or time sensitive information or recall to duty (physical) notifications.
     1.3.2. Selective recalls may involve the recall to duty or telephone notification of relay of
     important or time sensitive information to personnel by the following categories: Unit
     Type Code (UTC), Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP) disaster team, or
     key/Disaster Response Force personnel.
  1.4. Unit/Group Deployment Managers (UDM/GDMs) will:
     1.4.1. Maintain contact information for personnel assigned to UTCs in a centralized
     database in the Readiness Flight (Operations). Note: UDMs can consider utilizing the
     recall roster administration function in MRDSS Ultra.

Terms
Alert—Members must be in the local area and available to be contacted. Check-in required once
during each 24-hour period.
Alert Hour (A—Hour) —The time the recall was initiated (this is not necessarily the time the
unit was notified of a base wide recall). The 37th Training Wing commander or the 59 MDW
commander may initiate a total or selective recall of 59 MDW personnel and set the A hour.
Group and squadron commanders may initiate recalls for their units. Units should obtain the A-
Hour upon notification of recall initiation from the Command Post or the MCC.
A—Hour +1—One hour after A-Hour—For example, time of recall is 0515, the A-Hour +1 is
0615.
A—Hour +2—Two hours after A-Hour—For example, time of recall is 0515, the A-Hour +2 is
0715.
A—Hour +3—Three hours after A-Hour—For example, time of recall is 0515, the A-Hour +3 is
0815.
Comm—Out Recall—Recall conducted under reduced communications capability (e.g., some
or all telephone or communications systems are inoperable due to a natural disaster or terrorist
activities). It will be left to each unit to determine if they need to maintain comm-out recall
capability unless wing leadership decides otherwise.
Essential Personnel—Are those individuals, active duty, reserve or civilian, who are required to
sustain 24 hours operations for inpatient care. At a minimum, the level of staffing must equal to
that normally seen on weekends. Trainees/residents/fellows are not considered essential
personnel unless they are designated as staff on-call in-house for a specific timeframe. Any
further delineation of essential personnel is at the direction of the squadron or group
commanders.
Personnel Accountability—The accurate accounting for all Air Force personnel at all times
regardless of location.
Recall—A recall of all 59 MDW military personnel.           Recalled members are required to
physically report to designated sign in locations.
Recall Standby—Members must be at or near a telephone and able to answer within six rings.
Members must also have a current recall roster available.
Selective Recall of Disaster Response Force or Specialized Teams—EOC, RMOC, MCRP
teams, etc.

                                  RECALL PROCEDURES

A2.1. Recall Response Goals. Recall response is measured based on available personnel
accounted for at the end of a given time period. Personnel determined available for duty are all
assigned personnel excluding those on leave, TDY, hospitalized, quarters, etc. Associate units
will establish their own mechanism to track the availability of the personnel assigned in
accordance with AETCI 10-202, Contingency Operations and Preparation. The following have
been approved through the MRC:
   A2.1.1. The 59 MDW goal is to have A+1=20%, A+2=80%, A+3=100% accountability.
A2.2. Updating Recall Information. Keeping recall information current is an individual
responsibility not a unit responsibility. Anytime an individual’s home phone number or address
changes they need to ensure their recall information is updated by contacting their unit recall
roster monitor.
A2.3. Recall Reporting Procedures. Upon recall notification, perform the following procedures
(Note: These procedures are to be printed on all recall rosters):
   A2.3.1. Personnel will call the individual(s) directly below them on the roster or connected
   to them in the recall chain. Speak directly with member identified on the recall roster and
   repeat verbatim any message. Do not accept a child, spouse or answering machine as an
   acceptable contact. If an answering machine is reached, leave a message and continue to call
   down the chain.
       A2.3.1.1. Contact by using all telephonic devices listed on recall roster. If there is no
       answer, call the next person in the chain.
       A2.3.1.2. Unless otherwise instructed, the caller will advise the individual of the recall
       and requirement to report to their respective duty location in the Battle Dress
       Uniform/Airman Battle Uniform.
       A2.3.1.3. Individuals should be en-route within 15 minutes, or as specified in the recall
       message, after being notified of a recall. Personnel are not to shower, shave, bathe, eat
       breakfast or stop while en-route.
       A2.3.1.4. Upon arrival at the duty location, individuals will sign in at their designated
       sign-in area, and unless otherwise directed, report to their duty section and await further
       instructions. Announcements will be made to keep medical staff abreast of the current
       situation and appropriate actions to initiate.

       A3.2.1.8. Personnel TDY, on leave, or on a pass in the impacted area.
A3.3. When the impacted area is outside continental United States, UIC will contact personnel
and find out the personnel’s plan of action.
   A3.3.1. Accountability Operations.
       A3.3.1.1. MCC will:
       A3.3.1.2. Receive official notification from 502d ABW Command Post to report
       accountability of all personnel.
       A3.3.1.3. Distribute information to UIC to begin accountability procedures. During
       contingency operations, active duty dependents will be accounted for per Headquarters
       Air Education and Training Command.
       A3.3.1.4. Report accountability statistics to PCC unless otherwise directed by PCC.
