     Operations Officer to be the PMRP manager for the host base, responsible for overall
     program management. The 433D Wing Commander appoints the Decentralized Materiel
     Support as the PMRP manager for the wing.
     1.2. The 433D PMRP monitor will maintain a list of organizations using or generating items
     in the program for all Wing organizations. The monitor will ensure program management to
     conform to AFI 23-101, Chapter 6 Section 6C. The host PMRP manager is responsible for

   manager or 433D PMRP monitor during inspections or staff assistance visits.

   2.7. Perform all required day-to-day preventative maintenance and cleaning of silver

   DLA Disposition Services.
   2.11. Unit monitors submit all requirements for supplies and equipment required in the
