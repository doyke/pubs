SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This
document has been restructured and realigned to provide clear and concise guidance; updated
references to AFOSH Standards superseded by AFI 91-203; incorporated procedures for adding
to equipment to the maintenance contract; added requirement for the deleted equipment request
be routed through both the 82 and 782 TRGs; clarified procedures for ensuring classified
components on new Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA) are identified and
documented upon arrival; simplified process for identifying, deleting and coordinating excess
GITA; added requirement for equipment to be removed from service when an inspection has not
been completed by the next scheduled major inspection; identified 982 MXS/MAMD as the
responsible office for reporting aircraft loss per AFI 21-103; exempts the 364 TRS Telecom
Flight and the 366 TRS from the lost tool procedures. Added paragraph 4.3 Squadron/Unit AGE
identification to standardize the use of optional identification markings. SAFB Form 71 was
renamed to better clarify its use and purpose.

   number(s) for point of contact if the equipment is not at the designated location.
3.10. Procedures for TMDE (SAFB and 359 TRS, Det 1, NAS Pensacola):
   3.10.1. The training squadron’s TMDE coordinators ensure the TMDE scheduled for
   calibration is available at the designated pickup point on the date prescribed by the schedule
   (hours for delivery and pickup of TMDE are 0730-1030). PMEL pickup and delivery
   personnel will leave a PMEL Automated Management System (PAMS) generated work order
   copy as an equipment locator (hand receipt) for the training flight. TMDE that has exceeded
   the scheduled calibration interval is prohibited from use (TO 00-20-14, AF Metrology and
   Calibration Program). Exceptions to pickup of scheduled TMDE will be coordinated with
   the PMEL scheduler. Early or late pickups disrupt scheduled workflow and can delay timely
   calibration and repair of other scheduled equipment.
      3.10.1.1. TMDE will NOT be picked up for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance
      unless safe for transport to prevent possible foreign object damage/contamination (i.e.,
      ESD protection, ports capped/plugged).
   3.10.2. The PMEL scheduler will identify TMDE overdue calibration by letter to the training
   squadron commander. The overdue calibration letter will be initiated on the third workday
   after the date due calibration.
      3.10.2.1. The training squadron commander will reply to the SP stating the reason the
      overdue item was not ready for pickup on time.
      3.10.2.2. Overdue TMDE will be rescheduled and treated as unscheduled maintenance.
      3.10.2.3. The PMEL scheduling section will maintain a file of overdue calibration letters.
   3.10.3. Unscheduled, Initial Calibration and Excess TMDE. All unscheduled and excess
   TMDE will have a completed AFTO Form 350 attached IAW TO 00-20-2, Maintenance
   Data Documentation. The bottom portion will be used as a hand receipt.
   3.10.4. Priority Calibration/Repair:
      3.10.4.1. Priority TMDE will be worked by PMEL on receipt. These items will be
      worked until completed during normal duty hours and may be picked up by the training
      flight when completed by PMEL. Requests for priority must be limited to genuine
      mission impact/emergency requirements, since this action takes priority over all other
      work. A sample request is contained at Attachment 4.
      3.10.4.2. Work center supervisors and TMDE coordinators will review their schedule to
      identify priority TMDE due scheduled calibration. The training flight TMDE coordinator
      will contact the PMEL scheduler 5 workdays prior to the unit being due calibration to
      coordinate the priority.
      3.10.4.3. All priority equipment will have a letter requesting priority service (Attachment
      4) signed by the training flight supervision.
      3.10.4.4. To prevent abuse of the priority system that may cause production backlog in
      PMEL, training flights should consider alternate methods of accomplishing the required
      measurements before requesting priority services. The training flight must determine that
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         23


     the TMDE requires priority service and that no substitute TMDE is available from
     another training flight. The PMEL scheduler can assist in identifying training flights that
     possess like items. Equipment loans or transfers of custody are the prerogative of the
     custodians involved. The PMEL supervisor is the approval authority for all priority
     TMDE work requests.
  3.10.5. Deletion/Turn-in/Transfer of TMDE:
     3.10.5.1. Equipment that is on the PMEL Master ID Listing will be sent to PMEL for
     condition tagging prior to turn-in.
     3.10.5.2. The appropriate TMDE coordinator will submit a letter, utilizing Attachment 6
     as an example, to the SP. The PMEL scheduler, as required, will then update the Master
     ID Listing.
     3.10.5.3. The PMEL scheduler will provide a list of all TMDE additions/deletions to 982
     MXS/LGMQ weekly.
     3.10.5.4. If during calibration the TMDE is found to be defective and requires Not
     Repairable This Station (NRTS) action, the PMEL scheduler will add the item to the
     weekly addition/deletion list. The deletion will be identified as being done at PMEL and
     the equipment returned to the assigned training flight for turn-in. In this instance, the
     training flight TMDE coordinator will not be required to submit a TDME Deletion/Turn-
     in letter to the SP.
     3.10.5.5. For TMDE being transferred between organizations on Sheppard AFB, the
     losing organization’s TMDE coordinator will initiate an Equipment Transfer Letter
     utilizing Attachment 7 as an example.
  3.10.6. TMDE Coordinator Appointment:
     3.10.6.1. Training flights supported by PMEL will appoint a primary and an alternate
     TMDE coordinator. The appointment must be in letter format (see Attachment 8) signed
     by the training flight commander/chief. Provide updates to the letter as they occur. One
     copy of the appointment letter will be sent to the PMEL scheduling section with a
     courtesy copy sent to 982 MXS/LGMQ. The training flight TMDE coordinator will file a
     copy in the TMDE coordinator file. The following will be included in the letter:
        3.10.6.1.1. Full name and rank of the primary and alternate TMDE coordinator.

  3.10.11. TMDE Awaiting Parts (AWP), Hold, & NRTS. The PMEL scheduler will inform
  training flights of TMDE status changes to AWP, HOLD, or NRTS within 3 workdays.
  Initial notification may be by telephone and will be documented, but it must be followed by
  written notification to the owning section chief within 10 workdays of status change. A copy
  of the written notification will be maintained in the PMEL scheduling section with a courtesy
  copy to 982 MXS/LGMQ.
  3.10.12. Calibration Responsibility Determination. Items of TMDE that are new to the Air
  Force inventory may not be listed in TO 33K-1-100-2, Technical Manual – TMDE
  Calibration Interval Technical Order & Work Unit Code Reference Guide. Training flights
  with such TMDE will furnish the PMEL with the information required by TO 33K-1-100-1,
  Technical Manual – TMDE Calibration Notes Maintenance Data Collection Codes &
  Calibration Measurement Summaries. PMEL will send technical data and the required
  information provided by the training flights to 562d Combat Sustainment Group, formerly
  known as Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL), for determination of
  calibration responsibility.
  3.10.13. Technical Data on TMDE. The PMEL scheduling section will check all resources,
  when equipment is accepted, to obtain the required technical data for all TMDE supported by
  PMEL. PMEL is not required to keep technical data for unique systems, one-of-a-kind
  commercial equipment, or special purpose limited usage equipment. Training flights must
  requisition and keep data for TMDE in these categories. The training flight will, upon
  request, send the data to PMEL. If data is not available, the equipment will be returned to the
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             25


   training flight and rescheduled upon receipt of the technical data. The PMEL scheduling
   section will assist in obtaining technical data at the training flights request.
   3.10.14. TMDE Received Unserviceable from Supply:
      3.10.14.1. Training flights receiving TMDE from supply will leave all condition tags
      attached to the unit. If the TMDE is determined to be defective during initial calibration,
      the following procedures apply:
          3.10.14.1.1. Test equipment issued from depot stock or shipped from a manufacturer
          will be processed IAW TO 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency Reporting and
          Investigating System.
          3.10.14.1.2. If warranty repair is available on new items, the items will be returned to
          the training flight for processing. PMEL will furnish technical details of rejection or
          failure, as well as warranty and processing information.
   3.10.15. PMEL QA:
      3.10.15.1. When equipment is received from PMEL with a discrepancy, the TMDE
      coordinator will notify PMEL QA. The TMDE coordinator should have all information
      concerning the discrepancy on hand during the conversation. If serviceability cannot be
      determined, the TMDE will be rescheduled into PMEL.
      3.10.15.2. TMDE coordinators must validate the accuracy of certification labels on
      TMDE returned from PMEL. Discrepancies will be brought to the attention of PMEL
      QA. All reported discrepancies will be investigated, and the results provided to the
      training flight.
      3.10.15.3. If the difficulty is not resolved to the training flight’s satisfaction, complete a
      SAFB Form 101, Customer Complaint Record (see Attachment 9).
3.11. Processing Impending Training Deficiencies. This section outlines procedures for
processing impending training deficiencies created by maintenance or supply difficulties.
   3.11.1. A copy of the Anticipated Training Deficiency Report (see AETCI 36-2203,
   Technical and Basic Military Training Development, Chapter 11) will be sent to the
   appropriate 82/782 TRG/TGAO who will work with the Training Manager to alleviate the
   deficiency.
   3.11.2. Actual or anticipated training deficiencies (losses, degradations, or deviations) will
   be processed with higher-than-routine maintenance priorities.
   3.11.3. (982 TRG TDs only) 982 TRG equipment managers (982 TRG/TXFM) should
   explore all avenues available to them, such as direct contact with system/item managers for
   parts procurement where appropriate or interface with depot trainer system technicians prior
   to endorsing the training deviation alerts to the SP. For additional information, refer to
   Chapter 5 of this instruction.
3.12. Turn-In/Transfer of Trainers/Equipment (Except GITAs):
   3.12.1. Prior to turn-in of equipment to supply, the appropriate PEM will submit a letter of
   deletion, using Attachment 10 as an example, to the SP. The PEM will obtain a JCN from
   the SP’s MOC to prepare the unit for turn-in. Required inspections will be accomplished if
 26                                          SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


   more than 75 percent of the inspection interval has elapsed since the last periodic inspection
   IAW TO 00-20-1.
   3.12.2. The losing organization’s PEM will initiate a letter of transfer, utilizing Attachment 7
   as an example. This letter will be given to the gaining organization’s PEM for completion of
   the request. The letter will be submitted to the SP with an info copy to 982
   MXS/LGMQ/LGML.
   3.12.3. The trainer/equipment inventory(s) will be updated by the SP, and reported IAW AFI
   21-103, if required.
3.13. Ground Instructional Training Aircraft (GITA) Procedures:
   3.13.1. 82 TRW Aerospace Vehicle Distribution Office (AVDO) will secure funding for
   both acquisition and disposition of GITAs, to include costs associated with movement,
   dismantling of GITA for transportation, bed-down of GITA, and making aircraft safe for
   training (i.e., removal of explosives, hydrazine, etc.).
      3.13.1.1. GITA acquisition and disposition will be IAW AFI 16-402, and AFI 16-402
      AETC Supplement 1, and AFI 16-402, Sheppard AFB Supplement 1.
   3.13.2. Due to the unique duties and requirements of the technical training mission at
   Sheppard AFB, IAW AFI 21-101, AETC Supplement, GITA will not be maintained or
   treated as operational aircraft. Inspection and lubrication requirements may be adjusted to
   correspond with training requirements and equipment usage and to prevent over or under
   inspection. Where significant savings may be achieved, the owning group commander in
   conjunction with the SP may document authorized deviations or changes to technical data
   requirements, including substitution of materials. These actions will be coordinated through
   the Chief COR, FC, and contracting officer. In all cases, safety or design function must not
   be compromised. The SP PM will maintain documentation authorizing deviations.
      3.13.2.1. GITAs at Sheppard are designated by the addition of the prefix G and are coded
      TX (permanently grounded) by HQ USAF. These permanently grounded instructional
      aircraft are designated as training aircraft, and only the systems required for technical
      training (or those required to ensure safety or system integrity) will be maintained
      according to the AURL.
      3.13.2.2. GITA systems not maintained on the maintenance contract may be permanently
      safed to prevent FOD.
      3.13.2.3. The AURL will be organized by mission design series (MDS) and serial
      number of assigned GITA (refer to Attachment 11 as an example). The AURL will
      identify systems and subsystems by work unit code (WUC) (as listed in a current -06
      WUC manual) required to be operational and/or maintained in the same configuration as
      operational equipment. If only a portion of a system is required, then only the specific
      subsystem or component(s) WUC(s) will be listed. Listings will also identify systems
      that need not be operational, but are required for training.
      3.13.2.4. Annually, NLT 5 June, the SP will provide a complete listing of aircraft
      utilization and system requirements to 82/782 TRG/TGAO for review. In turn, 82/782
      TRGs will coordinate validation with respective squadrons and utilizing attachment 11 as
      an example, submit corrections/changes to the SP and 982 MXS/LGMQ NLT 15 June.
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          27


     3.13.2.5. Changes to the AURL will be forwarded to 982 MXS/LGMQ as they occur.
     982 MXS/LGMQ will forward the original to the SP.
     3.13.2.6. The AURL will be distributed by the SP to all required agencies, to include the
     wing AVDO. After the new AURL has been accepted by the SP it will be stamped,
     dated, and a copy returned to 982 MXS/LGMQ and 82/782 TRG/TGAO, as applicable.
     82/782 TRG/TGAO will forward the AURL to the GITA manager/crew chief who will
     ensure the updated AURL is incorporated into the GITA AFTO Forms 781 binder.
  3.13.3. A complete inventory of all aircraft specific Dash 21 equipment is not required to be
  maintained for assigned GITA.
     3.13.3.1. The GITA manager/crew chief will identify, procure, and maintain only the
     Dash 21 equipment necessary to “safe” the aircraft and/or conduct training to support
     instructional courses as referenced in the AURL.
     3.13.3.2. Each June, the GITA manager/crew chief will complete a SAFB Form 74,
     Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to validate all Dash 21 equipment necessary to
     “safe” the aircraft and/or conduct training to support instructional courses as referenced
     in the AURL and forward to the respective group TGAO for coordination.
     3.13.3.3. 82/782 TRG TGAO will sign the completed SAFB Form 74 and return it to the
     GITA manager/crew chief who will ensure the updated listing is incorporated into AFTO
     781 binder.
     3.13.3.4. All Dash 21 equipment not required for training will be listed on a SAFB Form
     75, GITA Dash 21 Inventory Non Training Equipment, and maintained in the GITA
     continuity book.
  3.13.4. GITAs positioned outside hangars will be weighted or tied down as necessary to
  prevent damage. 82/782 TRGs and 982 MXS/MA will review the GITA parking plan
  annually.
     3.13.4.1. The training flight/user will ensure that C-130 aircraft positioned outside
     hangars will have aileron/rudder/elevator hydraulic system pressure maintained IAW
     applicable TO or high wind gust locks installed, when training is not being conducted.
  3.13.5. Unless required for training instruction, all fuel tank systems will be defueled and
  drained IAW TO 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks and Fuel Cells.
  The SP will ensure all GITA fuel tank systems are drained of excess water/moisture
  annually. More frequent water/moisture draining may be required on certain GITAs.
  3.13.6. The training flight or user will be responsible for removing all mechanical restraining
  devices on flight control surfaces and documenting the GITA AFTO Form 781A BEFORE
  applying hydraulic power to any GITA and for properly reinstalling those restraint devices
  and documenting the GITA AFTO Form 781A UPON completion of that day's training
  events/maintenance tasks.
  3.13.7. Newly Acquired GITAs:
     3.13.7.1. 82 TRW AVDO will notify 982 MXS/LGMQ and applicable training squadron

        forms. The gaining squadron may dispose of the components in accordance with
        Item Manager direction, if not needed for training.
     3.13.7.3. The SP will:
        3.13.7.3.1. Perform acceptance inspection on newly assigned GITA as soon as the
        aircraft has been made safe (explosives removed, etc.), to include a complete review
        and operational check of the systems and subsystems, identified on the AURL.
        Perform a visual inspection on all wheels and tires to identify and record inspection
        dates. Discrepancies that render the system(s) not fully mission capable (FMC) for
        training, per the AURL, will be the responsibility of the training squadron to
        coordinate the repair with 982 MXS/LGML prior to acceptance on the maintenance
        contract by the SP. The SP will initiate AFTO series 781 forms for each GITA.
        3.13.7.3.2. In conjunction with the FC/FD, approve the items of equipment exempt
        from inspection requirements. Do not delegate this responsibility or approval
        certification.
        3.13.7.3.3. Order all applicable technical data that is not on hand.
        3.13.7.3.4. Develop maintenance procedures to meet course requirements and
        forward to 982 MXS/LGMQ for review/acceptance.
     3.13.7.4. 82/782 TRG/TGAO will ensure a current copy of the AURL is provided to
     each squadron. Squadrons will ensure a current copy (at a minimum the cover letter,
     changes, and aircraft specific pages) is placed in each GITA AFTO Forms 781 binder.
  3.13.8. GITAs Declared Excess to Training Needs:
     3.13.8.1. When GITAs are declared excess to training, the training squadron will prepare
     a deletion letter requesting that the aircraft be deleted from the maintenance contract and
     route according to Attachment 10. The 82 TRW AVDO will follow the procedures
     outlined in AFI 16-402, SAFB Supplement 1.
     3.13.8.2. Once disposition is determined; i.e., reclamation via Defense Reutilization and
     Marketing Service (DRMS) or reassignment under a static display program, 982
     MXS/LGML will initiate actions to procure save list, demilitarization instructions, and
     oversee all logistics support operations necessary to facilitate removal of excess GITAs
     from the maintenance contract.
        3.13.8.2.1. Upon receipt of the non-programmed save list from the owning Air

       Form 781A documentation requirements.
       3.14.6.3.4. The following procedures will be used when entering PDs:
          3.14.6.3.4.1. When a maintenance discrepancy is identified that will potentially
          not be corrected due to the age of the trainer/equipment/GITA, excessive
          costs/work hours, or lack of parts/support equipment, the SP will notify the
          training squadron.
          3.14.6.3.4.2. The applicable course training manager will assess the impact and
          determine if the discrepancy warrants repair or will be a permanent discrepancy.
          The training manager will notify the SP, in writing, of the decision to make the
          discrepancy permanent. All permanent discrepancies entered in the forms prior to
          approval of SABI 21-208 on 31 Aug 2010 will not require notification in writing
          and are grandfathered.
          3.14.6.3.4.3. The SP will transfer the discrepancy into the separate PD AFTO
          Form 244 or GITA AFTO Form 781A. On the original entry, the person
          accomplishing the transfer will enter in the corrective action block “Discrepancy
          transferred to PD AFTO Form (specify 781A or 244).” Enter the date, signature
          and employee number in the appropriate blocks.

     documents will be kept in the forms binder.
     3.14.7.2. Each course may develop preprints for GITA hands-on training objectives.
     Annotate the discrepancy with the training maintenance action and the phrase “Training
     in progress”. As a minimum, the discrepancy will identify the following training
     maintenance actions:
        3.14.7.2.1. A Red X entry for removal of any component or assembly that affects
        safe operation of the GITA/equipment (i.e., removal of battery or hydraulic
        components, stress panels). Ensure the applicable warning NOTE is annotated in the
        discrepancy block.
        3.14.7.2.2. A Red X entry when a jumper wire or other type of shorting device is
        installed.
        3.14.7.2.3. A Red X entry for each warning tag that is installed. One AFTO Form
        781A entry may contain several warning tags only if they pertain to the same training
        action.
        3.14.7.2.4. A Red X entry for any maintenance action that has a TO required In
        Progress Inspection (IPI). The IPI requirement will be annotated in the same block as
        the original discrepancy.

     standard JCN, discovered by, and employee number for the training event(s). A standard
     JCN consists of the current Julian Date followed by four zeros; i.e., YYDDD0000. The
     instructor will print their name in the Discovered By block and enter their employee
     number in the employee block.
     3.14.7.5. When training is completed, the instructor will document the corrective action
     in the GITA AFTO Forms 781A IAW TO 00-20-1. The instructor will ensure that all
     conditions that warranted a warning tag are corrected and the tags removed, and that IPIs
     were completed.
     3.14.7.6. The SP will accomplish AFTO Form 781 reviews during each Periodic
     Maintenance Inspection (PMI); i.e., #1, #2, #3, and #4. The SP technician accomplishing
     the review will correct all errors relating to SP entries. Circle all errors made by the
     owning organization that are not historical in nature in BLUE pencil. These errors do not
     require correction. Errors that are historical in nature will be circled in RED pencil and
     require correction.
         3.14.7.6.1. After the review, the forms will be turned over to the SP section lead who
         will accomplish a review following the guidance in paragraph 3.14.7.6. The SP
         section lead will then forward the forms to the SP QC.
         3.14.7.6.2. The SP QC will review the forms for errors using the guidance in
         paragraph 3.14.7.6. Any additional errors that are identified as belonging to the SP
         will be returned to the appropriate lead for corrections. Upon correction the section
         lead will return the forms to SP QC for additional review. The SP QC will forward
         the forms to the Documentation section if all corrections by the SP were
         accomplished. The Documentation section will file all forms having no historical
         documentation errors (by SP or owning organization).
         3.14.7.6.3. The SP QC will forward forms having historical documentation errors
         requiring correction by the owning organization to 982 MXS COR.
         3.14.7.6.4. The 982 MXS COR will make a copy of the forms and forward the
         originals to the appropriate training Squadron Superintendent (CEM) for correction.
         The 982 MXS COR will attach a cover sheet to the copy stating that the original
         forms were forwarded for correction. Temporarily file the copy of the forms in the
         Documentation section, GITA historical file.
         3.14.7.6.5. The appropriate CEM will ensure that all errors made by instructor
         personnel are corrected and will return the original forms to 982 MXS/LGMQ NLT
         10 working days after receipt.
         3.14.7.6.6. The 982 MXS COR will validate the corrections and erase the red pencil
         circle from the forms. The original forms will be returned to the Documentation
         section. The copy of the forms will be replaced by the originals, and the copy will be
         shredded.
         3.14.7.6.7. If at any time during this process the original forms are lost, the cover
         letter attached to the copy will be annotated “Original Lost.”
  3.14.8. Temporarily induced malfunctions are malfunctions caused by the instructor for the
  purposes of training, which will be corrected IAW TO 00-20-1 upon completion of the shift.

      3.14.8.1. Personnel for a particular class may use temporarily induced malfunctions.
      These malfunctions will be recorded in the regular AFTO Forms, but not called into
      MOC. The word “Temporary” must be entered in red on the form to allow differentiation
      from unscheduled discrepancies. A standard JCN for all training events consisting of the
      current Julian Date followed by four zeros; i.e., 101170000, will be entered in the GITA
      AFTO Form 781A or AFTO Form 244.
   3.14.9. For all equipment under maintenance contract, the SP is responsible for verifying
   scheduled maintenance actions and corrective actions taken on the AFTO Forms 244. The
   PEM/alternate is responsible for verifying the accuracy of the AFTO Forms 244 Part I and
   that instructor entered unscheduled maintenance entries are properly documented. The
   squadron will annotate the completion of this supervisor review in Part IV at least semi-
   annually. When an AFTO Form is closed out it will be forwarded to SP Documentation
   Section.
   3.14.10. For equipment not under maintenance contract, supervisory reviews will be
   conducted by the PEM/alternate and annotated semi-annually on all AFTO Forms 244.
   When an AFTO form is closed out it will be kept in the equipment custodian’s historical file.
3.15. 982 MXS GITA/Training Equipment Impoundment Procedures. When an
impoundment of GITA/equipment is warranted by the SP, the SP’s Impoundment Authority will
follow the procedures outlined in the PWS and coordinate with the affected training
course/squadron prior to impounding GITA/equipment. The Impoundment Authority will place
a Red X symbol in the applicable AFTO forms with a statement indicating the reason for
impoundment and the name of the assigned Impoundment Official. The Impoundment Official
will ensure that the 982 MXS MOC is notified.
   3.15.1. The Impoundment Official will determine what maintenance or training can be
   performed on the GITA/equipment during impoundment. The impoundment will be cleared
   IAW TO 00-20-1.

              82/782D TRAINING GROUPS MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT

4.1. Special Certification Roster. The Special Certification Roster (SCR) is a management
tool providing supervisors a clear and concise listing of personnel who have been appointed to
perform, evaluate, and/or inspect maintenance training of a critical nature.
     4.1.1. Course instructor supervisors will validate each assigned instructor’s qualification for
     clearing training maintenance Red X discrepancies and will provide names to the flight
     commander/chief. Provide updates (additions/deletions) as needed. Ensure training task
     certifications have been completed and recorded in each individual’s training record.
     4.1.2. Flight Chiefs will review each individual’s qualifications prior to recommending
     approval to perform SCR tasks to the Squadron Superintendent (CEM). Removal or additions
     to the SCR may be accomplished by lining through the task on the SCR or by adding a name
     to the SCR. Flight Chiefs may also use AETC Form 666, Change to Inspector/Special
     Certification Listing, to add/remove an individual to the SCR. Maintain a copy of each
     individual’s nomination until items are verified as loaded into the maintenance information
     system (MIS).
     4.1.3. The Squadron Superintendent (CEM) has the overall responsibility to implement the
     SCR program. The CEM will approve individuals within their primary AFSC based on their
     experience and technical expertise regardless of their assigned skill position. The CCM
     reviews and signs the SCR quarterly to verify all entries are current and accurate and to
     ensure task certifications have been completed. Return a copy of the signed SCR to the Unit
     Training Manager.
     4.1.4. The appropriate TRG commander is the waiver authority for civilians and selected 5-
     skill level personnel, in the rank of SrA or higher, for tasks normally requiring a 7-skill level
     to facilitate the maintenance training effort. Waived 5-skill level personnel should be closely
     monitored and kept to the minimum required to accomplish the training mission. Squadron
     CEMs will maintain file copies of approved waivers.
     4.1.5. The Unit Training Manager loads the appropriate course code against the approved
     name in the MIS.

      GITA/equipment or trainers and are responsible for controlling, monitoring, and
      investigating the impounded aircraft or equipment.
      4.2.2. The Impoundment Authority may impound GITA/equipment or trainers where power
      is applied or mechanical movement is required any time a training course item, tool, or
      portion of a tool cannot be found (see Lost Tool Procedures, paragraph 4.3.7.). When the
      Impoundment Authority directs impoundment, a Red X symbol will be placed in the
      applicable AFTO forms with a statement indicating the reason for impoundment and the
      name of the assigned Impoundment Official. The Impoundment Official will ensure that the
      982 MXS MOC is notified.
      4.2.3. The Impoundment Official will determine what maintenance or training can be
      performed on the GITA/equipment during impoundment. If the item/tool is not located, the
      Impoundment Official will determine when the search may be discontinued. The
      impoundment will be cleared IAW TO 00-20-1.
4.3. Squadron/Unit AGE Identification. Optional identification markings may be applied or
attached to Aerospace Ground Equipment for ease of ownership identification and inventory
purposes. Marking size and type will be of reflective material and not exceed 2 square inches. As
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            37


practical, markings will be held to a minimum and located adjacent to the unit field number.
Markings are not to obscure required markings, Field unit, SN/PN, etc.
4.4. Tool and Equipment Management. The objective of the tool and equipment management
program is to reduce costs through strict effective control and accountability of assets and to
prevent foreign object damage to GITA, trainers, and training support equipment. Training
squadrons should employ good judgment and common sense to ensure the intent of the program
is met for those areas or situations not specifically covered by this instruction. The Training
Squadron Commander or the Operations Officer is the designated representative for the
appropriate Training Group Commander on tool management and lost tool issues.
   4.4.1. General Program Guidance. Training flight support sections may be set up to emulate
   the real-world environment for training purposes. Course supervisors will determine the
   number of composite tool kits (CTKs) and the type, size, and number of tools, and support
   equipment required for their training flights.
       4.4.1.1. The flight commander/chief will appoint support section or work center tool
       custodian(s), in writing. The tool custodians will be responsible for the flight’s overall
       compliance of the tool program ensuring each work center is in strict adherence with TO
       32-1-101, Use and Care of Hand Tools and Measuring Tools, and this instruction.
       Authorization to issue/turn-in tools/equipment will be accomplished either in writing or
       by authorized access to an automated tool control program.
       4.4.1.2. Set up support section/tool rooms to ensure accountability. The support
       section/tool room must be capable of being locked and afford protective measures such as
       monitoring, 24-hour coverage, or controlled key access. When all CTKs are not capable
       of being secured in the support section/tool room, the flight chief will design a process to
       prevent the unauthorized use or access to tools and equipment. Due to space and facility
       limitations, it may not be possible to store oversized tool kits in the support section/tool
       room.
          4.4.1.2.1. Locks will be used on all tool kits to provide a physical barrier to opening
          the container lid, drawer, or door and prevent the unauthorized removal of tools.
          Locks are not required on tools and equipment that are stored within secured tool
          rooms or classroom/labs.
          4.4.1.2.2. Dispatchable tools, equipment, and CTKs are locked and secured (e.g.,
          with a lanyard) when left unattended outside the work center. CTKs will be locked
          when left unattended in the work center. Tools and equipment are never attached to
          the exterior of a GITA.
          4.4.1.2.3. Modifications to tool containers are authorized unless modification voids
          the manufacturer’s warranty.
       4.4.1.3. Account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment at the beginning and
       end of each shift. Separate shift inventories must be documented by both outgoing and
       incoming personnel. CTKs present during tool room shift inventories do not need to be
       opened for inventory. Tools will not be issued individually from dispatchable CTKs.
38                                         SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


     4.4.1.4. All CTKs require a 100-percent inventory prior to issue, before leaving the work
     area, and prior to turn-in. Students may sign out a CTK; however, upon turn-in it will be
     inspected/signed-in by an instructor or other permanent party member.
     4.4.1.5. Establish designated locations for test equipment and common accessories (e.g.,
     waveguides, attenuators, fittings, cables, adapters) that are not part of a CTK. Industrial
     shop machinery accessories/attachments (e.g., blades, arbors, chucks, gears) need not be
     controlled as tools; however, these items will be maintained in designated storage
     locations for accountability. As a minimum, storage cabinets/drawers will be labeled to
     identify the contents.
     4.4.1.6. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an
     assigned location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout,
     or silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except
     for tools issued in sets such as drill bits, Allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g.,
     gloves, booties).
        4.4.1.6.1. If tools are issued for use in a pouch, lineman’s kit or container that
        prohibits silhouetting and/or shadowing, use AETC Form 1042, CTK Tool Checklist,
        or other approved form to facilitate inventory control. Include the CTK number of
        the pouch or kit and the quantity, nomenclature, and CTK number (if different) for
        each tool included in the kit. The form will be completed at the time of issuance, and
        a copy of the form will remain in the CTK storage facility. Note: Units may elect to
        mark the exterior of a pouch with an inventory of the items it contains, using
        permanent marker, stamps, etc., to facilitate user inventories at the end of each task.
     4.4.1.7. At least annually, or when the support section or work center tool custodian
     changes, conduct a comprehensive inventory of all tools, equipment, and CTKs to
     validate training course tool/equipment requirements, ensure the condition and
     identification markings on the tools/equipment/CTKs, and to verify the accuracy of the
     Master Inventory List (MIL). Inspect all tools for serviceability IAW TO 32-1-101.
     Support section/tool custodians document these inventories and maintain the most current
     inventory documentation on file.
     4.4.1.8. Document removed or broken tools/items on the appropriate inventories and, if
     applicable, in the automated tool control program. For dispatchable CTKs and
     dispatchable support equipment/dispatchable special tools containing multiple parts,
     document the missing, removed and/or broken tools/items on an AETC Form 1042 or on
     the hard copy MIL. If using the AETC Form 1042, complete all applicable fields. If
     using the MIL, if broken tool/item is temporarily removed, annotate the date removed,
     the reason removed, and initials of the individual making the entry in pencil. Do not
     update the quantity if tool will be replaced or returned. If broken tool/item is
     permanently removed, remove tool from the MIL and automated tool control program
     and update the MIL with new signatures and new quantities. The equipment
     identification designator (EID) will be removed from any broken/removed tool/item.
     4.4.1.9. All non-consumable items used in formal technical training courses regardless of
     acquisition method require authorization/accountability either on a CA/CRL, Special
     Purpose Recoverable Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM) list, SAFB Form 74/75, MIL,
     or SAFB Form 71, Training Asset List.
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         39


        4.4.1.9.1. Document training assets not covered in AFMAN 23-110 (i.e.,
        miscellaneous aircraft parts, engine parts or items used for visual enhancement of
        objectives) on a SAFB Form 71 to provide accountability and control. The
        appropriate course will perform an inventory of all training assets annually to ensure
        all items are on-hand. If discrepancies in the inventory are discovered the course
        supervisor will be notified and the records will be reconciled.
        4.4.1.9.2. Tag aerospace parts with the appropriate serviceability form (i.e., DD Form
        1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag - Materiel, DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable
        (Reparable) Tag - Materiel; DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag – Materiel) and place
        an item number on the tag corresponding to the part on the SAFB Form 71.
        4.4.1.9.3. Once the inventory is complete, the course supervisor will sign the SAFB
        Form 71 and obtain the appropriate training manager’s signature.                 The
        completed/signed SAFB Form 71 will be kept in the equipment custodian book.
     4.4.1.10. Electronic Tools (E-Tools).     For technical support of E-tools contact 82
     TRW/TOO.
        4.4.1.10.1. E-Tools purchased and used for the purpose of viewing digital technical
        data and/or for maintenance documentation must be accounted for as automated data
        processing equipment (ADPE) IAW 33-series AFIs and tracked in an automated tool
        control program or locally developed tracking system. E-tools designed specifically
        for a weapon system (e.g., F-22 PMA) will be accounted for on the equipment
        account (CA/CRL) and tracked in an automated tool control program.
        4.4.1.10.2. Licenses, certification, maintenance and security of E-Tools (hardware
        and software) must also be IAW 33-series AFIs and AFI 21-116, Maintenance
        Management of Communications-Electronics. Units must make maximum use of E-
        Tool warranties and ensure only serviceable E-Tools with charged batteries, up-to-
        date system software, and current technical data are available for checkout.
        4.4.1.10.3. The appropriate Lead TODO(s) shall work with 82 TRW/TOO and the
        training squadron TODOs and TODAs to ensure E-Tools are configured with current
        software to support TO and maintenance documentation. E-tools will not be used for
        email or other personal computer type uses. E-tools that require Microsoft Office
        Suites or other software applications to support viewing electronic technical orders
        and maintenance documentation may be loaded on e-tools, but applications such as
        Outlook and internet access will be sufficiently disabled to ensure compliance with
        this policy.
     4.4.1.11. Establish designated locations for test equipment and common accessories that
     are not part of a CTK. Include industrial shop machinery accessories/attachments.
     4.4.1.12. Tools/expendable items used for oxygen systems maintenance training will be
     kept in special purpose kits separate from other tools. For tools utilized in oxygen system
     maintenance training, mark them with the following statement: “For Oxygen System Use
     Only”.
     4.4.1.13. To prevent damage to trainers/equipment/GITA, discard removable (e.g., slide
     on) pocket clips from tools when possible (flashlights, continuity testers, small
 40                                          SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


      screwdrivers, etc.) prior to placement in tool kits. Do not disassemble/damage tools for
      the sole purpose of removing clips, rubber switch guards, etc.
      4.4.1.14. Flashlights, lanterns, portable lighting devices and light sources will conform to
      the requirements of TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
      Grounding/Bonding, when used during servicing operations training. When flashlights,
      lanterns, portable lighting devices and light sources are used during fuel cell maintenance
      training, comply with TO 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks and
      Fuel Cells, and when used in an explosive environment, comply with AFMAN 91-201,
      Explosives Safety Standards.
   4.4.2. Tool Accountability, Control, and Inventory.
      4.4.2.1. All aircraft maintenance training flights will use an approved automated tool
      control program. Training flights will use the automated tool control program to:
          4.4.2.1.1. Track the issuance and receipt of all assigned tools, equipment, tool kits,
          HAZMAT items, TOs (does not apply to TOs, equipment and HAZMAT kept in a
          shop/classroom and not dispatched).
          4.4.2.1.2. Track   authorizations/restrictions   for   special   tools/equipment    (by
          individual).
          4.4.2.1.3. Track inspections required by this instruction.
          4.4.2.1.4. Track spare, lost, and damaged (removed) tools.
          4.4.2.1.5. Develop and manage tool/equipment inventories.
      4.4.2.2. The 364 TRS Fuels (TTF) Flight, 364 TRS Telecom (TTKMS), 364 TRS
      Detachment 1, and 366 TRS (including detachments) will use the following procedures:
          4.4.2.2.1. Use AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, AETC Form 1042, CTK
          Tool Checklist, or an automated system to track and control the location of tools.
          4.4.2.2.2. Track inspections required by this instruction. The inspections will be
          documented on an AF IMT 2411, Inspection Document, or locally developed
          inspection log.
          4.4.2.2.3. Track spare, lost and damaged (removed) tools on an AF IMT 2411, AF
          IMT 3131, General Purpose, or locally developed form.
          4.4.2.2.4. Use an AETC IMT 1042 or locally developed form to annotate log entries
          when a tool/item is added or removed from the inventory stock.
      4.4.2.3. All tools/support equipment/CTKs must be annotated on a MIL (may be
      automated). The MIL does not require replacement solely to update signature. Training
      flights which do not have a centrally located support section will maintain an inventory
      list and the AETC Form 1042, or other approved product, within each room to facilitate
      inventory control.
NOTE: 366 TRS and 364 TRS Telecom Flight are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs
4.4.2.3.2. through 4.4.2.3.3.
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                             41


        4.4.2.3.1. For dispatchable CTKs, a copy of the applicable inventory must be kept
        with the dispatched CTK at all times.
        4.4.2.3.2. Cabinet or CTK contents are identified on the inventory by drawer/section
        indicating the number and type of each item in each drawer/section of the
        cabinet/CTK and total number of all items in each drawer/section. For tools that are
        sets, identify the total number of items in the set on the inventory. (e.g., Allen wrench
        set – 9 each Allen wrenches + container). The Support Section custodian has the
        authority to interchange “like” items.
        4.4.2.3.3. If identification tags or similar tags or dust caps are attached to
        tools/equipment, they will be secured in a manner that will preclude any possibility of
        loss. Locks, key(s), and tie down strap(s), will be marked/etched with the appropriate
        CTK number. All items will be listed on the inventory.
     4.4.2.4. Tool and CTK identification numbers.
        4.4.2.4.1. Each training squadron will designate EIDs for use within their squadron.
        For organizations using an automated tool control program, the EID will consist of
        nine characters (numbers/letters) of which the first four characters will be the World
        Wide Identification (WWID) code. Note: The intent is for the four characters of the
        WWID to identify the base (first and second character), unit (third character), and
        shop (fourth character) in order to leave the remaining five characters available for
        tool/CTK/equipment numbering. See Attachment 13 for the approved numbering
        systems for aircraft maintenance training squadrons.
        4.4.2.4.2. For organizations not using an automated tool control program, 364
        TRS/TTF, 364 TRS/TTKMS, 364 TRS Detachment 1, and 366 TRS (including
        detachments), EID numbers will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate
        squadron operations officer to prevent duplication of numbers used by other courses
        within the squadron. See Attachment 14 for the approved numbering systems.
        4.4.2.4.3. All aircraft maintenance training squadrons must mark their tools and 364
        TRS/TTF, 364 TRS/TTKMS, 364 TRS Detachment 1, and 366 TRS (including
        detachments) must mark their CTKs with a standard EID. Units must place the 9-
        digit EID on all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable equipment that are of sufficient size.
        Tools within a CTK may be marked with less than 9 digits but must contain the 4
        digit WWID and identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the CTK. The 9-
        digit EID must be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs.
            4.4.2.4.3.1. Small tools or items that cannot be marked as described above (such
            as drill bits, Allen wrench sets, apexes, etc.) are to be maintained in a container
            marked with the EID and an identifying character(s) that ties the tool back to the
            CTK along with the number of tools contained. The container is counted as one
            of the items.
            4.4.2.4.3.2. For items that physically or mechanically check tolerances that
            require calibration, do not etch, or stamp in any manner that will affect calibration
            or the ability to calibrate. If marking is in question, the training flight will consult
            PMEL.
42                                         SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013


            4.4.2.4.3.3. Fiberglass handled hammers are etched on the metal head only (not
            on handle) in a non-impact area.
            4.4.2.4.3.4. Permanently mark (by etching or other means) grease guns,
            dispensing cans, spray bottles, pump oilers, and similar containers with the type
            of grease, fluid, or other liquids and military specification (MILSPEC) of the
            contents. If no MILSPEC exists, mark the item with the manufacturer’s name,
            part number/NSN from the applicable MSDS. Mark grease gun fittings and hoses
            with the type of grease they contain if they will be used on a different gun. If
            fittings and hoses are maintained with the same gun, fittings and hoses do not
            need to be marked with the type of grease. Note: If containers are used to hold
            or apply substances classified as hazardous materials, ensure labeling
            requirements of AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication, and local directives are
            accomplished.
            4.4.2.4.3.5. Items that are assembled and are not intended to be disassembled
            during use, require only one mark/etch/stamp and one entry in the inventory (e.g.,
            scribes, flashlights, grease guns).
  4.4.3. Warranted Tool Management:
     4.4.3.1. The Operations Officer/Flight Commander/Chief will ensure strict
     accountability of warranty tools. Support section/tool custodians are designated as the
     Warranty Tool Managers.
     4.4.3.2. The support section/tool custodians will follow tool manufacturer’s guidance
     and operating instructions, being careful not to void any warranty.
     4.4.3.3. The support section/tool custodian will maintain a list of all warranty tools and
     ensure broken or damaged warranty tools are isolated from non-warranty tools and
     secured until properly replaced. For accountability reasons, support section/tool
     custodians will receive a receipt or signature upon pickup/shipment for warranty tools
     requiring servicing or repair.
  4.4.4. Spare and Replenishment Tools:
     4.4.4.1. A stock of spare tools is authorized. These tools are used to replace broken,
     worn, or missing tools to prevent unnecessary training delays. Support section/tool
     custodians authorize the tools and quantities maintained. Inventory and document all
     replacement tool stocks quarterly annotating the inventory sheet with the name of the
     individual conducting the stock check and date completed; use an AF IMT 2411, AF IMT
     3131, or locally developed form. Use a general-purpose form (such as AF IMT 3131 or
     AETC Form 1042), locally developed form, or automated tool control program to
     annotate log entries when a tool/item is added or removed from the inventory stock.
     4.4.4.2. During the quarterly inventory, the custodian will validate the quantity of
     tools/items within each bin. To aid in accountability, control, and inventory, tools/items
     will be separated by individual bins or dividers (identical items may be grouped). Access
     to spare tools will be limited to the support section/tool custodians.
SHEPPARDAFBI21-208 20 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              43


       4.4.4.3. Mark replacement tools with the EID number prior to issue. If previously used
       serviceable tools (i.e., spare tools) are to be used as replacements, de-etch/line through all
       prior assigned markings.
       4.4.4.4. Secure all broken tools/tool kits until they are processed for disposal. Prior to
       disposal, if tools/tool kits were previously marked, ensure all etchings are completely
       removed.
   4.4.5. Consumables:
       4.4.5.1. Consumables may be placed in CTKs if they are identified on the inventory as
       consumables. Consumables that are placed in CTKs will be marked for the CTK they are
       in, and replaced on an as-needed basis. Consumables that are not feasible to mark (pins,
       etc.) will be placed in a suitable container that can be marked. Only support section
       custodians are allowed to replace consumables on a one-for-one exchange. Keep
       consumables placed into CTKs to the absolute minimum needed to perform the training.
       Hazardous materials will not be assigned to or permanently stored in a CTK.
   4.4.6. Job site transfer of tools is allowed between instructors.
   4.4.7. Lost tool procedures:
       4.4.7.1. Supervisors will ensure all personnel are familiar with lost tool procedures.
       4.4.7.2. Any time an item, tool, or portion of a tool cannot be found after training is
       performed on or around GITA, support equipment, or training equipment where power is
       applied or mechanical movement is required, the following will apply.
NOTE: 366 TRS and 364 TRS Telecom Flight are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs
4.4.7.2.1 through 4.4.7.2.5. However, these units will develop lost tool procedures that are
applicable to their respective organizations.
          4.4.7.2.1. When an item/tool is lost during training on GITA, support equipment, or
          training equipment, immediately stop any training on that asset and conduct a search.
          If the item/tool is not found within two hours, place a Red X in the GITA AFTO
          Form 781A or AFTO Form 244, with a description of the item/tool and the specific,
          last known location of the item/tool. Notify the 982 MXS MOC before leaving the
          immediate area.
          4.4.7.2.2. Notify the Flight Chief, IS, or shift supervisor immediately if the initial
          search does not produce the lost or missing item/tool. The Flight Chief, IS, or shift
          supervisor will ensure the Operations Officer and Superintendent (or equivalent) are

Terms
Composite Tool Kit (CTK)—A controlled area or container used to store tools or equipment
and maintain order, positive control, and ease of inventory. CTKs/TKS are assembled as a kit
and designed to provide quick, easy visual inventory and accountability of all tools and
equipment. CTKs/TKs may be in the form of a toolbox, a shadow board, shelves, system of
drawers (Stanley Vidmar, Lista, etc.), cabinets, or other similar areas or containers. The CTK
contains tools and equipment necessary to accomplish maintenance tasks, troubleshooting, and
repair.

Dispatchable CTK—issued out from a support section/tool room/work center to be used outside
the work center.
Electronic Tools (E—Tools)—Includes laptops computers, electronic “tablets”, hand-held
devices, etc, used to view digital technical data and/or maintenance documentation.
Equipment Schedule—A listing produced monthly of all TMDE due calibration during the
scheduled period.
Functional Commander/Director (FC/FD)—The person responsible for a functional area at
the squadron level for contracted functions; i.e., Civil Engineer Squadron Commander is the
Function Commander for the Civil Engineering performance-based work statements.
Historical In Nature Documentation Errors—Errors on AFTO Form 781 entries that are
considered historical in nature as defined in TO 00-20-1, section 10. Historical documentation is
the permanent record of significant maintenance actions on aerospace equipment.
Induced Malfunction—Discrepancy induced by an instructor as a learning tool.
Master Identification (ID) Listing—A listing of equipment maintained by the PMEL. This
listing is either by training flight or SP PWC Master ID Listing, which is produced quarterly.
Master Inventory List (MIL)— Primary source document for inventory of CTKs. The MIL
indicates the total number of items in each drawer or section of the composite tool kit. The MIL
may be automated.
Normally Installed Equipment (NIE)—Bomb racks, launchers, and pylons normally installed
on an aircraft.
Performing Work Center (PWC)—SP’s work center responsible for repairing, calibrating,
and/or certifying equipment.
Permanently Induced Malfunction—Induced malfunction that are not corrected to facilitate
on-going training objectives.
Permanent Discrepancy—Discrepancy that will not be corrected due to the age of the
trainer/equipment/GITA, excessive costs/work hours, or lack of parts/support equipment to
repair the discrepancy.
Priority TMDE—TMDE that is one of a kind that causes work stoppage, or that is needed to
meet critical mission requirements.
Service Provider—Maintenance contractor responsible for all maintenance actions pertaining to
trainer/support equipment/AGE/GITA under contract, except for user responsibilities as
identified in this instruction.
TMDE Coordinator—A person appointed to obtain calibration support for their activities, keep
the training flight informed as to the status of their TMDE and provides advice for the
commander or supervisor. Normally, all communications from the training flight to the PMEL
will go through the TMDE coordinator.
