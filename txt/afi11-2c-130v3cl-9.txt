                   MAFFS OPERATIONS
         COCKPIT CREW MAFFS CHECKLIST
This checklist establishes procedures for the operation of C-
130 aircraft employed by Mobility Air Forces (MAF) to
accomplish their worldwide missions.
This checklist complements AFI 11-2C-130V3, C-130
Operations Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x
11” bond paper then trimmed to a unique size 4 ½ “ x 6 ½”
that will fit the standard plastic C-130 aircrew checklist
binders. Units may request copies of this checklist printed on
a water proof-based media (in the size outlined) from the
OPR. This product reduces weight and eliminates the need
for plastic inserts. Limit water proof copies to aircrew only
for use in-flight and training purposes.
Summary of Revisions: Corrected checklist step placement.
