                               PROGRAM INFORMATION

1.1. Goal. The goal of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program is to incorporate
maximum nuclear surety, consistent with operational requirements, from weapon system
development to retirement from the inventory.
1.2. Safety Standards. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program ensures personnel
design and operate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems to satisfy the safety standards
in Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 3150.2, DOD Nuclear Weapon System Safety
Program. The DOD safety standards are:
   1.2.1. There shall be positive measures to prevent nuclear weapons involved in accidents or
   incidents, or jettisoned weapons, from producing a nuclear yield.
   1.2.2. There shall be positive measures to prevent DELIBERATE prearming, arming,
   launching, or releasing of nuclear weapons, except upon execution of emergency war orders
   or when directed by competent authority.
   1.2.3. There shall be positive measures to prevent INADVERTENT prearming, arming,
   launching, or releasing of nuclear weapons in all normal and credible abnormal
   environments.
   1.2.4. There shall be positive measures to ensure adequate security of   nuclear weapons,
   pursuant to DODM S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108V1, The Air Force                Nuclear Weapon
   Security Manual, DODM S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108V2, General                 Nuclear Weapon
   Security Procedures, and DODM S-5210.41-M_AFMAN31-108V3,                 Nuclear Weapon
   Specific Requirements.

                                             Chapter 2

                                       RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Commanders’/Directors’ Emphasis. Commanders at all levels are responsible for the
success of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. Commanders MUST emphasize that
safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons are important to the United States.
The following is not an all inclusive list of restrictions dealing with nuclear weapons.
Commanders should review the Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR) for their specific weapon
system(s) found in AFIs 91-111 thru 91-117.
     2.1.1. Do not use nuclear weapons to troubleshoot faults, that is, to confirm a fault exists, to
     aid in fault isolation, or to verify fault correction. AFI 91-107, Design, Evaluation,
     Troubleshooting, and Maintenance Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems, contains specific
     guidance.
     2.1.2. During exercises, do not wear complete chemical ensembles when handling war
     reserve nuclear weapons. Remove the gas mask (to aid in identification) and gloves (to
     ensure weapons are not inadvertently damaged).
     2.1.3. Storing nuclear weapons in one facility and conventional munitions in another facility
     within the same weapons storage area (WSA) is not considered simultaneous presence and
     does not require MAJCOM approval. Conventional munitions inherently part of a nuclear
     weapon system and/or nuclear weapon component (e.g. forward shroud, forward section,
     electrical explosive devices, and limited life components) located in the same assembly,
     surveillance, and inspection (AS&I)/maintenance and inspection (M&I), vault or storage
     facility are not considered simultaneous presence. Do not store nuclear weapons and
     conventional munitions together, except:
        2.1.3.1. As part of flightline or protective aircraft shelter operations conducted according
        to nuclear weapon system safety rules.
        2.1.3.2. The MAJCOM/CC may approve the temporary storage of nuclear and
        conventional munitions within a WSA facility to facilitate the warehousing of these
        materials in order to meet immediate operational requirements. AFMAN 91-201,
        Explosive Safety Standards, and Technical Order (TO) 11N-20-7, Nuclear Safety
        Criteria, contain specific guidance. Reference AFMAN 91-201 for storage requirements
        of nuclear weapon components within a weapons storage and security system (WS3)
        vault.
        2.1.3.2. (USAFE) For operations within USAFE follow guidance from AFI 91-112,
        Safety Rules for US/NATO Strike Fighters.
        2.1.3.3. The Wing/CC may approve the immediate storage of nuclear and conventional
        munitions within a WSA facility for 72 hours in the event of fire, flood, or natural
        disaster, or if the nuclear storage facility can no longer be secured and initiate
        PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV) procedures prescribed in
        AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Storage for more than 72 hours requires
        MAJCOM/CC approval.
AFI91-101_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                         7


      2.1.3.4. Storage of nuclear and conventional munitions within a WSA facility for more
      than 90 days requires a waiver be granted by AF/SE. At a minimum, the waiver shall
      include a mitigation plan containing: the reasons for requesting the waiver, risk
      assessment, any corrective action or actions to ultimately correct the waiver, and
      expected duration of the waiver. While the waiver is in existence it will be reviewed at
      least quarterly by the affected Wing/CC and MAJCOM/CC for validity and progress
      updates.
   2.1.4. Implement local procedures to:
      2.1.4.1. Prohibit direct overflight, in airspace controlled by the base, of WSAs, weapon
      movements, nuclear loaded aircraft, and aircraft shelters with nuclear weapons inside.
      Over flight of aircraft shelters where the weapons inside are secured in a WS3 vault is
      permitted.
      2.1.4.2. Ensure aircraft with forward firing ordnance, to the maximum extent possible,
      are not parked pointed toward Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) flightline operations
      and active convoy routes.
      2.1.4.3. Ensure aircraft with forward firing ordnance are limited, to the maximum extent
      possible, from sweeping across PNAF flightline operations and active convoy routes.
      2.1.4.4. Prohibit direct overflight of PNAF aircraft during ground operations within that
      airspace controlled by the base.
2.2. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF):
   2.2.1. Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) oversees the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety
   Program.
      2.2.1.1. Establishes program requirements.
      2.2.1.2. Publishes instructions and guidance on the various portions of the program.
      2.2.1.3. Maintains liaison for nuclear surety matters with organizations outside the Air
      Force.
      2.2.1.4. Advises Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the Assistant
      Secretary (Acquisition) (SAF/AQ) of required nuclear surety technology.
      2.2.1.5. Provides augmentation, through Air Force Safety Center, to AFIA/OV Nuclear
      Surety Inspection (NSI) oversight teams in support of SAF/IG NSI oversight
      responsibilities.
      2.2.1.6. Issues coordinated guidance on radiological health matters pertaining to nuclear
      weapons.
      2.2.1.7. Provides, at the request of commanders, Nuclear Surety Program Visits and
      Functional Expert Visits to assist in developing a robust and compliant nuclear surety
      program.
      2.2.1.8. Establishes the minimum content of the Nuclear Surety training program.
          2.2.1.8.1. Creates and distributes standardized nuclear surety lesson plan and testing
          material to MAJCOM Chiefs of Safety.
