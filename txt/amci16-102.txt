                             GOVERNANCE PROCESS PURPOSE

1.1. Governance Process Purpose. The purpose of the FEGP is to ensure the most relevant and
highest priority fuel efficiency initiatives are implemented, commensurate with war fighting
mission effectiveness needs and in concert with US Government, Department of Defense (DoD),
and United States Air Force (USAF) FE policies, standards, instructions, and charters
(Attachment 1, Glossary of References).
1.1.1.     Capability Development. The FEGP provides decision-making transparency for
material and non-material solution development and ensures coordinated proposals are acted
upon by appropriate officials (Attachment 2, AMC Governance Structure). Command FE
development efforts will utilize a Capabilities-Based Planning (CBP) approach in accordance
with the Defense Acquisition System. Fuel efficiency efforts will use the Joint Capabilities
Integration and Development System (JCIDS) along with the Planning Programming Budget and
Execution (PPBE) process as needed. Fuel efficiency capability needs that cannot be realized
with AMC-controlled resources are addressed as capability needs through this FEGP by linking
to established references outlined in Attachment 1, Glossary of References. The scope of this
FEGP applies to the full spectrum of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and
Education, Personnel, Facilities and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) capability efforts to ensure coherent,
integrated solutions. Analysis and revision of processes will be considered before making
investments in materiel/non-materiel solutions.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction directs all AMC Directorates and informs all other COI
members/stakeholders.
     1.2.1. All AMC aviation FE enterprise-level materiel/non-materiel capability development
     and process improvement efforts must comply with this FEGP. The FEGP provides a
     structured means to pursue fuel efficient, capability based solutions, but does not supplant the
     authority or responsibility of AMC directors to adhere to statutory or assigned
     responsibilities.
     1.2.2. The FEGP enables FE portfolio management, and other program management
     functions, by providing structured review, analysis, and decision making processes. The
     development of materiel/non-materiel and service acquisition strategies by the Service
     Acquisition Executive organizations is a critical component of the FEGP and is incorporated
     in the FEGP procedures. Specific FEGP procedures, roles, and responsibilities are in
     paragraphs 2, 3, and 4.
1.3. Terms. Acronyms used in this FEGP are in Attachment 1, Glossary of References and
Supporting Information.

1.4. Policy. Command policy is:
   1.4.1. Consistent with the AMC Energy Management Steering Group on Energy/Fuel Use,
   AMC promotes (1) energy as a resource consideration in AF decision making, (2) a culture
   where Airmen naturally conserve energy, (3) alternative energy sources consistent with life
   cycle costs/benefits and (4) utilization of technology to offset energy consumption.
   1.4.2. To develop aviation fuel efficiencies by investing in the MAF enterprise, including six
   focus areas (policy, planning, execution, maintenance, science and technology (ST), and fuel
   efficient aircraft systems).

                        AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES FOR FEGP

2.1. Authoritative Sources for FEGP. Specific authoritative sources providing the basis for
HQ AMC to execute FEGP are identified in Attachment 1, Glossary of References. Governance
will be implemented through the AMC Energy Management Steering Group, the AMC Fuel
Efficiency Governance Board Charter, the Fuel Efficiency Requirements and Planning Council,
the Fuel Efficiency Initiative/Program Management Review process, and the AMC Governance
Structure (Attachment 2, AMC Governance Structure).
2.2. Related Governance Processes. The Command, using authorities listed in the references,
pursues FE initiatives with external organizations and bodies. The primary role of the FEGP
within these external processes is to ensure AMC-led initiatives are coherent and represent a
coordinated approach for pursuing fuel efficiencies addressed through the respective processes.
Relevant external organizations are listed in Table 3.1.

   3.1.1. Associations. The FEGP establishes linkage to applicable internal and external
   corporate processes to enable transparency and efficiency in all stages of FE initiative
   staffing. (All internal players link to their external counterparts).
       3.1.1.1. The COI/Stakeholders identify FE capability needs and potential FE initiatives
       which are assessed and implemented through the FEGP and other applicable existing
       corporate processes.
   3.1.2. The COI/Stakeholders are kept informed on FE initiatives progress by the FEGP semi-
   annually.
   3.1.3. Internal. The FEGP links to the CBP and AMC Corporate Structure through the
   Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process (AMC Group, Board, Council, and
   Configuration Review Board (CRB)) by A4, A5/8, A6, and FM participation in the FE
   Requirements and Planning Council (R&PC). The FEGB-approved initiatives which require
   funding are submitted to the relevant functional Mission Design Series (MDS) R&PCs, or the
   AMC IT Requirements Process. All initiatives requiring funding then go to the applicable
   Program Element Monitor (PEM) and finally to the AMC Corporate Structure for funding
   prioritization via the annual POM process.
   3.1.4. External. At a minimum, the FEGP links to:
       3.1.4.1. United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) through AMC
       representation to the USTRANSCOM Corporate Governance Process (CGP). (Fuel
       Efficiency Office (FEO), FM, A3, A5/8, A6).
       3.1.4.2. Air Force Material Command (AFMC) through System Program Office (SPO)
       representation on the FE R&PC and by AFMC Advisor status on the AMC FEGB.

        3.1.4.3. Mobility Air Force organizations, as members of the COI and through the FEGB
        and FE R&PC.
        3.1.4.4. Headquarters Air Force A1, A3/5, A4/7, A6, A8 and SAF/AQ, IE, FM, through
        membership on the AF Energy Working Groups and through formal coordination on
        initiatives requiring investment or with policy implications.
        3.1.4.5. Industry, through FEO and ST outreach to relevant companies at the leading
        edge of FE efforts.
        3.1.4.6. Fuel Efficiency Office and ST outreach to institutions and laboratories involved
        in FE research.
3.2. Command Corporate Resource Process. This FEGP changes established budgeting and
approval processes, only as specified.
     3.2.1. Prioritized and FEGB-approved initiatives which do not require investment may be
     implemented In Accordance With (IAW) normal and existing AMC procedures.
     3.2.2. Prioritized initiatives which require investment are submitted by the FE R&PC to the
     applicable functional, Configuration Review Board (CRB), IT Requirements Process and
     MDS R&PCs for integration into their overall priority lists. AMC FEO will submit these
     initiatives as a prioritized list of FE initiatives to the AMC Corporate Structure separate from
     a PEM prioritization list. The PEMs will provide advocacy for individual fuel efficiency
     initiatives to the AMC Group, Board, and Council. Fuel efficiency initiatives will also be
     submitted to the respective SPO or Centralized Asset Management (CAM) office for staffing.
        3.2.2.1. In order to meet the USAF programming requirements laid out in Air Force
        Instruction (AFI) 16-501, the AMC corporate structure produces the AMC POM input.
        The AMC Corporate Structure process is defined in Air Mobility Command Instruction
        (AMCI) 16-101 and is summarized here. The PEM assigned to each program element
        presents specific initiatives, disconnects, and offsets for consideration to the AMC Group
        each fall. The PEM is the entry point for all FE initiatives to compete for funding, and
        fuel efficiency initiatives should be briefed as part of a PEM’s presentation to the AMC
        Group with the assistance of the FEO as necessary. However, the AMC FEO will submit
        a prioritized list of all energy efficiencies competing for funding in the POM to AMC
        A8PP for FEO’s brief to the AMC Group. The AMC Group, chaired by AMC/A8P,
        reviews all POM issues and directorate priorities and produces an integrated funding
        strategy for AMC board review/approval. The AMC board, chaired by AMC/A5/8,
        reviews the group’s work, refines it, and sends it to the AMC Council for approval. The
        AMC Council, chaired by AMC/CV, reviews the draft POM input and recommends
        approval to the AMC/CC. The brief to the AMC Board, Council, and CC will include a
        scorecard slide listing the prioritized energy efficiencies and whether or not each
        efficiency was funded as part of the balanced AMC submission. After the AMC/CC
        approves the AMC POM input, it is submitted to AF/A8P to be combined with other
        Major Command (MAJCOM) and agency inputs to form the USAF POM.
        3.2.2.2. Fuel Efficiency initiatives approved by the FEGB may also be submitted to
        linked external processes to compete for funding. The FEGB decides this funding
        strategy for each initiative during its reviews. For example, initiatives requiring
        investment which could result in savings for the Transportation Working Capital Fund

       Council (ERRC) and Resource and Acquisition Strategy Board (RASB)).
3.3. Incentives/Awards. The FEGP will implement an incentive/awards plan in accordance
with Service and Department governance procedures to encourage and reward organization and
wing levels which create and/or successfully implement fuel efficiency initiatives.
   3.3.1. Incentives provided to organizations should be used to fund mission needs and
   enhancements, rather than non-mission related purposes.
3.4. FEGP Procedures. The FEGP owner is the AMC/FEO, as delegated by the AMC/CC.
The FEGP consists of the structure illustrated in Attachment 2, AMC Governance Structure. The
AMC FEGB is responsible to the AMC Energy Management Steering Group. The FEGB meets
as needed, but not less than semi-annually, to oversee the FEGP and to function as the decision-
making body for the FE R&PC prioritization process and initiative funding strategies. The AMC
FEO administers the AMC FEGP. Topical High Performance Teams (HPTs) are formed as
needed to address issues related to FE topics and initiatives. The FE R&PC is the process and
structure which establishes primary linkages to internal and external organizations as initiatives
are developed. The Initiative/Program Management Review (I/PMR) process instills rigor and
fidelity to both the initiative development and program oversight actions of the staff.
   3.4.1. The FEGB is chartered and chaired by the AMC/CV.
       3.4.1.1. The FEGB is tasked to:
           3.4.1.1.1. Establish rigorous project management and oversight structure and
           processes for the FEGP,
           3.4.1.1.2. Establish linkages to all relevant stakeholders,
           3.4.1.1.3. Create and coordinate funding for an incentive program to encourage and
           reward fuel efficiency,
           3.4.1.1.4. Act as the approving body for FE R&PC Requirements Working Group
           (RWG) and Executive Session meetings.
   3.4.2. Fuel Efficiency Governance Board membership is:
       3.4.2.1. Air Mobility Command/A1, A3, A4, A5/8, A6, A7, A9, FM, 18AF/CV, 618/CV,
       ST, TE, MA to AMC/CC, ANG Assistant to AMC/CC, AFRC Reserve advisor to
       AMC/CC, and ANG Advisor to AMC/CC.
       3.4.2.2. Advisors: SAF/AQX, AQQ, FMC, IEE; HAF/A5R, DA4; AFMC System
       Program Managers (SPMs), AFRL, DAU, Legacy Fleet Study, Fleet Viability Board, and
       others as required.
   3.4.3. Topical HPTs. The FEGB charters HPTs as needed to deal with FE topics and issues.
   AMC/FEO leads Topical HPTs.
   3.4.4. Fuel Efficiency R&PC. The FE R&PC conforms, with minor modifications, to the
   HQ AMC/A5Q R&PC Charter (1 Jul 09).
   3.4.5. The FE R&PC provides a common, MAF forum to plan and baseline activities,
   validate, prioritize, review, and approve initiatives and new requirements. This process
   prioritizes requirements, resources, and schedules within a total force context. It consolidates
10                                                      AMCI16-102 23 NOVEMBER 2011


  HQ AMC’s Total Force/MAF near-term and long-term FE requirements and plans and
  supports the SPMs’ program execution responsibilities. It bridges AMC’s requirements
  definition process and the SPO requirement implementation process. The FE R&PC’s
  consolidated decisions are intended to foster unity of direction among all members of the
  COI. The FE R&PC does not circumvent existing AF acquisition processes (AF Form 1067,
  JCIDS, Capabilities Development Document, etc.), but works synergistically with these
  processes. The FE R&PC cycle occurs annually to support the POM process, but is also
  used to evaluate and advocate initiatives outside the POM submittal, when timing and
  opportunity allows (Attachment 3, AMC FE R&PC Flow).
     3.4.5.1. The FE R&PC process (Attachment 4, FE Initiative Path) is a 10 Step path that
     begins with a call for topics. The FE R&PC process has embedded within its’ 10 steps
     the AMC FM Business Case Analysis (BCA) process responsible for developing
     comprehensive BCAs for material solutions in accordance with AFI 65-509 Business
     Case Analysis and AFMAN 65-510 Business Case Analysis Procedures. The AMC FM
     BCA process is also utilized to accomplish Policy Evaluations for non-material solutions.
         3.4.5.1.1. Step 1 Idea Jar. New topics should be submitted electronically to the AMC
         FEO using the initiative submission format (Attachment 5, Fuel Efficiency Idea
         Submission). New topics should be emailed to: amc.a3e.fueloffice@scott.af.mil
         (AMC/Fuel Efficiency Office on the Global). The FEO will collect all new topics
         submitted and assign the topic to one of the FEO portfolios. The FEO portfolio
         monitor, in concert with the weapon system Integrated Product Team (IPT) leads and
         other subject matter experts, will capture the basic idea information to include
         description, impact, potential cost and savings, magnitude of effort (labor and
         schedule). The portfolio monitor and supporting subject matter experts will also
         cross reference the topic with past/current FEO efforts to prevent duplication of
         effort. The portfolio monitors will present their findings to the Initiative Review
         Team (IRT) as identified in Step 2 for evaluation and determination of proceeding
         with a preliminary analysis of the topic.
         3.4.5.1.2. Step 2 Initiative Review Team (IRT). The FEO chairs an IRT with
         Division Chief representation and AMC subject matter experts to evaluate new topics
         against a filtration matrix (Attachment 6, FEO Standardized Idea Filter Template).
         Appropriate Weapon Systems and other IPTs are invited to participate in this filtering
         process. A subjective (high, med, low) score will be applied to 9 identified areas in
         the filter matrix to determine the value of proceeding with a preliminary analysis of
         the idea. Additional columns contained within the matrix support the subjective
         scoring with preliminary objective information. After completing the filter matrix,
         the IRT determines which topics should or should not proceed forward. The IRT then
         assigns an Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for each idea. For topics not
         pursued, the OPR will document rationale, file and retain all relevant information for
         future reference. For ideas to be further evaluated, the IRT and OPR will assign a
         champion (see Step 3).
            3.4.5.1.2.1. The following Divisions are considered voting board members:
            A1M, A3D, A3O, A3R, A3S, A3T, A3V, A4M, A4T, A5Q, A6C, A6I, A7K,
            A8P, A9A, FMP, FMA, TEA, TACC/XOC, TACC/XOG, TACC/XON,
            TACC/XOO, and TACC/XOP. After completion of the IRT, the FEO will
AMCI16-102 23 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 11


          compile the minutes and disseminate them out to the Board for review and
          approval. The Board members will acknowledge receipt of the minutes and
          confirm that they are in concurrence with the minutes. If a Board member
          dissents and does not agree with the approval of the ideas/initiatives then
          adjudication will be accomplished at the RWG (Requirements Working Group, 2-
          digit level).
          3.4.5.1.2.2. The IRT will conduct a periodic review of all active analyses to
          facilitate coordination. The IRT will prioritize all preliminary analysis using the
          idea filter matrix.
          3.4.5.1.2.3. The IRT will complete the BCA and PE tasking matrix (Attachment
          7, FEO Standardized BCA Tasking Template; Attachment 8, FEO Standardized
          PE Tasking Template) as prescribed in Step 5 using the information provided by
          the preliminary analysis. The IRT will make a recommendation to the
          Requirements Working Group (RWG) to identify an idea as an initiative and
          accomplish a comprehensive BCA or policy evaluation. The tasking matrix will
          support the recommended prioritization for staff effort of comprehensive BCAs
          and policy evaluations to be accomplished.
       3.4.5.1.3. Step 3 Champion Identification. The IRT Chair and Division Chiefs
       should select from and in coordination with, the functional area most impacted by the
       initiative implementation. The roles and responsibilities of the initiative champion
       are in section 4.14. Internal and external stakeholders shall also be identified to
       support the champion as he/she develops a preliminary analysis with the assistance of
       the FM cost analyst. The champion leads the staff effort to carry the idea/initiative
       forward from the IRT through termination. A champion’s role varies as an
       idea/initiative progresses, ranging from the driving force to a monitor. During all
       phases of an idea/initiative, the champion is the single primary point of reference for
       AMC, responsible for program information updates to the FEO and the AMC
       leadership.
       3.4.5.1.4. Step 4 Preliminary Analysis. The initiative champion requests a
       preliminary analysis in writing from AMC/FM, who delegates the request to the cost
       branch (AMC/FMPC). Preliminary analyses are internal planning tools for making a
       recommendation to the decision makers without going through the effort of a
       comprehensive BCA. It is a first effort at the elements of economic analysis,
       including: statement of the problem or objective, assumptions, alternatives,
       determination of feasible or infeasible alternatives, an estimation of the benefits and
       costs of each feasible alternative, and consideration of the risk of the recommendation
       relative to key variables. The goal is to facilitate a good management decision among
       possible alternatives. During this phase, the initiative champion should be inserted
       into any relevant IPTs (if available). Membership into appropriate IPTs ensures that
       updated information is transferred among key stakeholders. The initiative champion
       socializes the initiative with the appropriate implementing offices. The initiative
       champion may be required to initiate a Form 1067, or other JCIDS requirements
       documents, to gather pertinent information and prepare for formal requirement
       generation. The preliminary analysis will identify the idea as either a material or non-
       material solution for entry onto the appropriate tasking matrix.
12                                                    AMCI16-102 23 NOVEMBER 2011


     3.4.5.1.5. Step 5 Initiative Tasking. After the preliminary analysis, the A3 chairs a
     Requirements Working Group (RWG) with AMC Directorate representation. The
     Initiative Champion along with subject matter experts will attend to support
     discussion on scoring and proceeding forward with an idea as an initiative. Based
     upon the information provided from the preliminary analysis, the idea will be entered
     onto either the BCA tasking matrix or the PE tasking matrix. The BCA tasking
     matrix will evaluate all ideas and initiatives that require a material solution. The
     Policy Evaluation tasking matrix will be utilized to prioritize ideas and initiatives that
     require a non-material solution regardless of funds required. The RWG will evaluate
     the IRT recommendation and prioritization using the appropriate BCA or PE tasking
     matrix. A subjective score (high, high/med, med, med/low, low) will be applied
     against 9 areas to determine the value of applying manpower and funds to accomplish
     a comprehensive BCA or Policy Evaluation in consideration of the value added by
     implementing the initiative. Additional columns are provided within the matrix to
     support the subjective scoring with the best available objective information.
     Preliminary source data previously identified in the IRT (3.4.5.1.2) must be validated
     before going further. After completing the tasking matrix, the RWG approves which
     initiatives should proceed forward with a comprehensive BCA or policy evaluation.
     The RWG documents the reasons when initiatives are not selected for further
     analysis, and the OPR retains that information for future reference. The RWG will
     determine the prioritization of effort by the AMC staff in support of accomplishing
     the comprehensive BCAs and policy evaluations. As identified in 3.4.5.1.2.2., the
     IRT will periodically review the prioritization and make recommendations for RWG
     consideration.
        3.4.5.1.5.1. The following Directorates are considered voting board members:
        A1, A3, A4, A5/8, A6, A7, A9, FM, ST, TE, 18AF/CV, 618/CV, MA to
        AMC/CC, ANG Assistant to AMC/CC, AFRC Reserve advisor to AMC/CC, and
        ANG advisor to AMC/CC. After completion of the RWG, the FEO will compile
        the minutes and disseminate them out to the Board for review and approval. The
        Board members will acknowledge receipt of the minutes and confirm that they are
        in concurrence with the minutes. If a Board member dissents and does not concur
        with the RWG minutes their concerns will be documented. The RWG initiative
        prioritization with all non-concurring comments will be submitted to the
        AMC/CV for adjudication and approval.
        3.4.5.1.5.2. Initiative Champions then submit the approved selected initiatives to
        the appropriate MDS R&PC Crew Operations Review Team (CORT) and Support
        Operations Review Team (SORT).
     3.4.5.1.6. Step 6 BCA/Policy Evaluation. Initiative Champions serve as OPR for the
     development of BCAs/PEs initiated at MAJCOM level involving their functional
     area. The steps for a policy evaluation are consistent with those for a comprehensive
     BCA. AMC/FMPC acts as Office of Coordinating Responsibility (OCR) for
     preparation of BCAs initiated at the MAJCOM level. The initiative Champion
     together with the FMPC cost analyst initiates a ―kickoff meeting‖ with a team of
     OCRs necessary to define the objective and scope of the proposed initiative,
     formulate alternatives, make assumptions, and provide or gather operational,
AMCI16-102 23 NOVEMBER 2011                                                              13


       technical and cost data necessary for reviewers to replicate the analysis. The
       initiative champion and the cost analyst will oversee the team that is conducting and
       writing the sections of the comprehensive BCA. The comprehensive BCA supports
       an implementation and prioritization decision. During BCA development, the
       initiative champion should become familiar with potential implementation strategies
       and the requirements documents that may be required (SRD, CDD/Capabilities
       Production Document (CPD), 1067, etc.). For initiatives that are policy changes a
       Policy Evaluation similar in format to a comprehensive BCA will be conducted
       following the same procedures as a comprehensive BCA.
          3.4.5.1.6.1. Stakeholder Meeting.         A stakeholders’ meeting validates and
          approves the comprehensive BCA problem statement, background, alternatives,
          and desired end state criteria that resulted from the kickoff meeting.
          3.4.5.1.6.2. Analysis. During the analysis phase, the BCA documents the
          authoritative data sources, performs a cost-benefit analysis, conducts a
          risk/sensitivity analysis, identifies funding requirements and drafts
          mission/business impacts.
          3.4.5.1.6.3. First Draft. The first draft of the BCA is submitted for AMC four-
          letter review. AMC four-letter review coordinates on the draft comparative
          analysis, draft recommendation, draft change management plan, and draft
          executive summary.
          3.4.5.1.6.4. Second Draft. The second draft of the BCA is submitted for AMC
          three-letter review. AMC three-letter review will coordinate on the completed
          cost-benefit analysis, finished risk/sensitivity analysis and completed
          recommendation/change management plan/executive summary.
          3.4.5.1.6.5. Final Draft. The final draft is submitted for AMC two-letter
          coordination. The final draft incorporates all adjudicated AMC four-letter and
          three-letter comments. Upon completed coordination, an executive level
          summary out brief of the BCA will be prepared and briefed to the FM and
          initiative Champion’s two-letter functional for approval to proceed with the final
          draft and for AMC two-letter coordination. For initiatives requiring TWCF, some
          BCAs may require a certified analysis, in this situation, follow the guidance for
          certification as found in section 1.4 of AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis.
          3.4.5.1.6.6. Publish BCA. After the adjudication of AMC two-letter comments,
          the BCA is approved and published. The published BCA is provided to the
          Initiative Champion for use in Step 7, Initiative Prioritization.
       3.4.5.1.7. Step 7 Initiative Prioritization. The FEO chairs the FE R&PC with AMC
       Directorate representation. The initiative champions along with subject matter
       experts should attend to support initiative discussion. Using the results from the
       BCAs and PEs, the R&PC evaluates all mature initiatives against a prioritization
       matrix (Attachment 9, FEO Standardized Initiative Prioritization Template)
       consisting of 8 scored areas. Each area is given an analytical score (both objective
       and subjective) to prioritize initiatives for presentation to AMC/CV. The list of
       projects is presented as a single, integrated, prioritized list of initiatives.
14                                                         AMCI16-102 23 NOVEMBER 2011


             3.4.5.1.7.1. The following Directorates are considered voting board members:
             A1, A3, A4, A5/8, A6, A7, A9, FM, ST, TE, 18AF/CV, 618/CV, MA to
             AMC/CC, ANG Assistant to AMC/CC, AFRC Reserve advisor to AMC/CC, and
             ANG advisor to AMC/CC. After completion of the R&PC, the FEO will compile
             the minutes and disseminate them out to the Board for review and approval. The
             Board members will acknowledge receipt of the minutes and confirm that they are
             in concurrence with the minutes. If a Board member dissents and does not concur
             with the R&PC recommendation their concerns will be documented. The R&PC
             prioritized list of initiatives for implementation along with all non-concurring
             comments will be submitted to the AMC/CV for adjudication and approval (see
             Step 8).
         3.4.5.1.8. Step 8 AMC/CV Approval. The R&PC approved FE Initiative Matrix,
         along with proposed funding strategies and project plans, is presented to the FEGB
         (AMC/CV) for approval.
         3.4.5.1.9. Step 9 Acquisition Process. Approved initiatives are submitted to the
         applicable Configuration Review Boards (CRB), MDS R&PCs, IT Requirements
         Process and to the applicable AMC PEMs for advocacy in the AMC Corporate
         Structure. All applicable requirement documents (1067s, Configuration Control
         Document (CCD), CPD, etc.) are finalized and funding obtained for implementation.
         3.4.5.1.10. Step 10 Execution. The initiative is executed and fuel efficiencies
         tracked. Execution may require development, production, and/or publication. The
         initiative champion will monitor and track initiative execution and performance. The
         execution step is a continuous feedback process. Periodic review will be scheduled to
         evaluate the performance of an executed initiative. The feedback will generate one of
         three outcomes; 1) New idea may be generated based upon initiative feedback, 2)
         Initiative may proceed as normal or with minor modification (not sufficient to warrant
         a new idea), or 3) Initiative may be terminated.
  3.4.6. I/PMR Process. The FE Initiative Champions provide periodic project and program
  reviews to the FEO and other key stakeholders using a standardized template provided by
  AMC FEO. The schedule for program reviews will be based upon the current status/phase of
  the initiative. The I/PMR process instills rigorous ongoing management oversight of all
  initiatives being analyzed, as well as previously approved initiatives. The I/PMR process
  will be utilized throughout the entire life cycle of an idea/initiative. The I/PMR process will
  continue and be repeated in step 10 of the initiative process until termination of the initiative.
     3.4.6.1. Track, Measure, and Validate Results. The AMC/FEO, in accordance with roles
     and responsibilities detailed in section 4, supervises efforts to track, measure, and
     validate results.
         3.4.6.1.1. Confirm baseline, determine additional required metrics, and establish
         tracking mechanisms,
AMCI16-102 23 NOVEMBER 2011                                                     15


       3.4.6.1.2. Ensure collection and organization of data,
       3.4.6.1.3. Compare metrics against planned outcomes,
       3.4.6.1.4. Feedback and Adjustment. The FEO provides feedback to the FEGB at
       least annually on the status of each initiative with regard to outcomes and
       recommendations.
