SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision reorganized the
format of chapters and paragraphs for increased understanding with chapter two applicable to all crew
positions, chapter three applicable to instructors, and following chapters applicable to individual crew
positions. Grading criteria tables have been standardized across crew positions where applicable and
2                                                                                               AFI11-2EC-130JV2 27 JUNE 2008


expanded to include specific grading criteria. Evaluation methods are identified by notes in the crew spe-
cific tables as: in-flight only; in-flight and/or in simulator; and in-flight and/or alternate methods. Guid-
ance was added allowing Weapon System Trainers (WSTs) to be used to accomplish evaluations or
portions of evaluations if certified by HQ AFSOC/A3T and A3V. Guidance was clarified on the use of
SPOT evaluations to document Special Qualification Evaluations. Multiple Qualification guidance was
clarified. Emergency Procedures Evaluation, publications checks, and Cockpit/Crew Resource Manage-
ment guidance was added. In Table 2.1., aircrew discipline and airmanship/situational awareness have
been added as critical subareas. In Table 3.1., all “Instructor” subareas have been modified to reflect the
Command standard and are no longer graded as critical.

                                      GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and flight phases
of initial, requalification and periodic flight evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will be conducted In Accor-
dance With (IAW) this instruction and AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, as
supplemented. Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the profi-
ciency and capabilities of aircrews. Flight examiners use the AFI when conducting aircrew evaluations.
Instructors use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification.

1.2. Applicability. This volume is applicable to all individuals performing crew duties on EC-130J and
assigned BAI aircraft.

1.3. Key words and definitions.
   1.3.1. “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. “Should” is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplish-
   ment.
   1.3.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. “Note” indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to emphasize.

1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is Air Force Special Operations Com-
mand (AFSOC) Director of Operations, A3. Waiver requests should be submitted thru AFSOC Standard-
ization and Evaluation channels to the A3.

1.5. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation profiles
that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. MAJCOMs will forward a copy of MAJCOM
supplements to Headquarters (HQ) Air Force (AF)/A3O-AT, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval.
Units below MAJCOM level will forward one copy of each supplement to their MAJCOM OPR for
pre-publication review.

1.6. Evaluation Procedures. Before the Aircraft Commander (AC) Briefing, the evaluator will inform
the AC of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose,
and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria, prior to flight. The exam-
inee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations Planning Team or Deployment Plan-
ning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and
completeness of all mission-planning paperwork. Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary
charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any additional items they deem necessary.
   1.6.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior to ini-
   tial/requalification evaluations.
   1.6.2. The examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a recurring evaluation.
   1.6.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations, but may
   deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
6                                                                    AFI11-2EC-130JV2 27 JUNE 2008


    1.6.4. Under no circumstances will a pilot or flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow to below one
    engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca), regardless of airspeed tolerances listed for
    specific areas.
    1.6.5. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the critique,
    the flight examiner will review the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area/sub area grades
    assigned, and any additional training required.

1.7. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2, as supple-
mented and this volume. Examiners will use the criteria contained in this volume to accomplish all flight,
simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight
examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.
    1.7.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U)
    grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
       1.7.1.1. Q. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
       knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed tolerances
       and accomplished the assigned mission.
       1.7.1.2. Q-. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea tasks, but
       requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner. Deviations from
       established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
       1.7.1.3. U. Assign a U area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance outside allow-
       able parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mis-
       sion accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of U
       normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the flight examiner, additional
       training will not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case,
       the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
    1.7.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member in
    order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member receives an unqualified
    grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be unqualified. Critical areas
    are identified by “(Critical)” in the area title and by shading of the Q- block on the appropriate
    AFSOC Form 48, Flight Evaluation.

1.8. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s missions. Evalu-
ation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all crewmembers are con-
tained in Table 2.1. Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1. Evaluation areas unique to each crew
position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew specific chapter defines required events. Eval-
uation methods are identified by notes in the crew specific tables and include: in-flight only; in-flight and/
or in simulator (see paragraph 1.8.1.); and in-flight and/or alternate methods (see paragraph 1.8.2.). For
areas without a note, flight examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are
not observed, then the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.
    1.8.1. Simulator. Weapon System Trainers (WSTs) with a C or greater certification (or training value
    code of 3 or greater for all areas evaluated as determined by simulator certification may be used to
    accomplish evaluations. Simulator certifications will be located at the HQ AFSOC/A3T website. Do
    not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the simulator.
AFI11-2EC-130JV2 27 JUNE 2008                                                                                7


   EXCEPTION: Instrument (INSTM) evaluations. Initial mission and special qualification evaluations
   must be accomplished in the aircraft.
       1.8.1.1. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in flight, and the event is certified for eval-
       uation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to complete the evaluation.
       Document in the comments section of the appropriate AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualifi-
       cation, which portion(s) of evaluation were conducted in simulator.
   1.8.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in flight due to equipment mal-
   functions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, that area may be evaluated by
   an alternate method (i.e., procedural trainer, or verbal examination). If, in the flight examiner’s judg-
   ment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an
   additional flight.
   1.8.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the grading crite-
   ria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when the wording of areas
   is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner judgment will be the determin-
   ing factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the over-
   all grade.
       1.8.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable aircraft.
       In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee applies prompt correc-
       tive action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety.

1.9. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart jeopardizing
safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the examiner’s flight duty
period does not exceed AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules requirements). This does not mean the exam-
iner must assume the examinee's position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the exam-
iner feels the examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the
examinee's duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee's duties, assign a Qualification
Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade. Evaluators must report deviations/discrepancies from established pro-
cedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual's crew specialty, to squadron/group com-
mander for evaluation and necessary action in accordance with MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V2.

1.10. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training, at their
discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented. Any
approved training device or medium may be used for additional training. Additional training may be
accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation, when unique situations present valuable training
opportunities (i.e., crosswind landings). However, this option requires flight examiner discretion and judi-
cious application. The examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.

1.11. Rechecks. Dependent upon the item requiring the recheck, rechecks may be accomplished in flight,
or through an alternate method at the discretion of the flight examiner. Rechecks will normally be admin-
istered by a flight examiner other than the one who administered the original evaluation.

1.12. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that are not
universal to all members in that crew position. Special qualification evaluations may be conducted sepa-
rately or in conjunction with the qualification/mission evaluations. After qualification, areas can be
8                                                                   AFI11-2EC-130JV2 27 JUNE 2008


graded as part of periodic Mission Evals. There are no requisites for special qualification evaluations
unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew position for any special qualification evaluation require-
ments.
    1.12.1. Special qualifications result on the appropriate AF Form 8. Document IAW AFI 11-202V2 as
    SPOT evaluations. Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crewmembers qualified, this doc-
    umentation is still required due to intrafly and permanent change of station issues.

1.13. Instructor Certified Events. These are events that require certification of training by an instructor
or flight examiner, not an evaluation. Document certification per MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V1

                                         ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter apply to all crew positions and all
evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required duties safely
and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW applicable technical orders,
instructions, and directives.

2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crewmembers on areas listed in Table 2.1. and evaluate instructors on
areas listed in Table 3.1.
   2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as a req-
   uisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2 and applicable supplements.
   2.2.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). An EPE is a requisite for all flight evaluations
   except special mission evaluations. EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by
   another method determined by the examiner or unit standardization/evaluations. Operations group
   standardization/evaluations (OGVs) may develop EPE guides for each crew position for flight exam-
   iner use. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew position. The EPE will
   include areas commensurate with the examinee's qualification and experience level. Emphasize emer-
   gency procedures and systems knowledge. Examiners should include other general knowledge areas
   as well. For mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations. EPEs will
   include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the examinee's knowledge of systems
   and procedures to the flight examiner's satisfaction.
       2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The examinee must
       recite all BOLDFACE items from memory and should provide the initial steps of emergency pro-
       cedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time for reference.
       2.2.2.2. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs for all crew
       positions.
           2.2.2.2.1. Q-1. Satisfactory systems/procedural knowledge. Operated within prescribed limits
           and correctly diagnosed problems. Performed and/or explained proper corrective action, in the
           proper sequence, for each type of malfunction. Accomplished all required checklists and/or
           effectively used available aids. Thoroughly described the location, use and limitations of
           emergency equipment.
           2.2.2.2.2. Q-2. Marginal systems/procedural knowledge. Slow to analyze problems or apply
           proper corrective actions. Did not effectively use checklist and/or available aids. Minor omis-
           sions or deviations in describing the location, use and limitations of emergency equipment.
           2.2.2.2.3. Q-3. Unsatisfactory systems/procedural knowledge. Unable to analyze problem or
           take corrective action. Failed to accomplish required checklists and/or unable to locate infor-
           mation in available aids. Major omissions or deviations in describing the location, use and lim-
           itations of emergency equipment.
   2.2.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). In accordance with AFI 11-290, Cockpit/
   Crew Resource Management Training Program, CRM skills will be evaluated during initial and peri-
   odic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight; therefore no specific area titled CRM
10                                                                  AFI11-2EC-130JV2 27 JUNE 2008


      exists. CRM skills are imbedded within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situa-
      tional awareness, crew coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task man-
      agement, and briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills
      Criteria Training/ Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF IMT 4031 is unnecessary for evalua-
      tions.
      2.2.4. Formal Course Evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated for the type of evaluation
      flown, IAW guidance in this volume. Grade training objectives and related areas using the perfor-
      mance criteria in this volume.
      2.2.5. Publications Check. Required for all Qualification (QUAL) or combined QUAL/Mission
      (MSN) evaluations as outlined in area 11 criteria of General Areas.

                                         PILOT EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. The criteria contained here and in Chapter 2 apply to all pilot flight evaluations. The fol-
lowing general criteria in Table 4.1. apply during all phases of flight except as noted for specific events
and instrument final approaches.

Table 4.1. General Criteria.
                Altitude                 +/- 200 feet
                Airspeed                 + 10/- 5knots (but not less than Vmca)
       Q
                Course                   +/- 5 degrees/3 Nautical Mile (nm) (whichever is greater)
                TACAN Arc                +/- 2 nm)
                Altitude                 +/- 300 feet
                Airspeed                 +15/- 10knots (but not less than Vmca)
      Q-
                Course                   +/- 10 degrees/5 nm (whichever is greater)
                TACAN Arc                +/- 3 nm
       U                                 Exceeded Q- limits

4.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all pilot duties safely
and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW applicable technical orders,
directives and published procedures.

4.3. Requirements.
     4.3.1. Instrument/Qualification. See Table 4.2. for required evaluation areas.
        4.3.1.1. Initial/Requalification Evaluations. Initial, re-qualification and aircraft commander
        upgrade evaluations update the eligibility for instructor (INST)/QUAL evaluations. If an initial or
        re-qualification (return to active flight duties) evaluation is administered in-unit, all required areas
        from Table 4.2. must be evaluated. The unit commander determines the minimum events due to
        “Q-3” or “out of eligibility” re-qualification. Instructor upgrade evaluations may update the eligi-
        bility for INST/QUAL if requirements in paragraph 4.3.1.2. are met.
        4.3.1.2. Periodic Instrument/Qualification. Instrument evaluations may not be conducted sepa-
        rately from qualification evaluations. Pilot INST/QUAL evaluations should include approaches to
        airfields other than home station or deployed locations, if possible. Do not complete an INST/
        QUAL evaluation unless, as a minimum, the following are observed in flight: An instrument take-
        off, one coupled precision approach; two non-precision approaches (Note: One of the approaches
        must be a hand flown simulated engine out (AC/Instructor Pilot (IP) only) and one must be flown
        as a simulated Bus Interface Unit backup approach); one 3-engine go-around (AC/IP only); at
        least one partial flap (50% and/or no flap (AC/IP only)); and 100 percent flap landing.
     4.3.2. Mission. See Table 4.2. for required evaluation areas.
AFI11-2EC-130JV2 27 JUNE 2008                                                                            21


        4.3.2.1. Initial/Requalification Mission. Initial/requal mission qualification is conducted at the
        193 SOW and updates the eligibility for the mission evaluation. All required areas from Table 4.2.
        must be evaluated. The unit commander determines the minimum events due to “Q-3” or “out of
        eligibility” re-qualification. The mission profile will include the minimum requirements of a Com-
        bat Mission Sortie. This will include the following: Thorough mission planning, pre-briefing and
        debriefing, and flying consisting of an actual or simulated threat scenario using combat checklists.
        The sortie must encompass at least two of the following four components:
           4.3.2.1.1. Air Refueling (AR): All AR checklists must be completed, as well as a rendezvous
           with the tanker, pre-contact, contact, and post refueling procedures.
           4.3.2.1.2. Defensive Tactics/Threat Avoidance Maneuvers: The crew will accomplish at least
           one ground-based threat avoidance scenario. Additionally, a simulated air-to-air engagement
           defensive scenario is desirable.
           4.3.2.1.3. Mission Systems Officer (MSO): Any sortie with a mission crew that completes
           Electronic Communications System (ECS) or MSO events. This component should be
           planned to include a minimum of one hour of mission system operations.
           4.3.2.1.4. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operation: Includes an actual NVG airland profile.
        4.3.2.2. Periodic Mission. Follow the same requirements as the Initial Mission evaluation.
   4.3.3. Special Qualifications. Air refueling will be evaluated using the criteria in Table 4.2.

ingly. For instrument approaches, the examinee should utilize a normal glide slope from either the deci-
sion height or from a point where visual acquisition of the runway environment is made.
