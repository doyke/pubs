          ink/pencil.
       2.4.3. After the review, the corrected copy of the MIS (67034) will be placed in the box
       for PS&D distribution box located with the 700th AS. The AVUM will keep a copy for
       his/her files.
       2.4.4. For the monthly review, the AVUM will email a copy of a locally devised flying
       hour tracking sheet. This sheet will be verified with the monthly audit from GO81.
   2.5. Current Operations: The Chief of Current Operations is responsible for ensuring flying
   hours are effectively managed and all allocated hours are flown by the completion of the

     3.1. In the event of GO81 system failure, the MOC will make copies of the original AFTO
     781 (original will be given back to the aircrew). Once GO81 is restored, the MOC will enter
     the flying hours into the MIS and give all copies of the AFTO 78 l’s to P&S. P&S will
     perform the audit as usual.
     3.2. In the event an aircraft returns after normal hours, the original AFTO Form 781’s will
     remain with the aircraft forms and will be locked in the battery compartment (MEGP’s will
     be responsible for ensuring this happens) until a formal debrief can be performed.
