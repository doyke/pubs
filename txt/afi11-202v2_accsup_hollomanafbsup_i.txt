       2.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) Determine the effectiveness of the Stan/Eval program and
       compliance with all applicable publications.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                        15


     2.5.2.2. (Added-ACC) Assess the capability of the Chief of Stan/Eval, flight examiners,
     instructors and unit crewmembers to evaluate, instruct and perform the unit's assigned
     taskings.
     2.5.2.3. (Added-ACC) Identify operational or training factors adversely affecting
     aircrew capability to accomplish the assigned mission and initiate corrective actions as
     required.
     2.5.2.4. (Added-ACC) Verify       aircrew   compliance     with   approved    operational
     procedures.
     2.5.2.5. (Added-ACC) Provide meaningful feedback to commanders from a broad
     viewpoint as well as the specific evaluation of the existing evaluation criteria. The unit
     operation will be evaluated covering the entire period stemming from the last ASEV, not
     just a ―snapshot‖ of the unit‘s current program status.
  2.5.3. (Added-ACC) Notification Procedures:
     2.5.3.1. (Added-ACC) The evaluation OPR will send a ASEV notification
     message/memorandum to the unit with an info copy to ACC/A3TV 60 days before the
     evaluation. For AFRC/ANG evaluations, notification will be sent to the units and
     AFRC/A3V and 10AF/A3V or the State Adjutant General and NGB/A3O. The intent of
     this message/memorandum is to confirm the dates of the evaluation and inform the unit
     of the scope of the evaluation and support requirements. As a minimum, the
     message/memorandum will include the following:
        2.5.3.1.1. (Added-ACC) Approximate number of team members.
        2.5.3.1.2. (Added-ACC) Planned arrival date.
        2.5.3.1.3. (Added-ACC) Support required as necessary.
        2.5.3.1.4. (Added-ACC) Additional guidance on the selection of individuals and/or
        crews the team chief desires to evaluate--to include the Chief of Stan/Eval and/or
        Senior Examiners.
     2.5.3.2. (Added-ACC) Thirty days prior to the evaluation, a follow-up
     message/memorandum will include name, rank, security clearance, restricted area badge
     number, MDS and crew position of each team member.
  2.5.4. (Added-ACC) Conduct of Evaluations:
     2.5.4.1. (Added-ACC) Units will receive an overall grade of Complies (C) or Does not
     Comply (DNC). The MAJCOM/A3 (for PRUs or DRUs) or NAF/CC is the final
     approval authority for the unit‘s overall grade. Individual grades for performance and/or
     program(s) are based on a three-tier system and will receive grades of Complies (C),
     Complies with comments (CWC) or Does not Comply (DNC). The evaluation team
     when grading performance and/or program(s) areas or applicable sub-areas, will use the
     following grading criteria:
        2.5.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Complies: Performance/program met or exceeded
        mission requirements and complied with applicable directives. The program had no
        findings. If errors and/or deviations existed, they were minor and did not affect
        mission accomplishment or safety. Processes were well-defined, effective and
16              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


        efficiently executed. Performance/program was high quality and indicative of
        positive leadership involvement.
        2.5.4.1.2. (Added-ACC)Complies with Comments (CWC): Performance/program
        met mission requirements.   Findings existed that did not affect mission
        accomplishment or safety.
        2.5.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) Does not Comply (DNC): Performance/program did not
        meet mission requirements and/or comply with applicable directives. Findings
        existed that affected mission accomplishment or safety. Effectiveness was degraded
        by deviations from or omission of procedures. Processes were not well-defined,
        effective or efficiently executed. Performance/program was poor quality and
        indicated lack of leadership involvement.
            2.5.4.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) DNC/CWC             Corrective       Actions. The    unit
            commander will take immediate corrective actions on any safety related
            discrepancies documented by the evaluation Team Chief. Within 10 working
            days of receipt of the approved evaluation report, the unit commander will submit
            a plan addressing corrective actions on all CWC or DNC programs. The unit
            commander will submit regular progress reports to the approval authority and the
            approval authority will make the final determination when programs have been
            corrected to a C level.
     2.5.4.2. (Added-ACC) MAJCOM/NAF Flying-Related Special Interest Items (SIIs).
     SIIs will be evaluated during ASEV/SAVs. Compliance will be reflected in all ratings
     and evaluations, and will be commented on separately in ASEV/SAV reports.
     2.5.4.3. (Added-ACC) Not more than 25 percent of total aircrew will be evaluated
     during the evaluation using SPOT evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.5. Evaluations should
     include crewmembers of various experience levels and crew positions. Crewmembers
     maintaining multiple qualifications may be evaluated in either aircraft. Flight examiners
     may receive an Objectivity Evaluation (flight or ground).
        2.5.4.3.1. (Added-ACC) Full notice evaluations are appropriate for those
        administered by unit flight examiners where a HHQ flight examiner will observe and
        administer a Flight Examiner Objectivity Evaluation. The full flight evaluation
        profile should be planned by the examinee. These evaluations will constitute an
        evaluation of the examinee (conducted by the unit flight examiner), as well as the unit
        flight examiner's objectivity and the unit's flight evaluation profiles (conducted by the
        HHQ Flight Examiner).
        2.5.4.3.2. (Added-ACC) No-notice evaluations will be administered to individuals
        by notifying the unit at an appropriate time (if the individual is already on the flying
        schedule) or by requesting that an individual be added to the next day's schedule for
        this purpose.     Any additional or unique HHQ flight examiner evaluation
        requirements, beyond the scheduled mission profile, will be communicated to the
        examinee no later than 24 hours prior to designated aircrew briefing to facilitate
        mission planning.
        2.5.4.3.3. (Added-ACC) Flight evaluations/EPEs administered by HHQ flight
        examiners within 6 months of a ASEV may be counted toward the flight evaluation
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                           17


            sample for that evaluation. If this option is exercised, all intermediate flight
            evaluations by HHQ flight examiners (including evaluation team designated
            augmentees) must count toward that sample. The unit DO or OG/CC must be
            coordinated with prior to the 6 month period.
            2.5.4.3.4. (Added-ACC) Examiners will notify the commander and Team Chief
            when the examinee‘s performance is less than Q-1. As a minimum, the examiner will
            provide a detailed debriefing to the Team Chief at the earliest opportunity. For
            evaluations, regardless of mission profile, ―SPOT‖ will be entered in the flight phase
            block of the AF Form 8/8a, unless conducted in conjunction with a pre-coordinated
            recurring evaluation or a pyramid evaluation.
            2.5.4.3.5. (Added-ACC) All evaluation examiners shall use the following statement
            as the first line following the Mission Description in the comments block on the AF
            Form 8/8a: ―This evaluation was administered during an ACC (or NAF) ASEV.‖
            Document all supervisory attendance during mission debriefings. Furthermore, if in
            your opinion the examinee‘s performance demonstrated exceptional skill and
            knowledge in all phases of the evaluation, state the words "EXCEPTIONALLY
            QUALIFIED" on the first line of the Comments section preceding ―Examiner‘s
            Remarks‖. This distinction should be reserved for those performances that are truly
            exceptional and are clearly justifiable.
         2.5.4.4. (Added-ACC) In addition to aircrew flight evaluations, all available
         CMR/BMC aircrew will be administered a 50 question closed book written examination
         from the specific MDS MQF and have their flight publications evaluated. Flight
         publication checks will include all issued flight manuals/T.O.s, checklists, and OGV
         issued aircrew aids.
            2.5.4.4.1. (Added-ACC) The written examination administered during an ASEV
            may fulfill either the requisite closed-book examination requirement, if it meets all
            the appropriate criteria, or the semi-annual test requirement at the discretion of the
            OG/CC.
            2.5.4.4.2. (Added-ACC) The minimum passing grade for the written examination is
            85%.

                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
   3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
   OG/CC.
3.2. Operations Group. OG/OGV is responsible for all Stan/Eval functions unless delegated
to subordinate squadrons.

   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
          3.2.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Provide a suitable facility and resources to accommodate
          the Stan/Eval function.
       3.2.1.2. Designate OG Stan/Eval (OGV) flight examiners (see paragraph 4.2.3).
       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.3. (ACC) Ensure adequate aircrew briefing facilities are provided at the unit level.
       Attachment 8 (Added) of this supplement contains guidance for the minimum mission
       planning materials required to conduct an adequate aircrew briefing.
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.4. (ACC) A suitable Stan/Eval testing facility is one that provides a quiet,
       distraction-free atmosphere and allows easy monitoring of examinees by Stan/Eval
       personnel.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).
       3.2.1.6. Chair the SEB.
       3.2.1.7. Establish procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated Stan/Eval software.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
22              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


     3.2.2.2. (ACC) Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 803,
     Report of Task Evaluations, IAW GA applicable AFI Vol. 2.
     3.2.2.3. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
     (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
     3.2.2.3. (ACC) Establish procedures to review unit AF Form 623, Individual Training
     Record Tab 5 for Pararescue personnel and Individual Training and Evaluation Folder
     (ITEF) Tab 5 for Combat Rescue Officers.
     3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
     3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
     3.2.2.5. (HOLLOMANAFB) A trend is defined as a recurring deficiency requiring
     corrective action. A trend occurs when: 1) an exam question is answered incorrectly
     ≥20% of the time with a sample size ≥20, or 2) an evaluation area/subarea is downgraded
     during ≥15% of administered evaluations. The 49 OG/CC is the final authority for trend
     designation.
        3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.5.1. (ACC) Trend analysis will include all flight and EP evaluations as well as
        all requisite and periodic written examinations. ACC Form 8a or PEX may be used to
        document trend information. Any documents used to track trend information will be
        kept and disposed of IAW instructions on title page of this supplement.
        3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
        discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
        instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
        3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
        3.2.2.5.4. (ACC) Trends should be closed only after the OPR verifies the deficiency
        in performance or knowledge no longer exists in the applicable crew force. Such
        verification may be accomplished and documented through supplementary
        evaluation, aircrew testing, etc.
        3.2.2.5.4. (HOLLOMANAFB) Corrective actions may include, but are not limited
        to: tailored periodic testing, Flight Examiner (FE) training emphasis, squadron
        Special Interest Items (SIIs), and/or bulletin board slides with appropriate
        information. Corrective action effectiveness will be verified with control measures.
        Control measures may include, but are not limited to: supplementary/SPOT/no-
        notice evaluations, testing, and/or tape reviews.
        3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
        Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
        the trend was identified.
     3.2.2.6. Conduct supplementary evaluations as directed by the OG/CC.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                     23


       3.2.2.6.1. (Added-ACC) Establish unit supplementary evaluation program and goals
       IAW paragraph 9.4.
       3.2.2.6.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) Supplemental Evaluations (Sup Eval) will be
       conducted as necessary with OG/CC approval. 49 OG/OGV will provide the

   (applies to both the examinee as well as any accompanying aircrew).
      4.3.6.1. (Added-ACC) Reporting Deviations by Like/Unlike Specialty: Evaluators,
      conducting evaluations or performing flight examiner, instructor, or aircrew duties must
      report aircrew members (within their aircraft or formation regardless of the individual's
      crew specialty) not receiving an evaluation who commit significant deviations from
      established procedures/directives to the Chief of OGV and unit supervision for necessary
      action (e.g. commander directed downgrade).
   4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee‘s squadron commander (or available
   supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
   or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
   4.3.7. (ACC) The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) is considered an appropriate substitute for
   unit supervisors in their absence.
   4.3.7. (HOLLOMANAFB) In addition to verbally notifying supervision, FEs will fill out
   the applicable items on Attachment 14 and forward it to the squadron CC, DO, TOP 3,

   49 OG/CC approval is required for an FE to conduct multiple simultaneous evaluations.
4.4. Senior Flight Examiner Program.
   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
   assigned aircraft.
      4.4.1.1. NAF/CVs and OG/CDs may perform this function if the principal incumbent is
      not qualified or available.
      4.4.1.2. OG/CDs that fly different MDSs from the OG/CC in multi-MDS wings, or
      occupy a different crew position in the same MDS, may be designated as senior flight
      examiners at the OG/CC‘s discretion.
      4.4.1.3. Document designations IAW paragraph 4.2.3.2.
   4.4.2. Individuals eligible for Senior flight examiner status do not require, nor do they have
   to maintain, instructor qualification, but they must have completed flight examiner
   certification IAW unit standards.
   4.4.2. (ACC) Senior Flight Examiners will not perform instructor duties unless instructor
   qualified. Senior Examiners will not conduct initial or requalification instructor evaluations
   unless instructor qualified. Senior Examiner upgrade and documentation will be outlined in
   the unit supplement of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
   4.4.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) With 49 OG/CC approval, senior upgrading FEs may utilize an
   upgrade program tailored to their experience/previous qualification level. This program will
   be documented in the FEs Certification Checklist (Attachment 13).

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
   5.1.2. (ACC) Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in units supplements
   if required.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
5.2. (ACC) Use of simulators for the flight phase of flight evaluations is not approved by HQ
ACC, unless flight phases/events evaluated are certified as Training Value Code (TVC) 1 or
conducted in FAA CAT C or D simulators. RPAs may use an approved ATD for flight
evaluations IAW AFI11-2MDS-Vol2.
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
34              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


        5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
        under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
        requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew‘s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit‘s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. (ACC) Units falling under this paragraph will add MSN to the type of
        evaluation given on the Form 8 (e.g. QUAL/MSN).
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft‘s operational or DOC statement missions.
        5.2.3.2.3. (Added-ACC) Units will determine the scope of these evaluations and
        adhere to the appropriate overall grading criteria in this volume. Tactical
        employment subareas will be evaluated and graded according to parameters in AFI
        11-2MDS Volume 2.
        5.2.3.2.3. (HOLLOMANAFB) Local MSN evaluations should use 49 OG/OGV-
        approved profiles/scenarios located in the 49 OG/OGV FE Briefing Guide. Refer to
        AFI 11-2MDS specific Vol 2 for mission specifics. CCV is responsible for MSN
        evaluation profile/scenario management.
            5.2.3.2.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) T-38 MSN evaluations will primarily
            be red air execution. CCV is responsible for MSN evaluation profile/scenario
            management.
        5.2.3.2.4. (Added-ACC) BMC aircrew members will be evaluated on their ability to
        fly missions routinely performed by the examinee.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                           35


     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.1. (ACC) The emphasis on an initial instructor evaluation should be placed
        on examinee demonstration of instructional ability. This does not preclude the update
        of a required periodic evaluation if all required flight phase requirements are
        completed during the instructor flight evaluation and the examinee subsequently
        completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the periods
        described in paragraph 5.5.3. Label the evaluation appropriately (EXAMPLE:
        "INIT INSTR/MSN"). Do not add on missions (sorties) to complete the requirements
        for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
     5.2.5.2. (ACC) HHQ flight examiners can administer SPOT checks at anytime in any
     MDS. Crew position annotation will be IAW para. 3.4.4., AFI11-401_ACCSUP,
     Aviation Management.
        5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
        QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
36              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
         5.2.5.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) RPA Launch and Recovery (LR) aircrews
         will have a SPOT evaluation designating qualification in launch and recovery. This
         evaluation will be designated as SPOT (LR) on AF Form 8. If the SPOT (LR) eval is
         combined with another eval, list it on the same line with and behind the other
         qualifications on AF Form 8. If it is conducted on a separate day list it on a separate
         line. For SPOT (LR) evaluations not combined with another evaluation, list the
         examinee‘s crew position as their LR crew position (do not list them as an instructor
         if not a LR IP or ISO) in accordance with paragraph 7.3.4.3.3 Do not issue an
         expiration date for the SPOT (LR) eval. As long as LR currency is maintained, all
         SPOT (LR) evaluations will be re-hacked during the QUAL evaluation window.
     5.2.5.4. (Added-ACC) Flight examiner Objectivity Evaluations. An evaluation of
     the objectivity and skill of a lower echelon flight examiner in administering a
     flight/EP/ATD evaluation. Use SPOT as the type of evaluation under the Ground or
     Flight Phase, then explain in the mission description that the evaluation was a Flight
     examiner Objectivity Evaluation. Overall rating for this type of an evaluation will be
     either qualified (1) or unqualified (3).
         5.2.5.4.1. (Added-ACC) The grading criteria in Attachment 9 (Added) will be used.
         5.2.5.4.2. (Added-ACC) A qualified rating (1) indicates that the flight examiner
         objectivity examinee complied with HHQ and local Stan/Eval directives, properly
         briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the
         correct grade for each evaluated area, awarded the appropriate overall grade and, if
         required, assigned appropriate additional training.
         5.2.5.4.3. (Added-ACC) An unqualified rating (3) will be awarded when the flight
         examiner failed to satisfy the requirements of a qualification rating (1). The
         certification of the lower level flight examiner receiving an unqualified flight
         examiner Objectivity Evaluation will be determined by the SQ/CC or OG/CC as
         applicable. The SQ/CC or OG/CC may, at his/her discretion issue a commander
         directed AF Form 8 for the examinee based upon the higher level flightexaminer
         recommendation.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                         37


    5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
    qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
    MSN, INIT INSTR).
    5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
    qualification due to:
       5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
       guidance for that periodic evaluation.
       5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
       1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
       The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
       those items for which the individual is non-current.
       5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
       IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
       5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
       paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
       Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
       5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
           5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
           complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
           flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
           the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
           the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
           5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
           qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
    5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
       5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
       daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
       5.2.6.3.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) No-notice evaluations can be used by the SQ/CC to
       check the progress of aircrew members with a previous Q2/3 eval, to see whether
       someone is ready for an upgrade, or provide an assessment of an individual.
       5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
       evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. ―Normal
       preparation‖ will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
       5.2.6.3.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) Individuals will be notified of a no-notice
       evaluation no more than 4 hours prior to scheduled brief time, or no sooner than 4
       hours prior to start of required crew rest the day prior to a ―1st go‖ mission. In no
       case will notification occur after the scheduled brief time.
    5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
    in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
 38              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
          of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
          examiner.
      5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
      either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
          5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
          the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
          discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
          proficiency.
          5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
          remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
          5.3.2.2.2. (ACC) Units will outline procedures for ensuring additional training is
          accomplished in the unit supplement to this volume.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                          39


         5.3.2.2.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) If additional training is required, fill out the
         applicable items on Attachment 14 and forward it to the squadron CC, DO, TOP 3,
         DOT, DOS, 49 OG/OGV, and SARM personnel.
             5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
             or flying.
             5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
             of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
             be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
             5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
             additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖
     if, in the examiner‘s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
 40               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


       5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
          5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
          assigned.
          5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
          5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
       performance or knowledge.
          5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
          evaluations and EPEs).
          5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
          the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
          requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
          consideration.
          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be
          the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                          41


          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.1. (ACC) The written instrument exam will be successfully completed as a
          requisite for the qualification evaluation for navigators/WSOs/EWOs with flight
          instruments used for navigation at their station. The instrument examination will
          consist of a minimum of 50 questions.
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member‘s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
          5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
          evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
          simulator/ATD, or verbally.
42              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


         5.5.1.2.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) The EPE should utilize a Predator Mission Aircrew
         Training System (PMATS), Full Mission Trainer (FMT),or Weapons and Tactics
         Trainer (WTT). A Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) is acceptable if FMT is
         unavailable. Oral evaluation/Table top EPEs will be a last resort. Written Boldface
         will be accomplished prior to the EPE in the presence of the FE and graded
         immediately.
            5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
            evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
            5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
            INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
            cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
            evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
         5.5.1.2.7. (Added-ACC) EPE discrepancies will be recorded on ACC Form 8a or
         suitable alternate. These will be kept on file until the AF Form 8 is completed.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
  5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
     5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
     current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
     case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                            43


       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
       5.5.3.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Evaluation and requisite completion will be
       tracked by CCV primarily in PEX.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual‘s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
       recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
       evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
       5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
       remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
   evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
   mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
 44               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


   For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
   the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
   5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
   judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
   successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
      5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
      requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
          5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
          paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
          opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
          specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
          similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
          all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
          5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
          examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
          5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
          qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
          supervised status for mission tasks.
          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
   5.7.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) To place individuals on supervised status, fill out the
   applicable items on Attachment 14 and forward it to the squadron CC, DO, TOP 3, DOT,
   DOS, 49 OG/OGV, and SARM personnel.
      5.7.3.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The FE will brief the SQ/CC or DO on
      evaluations which require supervised status and coordinate the specifics of additional
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                            45


      training. Training accomplishment will be monitored by CCV. The certifying official
      will sign the AF Form 8 upon completion of additional training. Any instructor
      completing the training may serve as the certifying official.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s        may    extend
          evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
          IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction.
          5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
          of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
          paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
          longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
          see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
          period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
              5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
              5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
              5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
              5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
              5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
              than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
              before or during deployment.
              5.8.3.2.3.5. (ACC) This also includes unavailability of aircraft/assets due to
              deployments in support of real world operations.
      5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
 46               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


           5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
           authority is the next commander in the examinee‘s flying chain of command.
           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee‘s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander‘s confidence in the aircrew member‘s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew‘s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                           47


   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.4. (ACC) Aircrew members will accomplish the instrument evaluation in their primary
   aircraft. EXCEPTION: U-2 aircrew members will accomplish the instrument evaluation as
   outlined in AFI 11-2U-2V2, U-2--Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
       5.10.4.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) For dual qualification MDS (ie—T-38 and F-
       22A) the F-22 INST/QUAL will suffice for instrument evaluation. For dual qualification
       involving RPA and manned aircraft (ie—T-38 and MQ-1/9), regardless of which MDS is
       primary, aircrew members will accomplish an instrument evaluation in the manned
       aircraft.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (ACC) Universal Qualified Aircrew are defined IAW Chapter 8 of this instruction.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
 48               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS Vol 2/MOU.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                         49

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) Requisite examination testing will be managed by squadron
   CCV offices. Closed book requisite examinations will normally be accomplished in
   Squadron CCV examination testing facilities utilizing PEX testing. Open and Closed book
   requisite examinations will be proctored by Squadron SELOs or, on a case-by-case basis, by
   49 OG/OGV personnel. Each Squadron will ensure their examination testing facility
   complies with paragraph 3.2.1.4. and 3.2.1.4 (ACC).
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
       6.3.2.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Requisite examination testing will normally be
       accomplished using PEX. If PEX is not available, hard copy examination materials may
       be used. Hardcopy examinations will be scored immediately and manually tracked.
       Examination scores will be entered into PEX as soon as possible. The Instrument exam
       may be taken in conjunction with the Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) course,
       administered by the IRC instructor.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
       6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
       be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
       references for open book examinations.
50              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


     6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
     the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
     safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
     6.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) The emphasis of open book exams is on technical orders,
     manuals, handbooks or instructions that may not require immediate recall or are not
     regularly referenced.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Open book exams will consist of 25 questions.
     All publications required for testing will be available in the testing room.
     6.4.1.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The FE exam will be open book consisting of 25
     questions randomly generated from the FE SQB.
     6.4.1.6. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) The SOF exam will be open book and consist of
     25 questions randomly generated from the SOF SQB.
  6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
     6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
     specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
     aircrew.
     6.4.2.1. (ACC) Major emphasis of closed book requisite exams will be on aircraft
     systems and mission knowledge that the aircrews must immediately recall while airborne
     and key information from publications not available in-flight.
         6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
         administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
         procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
         6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
         necessary.
         6.4.2.1.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Closed Book exams will consist of 30
         questions, with 27 taken from the MDS specific MQF and three from the applicable
         49th Wing (49 WG) local MQF.
     6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
     MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
         6.4.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Local Procedures MQFs will be used to supplement the
         MAJCOM approved MQF. Units may include any information necessary for safe
         flight and mission accomplishment not included in the MAJCOM MQF. Local
         instructions, range procedures, unit supplements to AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes
         3, are examples of sources for the Local Procedures MQF. At least 10 percent of
         closed book examination questions will come from the local procedures MQF.
  6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
  Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
  procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
  test.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                            51


   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
   6.4.4. (HOLLOMANAFB) Exam Question Review. 49 OG/OGV will maintain a testing
   review tracker to ensure all examinations are reviewed annually. If a complete review is
   accomplished due to a source document change, an annual review will be annotated. The
   tracker will be checked monthly to ensure all exams are reviewed in a timely manner.
   Further, all hardcopy exams will include the ‗last reviewed‘ date.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education    and     Training   Course     Announcement         (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
   6.5.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) EOC examinations for MQ-1 and MQ-9 Formal
   Training Unit (FTU) students may be used as Open/Closed book requisite scores. The
   average of all initial FTU exams will be entered as the Open/Closed book test scores for the
   initial checkride. If any FTU student fails an exam the failed test score will be used calculate
   their overall average. If an FTU student fails to obtain an average of at least 85% their score
   will be entered on the AF Form 8 as a failed exam score IAW paragraph 7.3.5.1.3.1. and they
   will be required to take the actual Open/Closed book tests prior to their checkride.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
 52               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.1. (ACC) Boldface/CAPs exam will be written from memory. Abbreviations which do
   not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are acceptable.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member‘s next flight.
   6.8.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Personnel proctoring requisite examinations will ensure
   examinations are graded immediately upon completion. Written Boldface/CAPs will be
   accomplished prior to the EPE in the presence of the FE and graded immediately.
   6.8.5. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) If an individual fails a requisite exam or
   Boldface/CAPs the FE/proctor will fill out the applicable items on Attachment 14 and
   forward it to the squadron CC, DO, TOP 3, DOT, DOS, 49 OG/OGV, and SARM personnel.
   Both the failed test score and the passed test score will be entered on the individual's
   Temporary AF Form 8 and AF Form 8 (PEX).
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                           53


   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
      6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
      exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
      6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
      resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
      aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
      results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
      instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.1. (ACC) Each unit will conduct periodic testing at least semiannually for all aircrew
   members. Periodic tests are intended to encourage aircrew review of operationally relevant
   topics selected by the OG/CC. The OG/CC will determine whether the test is administered
   open or closed book and whether proctoring is required. A majority of the questions must
   come from sources other than MAJCOM-approved MQFs (i.e. flight manuals, Instructions,
   SPINS, etc). Classified tests will be handled appropriately.
   6.10.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) Periodic exams will be created by 49 OG/OGV, will consist
   of a minimum of 25 questions, and will be administered in January and July. Periodic testing
   is a Go/No-Go event for all 49 WG aircrew members. All aircrew on the squadron Letter of
   Xs are required to complete periodic testing no later than the last duty day of January and
   July, respectively. If unable to complete, aircrew member will not perform flying duties until
   the test is completed. TDY aircrews may continue flying until returning to Holloman AFB.
   New aircrew who arrive between testing periods will take the next scheduled test.
      6.10.1.1. (Added-ACC) All units will establish a Boldface/Critical Action Procedure
      written examination program for all applicable crew positions. As a minimum, all
      applicable aircrew members will successfully complete a Boldface/Critical Action
      Procedure written examination prior to the first flight of each month. The examination
      will be taken in the period for which it is applicable. Failure of this written exam grounds
      the individual until a successful examination is accomplished.
      6.10.1.2. (Added-ACC) A Boldface/Critical Action Procedure written examination will
      be accomplished for each MDS for which the aircrew is qualified (if any portion of the
      Boldface/CAPs is different from the primary aircraft).
      6.10.1.3. (Added-ACC) Boldface/Critical Action Procedure written examinations will
      be graded by the squadron operations supervisor or designated representative IAW
      paragraph 6.8.1. of this instruction.
      6.10.1.4. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) All FTU students will complete a written
      Boldface/CAPs and Ops Limits before the first flight each week. If an individual fails a
      Boldface/CAPs the proctor will fill out the applicable items on Attachment 14 and
54               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


     forward it to the squadron CC, DO, TOP 3, DOT, DOS, 49 OG/OGV, and SARM
     personnel.
  6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
  6.10.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) Periodic exam minimum passing score is 85% -- corrected to
  100%. If the periodic exam is administered via PEX the corrected to 100% requirement is
  satisfied by aircrew review of missed questions. Failed tests must be re-administered within
  30 calendar days. Aircrew who fail a periodic exam will not fly until a successful re-test is
  accomplished. If proctoring is required, semi-annual test will be proctored by Squadron
  SELOs or, on a case-by-case basis, by 49 OG/OGV personnel. FTU students will not be
  required to take periodic exams.
  6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
  the requirement for a periodic exam.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                              55


                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) All 49 WG flying units will create and maintain a squadron
personnel Certification Document (i.e. Letter of Xs).
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in

      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
      7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the

         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
     7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
     section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
         7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
         certifying official.
         7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
         proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
         generated AF Form 4348.
  7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
  certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
  certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
  are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
  Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
  signify transcription accuracy.

7.7. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member. See
example at Attachment 5.
   7.7.1. Data Entry.
      7.7.1.1. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
      ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.
      7.7.1.2. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
      data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
      desired.
      7.7.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those in which
      the qualification levels awarded on portions of a combined evaluation are not all the
      same.
      7.7.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
      any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
      awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
      level.
      7.7.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is completely filled. If additional blocks not
      needed, ―Z‖ out any unused blocks.
   7.7.2. Type Aircraft/Crew Position. Enter MDS used and crew position flown during the
   evaluation as it appears in the Aircraft/Crew Position area under Examinee Identification of
   the subject AF Form 8/8a. For AF Form 8a, enter first aircraft.

  7.8.1. Maintenance.
     7.8.1.1. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF that includes all
     AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and any additional MAJCOM
     and/or unit specified items. EXCEPTION: for flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-
     rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification do not require an
     FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
     7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
     organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
     7.8.1.3. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
     Stan/Eval function of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
     7.8.1.4. For personnel on inactive flying status, the FEF will be maintained with their
     Flight Records Folder (FRF).
     7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
  7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
  7.8.2. (ACC) Units will convert and maintain all FEFs in electronic format using PEX but
  must establish a viable backup system. Upon conversion, the original FEF and copies of
  subsequent Forms 8 should be provided to the individual. The converted FEF will be marked
  on the outside of the folder, indicating date of conversion and for reference only. Units will
  keep the legacy portion of the FEF in hard copy and put a cover sheet on top of the Form 8
  section indicating that all subsequent FEF action is maintained in PEX. OGV will produce a
  hard-copy FEF prior to a PCS or temporary assignment where the individual‘s unit does not
  possess the capability to manage forms electronically.
     7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
     into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
     maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
     7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
     Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
     7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
     when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
     must be transportable.
  7.8.3. Contents. Divide the FEF into two sections:
     7.8.3.1. (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and
     any items authorized by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement. Section I may contain
     two sub-sections.
         7.8.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top in chronological order with the most
         recent on top, followed by the AF Form 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.2. Any additional information as directed by MAJCOM and/or unit
         supplement will be placed under the AF Form 942 and 4348 (if used).
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                        73


        7.8.3.1.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) Attachment 16 will be placed under AF Forms 942
        and used to log reviews and minor discrepancies. If previous 49 OG versions were
        used, place a new copy on top of the previous version.
        7.8.3.1.3. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual‘s FRF, a
        copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
        Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training

     evaluations listed on the AF Form 942.
        7.8.3.2.1. AF Forms 8/8a. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most
        recent on top. Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more MDSs or two or
        more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
        – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
        7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).

  Review‖ on Attachment 16, no 942 entry is required. Any minor discrepancies will be
  logged on Attachment 16 during the Initial Review and subsequent periodic reviews. Do
  not change documentation on previous versions of Attachment 16 or AF Form 942 to
  comply with this change. Place a copy of the new ―REVIEW / MINOR DISCREPANCY
  LOG‖ on top of previous 49 OG editions.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
         7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
         of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
         Sections I and II of the FEF.
         7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
         only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
         7.8.5.1.2. (HOLLOMANAFB) Following the initial review, place a sheet on top of
         the                                   most                             current
         AF Form 8 produced from another OG stating ―The 49 OG was not the OPR for the
         AF Form 8‘s located behind this insert.‖
         7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
         Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
         Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
         flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
         7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
         4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
         7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
         qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
         requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
         initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
         7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification

     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
        7.8.6.1.3. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Major Discrepancies will be documented
        using the MFR format in Attachment 17. Place the completed MFR in front of the
        appropriate AF Form 8 in Section II. All major discrepancy MFRs must be signed by
        the flying squadron CC or Chief of CCV. The MFR will contain details of what
        caused the discrepancy.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or

        Attachment 16 and placed under the AF Form 942 in Section I. Annotate the reason
        for the discrepancy (i.e. deployed, typo, oversight) if known, any corrective action,
        and/or the correct information on the log. Only use for items found on AF Forms
        created under the 49 OG.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
76              AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


         the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
         7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
         correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
         7.8.6.3.1. (ACC) OGV Chiefs are allowed to correct minor discrepancies.
         7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
9.1. (ACC)Collocated units may use consolidated FCIF library.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) 49 OG/OGV is the OPR for the FCIF program. CCVs will
   serve as the squadron FCIF/Publications monitor and will ensure squadron compliance. 49
   OG/OGV will check for publications updates monthly. Changes will be posted in either
   hardcopy or electronic format, as applicable. Online publications will be backed up by
   hardcopy, DVD, or external hard-drive. All required FCIFs and publications will be made
   available on the 49 OG/OGV SharePoint site.
      9.1.1.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Prior to a deployment/contingency operation,
      each squadron will create a deployment/contingency operation FCIF library (hardcopy
      format or electronic). 49 OG/OGV will ensure deployed location personnel receive
      updated FCIF library information.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy

          electronic files in a hard-copy binder in the FCIF library.
          9.1.5.4.3. Documents in the FCIF library will be made available for deployments via
          either electronic or hardcopy means.
9.2. Flight Related SII.
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
   mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
       9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
       issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
       9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to

 84               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
9.3. (HOLLOMANAFB)Go/No-Go Procedures. The Go/No-Go program is based on a
positive release system with a series of checks. Aircrew, operations supervisors, and SARM
personnel have redundant responsibilities to ensure a ―Go‖ status prior to releasing aircrew
members for a sortie. The go/no-go requirement applies to aircrews stepping with the intent to
pre-flight, taxi, generate, or fly an aircraft. Aircrews will review the PEX Go/No-Go display to
ensure they are current and qualified for all mission/tasks. Individual aircrew members are
ultimately responsible for all personal requirements. SARM personnel will verify that each
aircrew is current in all categories of the Go/No-Go program. The squadron operations
supervisor shall verify each aircrew member‘s currencies before releasing an aircrew to step.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.
       9.3.1.3. Examination items required for flight from this AFI and applicable supplements
       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.5. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B) items.
           9.3.1.5.1. (Added-ACC) An initial review and certification of all volumes will be
           accomplished prior to an individual's first flight. Aircrew members on extensive
           absence from flying (90 days or more) will accomplish a complete review of all
           volumes and recertification prior to flight.
           9.3.1.5.2. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) If an aircrew member has not flown for 90
           days SARM personnel will notify the Top-3. The Top-3 will ensure the aircrew
           member accomplishes a complete FCIF review prior to flight. This is a Go/No-Go
           item.
       9.3.1.6. (Added-ACC) Use the Go/No-Go procedures to document the review,
       certification, and acknowledgment of Volume 1 Part B information by Aircrew members.
       Volume 1 Part C may be monitored by using Go/No Go procedures at unit discretion.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                           85


       Units will utilize PEX for Go/No-Go to ensure verification that aircrews have
       acknowledged each applicable item. Backup Go/No-Go procedures will be maintained to
       permit Go/No-Go verification procedures when information system connectivity
       difficulties are experienced.
           9.3.1.6.1. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) Prior to each flight briefing all aircrew
           members will use PEX to ensure verification and acknowledgement of Go/No-Go
           related items. Required items that have been accomplished but not entered into PEX
           will be documented on AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment
           Report, TAR sheets, or in the remarks section of the flight authorization prior to
           releasing aircrews for scheduled missions. All Go/No-Go items not tracked in PEX
           will be documented using suitable alternates (e.g. Oracle Discover Browser, AF
           Forms 1522, AF Forms 4327, ARMS Flight Authorization (FA), etc.). SARM
           personnel will print and/or save a weekly ARMS report listing the current status of all
           assigned and attached aircrew members‘ go/no-go items. This report will contain
           sufficient information to provide Backup Go/No-Go information should information
           system connectivity difficulties be experienced. If the backup system is required,
           aircrews will check the most recent backup file provided by SARM personnel and
           ensure all required items are green. If a new item has appeared since the last backup,
           aircrew will initial beside the appropriate block and annotate the number of the new
           item, i.e. ―FCIF 12-69.‖ SARM personnel will ensure items not included on the
           backup products are tracked and documented (e.g. AF Form 1042s going On/Off
           DNIF, ARMS products for currency items, etc.).
       9.3.1.7. (Added-ACC) Units will designate person(s) to verify Go/No-Go status prior to
       releasing aircrew members for any scheduled mission.
       9.3.1.7. (HOLLOMANAFB) See paragraph 9.3.
       9.3.1.8. (Added-HOLLOMANAFB) SARM personnel will verify the Go/No-Go of
       aircrews who are not assigned to the squadron. Visiting aircrews not assigned to the 49
       OG for flying purposes will accomplish, at a minimum, all items on Attachment 11 prior
       to flight. Standardized squadron versions of Attachment 11 are acceptable.
9.3.2. (ACC) Added) Flight Crew Publications Unit commanders are responsible for
ensuring that aircrew members are aware of all information published in current technical orders
and flight-related publications before participating in flight operations. Unit commanders will
utilize notification through Part B of Volume I of the unit FCIF and Go/No Go procedures to
ensure aircrew members review new changes and supplements prior to their next flight IAW AFI
11-215_ACC SUP 1.
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.1. (ACC) Supplemental evaluation program goals must be quantifiable; zero is not
   considered a goal. Monitor this program to ensure goals set by the OG/CC.
 86               AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012


   9.4.1. (HOLLOMANAFB) Purpose. The 49 OG Supplementary Evaluation goal is for
   OGV to accomplish OG/CC directed Supplementary Evaluations at least once per quarter.
   Additionally, SQ/CCs are encouraged to utilize Supplementary Evaluations to uncover
   trends, identify emphasis areas, recognize breaches in flight discipline, or to validate
   corrective actions taken to fix them. Further, they can ensure compliance with new
   regulations or aircraft/software changes, identify whether an individual is ready for an
   upgrade, or to ensure the overall quality of the force. Commanders will determine evaluated
   areas. Stan/eval will determine the method of evaluation and is responsible for data
   collection. See also para 3.2.2.6.1. for 49 OG/OGV Sup Evals.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.

                 of the evaluation or flight safety.
U                Failed to comply with directives or allowed flight safety to be jeopardized.
AREA 2 -- FLIGHT EXAMINER'S BRIEFING
Q             Thoroughly briefed the examinee on the conduct of the evaluation, mission
              requirements, responsibilities, grading criteria, and flight examiner
              actions/position during the evaluation.
Q-            Items were omitted during the briefing causing minor confusion. Did not fully
              brief the examinee as to the conduct and purpose of the evaluation.
U            Flight examiner failed to adequately brief the examinee.
AREA 3-- IDENTIFICATION OF DISCREPANCIES AND
ASSIGNMENT OF AREA GRADES
Q          Identified all discrepancies and assigned proper area grade.
Q-               Most discrepancies were identified. Failed to assign Q-grade when appropriate.
                 Assigned discrepancies for performance which was within standards.
U                Failed to identify discrepancies related to flight discipline or deviations which
                 merited an unqualified grade. Assigned Q- grades which should have been U
                 or assigned U grades for performance within standards.
AREA 4 -- ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE
Q             Awarded the appropriate overall grade based on the examinee's performance.
Q-           Awarded an overall grade without consideration of cumulative deviations in
             the examinee's performance.
U            Did not award a grade commensurate with overall performance.
AREA 5-- APPROPRIATE ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING
Q            Assigned proper additional training if warranted.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 21 DECEMBER 2012                                           119


Q-                Additional training assigned was insufficient to ensure the examinee would
                  achieve proper level of qualification.
U              Failed to assign additional training when warranted.
AREA 6 -- MISSION CRITIQUE
Q              Thoroughly debriefed the examinee on all aspects of the evaluation.
               Debriefed all key mission events, providing instruction and references as
               required.
Q-            Failed to discuss all deviations and assigned grades. Did not advise the
              examinee of additional training, if required. Failed to debrief or adequately
              reconstruct all key mission events.
U             Did not discuss any assigned area grades or the overall rating. Changed
              grades without briefing the examinee. Did not debrief mission at all.
              Debriefed few or no key mission events.
AREA 7-- FLIGHT/EPE/ATD EVAL UATION DOCUMENTATION
Q             Correctly completed all required documentation.
Q-            Minor errors in documentation which did not affect the validity of the
              evaluation.
U                 Failed to complete all required documentation. Major errors caused the
                  validity of the evaluation to be questioned.
AREA 8 -- BRIEFING THE SUPERVISOR ON THE EVALUATION
