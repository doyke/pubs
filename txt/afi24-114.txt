This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 24-1, Personnel Movement and

AFPD 24-2, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Materiel. It applies to all Air Force (AF)
user-small terminal operations worldwide, and provides guidance and procedures for Small Air
Terminals (SAT) performing an airlift function in support of the Department of Defense (DoD),
Airlift Support Functions (ASF) and Aerial Delivery Operations (ADO). SATs are those
terminals performing an airlift function in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) but not
designated as an aerial port per the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R, Part III-
Mobility, Appendix M. Exception: although Patrick AFB is termed an aerial port by the DTR,
their operations are governed by this publication. ASF supports the Installation Deployment
Officer’s (IDO) mission to prepare the local wing for deployment operations by providing unit
cargo preparation and readiness training programs, ensuring fully qualified personnel are ready
and available to support deployment operations during contingencies and exercises. ADOs are
those functions postured to prepare, rig, inspect and recover AF supplies and equipment for
unilateral aircrew training assigned airdrop missions.

The objective of this instruction is to identify the core air transportation responsibilities required,
and identifies references and provides the necessary procedural guidance to manage, day-to-day
Air Transportation Operations (Non-Aerial Port) including but not limited to, passenger and

operating Material Handling Equipment (MHE), loading/unloading aircraft, maintaining traffic
related documents, ensuring In-transit Visibility (ITV), conducting installation deployment
training, aerial delivery operations and managing 463L assets. This publication applies to all
Major Commands (MAJCOM) to include Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air
National Guard (ANG) units. Chapters 1 through 5, in their entirety, apply to all Air Force user-
SATs. Chapters 1 and 5, except where noted, apply to ASF-only locations. Chapters 1, 3 and 6,
except where noted, apply to ADO-only locations.

Refer to AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, and base Installation Deployment
Plan for deployment processing procedures. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

Publication title corrected from SMALL AIR TERMINAL OPERATIONS to AIR
TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS (NON-AERIAL PORT) and correction to paragraph
A7.9.5 to state “Perform one JI and complete QTP 7.2 annually.”

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The roles and
responsibilities of the three primary Air Transportation Operations (Non-Aerial Port) have been
broken out and clearly defined. Air transportation manager/local management responsibilities
and passenger and cargo processing procedures were updated to align with current AF and DoD
publication guidance, to include expanded air transportation guidance with removal of AMCI
references. In addition, general safety policies and procedures were also added to the revision.
Lastly, the revision provides new information on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM),
Operational Support Aircraft (OSA), Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) and
eSecure Flight (eSF). Additionally, document has been tiered IAW AFI 33-360.

       1.3.5.2. 2T2X1 personnel who are required to prepare unit-owned HAZMAT cargo will
       only require training/certification as a Technical Specialist IAW AFMAN 24-204 IP,
       Attachment 25.
   1.3.6. Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Program. Personnel handling NWRM
   cargo must complete training as identified in paragraph 1.3.6.1 and be appointed in writing
   by the unit commander. Once personnel meet all experience and training requirements set
   forth in the CFETP, commanders can approve Special Experience Identifier (SEI) 839. (T-1)
       1.3.6.1. NWRM Training. NWRM training requirements are located in AFI 20-110,
       Chapter 9 and are outlined in the NWRM QTP. All air transportation personnel, as a
       minimum, complete the NWRM fundamentals course located on the Advanced
       Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) website, listed in the Miscellaneous course section
       at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp#.
   1.3.7. Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA). Load planners and joint
   inspectors must maintain an active account for viewing/verifying ATTLA certification
   letters.          Personnel     can  apply     for   an     ATTLA         account     at
   https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AFLCMCEZF/default.aspx to obtain certification letters when

   2330, email address: attla@wpafb.af.mil. (T-1)
1.4. Installation Deployment (Readiness) Training Requirements (not applicable to ADO
locations). The IDO is ultimately responsible for the installation deployment training program.
Assigned military/civilian personnel must remain proficient and current with air transportation
career field core tasks, processes, and changes in order to properly train unit personnel on cargo
preparation duties as well as maintaining an augmentation program IAW Air Force Pamphlet
(AFPAM) 10-243, Augmentation Duty. Managers will adhere to AFI 10-403 to assist the IDO
with readying the base mobility mission which includes providing quarterly deployment training
status updates to the IDO, utilized to brief installation/wing commander.
   1.4.1. Assigned personnel will provide training to individuals assigned to fulfill the wing’s
   transportation related deployment tasks. The specific responsibilities of this work center
   include but are not limited to: (T-1)
       1.4.1.1. Develop, conduct, and document transportation-related training supporting the
       installation deployment training program as identified in the IDP and AFI 10-403.
           1.4.1.1.1. As a minimum, train personnel for the air transportation functions
           identified in AFI 10-403, Attachment 5 as required by this instruction and AFMAN
           24-204 IP. For training which does not have a prescribed formal or standard training

                Note: Recommend use of QTPs as a resource in building lesson plans, where
                appropriate.
                1.4.1.1.1.2. All lesson plans will include Installation Deployment Plan (IDP)
                overview.
            1.4.1.1.2. Ensure that safety and Operational Risk Management (ORM) is stressed
            and made part of each course curriculum.
            1.4.1.1.3. To enhance course material comprehension, instructors should use visual
            aids and allow students as much time as possible for practical training and classroom
            discussion. Have students fill out forms and demonstrate defined tasks/procedures.
            Use of tests, quizzes, and handouts, as appropriate, to help explain and/or clarify
            course materials is recommended.
            1.4.1.1.4. Use readiness exercises to provide hands-on training to maximum extent
            possible.
                1.4.1.1.4.1. When augmentee load team training cannot be accomplished during
                real world operations, units are highly encouraged to utilize the JA/ATT program.
                Further guidance is listed in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
1.5. Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Operations. Unit commanders ensure personnel
are fully trained to operate, inspect, and care for assigned assets. For additional guidance,
reference AFI 91-203, and applicable messages posted on AMC’s website
https://private.amc.af.mil/a4/port_dawg/. Note: At no time will any individual (including the
spotter) position themselves in the direct path of any MHE while it is being positioned for
loading operations. (T-1)
     1.5.1. K-loader Safety:
        1.5.1.1. K-loaders are designed to carry only the operator. When the vehicle is in active
        motion (travel/transport mode), never let anyone else ride on the vehicle except as listed
        in paragraph 1.5.1.6 and 1.5.1.10.2. During lift/lower motions (elevator mode), load
        crew personnel may remain on the K-loader deck to expedite cargo transfer/loading
        and/or provide clearance spotting where appropriate (e.g. B747 side loading operations).
        Personnel must be visible on the left side catwalk, in operator’s view, and stay clear of
        the ladder and extreme ends of the deck (past the final pallet lock/yellow caution line).
        1.5.1.2. Efforts to prevent falls must be paramount at all times, but especially during
        aircraft loading and unloading operations. All available measures, both passive and
        active, must be used to ensure safe conditions for all personnel. Personnel must be
        briefed by the load team chief on all safety-related concerns and conditions which may
        exist during the operation. The briefing will include any areas identified as having
        increased fall potential to ensure heightened awareness. Personnel must pay close
        attention to and remain aware of all visual cues (e.g. yellow caution lines, chain gates,
        etc.) in place to prevent falls.
        1.5.1.3. Gravity movement/feeding of palletized cargo on a K-loader are prohibited. The
        loading and unloading of a knelt C-5 aircraft does not constitute gravity movement as
        long as the cargo movement is controlled.
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                      9


       1.5.1.4. Transmission must be in neutral and parking brake set before personnel are
       allowed on K-loader decks. Personnel must stay clear of the loader's telescoping ladder
       and extreme ends of the deck.
       1.5.1.5. IAW AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, a
       properly secured fall restraint harness must be worn when working past the last pallet
       lock/yellow caution line on either end of the K-Loader deck when the deck is raised.
       During active loading activities, when the K-Loader is in final loading and unloading
       position, this requirement does not pertain to the transfer area between the loader and
       aircraft. Heightened awareness should be given to areas with increased fall potential. (T-
       1)
       1.5.1.6. Load crew personnel will not be allowed on the deck when the K-loader is
       moved forward or aft except when a spotter is required on the deck to raise for final K-
       loader/aircraft interface.
       1.5.1.7. Operators are responsible for ensuring cargo is properly restrained on K-loaders
       prior to movement, to include engaging the pallet stops. When necessary for the operator
       to remain in the cab of the K-loader, the loading supervisor is responsible for ensuring
       compliance.
          1.5.1.7.1. Engage all pallet rail guide locks for each pallet and raise both the
          emergency pallet stops, and apply supplemental restraint using 10,000 lbs chains and
          devices to the fore and aft pallet (both sides of pallet). If pallets are loaded in a
          logistics configuration, each individual pallet must be restrained by use of 10,000 lbs
          chains. Straps are not authorized in substitute of chains.
          1.5.1.7.2. Secure the middle pallets with 5,000 lbs straps restricting movement in all
          directions (bellyband). Apply supplemental restraint by using 10,000 lbs chains or
          HQ AMC-approved restraint to the fore and aft pallets when pallets are locked into
          only one rail guide lock. Note: Supplemental restraint is not required for the
          Halvorsen and Tunner loaders when the pallet rail guide locks are engaged on both
          sides of all pallets. Review the following website for more information on logistics
          configuration (Patriot Method):
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4tr/atsev/hello.html.
          1.5.1.7.3. Restrain each piece of rolling stock forward and aft with the appropriate
          tie-down devices (e.g. CGU-1/B, MB1 or MB2) and engage the integral braking
          system if rolling stock is so equipped. Restraint from the rolling stock will not be
          removed until the K-loader has arrived its loading or unloading point and come to a
          complete stop. When offloading single axle rolling stock, at least one forward and
          one aft tie-down device will be used to restrain the rolling stock until secured to a
          prime mover or positioned/controlled by a load team.
       1.5.1.8. Pallet-train lengths that exceed K-loader capacity, or pallet trains with overhang
       that prevent engaging both fore and aft emergency pallet stops, will not be transported on
       any type K-loader. If no alternate means are available and it is determined pallet
       handling limitations of a K-loader must be exceeded, an Operational Risk Assessment
       (ORA) MUST be conducted, coordinated and approved by the SAT Manager. The ORA
       will provide specific guidance concerning placement of the pallet train on the loader and
10 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


     ensure down line stations are notified of special loading requirements. Use supplemental
     restraint, spotters, etc. If a loading situation occurs wherein cargo overhang is a factor,
     use a second K-loader (if available) mated to the aircraft as a bridge to prevent possible
     damage to the aircraft ramp. (T-3)
     1.5.1.9. The K-loader pallet stop is a back-up in case the primary pallet restraint fails.
     Do not use the pallet stop as the primary restraint. When tie-down chains are used for
     supplemental restraints, the chains will be attached to the pallet D-rings and the excess
     chain will be secured. (T-1)
     1.5.1.10. The following guidance should be observed to mitigate the risk associated with
     bridging K-loaders in order to accelerate aircraft loading and offloading. “Elevator”
     pertains to the loader interfacing with the aircraft. Maintain 6-8 inch gap between the
     loaders. Limit number of K-loaders to the minimum required for operation.
         1.5.1.10.1. Loaders should be spotted in at lowered position to minimize falling
         hazards. Pay special attention to clearances with wing, fuselage and cargo doors.
         1.5.1.10.2. Limit access of personnel on elevated loader to left side catwalk, within
         the operators view. This will minimize hazard to any additional personnel on loader
         not in view of the operator.
         1.5.1.10.3. Engage at least one lock on the left side of all pallets during elevator
         operation up and down.
         1.5.1.10.4. On loaders with powered conveyors (Tunner and Halvorsen), all pallets
         may be unlocked and moved together when transferring to a second loader. This will
         only be permitted in lowered position. A spotter positioned on the left catwalk will
         monitor transfer of pallets from elevator to second loader and provide guidance to
         stop operation in case of any problem with a jammed pallet or safety concern. (T-1)
         1.5.1.10.5. Avoid bridging K-loaders during rolling stock operations. If you must,
         conduct an ORA to identify potential hazards and procedures to be followed in
         accordance with AFI 91-202, Attach 15.
         1.5.1.10.6. When bridging requires a loader to pass under or near a wing tip, ensure
         refueling or aircrew personnel are fully aware of loader’s proximity near fuel tank
         vents (during refueling operations) and wing control surfaces (during preflight
         operations).
  1.5.2. Wide Body Aircraft:
     1.5.2.1. Use loaders designed to service wide body aircraft when available. Hi-lift trucks
     may be used as alternatives. Due to the fuselage contour of these aircraft, use extreme
     care when positioning equipment for on/offload operations.
     1.5.2.2. When K-loaders without deck extensions are used to service lower lobe
     compartments, they are normally backed into the aircraft. Before attempting to back a K-
     loader, the vehicle operator must ensure the primary spotter is clearly in view and signals
     are understood. Additional spotters will be positioned to prevent K-loader from
     contacting aircraft fuselage. Accurate preliminary height adjustment of the loader deck is
     critical in lower lobe operations. The vehicle operator will stop the K-loader
     approximately 10 feet from the aircraft for preliminary height adjustment. Load crew
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                     11


       personnel must exercise extreme caution when approaching and stepping over the gap
       between the loader deck and aircraft floor as this gap is much greater than in other
       loading operations. (T-1)
   1.5.3. Forklift Safety:
       1.5.3.1. Secure     pallets   to    the     forklift   prior     to    movement        when
       loading/offloading/transporting pallets on forklift with rollerized tines, when pallets are
       top/side heavy, and when snow or ice is present between the forklift tines and pallet.
       1.5.3.2. Secure all objects of irregular shape, including aircraft engines, to the forklift
       mast frame before being raised, lowered, or moved. Place large, irregularly shaped
       objects on pallets for stability before transporting. Note: Ensure protruding engine parts
       (afterburners, etc.) are not damaged during transport.
       1.5.3.3. Secure non-unitized warehouse type skids or individual containers of explosives
       to material handling equipment (including forklifts) to prevent movement (AFMAN 91-
       201, Paragraph 8.28.8. Positively secure, unitize stacked explosives prior to movement.
       When forklifts or K-Loaders are used to transport explosives over-the-road or outside of
       the immediate work area, ensure the requirements of AFMAN 91-201, Section 8G (two
       fire extinguishers, DOT placards and wheel chocks) are followed.
       1.5.3.4. Bare tine loading operations may be conducted as needed for training or when
       rollerized tines are not available. Rollerized tines will be used when they are available.
       1.5.3.5. 10K A/T Prime Mover Operations:
          1.5.3.5.1. Technical data provided by Caterpillar, approved by the Air Force Safety
          Center, satisfies the manufacturer designation requirement for loading and unloading
          operations of the Caterpillar 10K A/T with the new Aircraft Loading Fork
          Attachment. If used as a prime mover, ensure use of this approved pintle hook
          attachment, officially referred as Caterpillar Hitch Assembly, IAW the operator
          manual.
Note: This attachment and technical data is not applicable to John Deere 10K A/Ts which is not
approved for prime mover operations.
          1.5.3.5.2. SAT managers and/or host vehicle management/maintenance activity will
          procure attachments directly through Caterpillar unless an approved AF source has
          been authorized. Purchasing agency will go to www.cat.com <http://www.cat.com>
          and select "Find Dealer" to find the dealer nearest the installation. OCONUS
          locations may have to follow local maintenance shop process to order Caterpillar
          parts. Contact information is also listed in the back of the Caterpillar forklift
          manuals. (T-1)
          1.5.3.5.3. Part #: 378-7975 with nomenclature "Hitch Assembly"
          1.5.3.5.4. Trailer mounted engines are strictly prohibited from lifting/movement
          using forklift tines during any on-load/off-load operations. Take precautions to ensure
          protruding engine parts (after-burners, engine blades, etc.) are not damaged during
          transport. Consult appropriate section of TO 00- 5-20, Engine Shipping Instructions,
          if necessary.

1.6. In-Transit Visibility (ITV) and Cargo/Passenger Documentation and Manifesting (not
applicable to ASF or ADO locations). ITV data provides the ability to track the identity, status
and location of DoD unit and non-unit personnel, cargo and equipment in the DTS. The DoD
system of record for ITV data is the Integrated Data Environment/Global Transportation
Network Convergence (IGC). IGC fuses data from multiple DoD logistics Automated
Information System (AISs) sources into a single repository. SAT managers will use Cargo
Movement Operations System (CMOS) as the primary AIS for cargo and passenger
documentation IAW the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR 4500.9-R). Locations that are
specifically approved by HQ AMC/A4T may use Global Air Transportation Execution System
(GATES) for manifesting and ITV. (T-0)
   1.6.1. In order to comply with ITV transmission criteria to Integrated Development
   Environment/Global Transportation Network Convergence (IGC), SAT managers will ensure
   manifests are released in CMOS (or GATES if authorized) within 30 minutes of aircraft
   departure. SAT managers will ensure designated personnel will have IGC accounts to verify
   and support ITV requirements. These personnel will query IGC no later than 1 hour after
   aircraft departure to ensure presence of cargo and/or passenger data in IGC as outlined in
   AFI 24-203, paragraph 18.5. (T-1)
1.7. Support Agreements. It is important to establish support agreements, as appropriate, to
clearly define the roles, mission and support at AF user-operated small air transportation
locations. SAT managers will work closely with the wing support agreement manager and refer
to AFI 25-201, Intra-service, Intra-agency, and Inter-agency Support Agreements Procedures,
for further guidance on support agreement policy. SAT managers should also: (T-1)
   1.7.1. Ensure all air transportation issues are thoroughly analyzed in all agreements.
   1.7.2. Ensure all agreements are evaluated in terms of the unit's SAT manpower and SAT
   facilities capability (to include installation’s CDF and PDF facilities operations).
1.8. Self-Assessment Program. Local management will develop and execute a self-assessment
program IAW AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System. Respective MAJCOMs may
publish additional guidelines for small air transportation operations. (T-1)

                                PASSENGER OPERATIONS

2.1. Purpose. SAT managers must provide detailed local guidance for safe and efficient
processing of all passengers their baggage IAW DTR 4500.9 R, Part I, Passenger Movement,
Chapter 103. In addition, SAT personnel must ensure passengers have eligibility to travel as
identified in DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility. For additional guidance on
contingency/deployment mobility operations, refer to AFI 10-403 and the relevant Installation
Deployment Plan (IDP). DTR Part III is an additional source for mobility operations. (T-0)
   2.1.1. Space Available (Space-A) Travel. IAW DoD policy, all unused seats on DoD-owned
   or controlled airlift after mission requirements are met shall be released for use by eligible
   Space Required (Space-R) and Space-A passengers. On all mission types, the SAT, in
   coordination with the aircraft commander and the user as applicable, shall determine if a
   defined need for security, safety or legal concerns (including hazardous cargo, customs,
   agriculture, or immigrations restrictions) prohibits Space-A travelers from flying on a
   specific mission. The aircraft commander is responsible for, and has the final authority on
   matters affecting the operation of their aircraft. Situations where the above prohibitions
   restrict Space-A travelers from a particular mission should be the rare exception rather than
   the rule.
       2.1.1.1. SATs shall maintain a register of passengers desiring air transportation that
       prioritize Space-R and Space-A passengers by category and date/time of sign-up IAW
       DoD 4515.13R. Prior to offering open seats on DoD aircraft, the SAT at origin shall
       ensure the following: that Space-A traffic can be received at destination; determine
       applicable border clearance requirements; and that any Space-A passenger will not
       hamper the user’s mission departure/arrival operations. If the mission is not landing at an
       AMC-operated passenger terminal, passengers shall be advised that the airlift user and/or
       downline station in not responsible for assisting with onward transportation or other
       arrangements. (T-0)
       2.1.1.2. Seat Management. SATs will control seat management after a mission is
       released to the terminal such as walk-ins, no-shows, late arrivals, rotated passengers,
       ineligible traffic, security screening, border clearance documentation, etc. Information
       control arranges with the passenger check-in section to ensure information concerning
       available seats is promptly relayed to minimize workload surges, maximize advertising of
       seat availability and permit orderly processing of all eligible Space-R/Space-A
       passengers. (T-1)
       2.1.1.3. Ineligible Passengers. Individuals are placed on the Space-A ineligible list by
       their respective sponsoring Service Headquarters. These individuals have been
       determined to be ineligible for travel on DoD-owned and controlled aircraft and are
       barred from worldwide Space-A travel. The Space-A Ineligible list can be obtained from
       the SATs respective MAJCOM/A4R. Local hold lists are provided by the installation
       commander, legal offices, or security forces and documentation copies should be
       maintained by the SAT. Both lists must be easy accessible at all times and agents should
       be thoroughly trained on their use and procedures to take when an ineligible passenger
 14 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


      attempts to travel. Specific questions from passengers relating to their eligibility must be
      directed in writing to their Service Headquarters. Provide them their Service
      Headquarters address as follows:
Navy: NAVSUP Global Logistic Support, Code N48, 1837 Morris Street, Norfolk, VA. 23511.

Army: HQ DALO-FPT-PP/PT, Room 1D343, 500 Army Pentagon, Washington DC, 20310-
0500.

Air Force: HQ USAF/A4LE, 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1030.

Marine Corps: HQ United States Marine Corps, I&L LPD-2, 3000 Marine Corps Pentagon,
Pentagon Room 2E211, Washington DC 20350-3000.

Coast Guard: CG-44, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr Ave S.E. Stop 7714, Washington DC, 20953-
7714.
      2.1.1.4. Instances of unacceptable passenger conduct or behavior that warrant
      consideration for revocation of Space-A privileges shall be forwarded to respective
      MAJCOM/A4R for action. Include all supporting documentation (travel documents,
      Passenger Service Agent (PSA) statements, police reports, etc.). MAJCOM shall review
      all reports and forward to the appropriate Service Headquarters with MAJCOM
      recommendation. A decision on passenger ineligibility rests with the passenger's
      respective Service Headquarters.
   2.1.2. Travel Eligibility Check. SAT personnel will ensure travelers have valid government-
   issued identification in their possession prior to manifesting. Dependents age 10 years or
   older must have a DD Form 2 Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card in order
   to travel. SAT personnel must ensure that all travelers possess required valid border
   clearance documents (orders, passports, visas, etc.) in accordance with DoD 4500.54E, DoD
   Foreign Clearance Guide (https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil). (T-0)
   2.1.3. Privacy Act Statement (PAS). In areas where personal identifying information (PII) is
   collected, SATs shall display a PAS to notify passengers of the collection of PII. Display
   PAS on signs/monitors in areas where passengers routinely furnish personal information.
   PAS signs are locally developed and must include the authority, purpose, routine uses, and
   disclosure items. The method of display/relaying the PAS will be left to the discretion of
   local management. SAT personnel must ensure PII is protected IAW AFI 33-332 at all time.

be prepared for all DoD aircraft carrying passengers. ITV will be collected on all passengers to
include, Inspector General (IG) teams, Thunderbird SAAMs, OSA missions, etc. (T-0)
   2.2.1. SAT operations retain overall responsibility for passenger manifesting, security, and
   maintain the space available sign-up roster. Local management will establish procedures for
   passengers that do not process through the designated terminal (i.e., Base Operations,
   protocol) to ensure proper anti-hijacking and manifesting process is accomplished.
   Deviations from this process must be approved by the respective MAJCOM. (T-1)
   2.2.2. Completion of the DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest (Attachment 2) is mandatory
   in the event of automated system failure. Refer to DTR, Part I for instructions on how to

   4515.13-R, Chapter 2 and 6. (T-0)
   2.3.2. Space-A registration may be done in person at the passenger terminal or by using any
   of the remote sign-up options (fax, email, internet and mail).
   2.3.3. General. Roll call is a phrase used to signify the beginning of the process in which
   eligible passengers in each category are selected by date and time of sign-up. This shall
   enable passengers to plan their activities and ensure equitable opportunities for all. All
   Space-A passengers shall be assigned a seat (no in-lap passengers authorized).
   2.3.4. Conduct roll call in sufficient time to meet vetting of Space-A passengers and aircraft
   departure times IAW locally developed sequence of events timelines. Roll-call times are
   determined by local management based on the size and scope of the operation. (T-3)
   2.3.5. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R for baggage restrictions and dress requirements.
2.4. Passenger Check-In. Verify all passengers have a copy of their orders/travel authorization,
and passport (as required) in their possession prior to boarding any DoD aircraft. Travel orders
will be checked for fiscal data, Customer Identification Code (CIC), and signature block. (T-0)
   2.4.1. General. A copy of orders shall be collected from all Space-R passengers and filed
   with the flight package. Check ID Cards, passport, and visas for validity prior to
   manifesting.
   2.4.2. Passenger Billing/Order Collection. Duty passengers are required to reimburse the
   DoD for travel aboard military aircraft unless associated with a contingency/exercise or
   SAAM. SAT personnel must collect and process their documentation for billing. If doubt
   exists on the applicability of billing and to avoid aircraft departure delays, personnel will
   collect orders and determine need for billing post-departure by contacting their respective
   MAJCOM/A4R. (T-1)
       2.4.2.1. Customer Identification Code (CIC). CICs are a 15 character alphanumeric
       sequence that is tied to the line of accounting from the service responsible for the travel
       authorization. For additional information, refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Chapter 103,
       Section J.
   2.4.3. Data Collections Requirements. (T-0)
       2.4.3.1. Emergency Point of Contact (EPC) Information. IAW DTR Part I, Chapter 103,
       Section N, passenger service agents (PSAs) and passenger functions must solicit
       emergency contact information from each passenger for all DOD missions. The sole
       purpose for this information is to ensure timely notification to the EPC in the event of an
       unfortunate circumstance. It does not designate beneficiaries and should not be confused
       with Next of Kin (NOK) notification. Request name and phone number of an emergency
       contact not traveling with the passenger. This is DoD policy and the information is
       required to be solicited by public law. Passengers may decline to provide EPC
       information. If a passenger declines to provide emergency contact information, a
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                     17


      manifest entry reflecting the fact shall be made. For stations authorized to use GATES, if
      emergency contact information is already resident in GATES, PSAs must confirm the
      information with the passenger at check-in. (Automatically marking the passenger as
      having declined is unacceptable) Note: The only two authorized EPC entries are 1)
      actual contact information or 2) "declined" if the passenger declines to provide
      information.
      2.4.3.2. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Data. CBP requires advance notification
      via the CBPs Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) for all passengers entering
      or leaving the Customs Territory of the United States (CTUS). SATs that do not use
      GATES must use CBP’s e-APIS web-based system in order to comply with this
      requirement (DTR Part V, Chapter 502, Paragraph C.3.). Information required by CBP is
      Full Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Nationality, Document Type, Document number,
      Country of Issue, and document expiration date. SATs manifesting passengers on flights
      that cross the CTUS borders must register for e-APIS accounts at
      https://eapis.cbp.dhs.gov/eapisj. For assistance with SAT access to e-APIS contact CBP
      National APIS Account Manager at (845) 838-8270. Note: e-Secure Flight does not
      provide data to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection
      (CBP) for admissibility purposes. (T-0)
2.5. eSecure Screening. (T-0)
   2.5.1. Passenger identity screening is in addition to physical and baggage security screening
   procedures already being performed.
   2.5.2. To ensure all passengers traveling on DoD-owned and/or contracted aircraft are
   afforded the utmost aviation security safeguards, all locations generating passenger manifests
   must ensure all Space-A passengers undergo mandatory identity screening of passengers
   prior to boarding aircraft. Detailed guidance for eSecure Flight (eSF) screening is outlined in
   DTR Part I, Chapter 103, paragraph O.
   2.5.3. Where available, passenger screening process is be completed via an automated
   interface between the Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) and
   Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight system. For manual procedures,
   eSF account holders will use the eSF web browser.
   2.5.4. IAW Under Secretary of Defense policy memo titled “Transportation of Space-
   Available Passenger on Department of Defense Aircraft” dated 28 October 2013, individuals
   who are not cleared to travel through passenger identity screening process will be denied
   boarding privileges. Passenger terminals that are unable to screen passengers prior to aircraft
   boarding time will not delay an aircraft due to waiting for Space-A vetting results (processes
   in Paragraph 2.8 must be exhausted prior denying transportation).
   2.5.5. Space-A passengers not screened or cleared prior to aircraft departure will not board
   and must be rotated off the flight manifest; final boarding manifest must reflect correct and
   accurate passenger information. Take action to ensure unit chain of command is fully aware
   of circumstances surrounding why seats were not utilized as a result of this process.
2.6. Encounter Management Procedures – “INHIBITED” STATUS ONLY”. (T-0)
18 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


  2.6.1. Once manifest is submitted through eSF web browser, TSA passenger screening
  occurs. This process can take up to 5 minutes and screening results appear indicating
  whether each passenger is cleared to board aircraft or requires more attention. PSAs are
  responsible for monitoring results in accordance with the TSA training provided.
  2.6.2. If results indicate passenger is “Cleared,” “Known,” or “Selectee,” then passenger is
  cleared to board aircraft.
  2.6.3. When eSF result indicates passenger is INHIBITED, the passenger may NOT board
  aircraft and/or enter sterile area and the PSA will immediately telephone the TSA Secure
  Flight Operations Center.
  2.6.4. TSA Secure Flight Operations Center will guide PSAs through additional steps and
  assist in resolution or confirmation of a passenger’s non-cleared travel status. In most cases,
  this call may result in resolution of INHIBITED status and passenger may board aircraft.
  2.6.5. If during the resolution process TSA Secure Flight Operations Center does not
  determine passenger is authorized for travel, PSA shall have readily available the following
  statement to convey to INHIBITED traveler.
   “Sir/Ma’am, I’m sorry, however, the Air Force cannot authorize your travel at this time
 and this issue must be resolved before you are granted travel aboard any aircraft from our
  terminal. In order to resolve the issue, you will have to provide additional information to
     the Department of Homeland Security. You will need to log into DHS’s interactive
                              website at www.dhs.gov/dhs-trip.”

  NOTE: Under NO circumstances shall any PSA communicate to any passenger they
  were/are being screened or they are INHIBITED. PSAs responsibility is to deny
  boarding and direct passenger to contact DHS for further resolution. If the traveler asks
  “why” they were denied travel or requests additional information, recommend individual
  PSAs employ the following language when communicating with a traveler:
  “Security procedures and legal concerns mandate that we can neither confirm nor deny any
  information about you which may be within federal watchlists or reveal any law enforcement
  sensitive information.” More specific details are provided during eSF training.
  2.6.6. In any event that an individual is not cleared to board a flight at overseas locations that
  is returning to the U.S., the PSA shall refer traveler to closest U.S. Embassy for travel
  support.
  2.6.7. If at any time a passenger becomes unruly or violent due to denial of air transportation
  as a result of their INHIBITED status, exercise professional judgment when contacting law
  enforcement and follow policy guidance established by local management in regards to
  activating duress alarm and denying aircraft boarding.
  2.6.8. TSA Secure Flight Operations Center may call the designated Air Force Security
  Director (618th Air Operations Center (AOC)/XOZ, or TACC) for situational awareness and
  information regarding INHIBITED passengers. The Air Force Security Director, or
  appropriate AOC, carries operational authority to order removal of any passenger(s)
  identified as INHIBITED and is authorized control over delayed boarding of passenger and
  aircraft departure when necessary. SATs may receive notifications from the Air Force
  Security Director or appropriate AOC if passenger status changes after check-in.

2.7. eSecure Flight System Outage/Manual Procedures: (T-0)
   2.7.1. The following steps provide direction for passenger terminals for screening passengers
   where technology prohibits screening via the normal eSF process. Passenger terminals that
   do not have eSF accounts are still responsible for ensuring passengers are screened at their
   locations. To obtain a copy of TSA passenger data template, contact any eSF account holder
   or HAF eSF Manager. These options must be exhausted prior to denying transportation.
   2.7.2. Encrypted email. First acceptable option to complete passenger screening is for eSF
   account holder to contact an alternate location and send an encrypted email with completed
   TSA passenger data template. PSA will confirm reception and processing of passenger
   information.
      2.7.2.1. When passenger screening is completed, alternate location will notify originating
      station. PSAs will confirm passengers have been screened and are safe to board aircraft.
      2.7.2.2. Should an INHIBITED passenger be identified by an alternate location, an
      immediate phone call to originating station passenger terminal will be initiated including
      all relevant passenger information.
      2.7.2.3. Originating location will proceed with actions as defined in DTR Part I Chapter
      103, paragraph O to clear or confirm INHIBITED traveler status.
   2.7.3. Safe Access File Exchange (SAFE). SAFE website can be used to transfer documents
   with personal identification information (PII) and should be used after encrypted email
   option has failed.
      2.7.3.1. To utilize SAFE site navigate to https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe2/, access
      site as a CAC User. There is no registration/log in with password requirement. Only
      personnel with CAC credentials may access site at any time.
      2.7.3.2. Specify all “Personal Information” fields
      2.7.3.3. “Browse” for passenger template you need screened
      2.7.3.4. Specify “Deletion Date” and description of file with remarks
      2.7.3.5. Provide recipient email address(es) at alternate location. Individual(s) must be
      an eSF account holder
      2.7.3.6. Designate file as “FOUO”
      2.7.3.7. Once uploaded, individuals will receive an automated email from SAFE that file
      is available for retrieval. Once individuals at alternate location have this information,
      they can access SAFE to retrieve completed passenger manifest and screen passengers as
      they normally would using eSF procedures. Paragraph 2.7.2.1 – 2.7.2.3 guidance applies
      for notification back to originating station.
   2.7.4. Verbal transmission of information. In the case of severe power outages where
   personnel cannot access any network, system, or computer workstation at all (when manual
   DD Form 2131 manifest procedures have been implemented), eSF account holder must
   initiate telephone contact with designated alternate location, relay passenger data verbally to
   an eSF account holder while alternate site inputs information onto passenger data template or
   directly into eSF. Return phone call or confirmation on same phone call from alternate site
 20 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


   suffices as approval that passengers were vetted and may travel. Paragraph 2.7.2.1 guidance
   applies for notification back to originating station.
   2.7.5. As a last resort, PSAs may contact TSA SOC via telephone to vet five passengers or
   less.
   2.7.6. In the event passenger screening cannot be accomplished by any means, air
   transportation will be denied. Should this occur, notify MAJCOM POCs and HAF eSF
   Manager with all relevant details for mission, reason screening was not accomplished and all
   mitigating actions taken to prevent end result. Paragraph 2.5.5 applies in this situation. (T-1)
2.8. eSecure Flight Database Integrity:
   2.8.1. Account Management. As personnel within each unit relocate, deploy, or relinquish
   their TSA responsibilities, it is paramount that unit leadership identifies new individuals to
   their respective MAJCOM Air Transportation Staff and HAF eSF Manager. Training must
   be completed within 5 duty days of assuming TSA passenger screening duties. Individuals
   will be identified in writing by unit commander. HAF eSF Manager will work with the
   MAJCOMs and each unit to delete and replace names. (T-1)
       2.8.2. Database Maintenance. It is the responsibility of eSF account holders at each unit
       to purge eSF mission files for completed flights. All flight files must be deleted within
       48 hours of actual arrival time. Do not delete mission data until flights reach their final
       destination (i.e. delays, diverts, etc). (T-0)
2.9. Sterile Area. Passengers and baggage shall be screened IAW TSA prohibited items list.
Screen all individuals entering the sterile/gate area using screening equipment (i.e. walkthrough
or hand-held magnetometers). Advise all passengers that objects identified by TSA as prohibited
in the cabin of the aircraft must be secured in their checked baggage or confiscated. Any
prohibited items identified in a passenger's hand-carried baggage at the sterile/gate area
inspection shall be disposed of. The listing of prohibited items may be viewed on the TSA web
http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items.            Appropriate handling and
safeguard procedures for these items shall be established at the local level. “PSAs will perform a
sweep of the sterile area before gating passengers to ensure area is free of prohibited items.” (T-
0)
   2.9.1. The LRS commander may exempt screening of on-duty passenger service personnel
   or personnel directly involved with flight/passenger processing (i.e., ramp controller and
   border clearance officials). The exemption must be in writing by the squadron commander
   and the letter shall be available at the security checkpoint. This exemption list must be kept
   to an absolute minimum and is not intended for maintenance or custodial personnel. (T-3)
   2.9.2. If a passenger refuses to be screened at any point during the screening process, the
   passenger shall be denied entry into the sterile/gate area and denied movement.
   2.9.3. Duty passengers on contingency, SAAM, or other dedicated mobility missions shall
   follow the guidelines provided in the DTR Part III.
       2.9.3.1. Troop Leader is responsible for verifying the screening of contingency
       passengers IAW DTR Part III Appendix BB, Paragraphs G, H and Appendix T.
       2.9.3.2. When deploying passengers are authorized in their orders to carry firearms and
       are processed through the passenger terminal, either originating or transiting, they shall
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                    21


      be allowed to retain their unloaded firearm provided it has been confirmed by the agent.
      SATs shall brief the deploying passenger they must retain positive control over the
      firearm at all times. Any hand carried or checked baggage is subject to inspection.
      Passengers shall not be allowed to retain control of any unauthorized items. These
      passengers are not required to remain segregated from other passengers and may have
      access to the terminal facilities (i.e. snack bar, vending machines, and pay phones).
   2.9.4. For direct to aircraft passengers (e.g., DVs, Secret Service, etc.) the aircraft
   commander or designated representative shall ensure they comply with TSA standards.
   Request a copy of the passenger manifest, signed by the aircraft commander or designated
   representative, certifying passengers are in compliance.
   2.9.5. Hand-Carried Baggage Inspection. Passenger service personnel shall inspect/X-ray all
   baggage (hand-carried items) in the presence of the owner at the time of entry at the
   sterile/gate area. Position the monitor so as to prevent passenger/public viewing. Honor
   passenger requests to have their hand-carried items inspected visually in lieu of X-ray.
   Require passengers to open their own baggage or packages for inspection and/or place them
   on the X-ray machine. Laptops and video cameras with cassettes shall be removed from their
   cases. Should the X-ray machine operator determine that a bag contains a questionable
   image, request the owner of the bag to open it for further inspection. Note: If you determine
   the image is a weapon or firearm not previously declared by the passenger, follow
   instructions outlined in 2.10.5.
      2.9.5.1. Any item that is not easily and immediately identifiable that may conceal guns
      (i.e., key chains, cigarette packs, battery packs, lighters, and any box or small pouch)
      should be X-rayed. Place the tray/container holding the items through the X-ray machine

   or guarded) when not in use.
   2.10.2. Duress Alarm System. Install a duress alarm system at passenger processing points
   and check-in counters to summon local Security Forces (SF) for immediate assistance. The
   type of system used shall be jointly agreed upon by both local SAT and SF management.
   Considerations to this type of equipment should include, but not limited to, base policies,
   terminal infrastructure, typical passenger movement types and velocity of passengers. The
   activating device (button/switch) must be out of public view to allow personnel
   monitoring/performing inspections to activate the alarm unnoticed. Duress alarms checks
   must be coordinated with the local SF personnel and established in local directives or as
   stated in wing/base AFI 31-series publications.
 22 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


   2.10.3. Use of walk-through magnetometer or hand held wand is required to expedite
   passenger processing. All passengers and baggage accessible in-flight will be inspected.
   Further inspect passengers who, twice, activate the walk-through metal detector (if installed)
   by using a hand held wand. If hand held wand is inoperable or unavailable, a visual
   inspection is required. (T-0)
   2.10.4. SAT managers will ensure magnetometers are properly tested and maintained IAW
   the manufacturer’s instructions. Test the device at least weekly. Record the date/time and
   where the machine operated satisfactorily. Maintain this record for at least 30 days. The
   magnetometer may be turned off when not in use; however, when reactivating, allow any
   needed warm-up period IAW the manufacturer’s instruction to prevent erratic sensitivity
   reading. Guidelines and procedures listed in this paragraph are in accordance to AFI 13-207,
   Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO).
   2.10.5. If any item noticed is suspicious, such as a weapon, inconspicuously summon law
   enforcement agents. SF personnel will perform all required physical inspections (body
   searches) when circumstances warrant. SAT personnel can perform these searches when
   trained and certified by local SF. (T-1)
2.11. Baggage. Process baggage as follows:
   2.11.1. General Information. It is SAT's responsibility to ensure all checked baggage be
   intact, undamaged, and available to each traveler immediately on arrival at their destination.
   Careful and considerate attention must be given to ensure each article is properly tagged,
   weighed, loaded, and unloaded at each originating, en route, and terminating station.
   2.11.2. Baggage Allowance. Except as noted, passengers are authorized to check two pieces
   of baggage not to exceed 70 pounds each (140 pounds total) and 62 linear inches (the sum of
   the length plus the width plus the height). Single items exceeding 70 pounds and/or 62 linear
   inches shall be counted as two pieces and, therefore, fulfill the allowance for a passenger.
   Space-A passengers are not authorized excess baggage. Items exceeding 100 pounds and or
   80 linear inches shall not be accepted. Snow skis, bicycles, and fishing equipment should be
   properly packed to avoid injury to baggage handlers or damage to other baggage. Only one

   passenger. SAT shall coordinate with the aircrew to ensure aircraft configuration provides
   proper access and safe transport of differently-abled passengers. Aircrew shall make every
   effort to accommodate them. Differently-abled passenger assistance depends largely on the
   degree of mobility and type of aircraft (e.g., if a differently-abled passenger is selected for a
   C-5 mission and the passenger can, with assistance, negotiate the internal stairs, he/she can
   travel). On the rare occasion when operational or equipment limitations preclude serving
   differently-abled passengers, the PSAs must ensure the passenger understands why air
   transport is not possible on the mission in question (see AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift
   Operations, for additional information).
      2.13.7.1. Decisions regarding acceptance of a differently-abled passenger for a flight
      shall be determined no lower than the shift supervisor with final determination made by
      the aircraft commander.
      2.13.7.2. Differently-abled passengers should be boarded early, preferably in seats close
      to latrine facilities if so desired, and be assisted in boarding by PSA and aircrew
      personnel. Ensure adequate assistance is provided to assure safety during all differently-
      abled passenger movement operations.
   2.13.8. Large-bodied passengers (passengers who cannot be safely restrained in a single
   aircraft seat using a single seatbelt). There may be times when these passengers cannot be
   accepted for flight aboard aircraft due to flight safety considerations. Commercial contract
   aircraft or KC-10 aircraft equipped with airline seats are authorized to use seat belt
   extensions to accommodate these passengers. Transport of these passengers may also be
   possible on other organic aircraft only if they are equipped with sidewall seats, utilizing only
   the standard aircraft seat belt restraints as they are designed to carry fully equipped
   paratroopers. For all other organic aircraft, seat belt extensions or cargo straps shall not be
   used.
   2.13.9. Movement of Pregnant and Postpartum Mothers and Newborn Infants shall be IAW
   DOD 4515.13-R.

Parts II and III and AFI 10-403. (T-0)
3.5. Load Planning. Load planners receive and monitor space allocations, pre-plan cargo
movements, pre-select cargo loads, and performs aircraft weight and balance. Load planners
also monitor the movement of explosives and cargo with approved diplomatic clearances. Load
planners monitor special interest and high priority cargo and conduct inventories as
directed/required. Note: Load planners will use forms IAW DTR 4500.9-R Part III, Appendix
V. (T-0)
   3.5.1. Load Planning Qualifications. Qualified personnel assigned to the load planning
   section must possess extensive job knowledge, be familiar with equipment/procedures
   utilized within the airlift system, have a 5-skill level, and meet the training requirements
   IAW Attachment 8 of this AFI. Load planning trainees must have their load plans validated
   by a certified load planner. For military personnel, document all training in accordance with
   AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, in the individual's training record, the Training
   Business Area, or AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, as
   appropriate. For civilian personnel document all training in the supervisor’s record of
   employee.
   3.5.2. Load Plan System
       3.5.2.1. Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES). ICODES is the DoD
       web-based system of record for completing computerized load plans. The DD Form
       2130 series/AF Form 4080 are the approved forms for completing manual load plans and
       maintaining qualifications. Access ICODES at https://icodesgs.sddc.army.mil/ or via
       the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) Electronic Transportation
       Acquisition (ETA) Portal https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/default.aspx.
       3.5.2.2. ICODES load plans may be uploaded and saved to the ICODES Information
       Repository (IR). When creating load plans for missions managed by USTC, load plans
       should be uploaded to the IR and saved using the full 12-character mission number as the
       file name. Load plans should be loaded to the IR NLT 6 hours prior to departure for
       flight manager fuel planning.
       3.5.2.3. ICODES formal training may be obtained through the AFRC Transportation
       Proficiency Center (TPC). Individuals assigned as trainers will instruct classes or
       perform OJT at home station. Training will be annotated IAW applicable guidance.
       3.5.2.4. ICODES System Change Requests (SCR). For ICODES system’s issues, AF
       load planners may submit SCR’s through HQ AMC/A4TI. This will assist the developers
       in the continued development of ICODES. For additional ICODES user guides, SCR
       instructions and the SCR Form go to the AMC/A4TI page on the AF Portal

annually. Coordinate required calibration with nearest Technical Measuring and Diagnostic
Equipment facility or base Contracting office. (T-2)
3.7. Protective Clothing/Spill Control Kits (not applicable to ADO locations). Protective
clothing/spill control kits will be available where hazardous materials are normally handled or
stored. Units may build or purchase commercial kits that meet or exceed AFMAN 24-204 IP
requirements. Refer to Installation Spill Prevention Plans for HAZMAT cleanup, emergency
response scenarios, evacuation procedures, etc. Note: Respiratory equipment is not required
provided requirements for this equipment are coordinated with the host base medical or
emergency services. (T-2)
3.8. Handling of Deceased Personnel (not applicable to ADO locations). Human Remains
shipments will move on a separate manifest, using the manifest as a hand-to-hand receipt. SAT
managers will ensure loading/unloading is accomplished discreetly and in a dignified manner.
Do not load/unload deceased personnel concurrently with passengers/patients. No cargo will be
loaded on top of transfer cases containing deceased personnel. However, if more than one
transfer case containing remains is shipped or stored, stacking is permitted, but should be
avoided if at all possible. (T-1)
   3.8.1. Transportation of deceased military personnel and other authorized remains is
   authorized between overseas and CONUS IAW AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program.
   Whenever possible, restrict movement of remains to cargo/dual configured airlift missions.
   Baggage compartment space on passenger type aircraft may be used when satisfactory
   service cannot be accomplished on cargo missions.
   3.8.2. Transfer cases containing remains will be stowed on the aircraft/pallet in a level
   position. The feet will never be higher than the head while in the stowed position. The head
   will always be positioned toward the nose of the aircraft. This procedure assures aircraft
   acceleration forces are borne by the feet, thereby avoiding damage to the head. When
   loaded, transfer cases should be loaded in the forward most available cargo position in the
   event jettisoning is necessary. Note: On wide body aircraft (e.g., C-5, C-17) transfer cases
   can be moved from one side of the aircraft to the other in the event jettisoning is required.
   Therefore, transfer cases may be loaded towards the rear of the aircraft if required.
   3.8.3. The maximum number of human remains transfer cases that may be safely transported
   on a single 463L pallet is 12. Place cases in three rows, each row stacked to a maximum of
   four.
   3.8.4. When remains are received, they will be stored in a secure area and separate from
   other cargo. If remains are not embalmed, refrigerated storage is required and when
   refrigeration is not available, contact Mortuary Affairs.
   3.8.5. Move remains on a space-required basis, using Defense Transportation Regulation
   documentation procedures.
   3.8.6. The shipping activity should provide the origin APOE with the following information
   as applicable, as far in advance as possible:
       3.8.6.1. Military personnel: name, grade, and SSN.
       3.8.6.2. Civilian employees: name, grade, SSN, and employment data.

        sponsor.
        3.8.6.5. Other United States citizens: name of decedent, name and address of sponsoring
        individual, agency or firm.
        3.8.6.6. The shipper marks the case with name and address of receiving funeral director.
        3.8.6.7. The shipper ensures a DD Form 2064, Certificate of Death (Overseas),
        preferably in English, is affixed to the transfer case of deceased personnel. If the
        certificate is not in English, the shipper provides a statement in English, stating the cause
        of death.
3.9. Aircraft Loading/Unloading. Load team chiefs will ensure a safety/ORA briefing and
safety check is conducted prior to the start of aircraft loading/unloading operations (see
Attachment 6, Load Team Chief Procedural Guide). Briefing topics will include, but not
limited to, standard hand signals, route to aircraft, load team position, type and uniqueness of
cargo, specific on/offloading instructions, chocking and use of MHE. A personal safety item
check will be accomplished and should include reflective vests/belts, gloves, ear protection
devices, safety-toe boots and light wands for night time operations. (T-1)
   3.9.1. The load team chief will conduct a briefing concerning all aspects of the load with all
   members of the load team. The load team chief will ensure all necessary equipment is
   available and delivered to the aircraft (ramp support, bridge plates, chock, shoring, rollerized-
   tines, etc.) and assigns qualified drivers to operate the MHE to transport the load to the
   aircraft and load the aircraft. (T-1)
   3.9.2. Loading operations will be a coordinated effort between the load team chief and the
   loadmaster/boom operator/contractor representative, etc. The load team, under the direction
   of the load team chief, assists the loadmaster/boom operator in preparing the aircraft for
   loading. Load teams will not spot MHE to/from aircraft, or perform cargo loading/off-
   loading duties without coordination with the loadmaster/boom operator. During aircraft
   loading operations, load teams will maintain positive control of cargo until cargo is secured
   to aircraft rail system/floor. (T-1)
   3.9.3. A chock will be placed in a position to ensure MHE does not come in contact with the
   aircraft. K-Loaders must stop at least 10 feet from aircraft for preliminary alignment. K-
   loaders will maintain approximately four to eight inches clearance between the rubber
   bumpers and the aircraft for minor adjustments during onloading. Forklifts will also
   maintain four to eight inches from the front of the fork tines and the aircraft. The vehicle
   operator will not attempt to judge clearances. Note: During forklift operations, the
   chocker/spotter can be the same person if the load team chief/supervisor, forklift operator and
   spotter/chocker all agree that critical clearances can be seen from the position of the
   chocker/spotter. (T-1)

   3.9.4. Equipment/vehicle operators and spotters will use the universal aircraft loading
   signals IAW AFMAN 24-306_IP, Manual for the Wheeled Operator. Close coordination
   between the primary spotter and vehicle operator must be maintained. Clear and concise
   signals must be used. In all instances where the vehicle operator does not understand, or is
   not sure of a signal given by the spotter, the vehicle operator will stop movement of the
   vehicle until clarification is received. Operators will halt movement of the vehicle any time
   visual or audible communication indicates to do so, or any time he or she cannot see or hear
   the spotter. (T-1)
   3.9.5. Due to the risk of personal injury, lack of training, and government liability of
   damage, SAT personnel will not operate any electrically powered mechanized systems or
   controls on commercial contracted aircraft. SAT personnel may handle manual equipment,
   such as pallet locks, under the supervision and approval of the carrier representative.
   3.9.6. Aircraft overboard venting of cryogenic liquid storage and transfer tanks. All
   cryogenic liquid storage and transfer tanks (unless “excepted" in AFMAN 24-204_IP) must
   be vented overboard the transport aircraft. The shipper is responsible for providing specific
   venting instructions in the Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods and for providing the
   equipment needed to vent the container overboard. Preparation and hookup (or disconnect)
   of the vent system will be accomplished by qualified shipper or aircraft maintenance
   personnel IAW the procedures outlined in TO 37C2-8-1-127, Liquid Oxygen and Nitrogen
   Overboard Vent System, C-130, C-17 and C-5 series aircraft. SAT or DCC personnel will
   prearrange for a qualified person to make the hookup at the desired time. SAT personnel and
   aircraft loadmaster/boom operators are not qualified to perform hookup or disconnection.
   (T-1)
3.10. Joint Inspection (JI) (not applicable to ADO locations). All SATs must establish a JI
Program. Exemptions can be made on a case-by-case basis by HAF/A4LR through
MAJCOM/A4R. An exempted location is still responsible to ensure required cargo inspections
occur before aircraft loading. Note: The 821 SPTS/LGT (AFSPC/Thule AB) is exempted from
maintaining a JI program. (T-1)
   3.10.1. Program requirements consist of three elements.
      3.10.1.1. Joint Inspection Instructor Qualification Course.
      3.10.1.2. Hazardous materials inspector/preparer qualifications IAW AFMAN 24-
      204(IP).
      3.10.1.3. Unit-level training.
   3.10.2. Requirements and qualifications for JI program managers, instructors and inspectors
   are listed in Attachment 7 of this instruction.
   3.10.3. Local management may allow the use of properly-trained 2T0X1 personnel to
   perform/augment 2T2X1 personnel with JIs. In order to perform this function, authorized
   members must meet all applicable JI training requirements as outlined in Attachment 7 of

4.2. Inbound Documentation. Information control ensures documentation is disseminated to
respective SAT functions and original copies are maintained in the station file. SATs will collect
and file terminating cargo and through load passenger/baggage manifests in the station file. If
documentation is incomplete or missing, information control will contact stations, (i.e.
originating or enroute) in an attempt to locate and recover missing documentation. Enter an
explanation in the remarks sections of the station file if document recovery efforts are
unsuccessful. (T-1)
4.3. Outbound Documentation. Information control will establish close coordination with load
planning in order to ensure receipt of outbound documentation prior to mission departure.
Information control will verify the mission document packet (except for passenger boarding
manifests) and account for completeness of its contents prior to delivery to the aircraft.
Information control will ensure the ramp coordinator delivers mission document packets to
outbound aircraft when the documentation is not available at the time of the aircrew briefing.
4.4. Aircraft Load Briefing. Information control, ramp coordinator, or designated
representative will brief the aircraft commander or designated representative (e.g. loadmaster or
boom operator) concerning seat release, NWRM/special cargo shipments, prisoners/guards,
couriers, number of pallets, load characteristics (e.g., overhang, rolling stock, etc.), total tonnage,
unique passengers handling, etc. (T-1)
4.5. Hazardous Cargo Briefing. Information control, ramp coordinator or designated
representative will brief the aircraft commander or designated representative (e.g. loadmaster or
boom operator) concerning hazardous cargo according to AFMAN 24-204_IP. The aircraft
commander or designated representative will print their name and rank directly below their
signature on the mission brief sheet or CMOS manifest. When the GATES Mission Brief Sheet
or ICODES load plan is utilized, load planners will print their name and rank directly below their
signature on the air terminal representative signature block. Ensure a copy is filed in the station
file folder. (T-1)
   4.5.1. For manual procedures, personnel will ensure the following air terminal inspection
   certification statement is annotated on the DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest, with printed
   name and signature of air terminal representative, "ALL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
   COVERED BY THIS MANIFEST HAVE BEEN INSPECTED AND FOUND TO BE
   PACKAGED IN THE PROPER OUTSIDE CONTAINER, FREE OF VISIBLE DAMAGE
   AND LEAKS, AND IS PROPERLY CERTIFIED.” Load planners will print their
   name/rank and place their signature directly below the statement. Additionally, ensure the
   following aircrew briefing statement is annotated on the DD Form 1385, "I HAVE BEEN
   BRIEFED ACCORDING TO AFMAN 24-204 IP, PARAGRAPH 1.2.9, ON HAZARDOUS
   CARGO COVERED BY THIS MANIFEST.” Once Information Control, ramp coordinator,
   or designated representative has briefed the aircraft commander or designated representative,
   have the aircraft commander or designated representative print their name/rank and sign their
   name directly below the statement. Apply these statements by pen and ink, programmed
   wording, rubber stamps, or typewriter. (T-0)
4.6. Ramp Control. The ramp coordinator is the eyes and ears of Information Control and will
monitor all air terminal ground handling operations to include maintaining constant
communication with Information Control. (T-1)
   4.6.1. The inbound ramp coordinator will: (T-1)
34 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


     4.6.1.1. Meet all inbound aircraft to collect cargo/passenger mission documentation.
     Exceptions may be made with prior coordination for local missions requiring no air
     terminal services.
     4.6.1.2. Ensure sufficient copies of registered mail/signature service manifests remain on
     the aircraft for special handling personnel to collect/transfer accountability.
     4.6.1.3. Physically inventory and annotate intransit cargo aboard aircraft by pallet
     position, weight, destination, pallet ID, and other locally required load planning
     information. Information for rolling stock and/or pallets that have forward and/or aft

                                           Chapter 5

                                    OTHER PROGRAMS

5.1. Purpose. This chapter identifies the various programs and requirements air transportation
operations management is responsible for. It establishes policies and procedures for obtaining
airlift support for the movement of passengers and cargo on military or chartered aircraft. It
addresses logistical support airlift transportation requirements (i.e., SAAM, OSA, JA/ATT, and
validating space available SAAMs). Finally, this chapter outlines the requirement for a Self-
Assessment Program and procedures for maintaining a robust 463L Pallet and Net Program.
5.2. Airlift Programs. The purpose of this section is to identify and provide guidance for the
various airlift programs associated with air transportation operations. Before requesting airlift
support, commanders at all levels will ensure that military airlift is necessary and economically
feasible to satisfy their movement requirement. Consideration must be given to all modes of
transportation. Deployment/redeployment/mid-phase rotation swap out of personnel and
equipment will be by most cost effective means (surface freight, dual-role, charter aircraft,
commercial ticketing) that meets mission requirements. Units within 1,000 surface miles of the
deployed location will plan to deploy and redeploy via surface/commercial transportation unless
lack of funds are justified by the installation commander. Planner or user convenience is not a
factor influencing the selection of military airlift. (T-1)
   5.2.1. Operational Support Airlift (OSA). OSA missions transport passengers on official
   travel and cargo when cost effective or with time, place, or mission-sensitive requirements.
   These missions are scheduled through the U.S. Transportation Command (USTC) Joint
   Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC) or respective theater OSA command and control
   (C2) authority. Passengers prepare a DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request
   and submit to the theater/service OSA validator to travel via OSA. Passengers who are on an
   advance list provided by an airlift validator need only present their orders (orders are not
   retained) for verification of duty status and an ID card. SAT personnel can accept telephone
   reservations from an airlift validator. SAT personnel will manifest all passengers traveling
   on OSA missions. Boarding passes are not required for passengers on administrative airlift
   unless there is a cash transaction or checked bags; this does not circumvent the requirements
   of DoD 4515.13-R. Normal processing procedures apply for terminal add-ons. The carriage
   of space available passengers and cargo specifically authorized by DoD 4515.13-R will be
   accommodated to the maximum extent possible. Consideration must be given to other modes
   of transportation that meet mission requirements. User convenience will not be the primary
   factor influencing the selection of OSA airlift. Refer to AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement,
   for additional guidance.
   5.2.2. Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM).            SAAMs are scheduled to
   accommodate special consideration due to the number of passengers involved, the weight or
   size of cargo, the urgency or sensitivity of movement, or other special factors with special
   pick-up or delivery by AMC/theater airlift at points outside established AMC routes.
   Respective MAJCOM Air Transportation staffs perform as SAAM command validators and
   disseminate program guidance outlined by USTC and established command unique guidance.
   The command validator will assign SAAM numbers/priorities in accordance with DTR
   4500.9-R, Part 1, appendix A.
36 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


     5.2.2.1. All requests (including KC-10 and KC-135 dual role airlift) will be submitted
     IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part l, Appendix B, Format for SAAM Request. Note: Local
     management will provide a current SAAM requester authorization letter to the respective
     MAJCOM validator. Letter should include requester’s name, rank, organization, office
     symbol, duty phone, fax number, and home phone. Authorization letters must be updated
     annually or earlier as needed for change of personnel (See Attachment 5, Program
     Management Letter). Once SAAM requesters are appointed, a SAAM Request System
     (SRS) account will be established within Consolidated Air Movement Planning System
     (CAMPS). All requests must be submitted in SRS (if required by MAJCOMs). (T-1)
     5.2.2.2. All unit airlift requests must be reviewed and submitted by local SAT/ASF
     section IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix B. SAT/ASF personnel are the focal point
     for all questions pertaining to SAAM requests on their installation. SAT personnel will
     be the communication conduit between their installation and MAJCOM airlift validators.
     SATs/ASFs will: (T-0)
        5.2.2.2.1. Be familiar with applicable transportation directives.
        5.2.2.2.2. Be able to discuss air transportation issues pertinent to their units’
        deployment.
        5.2.2.2.3. Document all travel requests.
        5.2.2.2.4. Submit airlift requests in a timely manner.
     5.2.2.3. Passenger SAAMs will not be validated for CONUS travel with the exception of
     civic leader tours.
     5.2.2.4. Deployment and redeployment request operating in successive months (i.e.,
     departing requirement in June and returning requirement in July) exceeding standard
     aircraft ground time must be broken into separate requests.
     5.2.2.5. For dual-role air refueling SAAMs, units must have at least six pallets of cargo
     to validate KC-10 aircraft and two pallets for KC-135 aircraft, not including baggage
     pallets. A validated air refueling (AR) requirement must be the primary means of
     validating dual role missions. Airlift is a separate process and is added to a valid dual
     role at user request if all program requirements are met. There are two means of
     satisfying AR requirements: Hard AR (obtained for user by AMC Current Operations or
     respective theater Air Refueling C2 authority), or Soft AR (coordination (verbal
     confirmation) between user and supporting flying wing). Satisfying AR requirements is a
     user responsibility. Provide all information pertaining to AR requirements in the remarks
     section of request.
     5.2.2.6. All requests for movement under AFMAN 24-204 IP, Chapter 3 must meet the
     requirements in DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Appendix Q and include full justification in the
     SAAM request along with general officer endorsement. Request for movement under
     Chapter 3 provisions is for operational necessity.
     5.2.2.7. Allow adequate cargo assembly/load plan time between available to load
     date/time (ALD) and pickup (PU). The latest arrival date/time (LAD) will include flying
     time to destination from location to location. Units will reflect at least one of the
     following date/time in ALD, PU, or LAD. All entries will be stated in Greenwich Mean
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                   37


      Time (ZULU). Date/time entries need to be coordinated between the flying wing and the
      user after the Mission Operating Directive is published. Date and time changes could
      cause loss of support.
   5.2.3. Space Available (Opportune) SAAMs. Space Available SAAMs are used to transport
   unfunded space available traffic. Space available traffic is defined as passenger and cargo
   traffic eligible for space that is surplus after all space required traffic has been
   accommodated. If funds are available for travel by any mode, an unfunded Space Available
   SAAM request cannot be submitted. Users will submit Non-Revenue Authorization (NRA),
   or space available, requests via SRS using the same procedures used for SAAMs IAW DTR
   4500-R, Part II, Appendix Q. Passengers and cargo must meet eligibility criteria as stated in
   DoD 4515.13-R.
      5.2.3.1. In billing and remarks fields, include Unfunded Transportation Request.
      Validators will pass validated requests to USTC via Single Mobility System (SMS).
      USTC approves and provide ID number for NRA movements.
      5.2.3.2. Unfunded requests will be approved by the wing commander or equivalent. This
      approval authority can be delegated no lower than the vice wing commander. Units
      requesting unfunded support must provide a justification statement along with a mission
      impact statement citing the outcome if not supported to respective MAJCOM validator.
      The justification will contain the following statement verbatim: “There are no funds
      available to move cargo or passengers by any mode of transportation.” Also include
      additional information that will assist in justifying the request to MAJCOM, USTC, or
      AMC.
   5.2.4. Enroute Support Team Advanced (ESTA) SAAM. Units are authorized one C-17
   equivalent per installation IAW USTC’s business rules. All ESTA SAAM requests must
   match supported aircraft routing in the Requirements section and require the Coronet number
   in Remarks section. Also, include entire routing in SRS “Remarks” section.
   5.2.5. Rapid Reaction SAAMs.         These missions must operate within 96-hours (i.e.,
   Hurricane Evacuations).
      5.2.5.1. Due to sensitivity of Rapid Reaction SAAMs, request should be sent to
      respective MAJCOM in an expeditious manner. All Rapid Reaction SAAM requests will
      be followed up with a phone call to respective MAJCOM validator. Due to limited
      aircraft availability, for planning factors request should not exceed one C-17 equivalent
      per installation.
      5.2.5.2. Individuals declaring a Rapid Reaction SAAM will have to answer the following
      questions in the Remarks section of the request:
a) Why the mission must operate inside the 96-hour window?

b) What is the mission impact if not supported as requested?

c) What level of leadership is directing the requirement to operate within the 96-hour window?

d) This individual will be no lower than O-7 in rank or civilian equivalent.
 38 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


Note: Any request received inside of this 96-hour window requires the 618th Air and Space
Operations Center (TACC) Commander (2-Star) or AMC Vice Commander (3-Star), or
respective theater Air Refueling C2 authority approval before the mission will operate.
       5.2.5.3. Units returning from evacuation should:
          5.2.5.3.1. Return by surface means for cargo and Commercial Air Movement for
          personnel. Funding for this requirement is a unit responsibility.
          5.2.5.3.2. Submit for airlift only if an urgent need to return to home station exists;
          justification must be provided to support airlift requests (fund cite must be included).
          If the return mission must operate within 96-hour window the requesting unit will
          have to meet the same requirements stated in paragraph 5.2.5.
          5.2.5.3.3. Normally, the priority used for return missions are significantly lower thus
          decreasing chances for support.         Funding requirements will apply to user
          redeployment.
Note: Consider surface transportation as the primary mode to support hurricane evacuation
plans. Installations must provide a fund site on all requests prior to submission.
   5.2.6. Denton Amendment Movements. Denton Amendment cargo is humanitarian cargo
   donated by private citizens or organizations that may move on space available basis on DoD
   assets. Joint Mobility Control Group is the responsible clearinghouse for all Denton
   Amendment and space available cargo lift requests. Refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part III,
   Appendix G or http://hatransportation.ohasis.org for guidance.
   5.2.7. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT). JA/ATT provides basic
   airborne training and proficiency and/or continuation training for movement of passengers
   and cargo by air in a joint environment. Missions authorized by JA/ATT are listed in AMC
   OPORD 17-76, JA/ATT. For most Air Force units, JA/ATT static load C-17s, C-5s, and C-
   130s provide the capability to conduct hands-on training for Wing augmentee program
   aircraft load teams. Units should submit requests to respective MAJCOM validator IAW
   guidance provided by their MAJCOM.
       5.2.7.1. Missions should be scheduled in conjunction with a local exercise to ensure
       optimum training.
       5.2.7.2. Aircraft for maintenance, operations, or SAT ground training will be used a
       minimum of 12 hours. (T-3)
       5.2.7.3. In order to increase JA/ATT support opportunities, all units should be flexible in
       regards to their training schedule. Units must plan and coordinate static load training,
       aircraft positioning and depositioning requirements in advance to meet program
       requirements. (T-3)
       5.2.7.4. Units are highly encouraged to be proactive in trying to obtain JA/ATT support
       opportunities. Units should look to coordinate JA/ATT training with airlift agencies
       during the JA/ATT validation period. Contact information for flying wings can be
       located on the JA/ATT website at https://jaatt.amc.af.mil/default.aspx. Proper
       coordination will prevent unnecessary conflicts and costly cancellations.
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                     39


       5.2.7.5. Equipment/cargo tasked to support JA/ATT training during local exercises
       should be Unit Type Code (UTC) specific and should include varied loads (i.e., bomb
       loaders, communication vans, and other unique rolling stock) to enhance realistic training
       of both augmentees and aircrews.
       5.2.7.6. All unit JA/ATT program monitors must be approved and appointed in writing
       by unit commander or designate rep. Units will forward a current JA/ATT letter to the
       respective MAJCOM validator. Letters will be updated annually or upon change of
       personnel. (see Attachment 5, Program Management Letter) (T-2)
Note: For KC-10 or KC-135 to be considered for a JA/ATT, a refueling requirement must be
tied to the mission and coordinated prior to training request. (T-1)
   5.2.8. Training Missions. Training missions are those missions that are unit-planned that
   support operational training requirements primarily for aircrew but can also be in support of
   aeromedical evacuation crews and mission support functions such as air transportation,
   maintenance and C2 personnel. Aircrew training missions allow opportunities to move space
   available passengers and opportune cargo. These space available missions may result when
   minor adjustments are made to a scheduled training mission to accommodate the airlift
   requirement, or when a productive aircrew training mission can be generated while
   producing the airlift.
       5.2.8.1. Use of aircrew training missions for logistical support is only authorized when
       transportation is not over an established channel route or when channel route capability is
       exceeded.
       5.2.8.2. Training missions must be built in the Global Decision Support System 2 (GDSS
       2) to ensure ITV is captured for passengers and cargo. (T-2)
5.3. 463L Pallet and Net Management. Unit Pallet and net managers must be appointed in
writing by the unit commander or designate representative. Letter will be updated annually, or
earlier as needed for change of personnel (see Attachment 5, Program Management Letter). (T-
0)
   5.3.1. The redistribution of serviceable equipment will be directed and controlled by each
   MAJCOM’s pallet and net manager. (T-2)
   5.3.2. Units must control, maintain, inspect, and report pallets and nets IAW DTR 4500.9-R,
   Part VI, Management and Control of Intermodal Containers and System 463L Equipment, its
   supplements, applicable AFIs, and any supplements, TO 35D 33-2-2-2, Instruction with
   Parts Breakdown -- 463L Air Cargo Pallets, Types HCU-6/E and HCU-12/E and TO 35D

   HCU-15/C, II, Top, HCU11/C, III, Side, HCU-16/C, IV, Top. Units will conduct a physical
   inventory of pallets, nets, and report monthly in Global Asset Reporting Tool (GART).
   Except those locations who report to AMC (weekly reporting required), all other locations
   will submit their reports between the 15th and 20th of each month. (T-0)
   5.3.3. Re-validate 463L pallets and nets annually for operational and War Reserve Materiel
   (WRM) authorization levels. AMC, as DoD pallet/net managers, will publish guidance
   annually to MAJCOMs on re-validation procedures. (T-1)
 40 AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014


   5.3.4. In the event the local air transportation function cannot support adequate 463L pallets
   and nets for a unit deployment, the air transportation pallet and net managers will coordinate
   with MAJCOM pallet and net manager to request additional assets. MAJCOM pallet and net
   managers will coordinate with AMC to request additional assets if the deployment cannot be
   supported from within the MAJCOM. (T-2)
Note: Only 463L pallets and nets will be provided by AMC. Required couplers, chains and
devices will be provided by AMC only for subfloor requirements (only applies to those aircraft
requiring subfloor when scheduled by 618 AOC). Couplers, chains and devices for other
requirements are the unit’s responsibility.
   5.3.5. IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI, Ch 608, secure cargo to the aircraft floor using tiedown
   equipment organic to the aircraft or provided by the local air transportation function.
   However, to secure cargo to pallets, deploying units must procure and control their own
   standard pallet couplers, plastic coverings, tiedown equipment (less nets), and dunnage
   and/or shoring. It is not the responsibility of the local air transportation function to provide
   this tiedown equipment to deploying units. For cargo moving via channel missions, tiedown
   equipment is subject to one-for-one exchange for serviceable items only. (T-0)
       5.3.5.1. Advise units and shippers of their responsibility to program and fund the
       acquisition of tiedown equipment to move their shipments on 463L pallets to preclude
       work stoppages, cancellation, or delay of missions. DTR 4500.9-R, Part VI, Table 608-1
       itemizes this equipment by nomenclature and national stock number. (T-3)
   5.3.6. SATs/ASFs may be officially tasked (via email) by either their respective MAJCOM
   or through proper coordination with AMC/A4TR to ship 463L assets. The tasking will
   include tasking number, shipping address DODAAC, POC at receiving station, amount of
   463L assets to be shipped, and appropriate transportation funding code. The unit must
   respond to email notification within one duty day. The response must include the
   Transportation Control Number (TCN), type movement, and estimated ship date. (T-1)
   5.3.7. Repair of damaged 463L pallets and nets is a critical part of overall mission success.
   Units are responsible for preventative maintenance as outlined in 463L asset T.O.s (e.g. rust,
   mildew, etc.). All units are required to ship depot repairable pallets and nets to the
   appropriate repair facility. Prepare, mark and label reparable pallets IAW TO 35D33-2-2-2.
   Contact respective MAJCOM for shipping instructions and information on transportation
   funding. (T-0)
       5.3.7.1. 463L nets in need of depot repair must be inspected and packaged according to
       T.O. 35D33-2-3-1. (T-0)
5.4. RFID Tag Management. Where required, RFID tags will be managed and reported using
GART in conjunction with monthly 463L asset reporting (applies to AMC units only). Local
management will determine and maintain sufficient quantity of RFID tags and replacement
batteries to support cargo operations. Support IDO in managing unit move RFID requirements
as described in AFI 24-203 and AFI 10-403. (T-2)
   5.4.1. Starting 1 January 2014, DOD will only authorize use of tags in the supply chain that
   are compliant with the ISO 18000-7 standard protocol. RFID tags should be ordered from
   the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) using normal supply replenishment procedures.
   National Stock Numbers for all ISO tag models can be found at
AFI24-114 4 SEPTEMBER 2014 Corrective Actions Applied on 16 September 2014                       41


   http://www.ait.army.mil/Contracts/rfidiii/nsn_for_rfid.html. ISO tags can also be
   procured through Army’s Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (AMIS) using
   the RFID IV Contract (http://www.pdamis.army.mil/Contracts/rfidiv/rfidiv.html).

                           AERIAL DELIVERY OPERATIONS

6.1. Purpose. Designated ADOs exist to prepare, rig, and inspect AF supplies and equipment
for local assigned unilateral airdrop training missions. This existence is primarily to support
aircrew airdrop training proficiencies. Current rigging TOs will be available and used in load
rigging/buildup areas. (T-1)
   6.1.1. All aerial delivery training loads will simulate actual aerial delivery load weights and
   configurations as much as possible. All vehicle training loads must be marked “For Training
   Only.” Units will account for these vehicles by maintaining jacket files containing the source
   documents used to withdraw the vehicles from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing
   Office (DRMO). Maintain this accountability until the vehicle is turned back in to DRMO.
   These vehicles will be used only as aerial delivery training loads and will not be repaired or
   used for any other purpose. To obtain these vehicles, units will comply with requirements of
   AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. (T-1)
   6.1.2. Inspect, repair, and repack unit assigned cargo parachutes and rigging equipment IAW
   applicable TOs.
   6.1.3. Recover unilateral airdrop training loads, bundles, and associated equipment from the
   drop zone (DZ) and return these items to the unit. Airdrop training loads must be recovered
   from the DZ as soon as possible following each training mission to reduce the risk of loss or
   damage while on the DZ. In particular, every effort must be made to reduce the exposure of
   parachutes and rigging equipment to destructive elements. All DZ recovery vehicles should
   have off-road or four-wheel drive capability to ensure minimum damage to the recovery
   vehicles. Note: During periods of low visibility or darkness, while conducting peacetime
   operations, all personnel working on the flight line or the DZ will wear reflective vests or
   other reflective material.
   6.1.4. Maintain an adequate stock level of current aerial delivery system equipment,
   components, and supplies and provide secure storage for items subject to pilferage.
6.2. Notifications, investigations, reporting, and submitting reports of parachute and
airdrop load malfunctions/incidents will be conducted IAW Air Force Joint Instruction
(AFJI) 13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction/Investigation, and Activity
Reporting. (T-1)

A6.1. Pre-Loading Guide
Attention: All Team Chiefs will strictly adhere to the guidance of loadmasters/boom operator.
Cargo will not be handled loaded/offloaded without coordination. Note: The load team chief will
walk the entire load before cargo heads to the aircraft. This will ensure proper load setup. Inspect
all pallets for air worthiness, tight/serviceable tie-down, pallet damage, and cleanliness. Verify
with load planning that roller limitations have not been exceeded.
   A6.1.1. Assign crew duties (spotter, chocker, driver)
   A6.1.2. The load team chief is ultimately responsible for the load team and cargo safety
   during operations. The Load Team Chief must complete a safety briefing prior to
   commencing operations. The briefing must cover at a minimum – established evacuation
   route(s) and rally point for emergencies, any environmental limitations (i.e., ice/snow,
   temperature, poor visibility, etc.) and PPE/gear requirements and verify requirements for fall
   harness.
   A6.1.2.1. Special attention should be given when performing loading operations with a
   60K Tunner loader through the nose of the B-747 airframe. A safety hazard exists along the
   loader’s front, right-hand side; there is a gap of 2 to 4 ft between the loader rails and the
   airframe. During loading operations, ensure heightened awareness and brief personnel to stay
   clear of this area.)
       A6.1.2.2. When performing pallet loading and spinning operations with K-loaders from
       the rear of C-5/C-17 aircraft, pay special attention to the adjacent open ramp area. Ensure

       also applies to C-5 front ramp loading.
       A6.1.2.3. During loading operations from the side of the aircraft (KC-10, KC-135, DC-8,
       etc.) brief all personnel of the gap that exist between the K-loader right rail and the
       airframe. This also applies to belly loads on commercial aircraft. Stay clear of area and
       ensure awareness is heightened during loading operations.
       A6.1.2.4. When loading C-130 aircraft, beware of a safety hazard that exist on the right
       side; there is a gap between the loader rail and the airframe. During loading operations,
       ensure heightened awareness and brief personnel to stay clear of this area.
       A6.1.2.5. Load teams will not spot MHE to/from aircraft without coordination with the
       loadmaster/boom operator during aircraft on/off load operations.
       A6.1.2.6. Load teams will not load/offload cargo to/from the aircraft without
       loadmaster/boom operator coordination.
       A6.1.2.7. During aircraft on-load operations, load teams will maintain control of
       palletized cargo until cargo is secured to aircraft rail system/floor.
       A6.1.2.8. Personnel will not walk between the spotter and the vehicle being spotted
