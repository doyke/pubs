2.3. All units assigned, attached and associate will be responsible for care and storage of
containers in their units. Parts will be placed in the container and stored until it is returned to
use. The unserviceable part will be placed in the box the same way the serviceable part was

type, size and location. Every effort should be made by each squadron to reuse at least 90% of
materials.
2.3.6. Identify excess containers as to be used, reissued or returned to correct equipment item
manager.
2.3.7. Return containers to 35 LRS/LGRDDC for lateral support to other MAJCOM activities
upon direction from the base BCM.

3. PROCEDURES:
3.1. Opening containers and reuse of packaging materials: Care must be taken when opening
and unpacking to prevent damage to containers and their components. Use band cutters, nail
pullers and like tools made for the purpose if disassembly. Internal packing such as special
mounts, latex hair, sponge, foam in-place and other dunnage will be put back in the container for
reuse.
3.2. Receipt/turn-in of SPI containers.
3.2.1. Organizations accepting custody of material on a DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/
Receipt Document, with an SPI number annotated in block 16 and the words “Reusable
Container” in block 27, will ensure the container has the following markings:
3.2.1.1. SPI and stock number or fast pack number.
3.2.1.2. “Reusable container—do not destroy.”
3.2.2. When items requiring an SPI container are issued for storage, shipment or use without the
container, “no container issued” will be annotated in block 27 of the DD Form 1348-1A. This
document and an AF IMT 451 must accompany the repairable/serviceable part until it is
packaged for shipment.
3.2.3. If 35 LRS/LGRDDC receives an inbound item without the proper container, they are
responsible for submitting a Standard Form 364, Report of Discrepancy. One copy must be kept
with the repairable/serviceable replaced part when brought to the Deployment and Distribution
Flight for shipment. “Item issued without proper container” will be reflected on the AF IMT
451. In-turn, this item will not count as a negative notation on the monthly reports accomplished
by the base BCM.
3.3. Reusable containers will be kept in each unit for minimum of 180 days. If they are not used
after the 90-day period, a letter will be submitted to 35 LRS/LGRDDC for excess turn-in. The
BCM will provide disposition instructions IAW AFI 24-203.
3.4. Materiel requiring an SPI pack for shipment/storage must be sent to 35 LRS/LGRDDC
through the proper channels with the proper container. If the container has been destroyed,
damaged or lost, the user must complete an AF IMT 451, have it signed by a unit approving
official, then turned over to 35 LRS/LGRDDC with the item to be shipped.
