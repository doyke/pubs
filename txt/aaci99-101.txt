BY ORDER OF THE COMMANDER                                                            AFDTC INSTRUCTION 99-101
AIR FORCE DEVELOPMENT TEST CENTER (AFMC)                                                     20 FEBRUARY 1996

                                                                                                  Test and Evaluation

                                                             PLANNING, COMMANDING, AND CONTROLLING
                                                                          OF OFF-BASE TEST ACTIVITIES

This instruction implements AFPD 99-1, Test and Evaluation Process. It establishes procedures and responsibilities
for planning, commanding, and controlling of off-base testing by the 46th Test Wing (46 TW) and other AFDTC
personnel supporting the 46 TW. This instruction, in conjunction with test directives (TDs), establishes functional
relationships among Government test team participants operating at off-base/deployed testing locations. In special
cases when the 46 TW is delegated or assigned a special evaluation responsibility of which test is only a part, this
instruction will not apply and special procedures will be developed. Deployments from Eglin AFB to Holloman
AFB are subject to this instruction; however, planning and execution of the deployment will be greatly simplified
due to the existence of the 46th Test Group (46 TG) and 586th Flight Test Squadron (586 FTS) at Holloman AFB
(see paragraph 3.1.3). Deployments from Holloman AFB to test locations other than Eglin AFB are subject to this
instruction. See 46 TWI 11-201 for specific flying operation procedures at off-base locations.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision aligns the instruction with AFPD 99-1, and updates office symbols and titles. It also changes the title
of deployment director to deployment commander, and cross-references appropriate 46th Test Wing and 46th
Operations Group instructions.

1. General. This instruction provides policy guidelines and procedures for planning off-base testing, designating a
deployment commander and/or leader, and identifying test team responsibilities. This instruction does not supersede
existing organizational responsibilities in planning, conducting, or supporting test activities. These procedures apply
for all tests conducted, wholly or in part, at off-base locations. In special cases, where a permanent operating
location is established, a detachment leader will be designated and assigned the same responsibilities as the transitory
deployment commander or test team leader.

2. Terms Explained:

2.1. Deployment Commander. This individual is designated in writing by the 46 TW Commander (46 TW/CC) and
is responsible for all off-base activities in support of a particular test on a particular deployment. The deployment
commander is normally the senior ranking military or civilian individual supporting the test, but may be the test
engineer responsible for the conduct of the test.

2.2. Team Leader. This individual is responsible for providing 46 TW support at an off-base test location during a
specific deployment when an individual from another organization is deployment commander.

2.3. Officer in Charge (OIC) or Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC). This individual is responsible for
all AFDTC military matters. The OIC has no test direction authority unless this person is also designated specific
responsibilities.
