                                           Chapter 1

                                       CAPABILITIES

1.1. General. The purpose of this instruction is to bring together all the services provided by
the 45th Weather Squadron (45 WS) to all customers within the Cape Canaveral Spaceport.
Basic support concepts and procedures are outlined in this instruction along with Air Force and
Air Force Space Command directives, the Range Universal Documentation System (UDS) and
the 45 SW Operation Instructions (OI) for Range Support.
1.2. Concept of Operation. The 45 WS provides or arranges weather support to personnel and
organizations of the 45 SW, tenant units and all Eastern Range (ER) users. They provide a full
spectrum of meteorological products and services to customers including PAFB, CCAFS,
National Aeronautics and Space Administration – Kennedy Space Center (NASA-KSC), Human
Spaceflight Support (HSFS), Jonathan Dickenson Missile Tracking Annex (JDMTA), Malabar
Complex, Detachment 1, 45th Operations Group (OG) Antigua Air Station, Antigua Island,
Detachment 2, 45 OG, Ascension Auxiliary Airfield, Ascension Island and Argentia,
Newfoundland. General services provided to 45 WS customers include surface observations,
upper air observations, forecasts, meteorological watch bulletins, and unique or specialized
weather support. Support requirements not covered in this instruction must be coordinated
between the user and 45 WS Director of Operations (45 WS/DO) with as much advance notice as
possible.
   1.2.1. The 45 WS is composed of two divisions focused on different aspects of the mission.
   The operations division deals with weather support to the customer. The Range Weather
   Operations Center, (RWOC), provides operational support from the Morrell Operations
   Center (MOC) at CCAFS. The systems division (SY), located at PAFB, is responsible for
   weather system requirements, scientific research and resource management. The 45 WS
   provides airfield weather services for PAFB and the CCAFS Skid Strip. These services
   include airfield weather observation data PAFB and CCAFS Skid Strip, which is provided by
   the FMQ-19 Automated Observing Systems.
   1.2.2. The Eastern Range Technical Services Contract (ERTSC) provides observation data
   for selected KSC locations and is responsible for the operations and maintenance of specific
   meteorological equipment at specified ER and KSC locations, as identified in the ERTSC
   Statement of Work. In addition, the ERTSC contractor provides airfield weather services for
   the KSC Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF).
   1.2.3. The Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) is co-located with the RWOC and consists of a
   NASA-funded team of contractors and NASA atmospheric scientists created to support three
   participating organizations: National Weather Service (NWS), NASA and the USAF. The
   AMU’s mission is to provide weather support enhancements that safely increase space flight
   launch and landing opportunities and the productivity of associated ground processing
   operations, and reduce weather support system life-cycle costs.
1.3. Operational Sensor Suite. To fulfill the weather support mission, the ER operates and
maintains an extensive suite of weather sensors and systems to ingest, process, manage,
distribute, and archive meteorological information from local sensors, as well as national,
international, and satellite sources. Most of the equipment located on the ER is described in the
 8                                                               45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012


ER Instrumentation Handbook - Weather Systems. The majority of these systems are operated
and maintained by the 45 SW, but the ER also uses data from instrumentation sources operated
and maintained by other government agencies, including NASA, NWS, other USAF agencies,
and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Due to the diversity
of specialized systems and number of active sensors, the ER meteorological equipment suite
represents one of the largest concentrations of meteorological instrumentation in the world. The
density of sensors, combined with state of the art technology and 24-hour data collection,
provides a multitude of specialized measurements that help the USAF and its launch customers
successfully complete their missions in a variety of weather conditions.
1.4. Operational Support Requirements. Supported agencies will:
     1.4.1. Coordinate support requirements not covered in this plan with the 45 WS/DO as far in
     advance as possible.
     1.4.2. Ensure 45 WS is informed of critical weather elements affecting their operations.
     1.4.3. Ensure procedures are established within their organization to adequately respond to
     disseminated weather information.
     1.4.4. Review this instruction at least annually for any changes in support requirements.

                                  OBSERVING SERVICES

2.1. General. The 45 WS maintains an automated surface weather observing capability at
PAFB and CCAFS Skid Strip. Contract weather observers are employed at the KSC SLF control
tower. PAFB and CCAFS have operational FMQ-19 Automated Observing Systems (AOS)
which report meteorological conditions 24-hours per day. Contract employees under the ERTSC
also provide upper air observations from the CCAFS Balloon Facility (Bldg # 20185). A variety
of weather balloons are released to acquire wind, temperature, pressure, and humidity data to
support ER operations. Other observational data are generated by an instrumented tower system,
wind profilers, and several lightning detection and radar systems located on and around CCAFS,
NASA-KSC, and PAFB.
   2.1.1. Airfield Weather Sensor Limitations. The FMQ-19 AOS is the primary instrument
   for measuring atmospheric conditions. The system has the following inherent limitations:
       2.1.1.1. Wind gust spread is not reported.
       2.1.1.2. Only three cloud layers are reported.
       2.1.1.3. Cloud layers above 25,000 ft are not reported.
       2.1.1.4. Cloud cover or amount is determined using weighted readings over a 30 minute
       period. This results in an underestimation of cloud amount when a new layer moves over
       the system and an overestimation of cloud amount as a cloud layer moves away from the
       sensor.
       2.1.1.5. Visibility is determined by averaging one minute readings over a 10 minute time
       period.
       2.1.1.6. Runway Visual Range (RVR) is determined by averaging one-minute readings
       over a 10 minute time period.
       2.1.1.7. The FMQ-19 is unable to detect hail, volcanic ash and tornadoes.
2.2. Surface Observations. Observing procedures for all locations are accomplished IAW
standards established in AFMAN 15-111. Contract weather observers at the SLF maintain a
Basic Weather Watch by rechecking weather conditions at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes
since the last observation/recheck. This is done to determine the need for a special or local
observation.
   2.2.1. Examples of Surface Observations. 45 WS provides training to those units with New
   Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS) or Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) monitors for
   explanations and format breakdowns.
       2.2.1.1. Hourly and Special.

2.3. Patrick AFB (KCOF) Surface Observations. The Base Weather Station (BWS) located
in building 820, is not manned. The FMQ-19 AOS operates continuously to provide weather
observations. The FMQ-19 AOS system is located on Runway 02 at the 1065ft mark and on
Runway 20 at the 1024ft mark. In the event of a system or sensor failure, 45 WS personnel will
augment observations during the hours the airfield is open. Augmented (manual) observations
will also be performed in the event of forecasted severe weather (¾‖ hail, tornadoes), which the
FMQ-19 cannot detect. The location for taking manual weather observations is about 200 feet
west of Building 820. From this point, the observer’s view is limited NNE – ESE; however, the
weather observing tower located adjacent to the point of observation provides a full view of that
segment.
   2.3.1. KCOF Observer Duty Priorities. During periods when the FMQ-19 is augmented, the
   following duty priorities will be followed:
       2.3.1.1. Emergency war orders.
       2.3.1.2. Execute evacuation.
       2.3.1.3. Respond to aircraft/ground emergencies.
       2.3.1.4. Provide ―Eyes Forward‖ / Collaborate with RWOC.
       2.3.1.5. Disseminate surface observations.
       2.3.1.6. Answer operational phone calls and provide other weather information to
       customers.
   2.3.2. Hourly Observations. Hourly observations include:

       Single element specials are authorized for these criteria (AFMAN 15-111).
       2.3.3.5. A thunderstorm either begins or ends (AFMAN 15-111). No special is required
       when a new thunderstorm begins if one is currently being reported.
       Note: A thunderstorm is not considered to have ended until 15 minutes after the last
       occurrence of criteria for a thunderstorm (i.e., thunder and lightning) is detected.
       2.3.3.6. Precipitation begins or ends (AFMAN 15-111).
       2.3.3.7. Hail begins or ends (AFMAN 15-111).

       2.3.3.9. Wind and wind shifts (AFMAN 15-111):
          2.3.3.9.1. The wind speed suddenly increases by at least 16 knots and is sustained at
          22 knots or more for at least a minute (squall).
          2.3.3.9.2. Any wind direction change of 45 degrees or more in less than 15 minutes
          when the sustained wind speed throughout the shift is 10 knots or more.
       2.3.3.10. Within 15 minutes after returning to duty following a break in hourly coverage

   2.3.4. Dissemination. Observations are disseminated locally and longline over the New
   Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS), or the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) to a number of
   agencies. In the event of an N-TFS/JET outage, the forecaster located at CCAFS will
   disseminate weather information to the air traffic control (ATC) tower via telephone.
   2.3.5. Patrick AFB Alternate Observing Site. The Alternate Observing Site at PAFB is in
   Building 629, located northeast of the approximate center point of runway 02/20. From this
   alternate location, the observer’s view is limited from SE-SW-NW-N. The observer will rely
   on reports from ATC tower controllers to assist in observing weather approaching from those
   directions. Pressure and wind data are estimated while the Alternate Observing Site is
   utilized.
2.4. CCAFS (KXMR) Surface Observations. The FMQ-19 AOS operates continuously to
provide weather observations. In the event of a system or sensor failure, 45 WS personnel will
augment observations during the hours the airfield is open. Augmented (manual) observations
will also be performed in the event of forecasted severe weather (¾‖ hail, tornadoes) which is
undetectable by the automated system. The FMQ-19 system is located on Runway 13 at the
1480ft mark and on Runway 31 at the 1550ft mark.
   2.4.1. CCAFS Observer Duty Priorities. During periods when the FMQ-19 is augmented,
   the following duty priorities will be followed:

   2.4.5. Launch Observations. During launch operations, ERTS contractor personnel take
   mission-specific weather observations for CCAFS from Weather Station A, Building 20185
   (balloon facility). These observations are taken on an as-needed basis and are only
   disseminated locally. No viewing obstructions exist at this location.
2.5. KSC - Shuttle Landing Facility (KTTS). The RTSC contractor provides daily surface
observing support to KSC from the fourth floor of Building J5-1197 (Air Traffic Control Tower)
at the SLF. Weather observers maintain a Continuous Weather Watch, 24-hours per day, 7-days
per-week. Weather observations are taken from the facility located approximately 500 feet east
of the SLF. The observer’s view is generally unobstructed. Weather observations are taken
hourly and whenever established special or local criteria are met. During Space Shuttle
operations, observations are taken as follows:

   TFS outage during a Space Shuttle Operation, surface weather observations can be
   transmitted to Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston via Meteorological Interactive Data
   Display System (MIDDS).
2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch Program (CWW). The CWW program is a mechanism to
leverage non-weather personnel in the identification and monitoring of potentially severe
weather conditions and enhance the weather squadron’s support to local customers. Through an
agreement with the weather squadron, ATC personnel at PAFB and CCAFS will advise the
45 WS duty forecaster of changing weather conditions based on a set of predetermined
conditions outlined in paragraph 7.5. They will also relay Pilot Reports (PIREPS) and any other
significant observation.
2.7. Aircraft Mishaps. Upon notification of an aircraft mishap, the 45 WS will collect and save
data related to the mishap IAW AFMAN 15-129 and AFMAN 15-111.
2.8. Upper Air Observations. The 45 WS provides upper air observations via the ERTS
contractor at CCAFS.
   2.8.1. The ERTS contractor provides upper air observation from Weather Station A,
   Building 20185. Both high and low-resolution balloons are released to acquire wind,
   temperature, pressure and humidity data to support range operations. During normal, day-to-
   day operations, upper air observations are taken twice daily (0615L and 1815L), 7 days-per-
   week. During the convective season (May – Oct), an additional sounding is taken at 1100L.
   For launch operations, the schedule for upper air soundings is customer driven and changes
   with each vehicle launched from the ER and KSC.
   2.8.2. High/Low Resolution Launches.
       2.8.2.1. High Resolution Radiosondes. High Resolution Automated Meteorological
       Profiling System (AMPS) radiosondes are connected directly beneath a clear Jimsphere.
       They measure wind speed and direction only, and have an altitude restriction of 55,000 ft
       (balloon loses lift and starts to float). They are called 'high resolution' winds because of
       the Jimsphere’s capability to detect small-scale wind features. Jimsphere’s are only used
       for launch support.
       2.8.2.2. Low Resolution Radiosondes.         Low Resolution AMPS radiosondes are
       connected 70 feet below a latex balloon. They measure wind direction and speed,
       temperature and humidity. These balloons reach 100,000 feet on a regular basis. The
       wind measurements are considered 'low resolution' because the pendulum motion of the
       70 ft train is filtered out during derivation of the final winds, eliminating small-scale
       wind features. Thee low-resolution radiosondes are used for launch and landing support,
       as well as daily synoptic weather model runs.

                                        FORECASTING

3.1. General. The 45 WS provides Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), planning forecasts,
and (mission execution forecasts) for activities such as aviation operations, and range ground
processing and launch operations. All forecasting services are provided from the RWOC located
in the MOC, Building 81900 on CCAFS. Forecasting services are available 24 hours a day, 7
days per week. The RWOC forecaster can be contacted at: Commercial (321) 853-8484/8485,
DSN: 467-8484/8485.
   3.1.1. RWOC Alternate Operating Location. If the need to evacuate the RWOC occurs and
   is expected to last more than 60 minutes, one RWOC forecaster will evacuate to the PAFB
   BWS and provide support until operations in the RWOC have resumed. For evacuations less
   than 60 minutes, the RWOC forecaster will be available via cell phone at (321) 431-4524.
   3.1.2. RWOC Duty Priorities.          Since all forecasting tasks cannot be performed
   simultaneously, priorities are established to ensure tasks are accomplished in proper order.
   Support agencies should be aware of and respect these priorities. Customers should be aware
   duty priorities may change during launch operations. Duty priorities (in order of importance)
   are:
       3.1.2.1. Emergency war orders.
       3.1.2.2. Execute 45 WS evacuation.
       3.1.2.3. Respond to aircraft/ground emergencies.
       3.1.2.4. Provide Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV).

3.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts. The 45 WS will produce TAFs for Patrick AFB (KCOF)
and the SLF (KTTS) and issue them IAW AFMAN 15-124. Forecast elements refer to an area
within a five nautical mile (NM) radius centered on the midpoint of the runways. The term
―VC‖ (vicinity), referring to the area between 5 and 10 NM from the aerodrome complex, may
be used in these forecasts. Forecasts are monitored and amended as required per criteria
established by HQ USAF/A3O-W and as agreed upon by local supported organizations.
   3.2.1. Patrick AFB. The PAFB airfield complex is a limited duty operation. As such, the
   45 WS issues TAFs for Patrick AFB (KCOF) at 1100Z, 1900Z, and 0300Z daily except
   during EDT when they are each issued one Zulu hour earlier. When the airfield is closed,
   TAFs will not be issued or amended. An example of a Patrick AFB TAF is at attachment 2.
       3.2.1.1. Amendment Criteria. 45 WS issues and amends the KCOF TAF when not
       representative of existing thresholds and conditions and when those conditions are
       expected to persist for 30 minutes or longer, and if conditions are not covered in a current
       change group which will become valid by the next cardinal hour. The forecast is issued
       and amended for the following items.
          3.2.1.1.1. The ceiling and/or visibility is, or is expected to be, out of category.
          Ceiling/visibility categories are determined by the lower of the ceiling or visibility
          elements. Amendments are not required when either the ceiling or visibility improves
          to a higher category and the other remains in the lower category.                The
          ceiling/visibility categories are:

          3.2.1.1.2. Wind speed error of 10 knots or more (predominant or gust), or a direction
          error of 30 degrees or more if the predominate wind speed or gusts are, or are
          expected to be, in excess of 15 knots.
          3.2.1.1.3. Anytime in the interest of safety, efficiency of aircraft operations, or flight
          planning.
          3.2.1.1.4. Any locally established criterion for weather warnings/advisories which:
              3.2.1.1.4.1. Occurs, or is expected to occur, but is not specified in the original
              forecast.
              3.2.1.1.4.2. Is no longer occurring, or is not expected to recur, but was specified
              in the original forecast.
          3.2.1.1.5. Thunderstorm is no longer expected to occur and is in the TAF. Also, if
          thunderstorms are not in the TAF and they are now expected or occur.

          3.2.1.1.6. The beginning or ending of turbulence or icing from the surface through
          10,000 feet above ground level (AGL) which meets, exceeds or decreases below
          moderate or severe thresholds, and was not specified in the original forecast.
       3.2.1.2. Specification Criteria. TAFs will specify time of occurrence to the nearest hour
       (and/or minute as appropriate), the duration, and intensity of the amendment criteria
       along with any additional criteria in TAFs based on local customer requirements. The
       following is the specification criteria thresholds for PAFB TAFs.

Table 3.2. Specification Criteria Thresholds for PAFB TAFs.
Ceilings (Feet)                                 Visibility (Statute Miles)

       3.2.1.3. Dissemination. The primary longline and local dissemination system is via JET.
       The forecast is disseminated using TAF code and valid for a 24-hour period.
   3.2.2. Shuttle Landing Facility. The 45 WS issues TAFs for KSC's SLF (KTTS). KTTS
   TAFs are issued at 1100Z and 1900Z daily except during Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) when
   they are each issued one Zulu hour earlier. An example of a KTTS TAF is at Attachment 2.
       3.2.2.1. While the Space Shuttle is on orbit, the 45 WS issues TAFs every 8 hours and
       continuously monitors them.
       3.2.2.2. During Space Shuttle launch and landing operations, the 45 WS discontinues
       issuing TAFs approximately 8 hours prior to the scheduled operation. JSC Spaceflight
       Meteorology Group (SMG) produces and issues special forecast bulletins for KTTS
       during these time periods.
       3.2.2.3. Amendment Criteria. 45 WS (or JSC SMG) issues and amends the KTTS TAF
       when not representative of existing thresholds and conditions and when those conditions
       are expected to persist for 30 minutes or longer, and if conditions are not covered in a
       current change group which will become valid by the next cardinal hour. The forecast is
       issued and amended for the following items.
          3.2.2.3.1. The ceiling and/or visibility is, or is expected to be, out of category.
          Ceiling/visibility categories are determined by the lower value of the ceiling or
          visibility elements. Amendments are not required when either the ceiling or visibility
          improves to a higher category and the other remains in the lower category. The
          ceiling/visibility categories are:

           3.2.2.4.2. The beginning or ending of precipitation.
       3.2.2.5. Dissemination. The primary longline and local dissemination system is via JET.
       The forecast is disseminated using TAF code and is valid for a 24-hour period. It
       consists of valid times, winds, visibility, weather and obstructions to vision, sky
       conditions, minimum altimeter setting, and turbulence and icing forecasts.
3.3. Planning Forecasts.
   3.3.1. The 24-Hour Forecast. The 24-hour planning forecast gives 45 SW and Eastern
   Range customers an outlook for weather conditions that may impact their operations. The
   forecast covers CCAFS and KSC complexes and is issued/updated three times per day.
   Unlike the TAF, the 24-hour forecast is not formally amended. The 24-hour forecast is
45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012                                                                         23


   divided into three separate time periods and the forecast parameters are sky cover,
   precipitation probability, lightning probability, 54 foot prevailing wind, temperature range,
   remarks, and the time period’s severe weather potential (slight, moderate, or high). The 24-
   hour forecast will be posted at http://www.patrick.af.mil/weather/ by 0800L daily. An
   example of the 24-hour planning forecast is at Attachment 3.
   3.3.2. The 7-Day Forecast. The 45 WS issues a 7-day planning forecast to inform customers
   of potential weather concerns. The 7-day forecast is less detailed than a TAF and is general
   in nature. The following criteria will be included in the 7-day planning forecast, with each
   day broken into 12-hour segments (AM/PM): sky cover, weather, precipitation probability,
   lightning probability, 54 foot prevailing wind, maximum and minimum temperatures. This
   product is posted at http://www.patrick.af.mil/weather/ every morning NLT 0800L and is
   not amended. An example of the 7-day planning forecast is at Attachment 4.
   3.3.3. Mission Planning Forecast. The RWOC issues a Mission Planning Forecast (see drop
   zone map in Attachment 5) daily, valid 0800-2300L. This forecast is for planning purposes
   only. In addition, the forecast includes drop zone forecasts valid the same time period. This
   product is produced once per day and is not amended or METWATCHED. The mission
   planning forecast is posted at http://www.patrick.af.mil/weather/ every day at 0800L.
   Attachment 6 is an example of the Mission Planning Forecast.
3.4. Launch Forecast. The Range Weather Forecaster (RWF) and/or Launch Weather Officer
(LWO) provide daily forecasts, as required, in support of ground processing operations. In
addition, the LWO prepares pre-launch forecasts 3-4 days prior to a launch and a day-of-launch
forecast to include the forecast probability of violating Launch Commit Criteria (LCC).
Forecasts      are   disseminated     to    applicable      agencies     and      posted    at
http://www.patrick.af.mil/weather/ . Attachment 7 is an example of a day-of-launch forecast.
3.5. Aircrew Support. The RWOC provides the following services to aircraft departing PAFB,
the SLF, and the Skid Strip:
   3.5.1. Weather Briefings. The RWOC provides flight weather briefings for all parent/host
   unit flights departing PAFB, the SLF and the Skid Strip. The RWOC also provides and/or
   updates briefings for transient aircraft as time and resources allow. All strategic mobility
   missions will be directed to contact the 15th Operational Weather Squadron (15 OWS) at
   Scott AFB, IL. DD Form 175-1 (Attachment 8) and MEF (Attachment 9) are used to
   document flight briefings. Flight weather briefings are obtained by calling the duty
   forecaster (853-8484/8485) directly. For aircraft requiring DD Form 175-1 briefings at
   PAFB, instructions and materials are available at the weather desk in building 820, Base
   Operations, PAFB. Aircrews should notify the RWOC duty forecaster as soon as possible
   when support is required and provide take-off time(s), destination(s), estimated time(s) of
   arrival, flight level(s), and call sign(s) of aircraft. Verbal weather briefings are recorded on a
   locally generated form.
   3.5.2. Flight and Route Mission Watch (METWATCH). The RWOC forecaster performs a
   route and flight METWATCH for all flights departing PAFB, the SLF and the Skid Strip for
   which a flight weather briefing was given by duty forecasters. If weather conditions change
   from those briefed at departure to affect flight safety, the RWOC forecaster will make every
   attempt to contact the aircraft in flight by any means available (PMSV, 45 SW/CP, SOF,
   etc.).
 24                                                            45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012


   3.5.3. Pilot-to-Metro Service/Phone Patches. PMSV contact is available 24 hours a day on
   frequency 344.6 MHz. Phone patches can be routed to (321) 853-8484/8485. The RWOC
   forecaster solicits PIREPS from aircrews and transmits significant reports via JET to other
   using agencies.
3.6. Fit-To-Fight Weather. The RWOC provides weather information to assess conditions for
conducting fitness tests. Information is available by contacting the duty forecaster at 853-8485.
3.7. Tropical Storm/Hurricane Support. The RWOC receives hurricane and tropical storm
advisories from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) at approximately 0300Z, 0900Z, 1500Z,
and 2100Z. The 45 WS/CC or representative advises the 45 SW/CC, 45 SW Staff and NASA on
movement, intensity, weather conditions, and storm surge associated with tropical systems which
may affect PAFB, CCAFS, JDMTA, Malabar Annex, Antigua AS, Ascension Island, or
Argentia. Although the 45 WS recommends a HURCON level, the 45 SW/CC and NASA-KSC
Director, in coordination with each other, have the responsibility of declaring HURCON levels
for their specific area of responsibility.
   3.7.1. Hurricane Conditions (HURCON). HURCON levels are used to alert personnel to the
   proximity of the storm to ensure hurricane precautionary and preparatory measures are begun
   and executed in sufficient time. These categories focus on the forecast time-of-arrival of
   sustained 50 kt (58 mph) or greater winds associated with a tropical system. The HURCON
   levels are as follows:

Table 3.5. HURCON Levels.
Condition IV - Within 72 hours
Condition III - Within 48 hours
Condition II - Within 24 hours
Condition I - Within 12 hours
   3.7.2. The RWF will plot hurricane advisories received from the NHC and post them to the
   45 WS webpage. The NHC forecast intensity and track is the official forecast. The 45 WS
   will not deviate from this forecast except to apply local effects.
   3.7.3. The Space Shuttle LWO will produce a tailored hurricane forecast for NASA/KSC
   based on the Hurricane Center’s official forecast track and intensity.
   3.7.4. In the event that 45 WS cannot provide weather support due to evacuation, backup
   weather support will be provided by 26 OWS per Memorandum of Agreement 15-23.
3.8. Severe Weather Actions Procedures. The RWOC has established procedures ensuring
timely, accurate forecast services are provided to customers during severe weather situations.
Procedures are defined in 45 WS Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs).
3.9. Staff Meteorological Functions. The 45 WS provides the following staff functions.
   3.9.1. Climatological Services. 45 WS will provide or arrange for climatological data or
   studies as required.
45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012                                                                      25


   3.9.2. Staff Weather Briefings. 45 WS provides weather briefings to a number of customers,
   providing commanders, staff and operations and aircrew personnel with valuable weather
   information for planning and decision making. Wing staff, Battle Staff, flying safety,
   instrument refresher course, pre-deployment planning and seasonal briefings are provided
   upon request.
   3.9.3. Crisis Action Response/Aircraft or Missile Accident Investigation. 45 WS will
   provide meteorological support as necessary. In the case of a weather related accident or
   incident, 45 WS should be notified as soon as possible to allow timely archival of weather
   data.
3.10. Meteorological Consulting/Advising Services. Technical consultation includes advising
the 45 WS operational and support customers on all projects affected by weather from initial
project design, through testing, and operational execution. Topics range from simple
engineering studies such as adding a new control arm to a launch pad service tower, to
emergency parking of a Space Shuttle outside the Vehicle Assembly Building to make room for
repair of a hail damaged Space Shuttle, to designing the weather infrastructure at the Kodiak
Space Launch Complex in Alaska. Support is also provided to local science field studies. Some
of these field studies are done for non-weather research, while some are done specifically to help
weather support to the space program. Examples of the latter include the Airborne Field Mill
and Balloon-borne Field Mill projects to improve the Lightning LCC. Technical consultation is
also provided to 45 WS operations and staff actions, as required.
3.11. Research Support. The 45 WS System Division manages operational research programs
to improve weather support to the space program through highly focused research by
universities, national laboratories, and contractors. Operational research topics have included
nowcasting the start and end of lightning, climatology of Lightning Launch Commit Criteria,
convective wind forecasting, forecasting elevated point peak wind in winter and data integration
and visualization. External research agencies have included Florida State University the Air
Force Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University, National Environmental Satellite Data
Information Services, University of Hawaii, National Severe Storms Laboratory, Pennsylvania
State University, Air Force Academy and Colorado State University.

                        METEOROLOGICAL WATCH SUPPORT

4.1. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) Program. Certain weather conditions pose a
threat to life or create safety hazard for mission operations. Via the METWATCH program,
45 WS monitors for such weather conditions and advises base agencies when these dangerous
circumstances are observed or forecast to occur. Weather warnings, watches and advisories are
the vehicles through which supported agencies are notified of these critical weather situations.
The 45 WS provides METWATCH support to the 45 SW (PAFB, CCAFS, Port, Malabar),
NASA (KSC area) and Astrotech (Titusville, FL).
   4.1.1. Weather Warnings (WW). A Weather Warning is a special notice to support agencies
   giving them advanced notification (with sufficient time for protective actions) of weather
   conditions of sufficient intensity to pose a hazard to life or property. WWs are issued for a
   designated geographic area such as CCAFS or an area within 5 NM from a designated
   location such as PAFB. WWs are issued for all 45 SW locations stated in paragraph 4.1.
   WW numbers are location specific (KSC, CCAFS or PAFB). The format includes the WW
   number that consists of a two-digit numeric month designator (MM) separated by a dash,
   then the letter A, followed by the sequence number that begins at 001 (#MM-AXX).
   Example: KSC number 12-A32 is the 32nd WW issued for KSC in December.
       4.1.1.1. Lightning Warnings (Phase II Lightning Warning). A Phase II Lightning
       Warning is issued when lightning occurs or is imminent within 5 NM of a designated
       location. Customers can then take the necessary precautions to protect personnel and
       resources.
   4.1.2. Weather Watches. Watches are special notices to supported agencies concerning
   atmospheric conditions that may signal a future potential for weather conditions of intensity
   to pose a hazard to life or property. It can be used as a ―heads up‖ for agencies to consider
   making plans to take required protective actions should an actual WW be issued. If weather
   conditions do favor severe weather or if severe weather is imminent, a WW will be issued.
   Weather Watches are issued for PAFB, CCAFS and KSC. The Weather Watch number
   consists of the two-digit numeric month designator (MM) separated by a dash, then the letter
   A, followed by the sequence number for the month that begins at 01 (#MM-AXX).
   Example: PAFB number 1-A01 is the 1st watch issued for PAFB in January.
       4.1.2.1. Lightning Watch (Phase I Lightning Watch). A Phase I Lightning Watch is
       issued when lightning within 5 NM is expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.
       Phase I Lightning Watches are issued for PAFB, CCAFS, Astrotech and KSC and alert
       all agencies to take preliminary actions to protect personnel and resource.
   4.1.3. Weather Advisories. The 45 WS issues two types of weather advisories: Observed
   Weather Advisories and Forecast Weather Advisories. These advisories are issued for
   PAFB, CCAFS and KSC. The actual number consists of the two-digit numeric month
   designator (MM) separated by a dash, then the letter A, followed by the sequence number for
   the month that begins at 01 (#MM-AXX). Example: CCAFS number 3-A10 is the 10th
   advisory issued for CCAFS in March .
45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012                                                                      27


      4.1.3.1. Observed Weather Advisory (OWA). An OWA is a special notice that non-
      severe weather conditions, which could affect operations, are occurring within a
      designated geographic area or within a set nautical miles distance of a designated
      location. An OWA is issued on the first occurrence of the designated criteria and
      canceled when the event is no longer occurring. An OWA is used when agencies do not
      require advanced notification prior to the onset of the weather conditions.
      4.1.3.2. Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA). A FWA is a special notice to supported
      agencies giving them advanced notice (with sufficient time for protective actions) of
      mission-limiting, non-severe weather conditions expected to directly affect a designated
      geographic location or an area within a set nautical mile distance of a designated location.
4.2. Patrick AFB METWATCH Products. Warnings, watches and advisories are issued for a
5 NM radius from the center of the runway at PAFB. Attachment 10 graphically displays this
area. Products are disseminated via JET to the PAFB command post. Weather warning, watch
and advisory criteria and appropriate desired lead times are in Table 4.1. PAFB METWATCH
products are issued in the format outlined in Attachment 11.
   4.2.1. For a tornado or funnel cloud affecting PAFB resources including South Housing, the
   duty forecaster contacts 45 SW Command Post via hotline and 45 SW Command Post
   personnel activate the base siren warning system. The forecaster will issue the tornado or
   funnel cloud warning on JET after the telephone notification.

                              LAUNCH WEATHER SUPPORT

6.1. General. 45 WS provides comprehensive launch support to the DoD, NASA, and
commercial launch vehicles based at CCAFS and KSC 24/7 from the Range Weather operations
Center (RWOC) in the Morrell Operations Center (MOC). The specific support requirements are
coordinated via the UDS process and documented in the appropriate Operations Directive (OD).
The major programs supported are Atlas, Delta, Falcon, Pegasus, Space Shuttle, and Trident.
Each system has a lead Launch Weather Officer (LWO) to act as a POC to coordinate weather
support for the program. Each system also has specific constraints such as space environment,
wind, precipitation, temperature, etc. In addition, the Eastern Range has constraints known as
the Range Safety Natural and Triggered Lightning Flight Commit Criteria (attachment 17),
which are applicable to every vehicle launching from the Range. See the appropriate UDS
Operations Directive and Range Safety Operations Requirements for details concerning these
requirements. The following is a brief description of each program.
6.2. Atlas V. The Atlas V family of launch vehicles uses a Common Core Booster and a
Centaur upper stage. The vehicle configurations provide a number of flexible mission
trajectories for DoD, NASA, and commercial payloads. Multiple trajectory designs are available
to place payloads into orbit as well as interplanetary trajectories. Atlas V launches from
Complex 41. Specific aerospace weather concerns and constraints are located in appropriate
sections of the UDS, Series 5100.
6.3. Delta II. The Delta II is a small to medium expendable launch vehicles are used to lift
commercial, civil and DoD payloads into orbit. This vehicle was the primary booster responsible
for lifting Air Force Global Positioning System (GPS) block IIR satellites into orbit.
Commercial/civil missions range from scientific research to telecommunications satellites. Delta
launches occur from Complex 17A/17B on CCAFS. Specific aerospace weather concerns and
constraints for the Delta are located in appropriate sections of the UDS, Series 5300, 5400, and
5500.
   6.3.1. Delta IV. The Delta IV is an expendable medium to heavy lift vehicle for both DoD,
   civil and commercial payloads. It launches from Complex 37. Delta IV’s specific weather
   aerospace concerns and constraints are located in appropriate sections of the UDS, Series
   5000.
6.4. Falcon 9. The Falcon 9 is a LOX and RP-1 two stage, medium to heavy lift, partially re-
usable vehicle designed for commercial geo-synchronous transfer orbit as well as civil
international space station re-supply. Specific weather aerospace concerns and constraints for all
aspects of the operation are located in the appropriate sections of the UDS, Series 6000.
6.5. Pegasus launch vehicle is launched from a modified L-1011 aircraft. Pegasus launch
operations are rare and require some specialized weather support prior to and during the day-of-
launch. Although Pegasus launch support is unique, weather support is less demanding than a
standard unmanned launch of a larger vehicle from CCAFS.
45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012                                                                      49


6.6. Space Shuttle. The space shuttle is a recoverable manned launch vehicle that launches
from Complex 39A. The RWOC provides weather support from pre-launch operations through
post-landing operations.         Shuttle weather sensitive operations include Rollover,
Rollout/Rollback, Segment Moves, Launch, Landing, Ferry Flight, Solid rocket booster recovery
operations, Post-landing roll from the SLF to the Orbiter Processing Facility, Payload operations,
Terminal Countdown Demonstration Tests and External Tank ocean barge operations. While the
RWOC is responsible for weather support for pre-launch activities through launch, from liftoff
through landing, the NWS Spaceflight Meteorology Group (SMG) at Johnson Space Center in
Houston is the responsible agency for weather support. Specific weather aerospace concerns and
constraints for all aspects of the operation are located in the appropriate sections of the UDS,
Series 20000.
6.7. Trident II. The Trident II missile is a three-stage solid propellant ballistic missile with a
post-boost vehicle for the independent deployment of multiple re-entry bodies. Launched from
submarines in the Atlantic, their specific launch location is generally classified. Missile
processing is sometimes done in the port area prior to the mission. Specific aerospace weather
concerns and constraints are located in appropriate sections of the UDS, Series 900.
6.8. New Launch Systems. Weather support will be identified for all new systems. The
specific weather constraints for each new system will be outlined in the appropriate UDS
documents.
6.9. Range Safety Natural and Triggered Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LCC). The
Lightning Flight Commit Criteria are a set of rules developed by the Lightning Advisory Panel
consisting of leading scientists in atmospheric electricity. These rules were accepted by Range
Safety to ensure the avoidance of natural and/or triggered lightning during space/ballistic launch
operations. See attachment 17.
6.10. Execution. On launch day personnel in the RWOC use all meteorological sensing
equipment located on or near CCAFS and KSC, to include weather reconnaissance aircraft, to
assess the current and forecast atmospheric conditions to assure safe access to space. The
Launch Weather Team (LWT) must have clear and convincing evidence that hazard avoidance
criteria are not violated. To ensure these goals are met, a LWT is convened consisting of:
   6.10.1. Launch Weather Commander (LWC). This position is normally filled by the 45 WS
   Commander or Operations Officer. The LWC provides oversight to the LWT during a
   launch countdown and high-level technical support and advice to the Launch Decision
   Authority (LDA). The LWC also approves weather commit criteria changes from RED to
   GREEN.
   6.10.2. Launch Weather Director (LWD). This position is normally filled by the Range
   Weather Operations Flight Commander or Stan-Eval and Training Flight Commander, but
   may be filled by any certified LWO. The LWD supervises LWT members and orchestrates
   the operation of the LWT during the launch countdown. The LWD maintains Range
   Weather Operations Center (RWOC) access control and leads all LWT meetings and the
   post-mission ―Hot Wash‖. The LWD also approves weather commit criteria changes from
   RED to GREEN when the LWC is not present in the RWOC and initiate and complete all
   required emergency checklists.

  6.10.3. Launch Weather Officer (LWO). The lead LWO will serve as the single weather
  point of contact between the LWT, the range launch team, and the range user. The LWO
  develops and maintains a launch checklist for their vehicle(s) and prepares the Launch
  Weather Team tasking letter not later than one week prior to launch. The LWO is also
  responsible for performing system checks on weather and communications equipment and
  CCTV. Most importantly, the LWO forecasts, monitors, evaluates, and reports weather
  commit criteria RED/GREEN status, and has ―hold call‖ responsibility after the final clear to
  launch authority has been given.
  6.10.4. Deputy Launch Weather Officer (DLWO) for Radar. The DLWO-Radar is
  responsible for evaluating weather LCC using weather radar and lightning detection
  equipment. The DLWO-Radar makes extensive use of vertical launch profiles to ensure
  proper, three-dimensional stand-off requirements are met per the weather LCC. Any
  certified LWO may serve as the DLWO-Radar.
  6.10.5. DLWO for Reconnaissance (Recce). The DLWO-Recce is responsible for
  communicating with and directing the weather reconnaissance aircraft to focus on those
  weather commit criteria and/or observations that are best evaluated in situ. The DLWO-
  Recce also must convert aircraft pressure-determined altitudes to real-world altitudes based
  on GPS sounding data and the WMO standard atmosphere. The DLWO-Recce also
  coordinates possible rapid scan satellite scheduling with NOAA SSD. Any certified LWO
  may serve as the DLWO-Recce.
  6.10.6. Range Weather Forecaster (RWF). The RWF is responsible for providing synoptic
  discussions, observations, METWATCH, advisories/watches/warnings, and aircrew
  briefings.
  6.10.7. Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) Coordinator (Shuttle only).            The TAL
  Coordinator orchestrates search and rescue weather support for the three TAL sites and the
  21 OWS in Europe as well as local search and rescue planning/preparation conducted by
  NORTHCOM Joint Task Force.
  6.10.8. Toxic dispersion forecaster. The Toxics forecaster actively modifies weather
  rawinsonde data to accurately forecast conditions expected at T-0. The forecaster provides
  this information to the 45 SW/SE Risk Assessment Center (RAC) for inclusion into the toxic
  dispersion model.

Anvil cloud—means a stratiform or fibrous "cloud" produced by the upper outflow or blow-off
from "thunderstorms" or convective "clouds" having tops at altitudes where the temperature is
colder than or equal to -10 degrees Celsius.
Associated—means that two or more "clouds" are causally related to the same "disturbed
weather" system or are physically connected. "Clouds" occurring at the same time are not
necessarily "associated." A cumulus "cloud" formed locally and a cirrus layer that is physically
separated from that cumulus "cloud" and that is generated by a distant source are not
"associated," even if they occur over or near the launch point at the same time.
Average cloud thickness—is the altitude difference (in kilometers, km hereafter) between the
average top and the average base of all clouds in the "specified volume." The cloud base to be
averaged is the higher of (1) the 0 degree Celsius level and (2) the lowest extent (in altitude) of
all "radar reflectivity" measurements of 0 dBZ or greater. Similarly, the cloud top to be
averaged is the highest extent (in altitude) of all "radar reflectivity" measurements of 0 dBZ or
greater. Given the grid-point representation of a typical radar processor, allowance must be
made for the vertical separation of grid points in computing "average cloud thickness": The
cloud base at any horizontal position shall be taken as the altitude of the corresponding base grid
point minus half of the grid-point vertical separation. Similarly, the cloud top at that horizontal
position shall be taken as the altitude of the corresponding top grid point plus half of this vertical
45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012                                                                       61


separation. Thus, a cloud represented by only a single grid point having a "radar reflectivity"
equal to or greater than 0 dBZ in the "specified volume" would have an "average cloud
thickness" equal to the vertical grid-point separation in its vicinity.
Bright band—means an enhancement of "radar reflectivity" caused by frozen hydrometeors
falling and beginning to melt at any altitude where the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius or
warmer.
Cloud—means a visible mass of suspended water droplets or ice crystals. The "cloud" is
considered to be the entire volume enclosed by the visible, "nontransparent cloud" boundary as
seen by an observer, or, in the absence of a visual observation, by the 0 dBZ "radar reflectivity"
boundary. A visual evaluation of transparency is preferred whenever possible. Distance from
the "cloud" to a point in question refers to the separation between the point and the nearest part
of that "cloud." Specifically, the wording, "less than or equal to 10 nautical miles from any
cumulus 'cloud'" means that the "flight path" must not penetrate either the interior of the "cloud"
itself or the volume between 0 and 10 nautical miles, inclusive, outside the "cloud" boundary [for
example, see E. G417.9(a), Cumulus "Clouds"]. On the other hand, "between 0 and 3 nautical
miles, inclusive, from" refers only to the volume at a distance that is greater than or equal to 0,
but less than or equal to 3, nautical miles outside the "cloud" boundary, specifically omitting the
interior of the "cloud" itself [for example, see H. G417.15(a), "Debris Clouds"].
Cloud layer—means a vertically continuous array of "clouds," not necessarily of the same type,
whose bases are approximately at the same level.
Cloud top—means the visible top of the cloud, or, in the absence of a visual observation, the 0
dBZ radar top. A visual evaluation of "cloud top" is preferred whenever possible.
Cone of silence—means the volume in an inverted circular cone centered on the radar that is
generated by all elevation angles greater than the maximum elevation angle used in the radar
scan strategy. For the purpose of "VAHIRR" calculation this volume is capped by the observed
maximum "cloud top" height, the observed tropopause height, or an altitude of 20 km (66 kft),
whichever is lowest.
Cumulonimbus cloud—means any convective "cloud" with any part at an altitude where the
temperature is colder than –20 degrees Celsius.
Debris cloud—means any "cloud," except an "anvil cloud," that has become detached from a
parent "cumulonimbus cloud" or "thunderstorm," or that result from the decay of a parent
"cumulonimbus cloud" or "thunderstorm."
Disturbed weather—means a weather system where dynamical processes destabilize the air on
a scale larger than individual "clouds" or cells. Examples of "disturbed weather" include fronts,
troughs, and squall lines.
 62                                                              45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012


Electric field measurement—means the 1-minute arithmetic average of the vertical electric
field (Ez) at the surface of Earth, measured by a ground-based "field mill." The polarity of the
electric field is the same as that of the potential gradient; that is, the polarity of the field at
Earth's surface is the same as the dominant charge overhead. Do not use interpolated electric
field contours for purposes of this appendix. An "'electric field measurement' less than or equal
to 5 nautical miles from the 'flight path'" [e.g., C. G417.5(a) Surface Electric Fields] is not
applicable if the altitude of the flight path everywhere above the 5 nautical mile circle around the
"field mill" in question is greater than 20 km (66 kft).
Field mill—is a specific class of electric-field sensor that uses a moving, grounded conductor to
induce a time-varying electric charge on one or more sensing elements in proportion to the
ambient electrostatic field. Note: For the purpose of this publication, distance from an electric
"field mill" is measured differently than distance from any other object or measurement point:
Distance between a "radar reflectivity" or ―Volume Averaged Height Integrated Radar
Reflectivity‖ ("VAHIRR") measurement point and any object or the "flight path" is the shortest
separation (horizontal, vertical, or slant range) between that point and the nearest part of the
object or "flight path." Similarly, distance between the "flight path" and any object is the
shortest separation between any point on the "flight path" the nearest part of that object. For
example, "every point less than or equal to 1 nautical mile from the 'flight path'" [see F.
G417.11(c)(2) Attached "Anvil Clouds"] means that the "VAHIRR" threshold must be satisfied
at every point throughout the entire volume defined by a 1 nautical mile radius from every point
on the "flight path." (See also the additional explanation beneath the definition of "cloud.") In
contrast, distance between a "field mill" or an "electric field measurement" and any object or the
"flight path" is always measured horizontally between that mill or measurement point and the
nearest part of the vertical projection of the object or "flight path" onto the surface of Earth. For
example, "from the center of the 'cloud top' to at least one working 'field mill'" [see E.
G417.9(d)(2) Cumulus "Clouds"] means that the horizontal distance between the "field mill"
and a point on the surface directly beneath the center of the "cloud top" must be less than 2
nautical miles. The following bold-face terms are defined here and appear in quotes wherever
they are used in accordance with these definitions elsewhere in this appendix.
Flight path—means the planned nominal flight trajectory, including its vertical and horizontal
uncertainties specified by the three-sigma guidance and performance deviations.
Moderate precipitation—means a "precipitation" rate of 0.1 inches/hr or a "radar reflectivity"
factor of 30 dBZ.
Nontransparent—"Cloud" cover is "nontransparent" if one or more of the following conditions
is present: (a) Objects above, including higher "clouds," blue sky, and stars, are blurred,
indistinct, or obscured as viewed from below; or objects below, including terrain, buildings, and
lights on the ground, are blurred, indistinct, or obscured as viewed from above; when looking
through the "cloud" cover at visible wavelengths (the sun and moon may not be used to evaluate
transparency); (b) Such objects are seen distinctly only through breaks in the "cloud" cover; or;
(c) The "cloud" cover has a "radar reflectivity" factor of 0 dBZ or greater.
Precipitation—means detectable rain, snow, hail, graupel, or sleet at the ground; virga; or a
"radar reflectivity" factor greater than 18 dBZ at any altitude above the ground.
45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012                                                                         63


Radar reflectivity—means the radar return from hydrometeors, in dBZ, measured by a
meteorological radar operating at a wavelength greater than or equal to 5 cm. A "radar
reflectivity" measurement is valid only in the absence of significant attenuation by intervening
"precipitation" or by water or ice on the radome.
Specified volume—The volume bounded in the horizontal by vertical planes with perpendicular
sides located 5.5 km (3 nautical miles) north, east, south, and west of the point at which
"VAHIRR" is being computed. The volume is bounded on the bottom at the altitude where the
temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, and on the top by a fixed altitude of 20 km (66 kft).
Thick cloud layer—means one or more "cloud layers" whose combined vertical extent from the
base of the bottom layer to the "cloud top" of the uppermost layer exceeds a thickness of 4,500
feet. "Cloud layers" are combined with neighboring layers for determining total thickness only
when they are physically connected by vertically continuous "clouds," as, for example, when
towering "clouds" in one layer contact or merge with "clouds" in a layer (or layers) above.
Thunderstorm—means any convective "cloud" that produces lightning.
Transparent—Any "cloud" that is not "nontransparent" is "transparent."
Treated—means that a launch vehicle satisfies both of the following conditions: (a) All
surfaces of the launch vehicle susceptible to ice particle impact are such that the surface
resistivity is less than 109 "Ohms per square;" and; (b) All conductors on surfaces (including
dielectric surfaces that have been coated with conductive materials) are bonded to the launch
vehicle by a resistance that is less than 105 ohms.
Triboelectrification—means the transfer of electrical charge between ice particles and the
launch vehicle when the ice particles collide with the vehicle during flight.
Volume-Averaged, Height-Integrated Radar Reflectivity (VAHIRR)—is the product of the
"volume-averaged radar reflectivity" and the "average cloud thickness" in a "specified volume"
surrounding any point at which "VAHIRR" is being computed (units of dBZ-km). The
"specified volume" must not contain any portion of the "cone of silence" above the radar, nor any
portion of any sectors that may have been blocked out for payload-safety reasons.
VAHIRR application criteria—The individual grid-point reflectivity measurements used to
determine either the "volume-averaged radar reflectivity" or the "average cloud thickness" must
be meteorological "radar reflectivity" measurements. For "VAHIRR"-evaluation points along
the "flight path" itself (not those at a prescribed distance away from the "flight path"), the
"volume-averaged, height-integrated radar reflectivity" is not applicable at any point that is less
than or equal to 10 nautical miles from any "radar reflectivity" of 35 dBZ or greater at altitudes
of 4 km (13 kft) or greater above mean sea level, nor is it applicable at any point that is less than
or equal to 10 nautical miles from any type of lightning that has occurred in the previous 5
minutes.
 64                                                             45SWI15-101 26 MARCH 2012


Volume-averaged radar reflectivity—is the arithmetic average (in dBZ) of the "radar
reflectivity" in the "specified volume." Normally, a radar processor will report reflectivity
values interpolated onto a regular, three-dimensional array of grid points. Any such grid point in
the "specified volume" is included in the average if and only if it has a "radar reflectivity" equal
to or greater than 0 dBZ. If fewer than 10% of the grid points in the "specified volume" have
"radar reflectivity" measurements equal to or greater than 0 dBZ, then the "volume-averaged
radar reflectivity" is either the maximum "radar reflectivity" (in dBZ) in the "specified volume,"
or 0 dBZ, whichever is greater.

                      LIGHTNING LAUNCH COMMIT CRITERIA

The Launch Weather Team must have clear and convincing evidence that the following hazard
avoidance criteria are not violated.
Even when these criteria are not violated, if any other hazardous condition exists, the Launch
Weather Team will report the threat to the Launch Director. The Launch Director may HOLD at
any time based on the instability of the weather.
1. Surface Electric Fields.
  (a) A launch operator must not initiate flight for 15 minutes after the absolute value of any
  "electric field measurement" less than or equal to 5 nautical miles from the "flight path" has
  been greater than or equal to 1500 volts/meter.
  (b) A launch operator must not initiate flight for 15 minutes after the absolute value of any
  "electric field measurement" less than or equal to 5 nautical miles from the "flight path" has
  been greater than or equal to 1000 volts/meter unless either Section (1) or Section (2) is
  satisfied:
    (1) All clouds less than or equal to 10 nautical miles from the "flight path" are
    "transparent;" or;
    (2) All "clouds" less than or equal to 10 nautical miles from the "flight path" have "cloud
    tops" at altitudes where the temperature is warmer than +5 degrees Celsius and have not
    been part of convective "clouds" with "cloud tops" at altitudes where the temperature is
    colder than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius during the last 3 hours.
2. Lightning.
  (a) A launch operator must not initiate flight for 30 minutes after any type of lightning occurs
  in a "thunderstorm" if the "flight path" will carry the launch vehicle less than or equal to 10
  nautical miles from that "thunderstorm." An attached "anvil cloud" is not considered part of
  its parent "thunderstorm," but is covered instead by paragraph 4, Attached "Anvil Clouds."
  (b) A launch operator must not initiate flight for 30 minutes after any type of lightning occurs
  less than or equal to 10 nautical miles from the "flight path" unless all three of the following
  conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The "cloud" that produced the lightning is greater than 10 nautical miles from the "flight
    path;"
    (2) There is at least one working "field mill" less than 5 nautical miles from each such
    lightning discharge; and;
    (3) The absolute values of all "electric field measurements" less than or equal to 5 nautical
    miles from the "flight path," and at each "field mill" specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this
    section, have been less than 1000 volts/meter for 15 minutes or longer.

volts/meter, but less than +500 volts/meter, for 15 minutes or longer.
4. Attached “Anvil Clouds”.
For the purposes of this section, if there has never been lightning in or from the parent "cloud" or
"anvil cloud," sub-sections (a) and (b) shall be considered satisfied, but sub-section (c) shall still
apply.
   (a) A launch operator must not initiate flight if the "flight path" will carry the launch vehicle
   less than or equal to 10, but greater than 5, nautical miles from any attached "anvil cloud" for
