                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Approval and Waiver Authorities. The approval authority for changes or revisions to this
instruction is AF/A3/5. The MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for this instruction unless
specified elsewhere. Submit waiver requests in memorandum format.
1.2. Conducting Evaluations. Conduct all evaluations according to the provisions of AFI 11-
202, Volume 2, and this instruction. (T-2)
1.3. Evaluation Criteria Source. Attachment 2 provides TH-1H crewmember evaluation
criteria for instrument, qualification, mission (MSN), and instructor evaluations.
1.4. Evaluation Conduct:
     1.4.1. Flight examiners will use the evaluation criteria contained in this volume to conduct
     all flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPE). (T-1). To ensure standard and
     objective evaluations, flight examiners must be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
     evaluation criteria.
     1.4.2. Unless specified, the examinee or flight examiner may fly in any seat (within their
     crew qualification) that best enables the flight examiner to conduct a thorough evaluation.
     1.4.3. Prior to flight, the flight examiner will brief the examinee on the purpose of the
     evaluation and how it will be conducted and, if applicable, inform the aircraft commander of
     special requirements. The examinee will accomplish appropriate flight planning and mission
     preparation and furnish the flight examiner with copies of mission materials to include
     necessary maps (only one map per aircraft is required), flight logs, etc. (T-2).
     1.4.4. Units will use AF Form 4104, TH-1H Flight Evaluation Worksheet, when
     administering flight evaluations and EPEs. (T-2)
     1.4.5. When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in flight (due to equipment
     malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather), the flight
     examiner may elect to evaluate the areas by an alternate method (verbal, procedural trainer).
     In the ‘additional comments’ section of the Form 8 under ‘Examiner Remarks,’ document
     why required areas were not evaluated in flight and the alternate method of evaluation used.
     If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, a required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an
     alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight. (AF Form 8 is prescribed in
     AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
     1.4.6. For initial evaluations, all required items must be performed by actual demonstration.
     Additionally, to evaluate a specific mission area, all subareas on AF Form 4104 must be
     evaluated unless designated as optional. (T-2).
     1.4.7. All simulated emergency procedure maneuvers will be accomplished according to the
     guidance in TO 1H-1(T)H-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series TH-1H Helicopter; AFI 11-2TH-
     1H, Volume 3, TH-1H Helicopter Operations Procedures; and AFTTP 3-3.H-1, Combat
     Aircraft Fundamentals, H-1. (T-2)
AFI11-2TH-1HV2 10 JANUARY 2014                                                                 5


   1.4.8. The flight examiner will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. During the
   debrief, the flight examiner will review the overall rating, specific deviations, area grades
   assigned, and required additional training (if applicable). (T-2).
   1.4.9. Instrument evaluations may be completely administered in the Weapon Systems
   Trainer (WST). No evaluation profiles will be initiated in the WST, evaluations incomplete
   in the aircraft may be completed in the WST with 23 FTS/CC approval. Sound, visuals, and
   secondary motion are required for all evaluation profiles. Primary motion is not required, but
   highly recommended. NOTE: Secondary motion systems provide additional cues including
   rotor vibrations, translational lift vibrations, and aircraft harmonics.
       1.4.9.1. The following maneuver items will not be evaluated in the WST under any
       conditions: precision hover, taxiing, slope operations, autorotations to a touchdown, and
       EMER GOV OPNS in a hover. Evaluators always have discretion to consider the impact
       of device fidelity upon examinee performance. If the evaluator considers the examinees
       performance to be detrimentally affected by the device fidelity, the evaluator must cease
       evaluation in the simulator (maneuvers already accomplished will be graded; ungraded
       maneuvers will be accomplished IAW paragraph 1.4.5).
       1.4.9.2. Formation items may be evaluated using lead-ship record function or
       networking.
       1.4.9.3. Evaluators must be Instructor Operating System (IOS) certified to conduct a
       checkride in the simulator and may conduct checkrides from any IOS station in the WST.
1.5. Spot Evaluations of Other Aircrew Specialties. Any operations group Stan/Eval or
higher headquarters flight examiner, regardless of aircrew specialty, may administer aircrew spot
evaluations. However, if the examiner is administering a spot evaluation to a person in another
aircrew specialty, the examiner may only evaluate boldface, safety, judgment, situational
awareness, and ability to instruct (if applicable).
1.6. Aircrew Publications. Examiners will check aircrew publications during all qualification
evaluations to ensure they are current and properly posted. (T-2). Each aircrew member is
responsible for maintaining the publications in Table 1.1. Electronic publications will be
maintained IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program, AETC Supplement. The
operations group commander may direct additional publications be maintained or required in
flight.

 Notes:
 1-One copy required per aircraft
1.7. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). CRM is the effective use of all available
resources by individuals or crews to safely and efficiently accomplish an assigned mission or
task. The term CRM refers to the training program, objectives, and key skills directed to this end.
CRM will be evaluated on all flight evaluations. See AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource
Management Program, for guidance.
1.8. Evaluation Grading Instructions. Areas not applicable to the unit or mission should not
be performed; however, all areas performed will be graded. (T-2).
     1.8.1. Deviations. Flight examiners will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on
     conditions of smooth air and a stable aircraft. Do not consider a momentary deviation from
     tolerances provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action, and such deviations do
     not jeopardize flying safety. The flight examiner may consider cumulative deviations when
     determining the overall grade. (T-2).
     1.8.2. Standards and Grading Guide. The standards and grading criteria contained in
     Attachment 2 are provided as a guide to assist the flight examiner in determining grades.
     These criteria are not necessarily provided as minimum or maximum parameters for each
     maneuver. Examiners should compare examinee performance for each grading area with the
     standards provided in this instruction and consider all other factors before assigning grades.
     The flight examiner derives the overall flight evaluation grade according to AFI 11-202,
     Volume 2, and this volume, and must:
        1.8.2.1. Exercise judgment when wording of grading criteria is subjective and when
        specific situations are not covered. (T-2).
        1.8.2.2. Use his or her judgment as the determining factor in assigning the overall grade.
        (T-2).
     1.8.3. Critical Areas and Subareas. Critical areas and subareas are defined as those that
     can be graded only “Q” or “U” (e.g. BOLDFACE). Any unsatisfactory performance in a
     critical area or subarea will result in a qualification level of "Q-3". Critical areas and
     subareas are identified in Attachment 2 with an asterisk (*). (T-2).
     1.8.4. Noncritical Areas and Subareas. Noncritical areas and subareas are graded either
     “Q”, “Q-”, or “U”. Unsatisfactory performance in a noncritical area or subarea will result in
     a qualification level of no higher than “Q-2”. (T-2).
     1.8.5. Area and Subarea Grades. The desired level of performance, “Q”, is listed in
     Attachment 2 for each area or subarea. Refer to the definitions for “Q”, “Q-”, and “U” in
     AFI 11-202, Volume 2.
1.9. Aircrew Examination Procedures:
     1.9.1. Computer-based training or electronic information management tools may satisfy the
     requirement for written examinations if the electronic format meets the requirements for
     examinations in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Units may generate a unique test for each
     crewmember using appropriate computer software programs.

  1.9.2. The number of test questions will be determined using AFI 11-202, Volume 2, as
  supplemented by the MAJCOM. (T-2). The following is the minimum number of questions
  to be used; this number may be raised by MAJCOM supplement:
     1.9.2.1. Qualification Open. Fifty questions.
     1.9.2.2. Qualification Closed. Twenty-five questions.
     1.9.2.3. Instrument Open. Fifty questions.
     1.9.2.4. Mission Open. Fifty questions.

                                            Chapter 2

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Evaluation Requisites:
     2.1.1. Refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, for qualification and instrument evaluation requisites.
     2.1.2. MSN evaluation requisites consist of an MSN open-book examination and EPE
     (evaluate MSN-specific emergency procedures and systems knowledge during MSN
     evaluations). Note: A MSN open-book examination is not required for an MSN evaluation
     that adds a qualification for a crewmember. However, if the MSN open-book examination is
     not completed, the evaluation will not update the 17-month cycle.
2.2. EPEs:
     2.2.1. EPEs will not be conducted in flight (aircraft or WST). The purpose of the EPE is to
     evaluate systems knowledge and emergency procedures on the ground, allowing a more in-
     depth investigation of systems knowledge and scenario-driven circumstances. (T-2).
     2.2.2. The EPE is a verbal evaluation and should be scenario driven with an emphasis on
     emergency procedures and systems knowledge. Flight examiners may use one continuous
     scenario throughout the EPE or different scenarios for each emergency procedure. (T-2).
     2.2.3. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in flight. The examinee
     must recall applicable boldface items from memory. (T-2).
     2.2.4. The flight examiner may present situational emergency procedures in flight (use of the
     WST is encouraged); however, they will NOT be graded as an EPE. Instead, situational
     emergency procedures presented in flight will be graded under the Knowledge of
     Publications, Systems, and Limits section of AF Form 4104. The WST offers an excellent
     platform to evaluate situational emergency procedures; however, Flight Evaluation Criteria
     are the same for the WST as they are for the aircraft.
     2.2.5. Boldface procedures may be associated with situational EPEs. If not, knowledge of
     boldface procedures will be demonstrated to the flight examiner either verbally or in writing.
     All boldface emergencies must be covered for qualification evaluations. (T-2).
     2.2.6. The flight examiner will assign an overall grade to the EPE (1, 2, or 3) in the
     qualification ground phase of the AF Form 8. (T-2).
2.3. Qualification Evaluations. Complete all required subareas on AF Form 4104 under Areas
I and II for the crewmember’s aircrew specialty. If the crewmember is an instructor, complete
Area IV. Subareas labeled optional do not have to be accomplished in flight but as a minimum
will be evaluated verbally. (T-2).
2.4. Instrument Evaluations. Complete all required subareas on AF Form 4104 from Areas I
and III. If the crewmember is an instructor, complete Area IV. Subareas labeled optional not
accomplished in flight will be evaluated verbally. (T-2).
2.5. Mission (MSN) Evaluations. Complete all required areas and subareas for initial mission
(INIT MSN) and requalification mission (RQ MSN) evaluations. Aircrew must be trained and
initially evaluated on remotes, low-level, and formation night vision goggles (NVG) to be night-
AFI11-2TH-1HV2 10 JANUARY 2014                                                                   9


mission qualified. All night-mission maneuvers will be accomplished using NVGs for initial and
requalification evaluations. (T-2). Note: In certain cases, civilian contract instructors may be
qualified in some, but not all, MSN events. In this case, the INIT MSN evaluation will only
include those areas in which the instructor received training, and the AF Form 8 will clearly state
in which areas the instructor has been evaluated and is qualified to instruct. For recurrent MSN
evaluations, complete all of Area I, AF Form 4104, and a representative sample of mission
subareas from Area V. If the crewmember is an instructor, complete Area IV. Evaluators are
encouraged to give the crewmember a scenario representative of a unit mission. Not every unit
mission needs to be evaluated in flight, and unit missions can be conducted day or night for
recurrent MSN evaluations. An attempt should be made to alternate day and night mission
profiles on periodic MSN evaluations.
2.6. Certifications. Certifications do not require evaluations. Document certifications on an AF
Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, with the squadron commander's signature. AF Form
4348 is prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling
out the forms.
2.7. Instructor Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in the TH-1H, the
crewmember must successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation. The evaluation must
include a representative sampling from Areas I, II, III, IV, and V of the AF Form 4104.
Exception: If the crewmember transferred current MSN qualifications from another H-1 series
aircraft, the evaluation must include all required subareas from Areas I, II, and IV but only the
portions of Area V where a current MSN qualification did not already exist. Note: Evaluator
status is a certification versus a qualification. Certified evaluators will be given recurring
evaluations acting in the instructor crew position. (T-2).
   2.7.1. Evaluate Area IV during all periodic evaluations for instructors. (T-2).
   2.7.2. Thoroughly evaluate the examinee’s instructor knowledge and ability as outlined in
   Attachment 2.

                                   EVALUATION CRITERIA

3.1. Ground Phase Requisites (P/FE). Ground phase requisites requirements vary depending
upon the specific evaluation administered according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and may include
a combination of applicable examinations, boldface, and an EPE. Grading criteria for ground
phase requisites are conducted according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, or as defined in this
attachment.
3.2. EPE. (P/FE) EPEs are graded by qualification levels as follows:
3.2.1. (1) Given a simulated emergency, correctly analyzed the situation and provided the
appropriate action. (Boldface, if required, was provided promptly with correct response in the
correct sequence.) Used the checklist or flight manual, as required. Demonstrated a thorough
understanding of aircraft systems, limitations, and performance characteristics.
3.2.2. (2) Made minor deviations from (1) criteria. Did not compromise safety, aircraft
limitations, or maneuver or mission effectiveness. Analysis was slow or incomplete. Had some
deficiencies in systems knowledge. Referred to the checklist or flight manual, as required.
3.2.3. (3) Made major deviations from (1) criteria. Made incorrect analysis or incorrect
response to boldface. If required, boldface was provided with significant hesitation or with
incorrect response or sequence. Had significant deficiencies in systems knowledge. Did not refer
to the checklist or flight manual, as required.
3.3. Evaluation Criteria. Table 3.1 provides the grading criteria for determining individual
area grades (see paragraph 1.4.3). Use all criteria applicable to the events performed on the
evaluation. (T-2).
    3.1.1. Table 3.1 divides grading areas into subareas where applicable. FEs will assign grades
    to each subarea where the table provides evaluation criteria and the examinee performs the
    maneuver. FE’s will annotate discrepancies on the AF Form 8 by area or subarea.
    3.1.2. Asterisked (*) items identify critical sub areas.
