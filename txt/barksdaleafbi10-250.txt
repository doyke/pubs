6.2. Policy. EM planning allows continual support to the BAFB mission by minimizing the loss
of life, resources and/or operational capability caused by an ‘all-hazards’ event. Planning
addresses resources and activities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from threat and hazards
specific to BAFB. All military, DoD civilians, contractors, dependents and guest, including
those from GSUs, are included in planning considerations IAW DoDI 6055.17, AFI 10-2501,
AFI 10-2501_AFGSCSUP and AFMAN 32-1007.
6.3. Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2. This plan provides
comprehensive guidance for major accidents, natural disasters and/or terrorist use of CBRN
weapons systems. IEMP 10-2 will not include program management, exercise procedures, or
administrative information.
   6.3.1. OEM is OPR for IEMP 10-2, the Civil Engineer Contingency Response Plan (CE
   CRP) 10-211 and this instruction.
6.4. Unit Supporting Checklists. Units must develop supporting checklists addressing their
general and specific taskings identified in IEMP 10-2. Checklists must be dated and specify who,
what, when, and how to perform assigned tasks during contingency operations. Note: OEM
must approve unit supporting checklists prior to publication.

Table 6.1. Installation Contingency Response Plans




6.5. Support and Mutual Aid Agreements. Any Memorandum of Understanding (MOU),
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA) or support agreement
concerning installation first and/or emergency response in support of DSCA must be coordinated
in concert with OEM. This is a necessary component of installation emergency response
planning IAW AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures & Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101, Developing and Maintaining
Operations Plans.

              INSTALLATION NOTIFICATION AND WARNING SYSTEM

7.1. Installation Notification & Warning System (INWS). 2 BW/CC, or a delegated
authority, will direct a pyramid alert of BAFB personnel in response to Emergency War Orders
(EWO), contingency operations, terrorist attacks, natural and man-made disasters, or peacetime
exercises and/or incidents. With direction from higher authority, local requirements, or exercises,
the appropriate subordinate commander will, in turn, initiate unit pyramid alerts. This instruction
provides: pyramid alert procedures for assigned, attached, and associate personnel; 2 BW Crisis
Action Team composition and guidance for operations and Crisis Action Team Directive
(CATD) notification and strength reporting procedures.
   7.1.1. Emergency Management and Contingency/Exercise Leadership organizations are
   divided by function with two defined organizations for each event. The focus of these
   organizations, although similar in composition, differs depending on the situation.
       7.1.1.1. Emergency Management.
           7.1.1.1.1. Crisis Action Team (CAT).      The CAT serves as a strategic
           advisory/command forum for the 2 BW/CC during small scale or developing events.
           The 2 BW/CC may add members to the CAT as the situation dictates. The CAT may
           be comprised of the following members (or their designated representatives): 2
           BW/CC, 2 BW/CV, 2 BW/CCC, 2 OG/CC, 2 MXG/CC,           2 MDG/CC, 2 BW/DS, 2
           BW/IG, 2 BW/XP, 2 BW/JA, 2BW/CP, 2 BW/SE, 2 OSS/CC,                2 SFS/CC, 2
           CS/CC, 2 CONS/CC, 2 LRS/CC, 2 FSS/CC and the CAT Director and CAT
           Manager.
       7.1.1.2. Contingency/Exercise Leadership.
           7.1.1.2.1. Restricted CAT (RCAT). RCAT serves as an advisory/command forum
           for the          2 BW/CC during small scale or developing contingencies/exercises.
           RCAT is also used for events requiring a high level of confidentiality. The 2 BW/CC
           may recall specific members to the RCAT as the situation dictates.
           7.1.1.2.2. CAT Support Staff. The CAT Support Staff serves as the wing level
           contingency/exercise strategic actions coordination group. For large scale
           contingencies and exercises, the 2 BW/CC may add representatives from tenant units.
           The CAT Support Staff is comprised of the RCAT plus the following members: 2
           MXG/CEM, 2 LRS/CC, 2 FSS/CC,           2 CONS/CC, 2 BW/PA, OSI, 2 OSS/A3W, 2
           OSS/A2, BSC, CCA, 2 CS systems administrator.
   7.1.2. Recall Definitions. For the purposes of this instruction, Pyramid Alert is the procedure
   by which an individual is passed critical information through a chain notification process.
   The term “Recall” will be used when an individual is ordered to report for duty. Any means
   of notification may be used, including, but not limited to: telephone, base wide warning
   system (Giant Voice or Emergency Mass Notification System [EMNS]), SFS/FES/OEM
   public address systems, messengers, and announcements in clubs, snack bars, exchange, and
   commissary.
20                                        BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014


     7.1.2.1. Recalls. All military and/or civilian personnel assigned to BAFB may be recalled
     in any of the following combinations at the discretion of the 2 BW/CC. When recalled,
     individuals must report to their unit control center (UCC) for accountability. Military
     duty uniform is the utility uniform (ABUs, flight suits, etc.) and civilians will report in
     appropriate civilian attire. Conduct strength reporting according to paragraph 7.6 of this
     instruction.
        7.1.2.1.1. All Military and Key Civilian Personnel Recall. All military personnel, key
        civilian personnel and tenant units assigned to BAFB are recalled by their UCC.
        7.1.2.1.2. All Military Personnel Recall. All military personnel assigned to BAFB,
        including tenant units, are recalled by their UCC.
        7.1.2.1.3. All 2 BW Personnel Recall. All military and civilian personnel assigned to
        the         2 BW are recalled by their UCC.
     7.1.2.2. Selective Recall. When directed, group commanders may recall all or part of
     their organizations to provide sufficient personnel for the purpose of the recall (e.g.,
     deployment order drop). Recall of Group Control Centers (GCCs), UCCs, UDMs and
     Deployment Control Center (DCC) personnel is at the discretion of the individual group
     commander. Duty uniform and strength reporting requirements will remain at the group
     level.
     7.1.2.3. Exercise Alert/Recall. When directed, accomplish a test of the pyramid
     notification system. Units will complete their pyramid notification alert/recall procedures.
     Recall of shift workers and members on pre-flight crew rest is at the discretion of the
     group commander, unit commander, or staff agency chief. Normally, the CAT will not
     convene. Activate GCCs and UCCs to track strength reporting according to paragraph 7.2
     of this document.
        7.1.2.3.1. The focus of an exercise alert/recall is to fine tune effective and efficient
        personnel strength reporting and message passing capabilities. However, rather than
        face-to-face accountability, accurate sign-in procedures established by individual
        UCCs may be used.
        7.1.2.3.2. Personnel may be directed to pass a message, report immediately, or sign-
        in at their normal work location/time and annotate the time they were contacted.
        Each UCC will compile their sign-in rosters and forward to the Personnel Control
        Center (PCC) NLT the established timing criteria in paragraph 7.6.4. During
        exercises, the PCC will consolidate all unit sign-in rosters and forward them to the
        CAT and WIT.
     7.1.2.4. CAT Control Center. Only CAT and Support Staff members are recalled to the
     primary CAT location. The primary CAT is located in the CP, BLDG 3433. The alternate
     location is the Warrior Center, BLDG 6067. Both locations will be configured per the
     layout maintained by the CAT Support Staff as approved by the 2 BW/CC. Composition
     of the CAT may change at the discretion of the CAT Director to meet changing
     requirements as situations dictate.
        7.1.2.4.1. Watch Cell. A watch cell may be established when the primary CAT is not
        in session to maintain a 24-hour posture. At a minimum, watch cells should include
BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                        21


         representatives from each group, a Commander’s Senior Staff director and
         administrative support personnel. Members in positions not represented by watch
         cells will remain on telephone stand-by for immediate recall.
     7.1.2.5. EOC Recall. 2 BW/CC, in concert with 2 MSG/CC, directs 2 BW/CP to initiate
     EOC activation when necessary. During duty hours, the 2 BW/CP will initially direct
     Base Operations to activate the Secondary Crash Net to facilitate the rapid response of
     key base agencies. The on-duty controller will announce “primary location, BLDG
     7251” or any other location as determined by the EOC Director and as the situation
     dictates. The 2 BW/CP controllers will activate “At Hoc” system for automated
     computer based alerts and notifications. During non-duty hours, the Secondary Crash
     Net will not be activated. The command post will initiate the EOC recall using At Hoc
     and/or telephonic recall and identify the assembly point location. EOC members recalled
     will respond immediately to the location indicated.
         7.1.2.5.1. 2 MSG/CC is the primary EOC Director and as such will occupy the EOC
         during activations. During 24-hour operations, 2 MSG/CD will assume command
         upon shift change. The position of EOC Director may be delegated to 2 CES/CC
         whereas 2 CES/CD may assume transfer of authority between operational periods.
         7.1.2.5.2. 2 BW/CC appoints in writing at least two personnel as EOC Director and
         two personnel as EOC Manager to ensure proper coverage for prolonged all-hazards
         events.
     7.1.2.6. Initial Response Element (IRE) Recall. IRE activation is accomplished by the
     Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower over the Primary Crash Net.
  7.1.3. Wing Special Accountability Actions. During designated national or international
  disasters, 2 FSS will be directed to accomplish an accountability assessment for BAFB
  personnel and/or their dependents. In these rare cases, the 2 BW/CC will direct the 2 BW/CP
  to conduct an accountability assessment. This will be coordinated with 2 FSS and will utilize
  the Option 2 recall procedures as outlined in paragraph 7.5.2.
     7.1.3.1. When directed by higher headquarters, all total force personnel (as outlined in
     paragraph 7.1.3.1.1) are required to log on to the Air Force Personnel Accountability and
     Assessment System (AFPAAS) website (https://afpaas.af.mil) and account for
     themselves and their Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS)
     dependents. Under extenuating circumstances, UCC members, who have delegated
     access, can complete AFPAAS actions for individuals. This will be coordinated with the
     2 FSS/FSOXI section and will utilize Option 7 recall procedures as outlined in
     Attachment 5.
         7.1.3.1.1. Total force personnel include: Active Duty members, Selected Reserve
         members,       Air Force civilian employees (Department of the Air Force and Non-
         Appropriated Fund), family members of Active Duty and Selected Reserve members
         as reflected in DEERS, applicable non-command sponsored dependents and family
         members of the Air Force civilians receiving benefits associated with being evacuated
         to an authorized safe haven, and all Air Force-affiliated military and civilian
         personnel, including contractors and family member, excluding foreign nationals,
         when assigned outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS).
 22                                        BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014


   7.1.4. UCC. Once activated, UCCs become the primary command and control link between
   their GCC and unit personnel. Vigilance to UCC operations is mandatory. Operating the
   UCC becomes the primary duty for assigned personnel. UCCs must remain staffed until
   deactivated by their respective EOC and/or CAT representative. (Unless directed otherwise,
   UCCs should assume a 24-hour posture.)
      7.1.4.1. Emergency Relocation Kit (ERK). Kit maintained for the commander consists of
      unit-level checklists, CAT checklists, flashlight, base map, pyramid alert rosters and any
      other items desired by the commander. CAT checklists will be provided by the CAT
      Director.
   7.1.5. Re-attacks. Open items from previous CAT meetings. Each CAT briefing will
   address re-attacks from previous briefings and assign POCs for re-attacks in subsequent
   briefings.
7.2. CAT Directives (CATD). During CAT activation, all notifications to wing and tenant
units will take place via unclassified CATDs. CATDs will outline actions required for
coordination and accomplishment directed by the CAT. If a classified CATD is required, a
NIPR notification will be sent directing personnel to the SIPR CATD. During exercises, all
CATDs will be numbered sequentially along with the short title of the exercise name (i.e.,
GLOBAL THUNDER 001, GLOBAL THUNDER 002). When the CAT is not activated,
CATDs will be numbered sequentially by the year and sequence number (i.e. CATD 2015-01,
CATD 2015-02).
   7.2.1. All exercise CATDs will begin and end “EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE”.
   7.2.2. CATs will be sent to all UCCs listed in Figure 7.1
   7.2.3. The primary means of communication will be e-mail. The CAT Director will e-mail
   all directives to the associate units and UCCs listed in Figure 7.1. (Note: CATDs that
   initiate recalls and/or activate GCCs/UCCs will be followed up by a phone call from the
   CAT to group commanders and tenant/associate unit commanders).
      7.2.3.1. Upon receipt, each UCC should immediately acknowledge receipt to their
      respective GCC. UCCs will then report status to the CAT or EOC (if activated). Follow-
      up phone calls will be required for all unacknowledged e-mail notifications. After
      acknowledgement, any subsequent questions should be routed to the CAT through the
      applicable CAT Support Staff member.
      7.2.3.2. CAT and EOC members are responsible for ensuring CATD receipt for their
      respective UCCs. Note: The purpose of using e-mail is to keep routine phone
      conversations to a minimum for passing of time critical information.
   7.2.4. After acknowledging receipt of the directive(s), units will comply with all CATD
   instructions. Upon completion of a required item(s), the UCC will report compliance.
      7.2.4.1. UCCs will track all required actions within their groups and report completion to
      the CAT or EOC (if activated).
      7.2.4.2. CATDs may contain multiple taskings. UCCs should send notifications upon
      the completion of each task, not wait until all tasks are accomplished prior to notification.
BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                         23


   7.2.5. The primary method of CATD acknowledgement is via e-mail, UL/UC2, VOC,
   telephone, fax or runner, in that order. UCCs and associate units are responsible for passing
   information to subordinate units.
   7.2.6. If communications with the CAT and/or EOC are lost, a runner from the UCC will be
   dispatched immediately to either CAT Control Center or the EOC.

      and employment exercises and provide personnel/equipment, as necessary.
BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                         25


     7.3.3.2. Determine staffing requirements during alert conditions, disaster responses, and
     exercises. Staffing for increased security measure postures will come from within
     individual units.
     7.3.3.3. Establish UCCs to consolidate unit strength data and reporting to their respective
     GCCs. Provide QEMRs as prescribed in Attachment 3 and this instruction. When
     directed by the CAT, recall personnel on pass, leave, and temporary duty (TDY) by any
     means available.
     7.3.3.4. All squadron, staff agencies, and associate units will provide current pyramid
     alert rosters to the PCC and 2 BW/CP when accomplished (quarterly at a minimum).
     Send new recall rosters by e-mail to “2 FSS/FSOXI Installation Personnel Readiness”
     and “Barksdale Command Post” no later than 10 January, 10 April, 10 July and 10
     October of each calendar year.
     7.3.3.5. Designate a specific location for personnel to report during a recall (usually the
     UCC).
     7.3.3.6. Develop unit recall procedures to sustain 24-hour operations. Each organization
     will develop an internal degraded communications recall system and designate an on-
     base POC for degraded communications recalls.
     7.3.3.7. Establish procedures for the recall of assigned personnel from leave and TDY.
     Recall of personnel from leave or TDY may be directed by HQ USAF, AFGSC, 2
     BW/CC or the unit commander. Units of assignment are responsible for all expenses
     incurred during the recall of personnel from leave (travel costs, lodging, etc). UCCs will
     maintain the capability to telephone those on leave and initiate recall when directed. To
     recall personnel from TDY status (routine TDYs and schools), units should place a
     telephone call to the TDY location’s personnel section and temporary unit of assignment
     asking for return of the member. A written recall message must be provided via e-mail or
     fax. The PCC will advise commanders on the process of recalling personnel from
     contingency exercises/operations, if needed.
     7.3.3.8. Brief wing pyramid alert/recall procedures during unit in-processing and at least
     once yearly during a commander’s call.
     7.3.3.9. Conduct a unit-level pyramid alert exercise semi-annually via telephone or
     communications-out procedures.
  7.3.4. Recalled Individuals will:
     7.3.4.1. Immediately comply with instructions received. If recalled to the base, report
     (with a responsible sense of urgency) to their designated gathering point, sign in and wait
     for further instructions. Recalls of military and/or civilian personnel do not authorize
     circumvention of local traffic or law enforcement restrictions.
  7.3.5. CAT Director will:
     7.3.5.1. Develop recall procedures to sustain 24-hour operations and an internal degraded
     communications recall system with an on-base POC for degraded situations. Ensure
     currency of CAT checklists.
 26                                        BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014


      7.3.5.2. Maintain a working knowledge of AFGSC and 2 BW plans, policies, and
      procedures applicable to the command’s wartime mission and contingency operations.
      7.3.5.3. Maintain CAT communications to include as a minimum:
          7.3.5.3.1. Sufficient telephones to accomplish CAT mission.
          7.3.5.3.2. Secure telephones within the CAT Control Center.
          7.3.5.3.3. LMR (in receive-only mode) set to the Commander’s Net.

   7.3.6. CAT Members will:
      7.3.6.1. When directed by the 2 BW/CC or higher headquarters, each CAT position will
      ensure availability of sufficient personnel to conduct a 24-hour CAT posture.
          7.3.6.1.1. CAT members require unescorted access to the CAT Control Center.
          7.3.6.1.2. In cases where a primary or alternate member of the CAT does not reside
          on base, attempt to designate a knowledgeable individual residing on base to respond
          as an initial representative.
          7.3.6.1.3. A watch cell may be established when the primary CAT is not in session.
          At a minimum, watch cells should include representatives from each group, a CAT
          Director, and sufficient Support Staff. Members in positions not represented by
          watch cells will remain on telephone stand-by for immediate recall.
      7.3.6.2. Provide strategic expertise, support, and coordination to the 2 BW/CC and EOC
      (if activated).
      7.3.6.3. Bring or maintain all required support materials used during CAT operations. All
      items may be kept in a briefcase/bag to be stored inside the CAT Control Center. Items
      should include but are not limited to: copy of IEMP 10-2 checklists, list of key phone
      numbers, note pads/writing tablets, maps, pens/pencils, etc.
      7.3.6.4. In case of CAT relocation, CAT members are responsible for relocating with
      their checklist binders and ensuring all individual materials necessary to support CAT
      operations are taken to the alternate location.
      7.3.6.5. Ensure all radios and cellular phones are deposited in their appropriate
      receptacles outside the CAT Control Center.
      7.3.6.6. Ensure telephones are not answered during classified briefings. Otherwise,
      when answering a telephone inside the CAT, announce, “Line Up” or “Line Down” when
      returning the phone to its cradle.
      7.3.6.7. Coordinate all messages and correspondence with the CAT Director before
      dissemination within the CAT and to GCCs/UCCs by CATD. CATDs will standardize
      information output from the CAT and are the primary source of C2 information when the
      CAT is in session.
7.4. Procedures.
   7.4.1. 2 BW/CC or designated representative directs all pyramid alerts/recalls.

Figure 7.4. Emergency Operations Center Notifications




   7.4.9. Once pyramid alert/recall procedures are initiated by the 2 BW/CP, group and
   squadron commanders are responsible for activating appropriate control centers and initiating
   their own organizational recalls. The recall time is established by the 2 BW/CC and does not
   change during the recall process. All recall notifications must specify the same 2 BW/CC
   established recall time.
7.5. Telephone Pyramid Alert/Recall Procedures.
   7.5.1. The recall of shift workers and members on pre-flight crew rest will be at the
   discretion of the group commander, unit commander, or staff agency chief for Exercise Only
   pyramid recalls (See paragraph 7.5.3.2).
   7.5.2. 2 BW/CP will initiate a pyramid alert/recall using one of the following statements:
      7.5.2.1. Option 1: “This is a unit recall. Complete your pyramid alert notifications
      and report to your duty station immediately. Recall time is ________ Local.”
      Definition: Highest state of unit and wing readiness. CAT report to the command post
      immediately. Report unit strength in accordance with this instruction. All personnel
      complete pyramid notifications and report to duty station immediately. Used for a wing-
      wide recall of all personnel, regardless of shift work or crew rest.
      7.5.2.2. Option 2: “This is a unit alert and selective recall of mission essential
      individuals. Complete your pyramid alert notifications. Remain on telephone
      standby or report to your duty station as directed. Recall time is __________
30                                         BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014


     Local.” Definition: Second highest state of unit and wing readiness. CAT will report to
     the command post immediately. Report unit strength IAW this instruction. All personnel
     will complete pyramid notification and predetermined mission essential individuals as
     deemed by the group/unit commander will report to their duty station immediately.
     Personnel not directed to report will remain on telephone standby per unit/group policy.
     Shift workers and individuals in crew rest will not be called but will be notified upon
     reporting to duty. Special instructions determined by the 2 BW/CP can be added as
     necessary. For example: ALL LEAVES ARE CANCELLED, ALL PERSONNEL
     WILL REMAIN IN QUARTERS, or ALL PERSONAL REMAIN ON 6-RING
     TELEPHONE STANDBY.
     7.5.2.3. Option 3: “This is a selective recall of mission essential individuals. Recall
     time is _______Local.” Definition: Third highest state of unit and wing readiness.
     CAT will report to the command post immediately. Predetermined mission essential
     individuals as deemed by the group/unit commander will report to duty. Group and unit
     commanders will consider implementing local travel or telephone standby restrictions.
     Shift workers and individuals in crew rest will not be called but will be notified upon
     reporting to duty.
     7.5.2.4. Option 4: “This is a recall of the Crisis Action Team only. Recall time is
     ______Local.” Definition: Used to recall the CAT members only.
     7.5.2.5. Option 5: “This is a test of the Pyramid Alerting System. Recall time is
     _______Local.” Definition: Used to test the wing pyramid alerting system only.
     Complete your notifications and report end strength numbers to the UCC. Do not report
     to your duty station. Do not notify shift workers and personnel in crew rest. Do not
     remain on telephone alert. This is only a test.
     7.5.2.6. Option 6: “This is an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Recall. Recall
     time is ________Local.” Definition: Used to recall specific Emergency Support
     Functions (ESFs) to the EOC.
     7.5.2.7. Option 7: “This is an Air Force Personnel Accountability and Assessment
     System (AFPAAS) Recall. Recall time is ________ Local.” Definition: Used for the
     Commander to direct personnel to log on to https://afpaas.af.mil and complete
     accountability actions for themselves and their dependents. Reporting to duty station is
     not required unless directed.
  7.5.3. Degraded Communications. Any above message may be transmitted.
     7.5.3.1. 2 BW/CC, or designated alternate, reserves the right to make any modifications
     to the preceding pyramid alert/recall statements as the situation dictates.
     7.5.3.2. All exercise pyramid alerts/recalls will have “EXERCISE, EXERCISE,
     EXERCISE” preceding and following the text message.
  7.5.4. Each contacted individual will:
     7.5.4.1. Initiate their portion of the telephone pyramid notification by noting the time
     they were called and notifying the next person in their chain with the exact verbiage
     given. If there is no answer, skip to the next person until you make contact. If the line is
     busy, continue attempt to contact for three minutes before ceasing efforts. Make note of
BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                31


       any/all personnel not contacted. It is the responsibility of each member to let the
       person below them in the reporting chain know if any other(s) could not be
       contacted. The last person notified in the chain will report completion to their flight
       chief or squadron commander. The flight chief or squadron commander will notify
       their appropriate UCC of unit notification completion time.
           7.5.4.1.1. Unless otherwise directed, report immediately to their designated
           assembly point (usually the UCC), sign in and wait for further guidance.
   7.5.5. Degraded Communications Recall.
       7.5.5.1. The following procedures will be used if the commercial telephone system is
       inoperable, and a pyramid alert/recall is necessary:
           7.5.5.1.1. 2 BW/CP will contact 2 SFS by the any means available (runner, radio,
           hotline) to initiate the pyramid alert/recall. 2 BW/CP will deliver to BDOC recall
           instructions, maps, and directions to all key wing staff billeting/office locations.
           Commanders and 2 BW/DS will initiate unit-specific recall procedures.
           7.5.5.1.2. 2 SFS will dispatch a patrol vehicle to notify the appropriate individuals.
           7.5.5.1.3. Individuals contacted by 2 SFS will, in turn, notify a pre-identified member
           of their organizations residing on base to begin the pyramid alert/recall.
           7.5.5.1.4. Once contacted, individuals will initiate their portion of their unit’s
           degraded communications pyramid alert/recall program and then comply with follow-
           on instructions.
7.6. Strength Reporting. This paragraph provides UCCs with procedural guidance for
reporting unit strength numbers to the PCC during pyramid recalls. For recall options 1-3 and 5,
strength numbers must be reported to the PCC.
   7.6.1. Pyramid Recall Start Time (PRST). This will be established by the commander
   initiating the recall. Upon activation, the PCC will obtain the PRST from 2 BW/CP.
   Personnel recall and accounting will begin upon designation of the PRST. Units may obtain
   the PRST by contacting the PCC.
   7.6.2. PCC Location. Upon recall, the PCC will activate in Hoban Hall, Room 155. During
   relocation exercises, or possible "real-world" situations, the PCC may be moved to an
   alternate location. The alternate location for the PCC will be in the military personnel
   section. The phone numbers will remain 5611/2526. When the PCC is moved, reporting
   times will be shortened by 15 minutes for each scheduled report; this time change is due to
   lack of SIPR capability at the alternate location. This additional time will allow the PCC to
   provide strength reports to the CAT in a timely manner.
   7.6.3. Strength Figures. Units will report their strength figures to the PCC via phone,
   extension 5611, or by sending a runner (strength numbers can be given over unsecured lines
   or email). In the event of a communications outage, units will provide strength reports to the
   PCC by runner. Strength reports will consist of the following information:
       7.6.3.1. Total Assigned, in accordance with the most recent Military Personnel Data
       System (MilPDS) strength report, including any members that PCS in but are not yet
       reflected in MilPDS. (ONCE REPORTED, STRENGTH MAY NOT CHANGE).
32                                        BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014


     7.6.3.2. Deductions, detailed as follows:
        7.6.3.2.1. All personnel TDY, whether in or out of the local area, to include
        contingencies.
        7.6.3.2.2. All personnel on leave of any kind, whether in or out of the local area.
        7.6.3.2.3. All personnel on quarters or in the hospital.
        7.6.3.2.4. Other (anyone else that is not available for duty. Example: AWOL, in
        Professional Military Education (PME), confinement and departed but not yet
        dropped from the rolls).
        7.6.3.2.5. Available for duty (total assigned to the unit minus the TDY, leave,
        hospital/quarters and others).
        7.6.3.2.6. Present for duty (PFD). Individuals are PFD if they were recalled and are
        physically at their duty station, have been recalled and have been directed when to
        report for duty, or on crew rest and know when to report for duty (report number of
        personnel, not percentage).
        7.6.3.2.7. Percentage Present for Duty (PFD). To compute this, divide the number of
        personnel present for duty by the number available for duty.
  7.6.4. Reporting Times. Units MUST provide strength reports as follows. Each report is
  MANDATORY until the unit reports 100% accountability.
     7.6.4.1. “Present for Duty" is defined as those members that have been accounted for. If
     the member was successfully contacted during the recall, or if the member reports for
     duty, then that member is accounted for. As long as this person is available for duty (not
     AWOL or unable to be contacted), then they may be included in your strength report
     under “Available for Duty.”
     7.6.4.2. First Report is due to the PCC as soon as possible, but no later than PRST + 80
     minutes (1 hour and 20 minutes after PRST) (example: if PRST is 0600 hrs, the first
     report is due to PCC NLT 0720 hrs). DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO
     MAKE YOUR FIRST REPORT, AS THE PHONE LINE WILL BE BUSY. The PCC
     must provide the first report numbers to the CAT ten minutes after the unit report cutoff
     (PRST + 90 minutes). These ten minutes will be used to compile wing strength statistics
     and generate reports.
     7.6.4.3. Second Report is due to the PCC no later than PRST + 170 minutes (2 hours
     and 50 minutes after PRST). If the unit has reported 100% ”Personnel Available for
     Duty” for its first report of strength figures, a second report is not required. CHANGES
     TO ASSIGNED STRENGTH FIGURES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR SECOND
     OR SUBSEQUENT REPORTS. Once again, the PCC will have ten minutes to compile
     wing strength figures and forward them to the CAT Support Staff. Late reports will not
     be included in the second report figures.
     7.6.4.4. Subsequent Reports are required at PRST + 4 hours and PRST + 5 hours, and
     so on every hour until the units have obtained and reported 100% accountability. PRST
     + 24 hours report will be the final report to the CAT Support Staff.
BARKSDALEAFBI10-250 19 NOVEMBER 2014                                                          33


   7.6.5. Leave/TDY Accounting. Units must be able to recall personnel from leave or TDY.
   No action will be taken to require physical return of these members unless specifically
   directed. UNIT COMMANDERS DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RECALL
   PERSONNEL FROM HIGHER HEADQUARTERS-DIRECTED DEPLOYMENTS.
       7.6.5.1. Recall of personnel on leave will be accomplished by the unit via telephone
       contact and reported to the IPR via electronic media or posted on a shared drive. List
       members on leave, the phone number, and whether or not the member was contacted or
       recalled on the deduction letter.
       7.6.5.2. Recall of personnel TDY will be accomplished via priority message (AMHS)
       format and provided to the PCC on hard copy. Submit a copy on electronic media with
       the document. In the event Automatic Message Handling System (AMHS) capability is
       not available, resort to Microsoft Word using the same format. Remember the following
       when accomplishing the message: Only personnel in “regular” TDY status can be
       recalled at the unit commander’s direction, not those deployed in support of higher
       headquarters operations or contingencies. The unit commander or his/her designated
       authority must sign the message.
       7.6.5.3. Ensure all information is e-mailed to 2 FSS/FSOXI Installation Personnel
       Readiness, once the unit has reached 100% accountability.
   7.6.6. Deduction Letter and TDY Recall Message. Once all unit personnel deductions are
   determined and the PCC has been notified of unit strength information, the Deduction Letter
   and TDY Recall Message should be prepared. These documents must be hand delivered to
   the PCC no later than PRST + 3 hours. Improperly prepared or inaccurate documents will
   be returned to the unit for correction.
7.7. Security.
   7.7.1. 2 BW/CP is responsible for security, access and entry requirements for the CAT
   Control Center. 2 BW/CP will provide access to the facility for members of the CAT and
   RCAT.                2 BW/CP will ensure compliance with AFI 10-207, Command Posts,
   paragraph 10.2., by requesting entry controller support from the 2 SFS. 2BW/CP
   representatives may escort wing staff and higher headquarters personnel at their discretion.
   7.7.2. OEM is responsible for security, access and entry requirements for the EOC. OEM
   will provide access to the facility for members of the CAT, RCAT, EOC, UCCs and/or
   officially delegated representatives.
   7.7.3. Units will ensure commanders, chiefs and designated representatives have the
   appropriate clearances and obtain the required open line badge areas required for entry to the
   primary and alternate facilities identified as restricted.
   7.7.4. Units will provide escorts for personnel that do not have the required open line badge
   areas.
   7.7.5. Units will ensure personnel have the training and documentation required for NIPR
   and SIPR access prior to performing duties at the CAT Control Center and/or EOC.
   7.7.6. 2 SFS will provide an entry controller for the CAT Control Center upon 2 BW/CP
   notification. Entry controllers will remain on duty until released by 2 BW/CP. 2 SFS will
