1.3. Phases of Training:
     1.3.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). This training is necessary to qualify pilots for
     duties as first pilots (FP) in the T-6A aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.3.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to upgrade T-6A
     FPs for duties as IP in the T-6A. In this phase, upgrades will only be accomplished with a
     MAJCOM-approved syllabus. See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements.
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       9


   1.3.3. CT. This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to maintain their level of
   proficiency and currency. It provides minimum ground and flight training requirements. This
   training is also necessary to develop the IP force and certify pilots in specific unit or local
   area requirements. Individual pilot CT requirements are based on unit assignment as
   inexperienced or experienced. See Chapter 4 for CT program requirements.
      1.3.3.1. Experienced or Inexperienced Designation. Squadron commanders will
      designate all pilots as experienced or inexperienced, as follows: (T-2)
          1.3.3.1.1. Experienced Pilots. T-6A pilots who have been certified as MR and have
          150 rated hours primary or instructor flight time in the aircraft and 600 hours total
          rated time, or 250 rated hours primary or instructor flight time in the aircraft and 450
          hours total rated time may be certified experienced by the squadron commander. For
          the purpose of this instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG
          commander, deputy OG commander, squadron commander, and squadron DO are
          designated as experienced pilots. (T-2) Document experienced IP designation on the
          Letter of Xs and certify via the AF Form 4348. (T-2)
          1.3.3.1.2. Inexperienced Pilots. Pilots who do not qualify as experienced or who are
          not certified as such by the squadron commander are considered inexperienced. Pilots
          designated as inexperienced will progress through a program managed by the flight
          commander to develop sound flying and instructional skills. (T-2) Flight commanders
          will tailor each program based on the pilot’s past flying experience and performance
          during IQT and MQT. (T-2) No time limit is established to transition from
          inexperienced to experienced.
   1.3.4. Specialized/Certification Training. This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s
   assigned missions, but is not required of every crewmember. Examples of specialized
   training include, but are not limited to, aircraft handling characteristics (AHC) pilot,
   functional check flight pilot, etc. Individuals selected for training will accomplish appropriate
   formal course training to certify in these specialized areas, or comply with locally developed
   syllabi and squadron-developed training programs.
1.4. Training Concepts and Procedures:
   1.4.1. Squadron commanders will ensure training programs are designed to achieve the
   highest degree of qualification and proficiency consistent with flight safety and resource
   availability. (T-2)
   1.4.2. Unless specifically directed, the squadron commander will determine the level of
   supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. (T-2) If the mission objectives include
   introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an IP may be required.
   If mission objectives require direct supervision, a squadron supervisor may be warranted.
1.5. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.5.1. Maintain an aircrew training folder for each assigned or attached aircrew member. (T-
   2) The training folder will include records of on-going training to include, but not limited to,
   TI, BIP, specialized training, and completed certifications (signed AF Form 4348), in
   accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and the records disposition schedule (RDS). (T-2)
   Once training that requires a certification is complete (e.g., 4-ship upgrade), the signed 4348
 10                                                         AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


   becomes the source document for completion of that training. Once the signed AF Form
   4348 is placed in the training folder, corresponding training records may be removed at the
   unit’s discretion.
   1.5.2. Units may archive completed training records for assigned and attached pilots for
   future reference.
       1.5.2.1. Units may track specialized training that does not lead to a certification on the
       letter of Xs. However, for each certification (see paragraph 3.10 for list of skills that
       require certification) listed, units will maintain a signed AF Form 4348 in accordance
       with AFI 11-202, Volume 2. (T-2)
       1.5.2.2. Certification documents maintained in other locations (supervisor of flying, etc.)
       must also be annotated on the AF Form 4348. (T-2)
   1.5.3. Use AF Form 4293 to document training and any unusual occurrence that could affect
   training progress. (T-2) Instructors should annotate areas of difficulty on the form.
   Instructions for completing AF Form 4293:
       1.5.3.1. The originator provides a concise summary of the activity being documented and
       ensures entries clarify any required action. (T-2)
       1.5.3.2. Begin each entry with the date and reason for documentation. (T-2)
       1.5.3.3. End with the name, grade, and duty title of the person making the entry. (T-2)

       cycle. (T-2)
       1.5.4.4. Flying maneuver currency dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-2)
   1.5.5. Units may specify additional training folder requirements.
1.6. Pilot Utilization:
   1.6.1. IAW AFI 11-412, Commanders will ensure wing pilots fill only authorized positions
   according to unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. (T-2) The
   overall objective is for pilots to perform only operations-related duties. Supervisors may
   assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board member,
   mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of
   pilot tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. (T-2)
   1.6.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to aircrew position
   indicator (API)-1 pilots are programmer, flying safety officer, supervisor of flying, mobility
   or contingency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), stan/eval liaison officer,
   squadron aircrew flight equipment continuation training instructor, and other duties directly
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      11


   related to flying operations. API-1 pilots will not be attached to wing staffs or fill wing staff
   positions unless total wing pilot API-1/6 manning is 100 percent or better. (T-2)
   Commanders will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6) perform duties justified in MAJCOM
   manpower standards documents and authorized in unit manning documents. (T-2)
1.7. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Program. FCF program responsibilities and requirements
are specified in Attachment 2.

program may be accessed at https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod. (T-2)
1.10. Progress Review (PR). Refer to the appropriate formal course syllabus and AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, as supplemented, for PR procedures. (T-2)
1.11. Letter of Xs. The squadron commander will track aircrew training, qualification, and
certification in items appropriate for the unit’s missions on a monthly Letter of Xs according to
AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2) (Note: The squadron DO may accomplish the monthly review and
certify the letter of Xs if the squadron commander is not available.) See Attachment 3 for a
sample letter of Xs.
1.12. Fuel Conservation. All pilots must conserve fuel to the maximum extent possible. Pilots
and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. (T-2) Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all phases of mission planning
and execution. (T-2) Once the objectives of training are complete, sorties will be terminated at
the earliest opportunity. (T-2) Aircrews will not exceed MDS ASDs unless training objectives
have not been met. (T-2) “Sky hooking” (i.e., unnecessarily long cruise legs) is not a permissible
reason for not obtaining training objectives within the prescribed ASD.

                     MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. General Information:
   3.1.1. MQT upgrades T-6A pilots who have completed IQT to specialized undergraduate
   pilot training (SUPT) or ENJJPT IPs. MQT is normally conducted in conjunction with IQT
   according to the formal course pilot instructor training (PIT) syllabus. Additional sorties and
   requirements to become an MR PIT IP are at the discretion of the PIT squadron commander.
   3.1.2. Pilots who have completed MQT are basic mission capable (BMC) according to AFI
   11-202, Volume 1, and may not be designated as MR until completion of TI and certification
   by the squadron commander. (T-2)
   3.1.3. When MQT is not conducted at PIT, pilots must complete MQT within the training
   time prescribed in the formal course syllabus. (T-3) The OG commander or equivalent is
   waiver authority for training time extensions. Units will document all waivers in the
   individual’s training folder. (T-2) MQT is considered complete after successful completion
   of a mission evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 2.
3.2. Prerequisite. Pilots must complete T-6A IQT before beginning MQT. (T-2) Before
entering MQT, each aircrew member must comply with prerequisites in the appropriate formal
course training syllabus and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2)
3.3. Ground Training. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, minimum
ground training will consist of the ground training required by the instructor phase of the formal
course instructor syllabus. (T-2)
3.4. Flying Training. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, complete the

3.5. Training Documentation. Document MQT in TIMS. (T-2)
3.6. Sorties Documentation. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, units will
log MQT sorties as mission support sorties. (T-2)
3.7. Loss of IP Qualification. Failure of a mission evaluation, a commander-directed
downgrade, or failure to perform T-6 instructor duties according to paragraph 3.9 results in loss
of IP qualification. To regain qualification, pilots must, at a minimum, successfully complete an
evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 2. (T-2)
3.8. Loss of IP Certification (MR Status):
   3.8.1. IPs will be decertified and placed in non-mission ready (NMR) status if they:
       3.8.1.1. Fail any flight evaluation. To regain MR status, pilots must successfully
       reaccomplish the failed flight evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI
       11-2T-6, Volume 2. (T-2)
       3.8.1.2. Fail a ground requisite qualification, instrument, or boldface examination. (T-2)
       (Note: Failure of a monthly boldface exam does not require decertification if the exam is
       retaken and passed before the next flight.) To regain MR status, pilots must successfully
       reaccomplish the failed exam. (T-2)

   3.8.2. IPs may retain MR status for loss of currency that does not affect aircraft qualification
   or failure to accomplish annual and semiannual flying requirements, however, will not
   instruct or fly the deficient events according to the restrictions and guidance of AFI 11-202,
   Volume 1, and this instruction. (T-2)
3.9. Instructor Requalification. The following provides criteria for requalifying T-6A
instructors who have not performed T-6A instructor flying duties for:
   3.9.1. A period of 226 days to 2 years. The OG commander determines whether a pilot may
   complete a locally generated upgrade in lieu of a completing a formal requalification
   syllabus. Locally generated programs will be developed and approved by the OG/CC, taking
   into consideration the pilot’s previous experience and currency. Highly experienced IPs will
   conduct the flying training. (T-2) Send an information copy of the training plan to
   AETC/A3F. (T-2) A RQ INSTR evaluation will be completed according to AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2. (T-2) At a minimum, requalification plans will include:
       3.9.1.1. Aircraft: one sortie in each category plus an AHC sortie. (T-2)

                                           Chapter 4

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General Information:
   4.1.1. This chapter outlines the minimum training considered necessary to maintain a viable
   T-6A aircrew corps to meet mission demands. Judicious scheduling of CT is required to
   develop aircrew and ensure training standardization. Sufficient flying hours are included in
   the annual FHP to allow every qualified aircrew member to accomplish all the events and
   currencies listed in this chapter. Units will track all CT requirements in ARMS. (T-2)
   4.1.2. ID sorties are flown to develop IP instructional skills, enhance basic flying
   proficiency, and help meet currency requirements. These sorties allow inexperienced IPs to
   learn and refine techniques while flying with experienced IPs. To maximize their objective,
   ID sorties should be scheduled and flown dual.
4.2. Training Cycle. There are two semiannual CT training cycles, 1 January to 30 June and 1
July to 31 December of each calendar year. Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of
each semiannual period.
4.3. CT Administration:
   4.3.1. Quarterly CT Meetings:
       4.3.1.1. Squadron commanders will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings for
       aircrew members. (T-2) The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization,
       safety, mission-related topics, instructional techniques, grading practices, and to increase
       general knowledge. A CRM topic or scenario should be discussed in each CT meeting
       referring to core concepts from AFI 11-290.
       4.3.1.2. Attendance at CT meetings is mandatory. The unit will determine a method to
       track attendance as part of the go/no-go process for flight. (T-2) Individuals not available
       for CT meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor
       before their next flight. (T-2)
   4.3.2. Requirements. Minimum requirements are identified in this chapter, but units may
   direct additional training in a supplement to this instruction or as necessary for individual
   requirements. ID sorties are the primary means for building and maintaining instructor pilot
   force proficiency.
   4.3.3. Prorating End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the
   squadron commander may prorate training requirements for aircrew members who were not
   available for flying duties according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
       4.3.3.1. Prorate only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training nonavailability, not
       to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-2)
       4.3.3.2. Base prorating on consecutive days of nonflying in the training cycle and apply
       it separately for each period of nonflying. Use the prorating allowance in Table 4.1 to
       determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of consecutive
       calendar days of nonflying. (T-2)
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    19


       4.3.3.3. If IQT is reaccomplished, restart the individual’s training cycle at a prorated
       share following IQT completion. (T-2)
       4.3.3.4. Round off prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 1/2 to the next
       lower whole number, but prorate no requirement below 1. (T-2)
       4.3.3.5. For prorating purposes, newly assigned or converted aircrew and aircrew
       achieving qualification after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first
       day of the following month. Events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle
       may be prorated. (T-2)

    4.3.4. Failure to Complete Annual and Semiannual CT Requirements:
       4.3.4.1. Aircrew members who fail to maintain ground and flying training requirements
       according to Table 4.4, physiological training, medical certification, and minimum MR or
       BAQ CT requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, will be placed in NMR or
       nonbasic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) status as applicable. (T-2) They will not fly in the
       new training cycle until a review is completed to determine the cause of the deficiency
       and whether additional training is required. (T-2)
       4.3.4.2. The OG commander (AETC/A3V for MAJCOM flight examiners) is review and
       waiver authority. The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of the deficiency
       and the individual’s experience level to determine if additional training, increased
       supervision, or a waiver to the previous training cycle requirements is warranted.
       Document waivers, with justification, in the individual’s training folder. (T-2)
       4.3.4.3. The OG/CC will report end-of-cycle training shortfalls to AETC/A3F. (T-2) The
       report will include:
          4.3.4.3.1. Number of individuals who did not complete training and reasons why. (T-
          2)
          4.3.4.3.2. Additional training assigned. (T-2)
          4.3.4.3.3. Number of training waivers issued with justification. (T-2)

4.4. Periodic EP and CRM Simulator Training:
   4.4.1. All pilots will accomplish semiannual EP and CRM simulator training based on
   experience level as described in paragraph 1.3.3.1 and as prescribed in Table 4.4. (T-2)
   Accomplish the mission in the simulator with a certified civilian simulator instructor (SI) or a
   qualified T-6A IP who has received training on simulator console operations. T-6 IPs may
   take credit for an EP and CRM simulator when administering the simulator. If semiannual
   requirements are not met, pilots will not fly until EP and CRM training is accomplished. (T-
   2) Note: PWC requirements may be met during EP and CRM simulator training (see
   paragraph 4.9).
   4.4.2. Because of local emergency scenarios, a locally generated simulator EP and CRM
   instructor guide will be used when administering the simulator. (T-2) The simulator mission
   must include:
       4.4.2.1. All critical action procedures and selected noncritical action emergencies. (T-2)
       4.4.2.2. A cross section of thrust deficient situations, to include at least one forced
       landing initiated within the closed pullup zone. (See Attachment 4 for description of the
       closed pullup zone.) (T-2)
       4.4.2.3. Use of standby instruments. (T-2)
       4.4.2.4. A reduced runway condition reading or hydroplaning stopping scenario. (T-2)
       4.4.2.5. Applicable mishap lessons learned identified by MAJCOM, wing, or unit safety
       staffs. (T-2)
       4.4.2.6. At least one CRM practice scenario briefed, accomplished, and debriefed, using
       CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290. (T-2)
   4.4.3. Pilots must attend a CRM refresher each calendar year. (T-2)Track this training in
   ARMS. (T-2)
4.5. Theater Indoctrination Training (TI). TI is the beginning of the local pilot certification
process. It is during TI that skills learned during IQT and MQT are reinforced in the local flying
environment. New pilots will fly a local familiarization mission prior to the specific TI category
missions. (T-2) This local familiarization mission will focus on local departure, military
operating area, recovery, and pattern operations. (T-2) The mission should allow new IPs to
absorb as many of the local idiosyncrasies as possible before concentrating on required category
missions. The TI category missions should focus on training techniques, local constraints,
common student errors, and should use local routes and bases to the maximum extent possible.
   4.5.1. Pilots in TI will fly with assistant flight commanders and above, check pilots, or pilots
   designated by the squadron commander. (T-2)
   4.5.2. IPs will not perform instructor duties before completing TI. (T-2)
   4.5.3. Units will document ongoing TI training in the training folder. (T-2) Once TI is
   complete and the individual is certified on the Form 4348 as a Mission Ready IP, TI training
   documents may be removed from the training folder.
   4.5.4. TI sorties may meet CT requirements during the period in which they are flown. As a
   minimum, fly the following missions:
22                                                          AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


     4.5.4.1. Local familiarization (must be flown first and may be flown in combination with
     any of the specific category missions). (T-2)
     4.5.4.2. Contact. (T-2)
     4.5.4.3. High-level navigation (should be flown as an out and back). (T-2)
     4.5.4.4. Low-level navigation (may be flown in conjunction with the out-and-back
     mission). (T-2)
     4.5.4.5. Formation (N/A for 479FTG T-6 Combat Systems Operator (CSO) IPs). (T-2)
     4.5.4.6. Instrument (local area bases used for instrument training). (T-2)
     4.5.4.7. Uncontrolled airfield sortie. (T-2) As a minimum, plan the sortie to overfly those
     uncontrolled airfields that might be used as emergency airfields during the unit’s routine
     flying operations. (T-2) If possible, fly practice ELPs at at least one the unit’s routine-use
     uncontrolled airfields if conditions allow (e.g., # aircraft in pattern, weather, etc).
     4.5.4.8. Operational flight trainer (OFT) simulator practicing engine failures for each of
     the emergency landing pattern (ELP) series situations described in Attachment 4. (T-2)
     Practice these ELPs in the OFT at the locally-assigned airfield and other runways likely
     for an ELP recovery, to include commonly used auxiliary, uncontrolled, or emergency
     airfields. Additionally, the erect spin recovery and spiral demonstration/recovery will be
     flown in the OFT during this sortie IAW paragraph A4.7.6.3 and A4.7.6.4. (T-2) If
     practical, accomplish this OFT before the AHC aircraft sortie flown during TI. Civilian
     simulator instructors or qualified T-6 IPs who have received training on simulator
     console operations may conduct the sim training.
     4.5.4.9. AHC sortie, if not accomplished during PIT or pilot instructor requalification.
     (T-2)
  4.5.5. When applicable, missions may be combined if all training objectives are met. TI
  sorties will include training in normal operations and emergency situations in the local area
  such as diversions, single runway operations, and emergency airfields. (T-2) These items
  may be discussed as part of the preflight brief.
  4.5.6. Each OG commander will develop a training program to prepare aircrews to operate in
  an uncontrolled airfield environment. (T-2) As a minimum, the program will include a
  discussion of all applicable codes of federal regulations, advisory circulars, and Aeronautical
  Information Manual references on uncontrolled airfield operations. (T-2) Training will
  emphasize standard civilian radio phraseology. (T-2)
  4.5.7. After successfully completing all TI requirements, the new pilot may be certified by
  the squadron commander as MR by signing the AF Form 4348. (Additional sorties and
  requirements to become an MR IP are at the discretion of the squadron commander.)
  4.5.8. PIT squadron commanders may tailor TI for previous MR IPs directly gained from
  specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT) squadrons. However, at a minimum, a local
  familiarization sortie must be accomplished. (T-2)
  4.5.9. Squadron commanders may tailor TI for pilots who remain at the same base where
  they completed MQT. However, at a minimum, an ELP simulator and an AHC sortie must be
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  23


   accomplished in accordance with paragraphs 4.5.4.8 and 4.5.4.9 if they were not
   accomplished during MQT. (T-2)
   4.5.10. Squadron commanders may tailor TI for FPs; however, at a minimum, a local
   familiarization sortie must be accomplished. (T-2)
4.6. AHC Sortie Requirements and Restrictions:
   4.6.1. If not accomplished during MQT formal syllabus training, an AHC sortie will be
   flown as part of TI at the new IP’s assigned base. Each new IP will receive an additional
   AHC sortie 10 to 18 months following MR certification. All or part of this recurring AHC
   sortie may be accomplished in the T-6 OFT. (T-2) Any civilian simulator instructor or
   qualified T-6A IP who has received training on simulator console operations may administer
   this simulator. Additional AHC sorties may be flown as desired by an individual IP with an
   AHC IP in the aircraft. AHC training will be recorded in the IP’s training records. (T-2) See
   Attachment 4 for more information concerning the sortie profile.
   4.6.2. Plan to accomplish all AHC maneuvers in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) on
   one sortie. If weather prevents accomplishment of the high-speed ELP and/or straight-in ELP
   during an AHC aircraft sortie, these maneuvers will be accomplished in the simulator.
   Exception: Randolph AFB PIT may accomplish the high-speed ELP in the T-6 OFT for
   initial and recurring sorties. (T-2)
   4.6.3. AHC maneuvers may only be flown on an AHC sortie with an AHC IP. (T-2)
   Exception: Maneuvers directed by the syllabus, such as the stability demonstration and slow
   flight torque demonstration, may be performed as directed by the syllabus or by any IP
   during a CT sortie.
4.7. BIP Program: (Note: IPs at PIT, and key wing personnel [wing commanders, wing vice
commanders, OG commanders, and OG deputy commanders] are exempt from this program.)
   4.7.1. Following TI, flight commanders will assign each new IP to a highly qualified BIP
   who will monitor the new IP's performance and provide guidance in all areas of job
   requirements until the new IP has instructed through each category of training. (T-2)
   4.7.2. Due to different experiences of new IPs, two different BIP courses are available—long
   and short. The BIP short program is for new IPs with previous instructor or extensive major
   weapons system (MWS) experience. The BIP long program expands on the short program
   and is mandatory for FAIPs and recommended for individuals who do not have previous
   instructor or limited MWS experience. The squadron commander will designate which
   program new IPs will enter based on their performance during IQT, MQT, TI, and previous
   experience. (T-2)
   4.7.3. The training prescribed in Attachment 5 is the minimum required. Squadron
   commanders should tailor each individual's BIP program and provide additional training as
   required.
   4.7.4. Sponsor sorties may meet CT requirements during the period in which they are flown.
   (T-2)
4.8. Night Flying:

   4.8.1. Night Definition. For purposes of CT, night is defined as the period between the end
   of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight. To obtain night sortie
   credit, a portion of the sortie must be flown during this period.
   4.8.2. Night Certification:
       4.8.2.1. RCP. Night RCP certification consists of a minimum of one night training
       sortie in the RCP with a night certified IP in the front cockpit (FCP), and spatial
       disorientation training accomplished in a MAJCOM approved spatial disorientation
       training device. Note: Spatial disorientation training accomplished in conjunction with
       the pilot’s most recent physiological training will satisfy this requirement.
           4.8.2.1.1. The night RCP certification sortie will be a composite instrument flight
           rules and visual flight rules (VFR) sortie, emphasizing spatial disorientation, night
           instruments, night VFR considerations, traffic pattern procedures, and visual
           references. (T-2)
           4.8.2.1.2. To establish night RCP landing currency, at least three satisfactory night
           RCP landings must be accomplished. (T-2)
       4.8.2.2. FCP. Pilots qualified in the T-6A are qualified to land in the FCP at night
       following spatial disorientation training accomplished in a MAJCOM-approved spatial
       disorientation training device. Note: Spatial disorientation training accomplished in
       conjunction with the pilot’s most recent physiological training will satisfy this
       requirement.
           4.8.2.2.1. Without night RCP certification, pilots will not instruct, establish, or regain
           landing currency for an RCP pilot. (T-2)
           4.8.2.2.2. Night RCP currency is not required for a FCP pilot to instruct, establish, or
           regain landing currency for an RCP pilot. For the purpose of determining crew duty
           day limitations, the FCP IP will consider this a “night checkout sortie” IAW AFI 11-
           202v3 AETC Sup 1 if the pilot in the RCP is either unqualified or non-current.
           Double seat swaps conducted within a single flying period will be considered one
           sortie for the purposes of this restriction. (T-2) The FCP IP will not fly this event as
           the third flight-related activity of the duty day without an OG/CC waiver. (T-3)
   4.8.3. Night Restrictions. Pilots who have not accomplished spatial disorientation training
   IAW paragraph 4.8.2.2. will not fly at night. (T-2)
   4.8.4. Documentation. Night RCP certification training will be recorded on an AF Form
   4348 in the training folder. (T-2)
4.9. Pilot Weather Category (PWC) Certification. (See AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 3, for PWC
operational requirements and information.) PWCs are designed to reduce the exposure of pilots
with limited experience to risks inherent during periods of low ceiling and visibility. Before
PWC 1 certification, a pilot will demonstrate instrument knowledge and proficiency to a current
PWC1 pilot (flight commander or above) by flying an approach in an aircrew training device
with weather at or near PWC 1 ceiling and visibility minimums. (T-2) When calculating total
time for the purpose of PWC designation, do not include student, undergraduate pilot training, or
“other” flight time. (Note: Hours in an assigned aircraft may include all series or mission types
of that aircraft.) Squadron commanders will certify PWC1 pilots. (T-2) Record certification on
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                        25


an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and document on the Letter of Xs. (T-2) Note: For the
purpose of this instruction, the wing commander, vice wing commander, OG commander, deputy
OG commander, squadron commander, and squadron DO are designated as PWC1 pilots.
4.10. FCF Certification. See Attachment 2 for FCF pilot requirements. Record certification
on an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and document on the letter of Xs. (T-2)
4.11. Ground Training Requirements. Ground training accomplished during IQT, MQT, TI,
and BIP training may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was
accomplished. AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and Table 4.2 establish aircrew ground training
requirements.

Notes:
1. This is a consolidated list. Units will comply with grounding/frequency requirements of most
restrictive guidance when differences exist between this AFI and prescribing directives.
2. Required before the first flight of the month. An unsatisfactory boldface exam will result in
grounding until successful reaccomplishment. Ops limits exams are correctable to 100 percent.
3. Aircrew noncurrent in water survival training (WST) must accomplish WST before conducting
overwater flight (a flight in which the aircraft is outside the safe glide ratio to land at any time
during the flight.)
4. For multiple-qualified T-6A pilots, accomplishment of annual CRM CT in their primary aircraft
fulfills the T-6A annual CRM CT requirement in this table. For flight surgeons, CRM is a one-time
requirement in the primary assigned aircraft.

   4.11.1. Units will ensure all pilots attend annual CRM CT, which will build on the basic
   CRM skills taught in SUPT and the formal training unit. (T-2) This is a calendar year
   requirement and will be tracked in ARMS. (T-2) Briefings and debriefings will include the
   core curriculum of CRM training according to AFI 11-290 and MAJCOM guidance, as
   supplemented. (T-2)
   4.11.2. For ancillary, readiness, mobility, and other training requirements, refer to the

4.12. Flying Training. All pilots will maintain currency requirements as applicable in Table
4.3 and sortie/event requirements as applicable in Table 4.4. (T-2) The OG commander
(AETC/A3V for MAJCOM FEs) is the waiver authority for these requirements. Document
waivers in the individual’s training folder. (T-2)

Notes:
1. Complete a Primary Pilot Training (PPT), UCSO, ENJJPT, ENJJPT PIT, PIT syllabus-directed
mission, TI, IP/FP requalification sortie, or any flight evaluation as a flight examiner.
2. Fly at least one ID sortie in each syllabus category per semiannual period.
3. Emergency procedures/CRM simulator requirements do not begin until unit simulators are
operational.
4. Fly a complete procedure (high or low altitude) from the initial approach fix (IAF) to landing or
missed approach/climb out.
5. Fly the circling maneuver at the end of a published approach or a low closed pattern where local
procedures are established.
6. FPs must have a current and qualified IP at a set of controls.
7. Only required for pilots who maintain night RCP currency.
8. Fly from either the lead or wing position.
   4.12.1. Restrictions. Pilots will not fly sorties, events, mission, and currency items in which
   they are not qualified, current, and certified. (T-2) FPs will not fly simulated EPs, touch-and-
   gos, traffic pattern stalls, power-on stalls, out of control flight, formation, or low-level
   without a current IP at a set of controls. (T-2) Exception: FPs enrolled in a formal AETC
   course of training (i.e., PIT), or FPs flying sorties during Wing Theater Indoctrination
   training (TI), are exempt from these restrictions. In these cases, formation sorties will
   be performed under the direct supervision of an IP in the other formation aircraft.
   Additionally, simulated EPs and touch and go landings will only be accomplished at
28                                                           AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


  RSU monitored airfields or the tower controlled patterns at Randolph AFB and NAS
  Pensacola. (T-2)
  4.12.2. Currency and Recurrency. Unless otherwise restricted, pilots may log and update
  currencies during any sortie (including student sorties) if the maneuver or item is
  demonstrated. If a pilot loses an event currency, he or she will not perform that event except
  for the purpose of regaining currency under the supervision of a current and qualified
  instructor. (T-2) Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to
  recurrency may be satisfied in the flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as
  determined by the squadron commander. (T-3)
     4.12.2.1. Landing Currency. Landing currency, IAW Table 4.3, is required to maintain
     basic aircraft qualification. Currency may be regained by flying at least three satisfactory
     landings with a landing-current IP. (T-2) A landing from either the FCP or RCP updates
     landing currency. Loss of landing currency exceeding 90 days requires the following
     action: (Note: Timing starts from last landing.)
         4.12.2.1.1. For 91 through 135 days. Same as paragraph 4.13.2.1, plus an instructor-
         supervised emergency procedure and instrument review session (normal, emergency,
         and instrument procedures). (T-2)
         4.12.2.1.2. For 136 through 225 days. Same as paragraphs 4.13.2.1 and 4.13.2.1.1,
         plus a recurrency flight (at least three satisfactory landings with a landing-current IP),
         qualification written examinations, and an emergency procedures evaluation (EPE).
         (T-2) AF Form 8 documentation is not required.
         4.12.2.1.3. For 226 days up to 39 months at the end of a nonflying assignment or 48
         months at the end of any active flying assignment. For basic aircraft requalification,
         accomplish items in paragraphs 4.12.2.1 through 4.12.2.1.2, plus a locally
         administered qualification program approved by the OG commander, to include an
         instrument or qualification evaluation. (T-2) Note: See paragraph 3.9 for instructor
         requalification guidance.
         4.12.2.1.4. For periods of time greater than paragraph 4.12.2.1.3. Accomplish basic
         aircraft requalification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and accomplish instructor
         requalification according to paragraph 3.9 of this instruction. (T-2)

         currencies.
     4.12.2.4. ELP Currency. If ELP currency is lost, pilots will not fly without an ELP
     current IP on board until currency is regained. (T-2) Currency may be regained by flying
     an ELP from high or low key with an ELP-current IP.
     4.12.2.5. Instrument Approach Currency. Instrument approaches will be flown from
     the initial approach fix (IAF), or radar vectors, to landing or missed approach and may be
     flown from either cockpit. Currency may only be updated in simulated instrument
     meteorological conditions (IMC) with an instrument qualified pilot acting as a safety
     observer; or on any sortie flown at night or during actual IMC. (T-2) If currency is lost,
     regardless of the pilot’s PWC, instrument approaches may not be flown until currency is
     regained by flying an instrument approach with a current IP. (T-2)
     4.12.2.6. Wing Takeoff Currency. IPs and BAQ FPs maintaining formation
     qualification must accomplish a formation wing takeoff IAW Table 4.3 to maintain
     currency. Takeoff may be performed from either the lead or wing position. If currency is
     lost, formation wing takeoffs will not be accomplished without a wing takeoff current IP
     on board; Interval takeoffs may still be accomplished. To regain formation wing takeoff
     currency, a formation wing takeoff will be accomplished with a formation-current IP. (T-

     must accomplish a route entry or exit and at least two legs of a military training route
     (MTR) IAW Table 4.3 to maintain currency. Currency may be regained by flying a route
     entry or exit and at least two legs of a MTR with a low-level-current IP. (T-2)
     4.12.2.9. Traffic Pattern (TP) Stall Currency. IPs and BAQ FPs must accomplish a
     full set of TP stalls (overshooting, undershooting, and landing attitude) IAW Table 4.3 to
     maintain currency in the aircraft. If TP stall currency is lost, pilots will not fly without a
     current IP on board until currency is regained. Currency may be regained by flying a full
     set of TP stalls (overshooting, undershooting, and landing attitude) with a TP stall-current
     IP. (T-2)

          currency requirements.
4.13. Semiannual Event Requirements. Table 4.4 establishes the minimum semiannual sortie
and event requirements for all MR IPs. Except for EP/CRM simulator requirements, BAQ FPs
and senior officer pilots are only required to meet currency requirements per Table 4.3. (T-2)
   4.13.1. Logging Semiannual Events:
       4.13.1.1. Events may be logged when accomplished on any sortie, to include formal
       training syllabus missions when the instructor demonstrates the maneuver. (T-2)
       4.13.1.2. Events, when accomplished, may be dual logged. For example, a pilot flying a
       complete instrument approach procedure from the IAF to a nonprecision final with a
       circling maneuver to land may log: instrument approach, published approach procedure,
       nonprecision approach, and circling approach. (T-2)
       4.13.1.3. Appropriate currency should be updated when an event is flown. (See
       paragraph 4.12.2.5) (T-2)
       4.13.1.4. ELPs may be logged when flown from either high or low key. (T-2)
       4.13.1.5. For the following events with more than one maneuver, log an event after
       performing the minimum shown:
          4.13.1.5.1. For     power-on      stalls,    two    stalls   (a    combination    of
          straight/turning/high/low). (T-2)
          4.13.1.5.2. For TP stalls, a full set (overshooting, undershooting, and landing
          attitude). (T-2)
          4.13.1.5.3. For recoveries from abnormal flight, two of the following: nose low, nose
          high, and inverted. (T-2)
       4.13.1.6. For formation takeoff and formation landing, log from either the lead or wing
       position. (T-2)
   4.13.2. Logging ID Sorties. All SUPT, ENJJPT, and PIT IPs will fly a minimum of one ID
   sortie dedicated to each syllabus category of training per semiannual period. (T-2) The
   remaining ID sorties may be flown in any category and should be tailored to developmental
   requirements as determined by the squadron commander. ID sorties will not be logged on
   formal training syllabus missions. Both IPs may log ID sorties when both pilots fly the
   minimum maneuvers required by the squadron DO-defined profile.

   A2.2.3. Maintain an FCF read file for FCF issues available to all FCF pilots for review
   before flying FCF sorties. (T-2)
   A2.2.4. Ensure FCF crews maintain a high level of proficiency and knowledge of
   maintenance requirements to produce a quality aircraft for mission accomplishment. (T-2)
   A2.2.5. Ensure minimum FCF requirements and currencies are met, and noncurrent pilots
   are not allowed to fly until recurrent. (T-2)
   A2.2.6. Act as a liaison member of OG stan/eval and air traffic control agencies. (T-2)
   A2.2.7. Ensure local flight clearance is coordinated between the FCF section and air traffic
   control agencies. (T-2)
   A2.2.8. Maintain AF Form 4327 to serve as the FCF Flight Authorization. (T-2) Maintain
   AF Form 2400 or a locally developed, equivalent automated product to serve as the FCF
   Flight Log. (T-2)
A2.3. FCF Pilot Requirements. FCF pilots will be selected from highly qualified wing pilots.
(T-2) Pilots selected must have completed TI and have at least 4 months of experience in the T-
6A, 750 total flying hours and 200 IP/FP hours or 650 total hours and 300 IP/FP hours in the T-
6A. (T-2)
A2.4. FCF IP Requirements. A pilot selected to be an FCF IP must have at least 4 months of
experience conducting FCFs. (T-2) FCF IPs will be certified by the OG on the AF Form 4348.

   block. (T-2)
A2.6. FCF Currency. FCF pilots must fly an FCF flight every 90 days to maintain currency.
FCF pilots who fail to meet these requirements will be considered FCF noncurrent and will not
fly an FCF sortie until recurrent. To regain currency, the FCF pilot must review the FCF read file
and fly an FCF sortie with an FCF IP in the aircraft or simulator. (T-2) FCF pilots who exceed
180 days from their last FCF flight will be decertified. To be recertified, FCF pilots must review
the FCF read file, pass a ground evaluation, and fly an FCF certification flight with an FCF IP.
(T-2) If an FCF is flown dual, it may be counted as an FCF flight for both pilots provided a
proportionate number of test items are accomplished by each pilot.

                                      AHC PROGRAM

A4.1. Overview of the AHC Program. The AHC program provides IPs an in-depth look at the
handling characteristics of the T-6A when operated at the very edges of the envelope. The
program focuses on the effects of torque on spins, stalls, and slow flight; alternative weather
penetration ELP profiles; and aircraft ELP capabilities from within the standard pattern.
A4.2. AHC IP Certification. AHC IPs will normally be FEs. However, OG commanders may
select any experienced T-6A IP to be certified as an AHC IP. Units will certify the minimum
number of IPs required to fulfill AHC sortie training requirements. (T-2) Before being certified
as an AHC IP, selected IPs must complete a minimum of two AHC IP certification sorties that
focus on instructing the maneuvers. (T-2) Training will be certified by the OG/CC (or designated
representative) and documented in the IP’s training record on an AF Form 4348 and tracked on
the letter of Xs (Attachment 3). (T-2)
   A4.2.1. Ground Training. Prior to the AHC IP certification sorties, upgrading instructors
   will review AHC information contained in the following material: TO 1T-6A-1 (T-6A flight
   manual); AFI 11-2T-6, Volumes 1 and 3; AFMAN 11-248, T-6 Primary Flying; and other
   information as determined locally.
   A4.2.2. Flight Training:
       A4.2.2.1. On the first AHC IP certification sortie, the AHC IP will brief the sortie with
       emphasis on local restrictions, instructional techniques, and safe accomplishment of the
       required maneuvers. The AHC IP will then fly and instruct the maneuvers. Fuel and time
       permitting, the upgrading instructor may fly and practice instructing any of the
       maneuvers after the initial AHC IP demonstration. (T-2)
       A4.2.2.2. On the second AHC IP certification sortie, the upgrading instructor will brief,
       fly, and instruct all maneuvers. (T-2)
A4.3. AHC IP Currency. Certified AHC IPs must accomplish an AHC sortie every 90 days.
AHC maneuvers flown over 2 or 3 sorties may be combined to log an AHC sortie when all
required events are complete. To regain currency, the AHC IP must fly an AHC profile with an
AHC-current AHC IP. (T-2) AHC IPs who exceed 180 days from their last AHC sortie will be
decertified. To be recertified, AHC IPs will accomplish the Preflight Review IAW paragraph
A4.5 and fly two AHC sorties with a qualified AHC IP (one refamiliarization/training sortie and
an AHC certification sortie.) (T-2)
A4.4. AHC Sortie Overview. AHC sorties will only be flown with an AHC IP. These sorties
are designed to allow the IP or PIT student to observe and practice AHC maneuvers to ensure an
understanding of the aircraft’s capabilities and characteristics during each maneuver performed.
(T-2)
A4.5. Preflight Review. Prior to the sortie, the pilot will review Section III and VI of the T-6A
flight manual; AFMAN 11-248; and AFI 11-2T-6, Volumes 1 and 3; to include: (T-2)
   A4.5.1. OCF entry procedures and restrictions. (T-2)
   A4.5.2. OCF recovery procedures. (T-2)
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     41


   A4.5.3. Stability demonstration procedures, characteristics, and engine limitations. (T-2)
   A4.5.4. Stall characteristics and restrictions. (T-2)
   A4.5.5. Weather conditions and restrictions for stalls, spins, and ELPs. (T-2)
   A4.5.6. AHC ELP profiles. (T-2)
A4.6. Preflight Briefing. The preflight briefing should include objectives of the flight, details
and sequence of each maneuver to be accomplished, and an explanation of the expected results in
each of the maneuvers.
A4.7. Sortie Profile:
   A4.7.1. Restrictions and Requirements:
       A4.7.1.1. No more than two aircraft total (one in the tower controlled pattern at
       Randolph AFB PIT and 479FTG, NAS Pensacola) are allowed in the pattern during AHC
       operations. (T-2)
       A4.7.1.2. Only AHC sorties will be in the pattern when an aircraft is conducting AHC
       maneuvers. (T-2)
       A4.7.1.3. Only AHC maneuvers will be conducted during AHC pattern times. (T-2)
       A4.7.1.4. ELPs must be flown in a runway supervisory unit (RSU)-controlled pattern.
       (T-2) Additionally, an AHC controller must be the active controller. (T-2) (Exception:
       Randolph AFB PIT may conduct AHC maneuvers in the tower controlled pattern as long
       as the supervisor of flying [SOF] monitors pattern operations, and no other aircraft
       monitored by the SOF are airborne in the local area. AHC ELPs flown in the Randolph
       AFB tower controlled pattern will be flown under the supervision of a tower controller
       and SOF who have received an orientation on T-6 AHC ELP operations. (T-2) This
       orientation will be given by the runway supervisory unit training and standardization
       officer, runway supervisory unit training officer, or the SOF program manager and will
       cover basic AHC ELP operations as well as the SOF/tower controller’s role in making
       safety-of-flight radio calls (i.e., “go around,” “discontinue”). 479FTG will conduct AHC
       pattern operations in the Pensacola NAS tower-controlled pattern. 479FTG/CC will
       ensure USN tower controllers receive an orientation briefing on T-6 AHC pattern
       operations. This orientation will cover AHC ELP pattern operations, with specific
       guidance on the tower controller’s role in making safety-of-flight radio calls (“go
       around/wave-off”, “discontinue”, etc.) (T-2)
       A4.7.1.5. Opposite-direction and crossing or parallel runway landings will not be
       attempted. In zone B, assess the energy level of both approach end and departure base
       keys, then intercept a normal inside downwind ground track. In addition, crews will not
       practice takeoff emergencies below 500 feet AGL. (T-2)
       A4.7.1.6. Crews will use On profile, Runway in sight, and safely Maneuver to land 3-2-
       1 (ORM 3-2-1) gate heights as minimum altitudes. (T-2) At 300 feet AGL (3), the crew
       should determine whether to continue or not. No later than 200 feet AGL (2), the crew
       will confirm the gear down. At no less than 100 feet AGL (1), the aircraft will be on
       center line (or alternate sides for reduced runway separation) for landing. (T-2)

     A4.7.1.7. Following an initial torque reduction, the pilot flying (PF) will set the PCL to 4
     to 6-percent torque or direct the pilot not flying (PNF) to set 4- to 6-percent torque.
     Torque will be fine tuned to 4 to 6 percent by the PNF only after the ELP has been
     approved and the PF directs, “set torque.” Once 4- to 6-percent torque is set, the PNF will
     respond with “torque is set,” informing the PF that no further adjustment will be made by
     the PNF. (T-2)
     A4.7.1.8. Crews will lower the gear normally and then announce on the intercom,
     “simulate emergency gear handle pull.” The emergency gear handle will not be activated
     unless it is required in an actual emergency. (T-2)
     A4.7.1.9. ELPs will not be attempted from zones A or G or from other areas not defined.
     479FTG-assigned pilots are not required to perform AHC ELP training from Zones C &
     D at NAS Pensacola. (T-2)
     A4.7.1.10. Crews will refer to MAJCOM and local guidance for pattern deconfliction
     rules and radio calls. (T-2)
  A4.7.2. Best Rate-of-Climb Takeoff (Optional). This maneuver demonstrates the T-6A
  best rate of climb. Perform this maneuver according to Section II of the T-6A flight manual.
  Rotate to 15 degrees nose high after liftoff and accelerate to the best rate-of-climb speed of
  140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), using normal procedures until reaching 5,000 feet mean
  sea level or as directed locally.
  A4.7.3. Slow Flight (Torque Demonstration). The purpose of the slow flight profile is to
  demonstrate the effects of torque on the aircraft while operating in the very slow flight
  regime. Start by accomplishing pre-stall, spin, and aerobatic checks. Then, at a safe altitude,
  slow the aircraft below 150 KIAS and configure with landing gear down and landing flaps.
  Continue reducing airspeed to approximately 80 KIAS (about 15 units of AOA), while
  setting approximately 45-percent torque. Note that the stick shaker may be on throughout the
  demonstration. Accomplish the following procedures:
     A4.7.3.1. Straight and Level. This slow flight maneuver demonstrates operating the
     aircraft on the back side of the power curve. Pilots must understand that increased AOA
     will result in increased drag and a stall if not carefully flown. Note the pitch attitude,
     torque, and rudder deflection required to maintain straight-and-level flight. This is the
     picture a pilot should see at rotation during takeoff or just prior to touchdown during
     landing.
     A4.7.3.2. Control Effectiveness. Rapid control inputs, especially in the flare, often do
     not give the aircraft sufficient time to respond to the inputs. While moving the ailerons
     with small, rapid movements, notice that even though the ailerons are moving, the
     controls have little effect on changing the heading or bank of the aircraft during slow
     flight. In slow flight, less airflow over the control surfaces requires smooth, positive
     inputs to effectively control the aircraft.
     A4.7.3.3. Torque. The T-6A has an initial tendency to pitch up, yaw, and roll left if the
     pilot does not maintain positive control during full power takeoffs, go-arounds, missed
     approaches, and the go portion of touch-and-gos. To demonstrate this, quickly increase
     power to MAX from straight-and-level coordinated slow flight and let go of the controls.
     Note that the nose tracks up, yaws, and rolls left approaching a stall. Recover from the
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                          43


     buffet prior to the stall. Reestablish slow flight and increase power to MAX again. This
     time, hold the proper takeoff pitch and apply a coordinated rudder to maintain a proper
     nose track. Emphasize that positive control of the aircraft will allow a safe takeoff, touch-
     and-go landing, or go-around.
  A4.7.4. Stability Demonstration. The purpose of the stability demonstration is to show that
  the aircraft will not spin if it is not stalled (even though there is yaw induced by torque). It
  also shows the effect of different torque settings on the aircraft in this flight regime.
  Accomplish the following procedures:
     A4.7.4.1. Idle. Accelerate to 160 KIAS and set 60 percent torque. Increase the pitch
     smoothly to 45 degrees nose high. Allow the airspeed to decay, using back stick pressure
     to maintain 45 degrees pitch and ailerons to maintain wings level. Apply enough rudder
     inputs for coordinated flight. Passing 80 KIAS (or at first stick shaker), select idle power
     and position the stick and rudder to neutral. Note that there is some nose track to the left
     as the nose smoothly falls through the horizon. The aircraft will not stall as long as
     neutral stick is maintained. When the nose is well below the horizon, recover from the
     dive. Use power as required when the engine parameters (for example, oil pressure) are
     confirmed within limits and stable.
     A4.7.4.2. Sixty Percent Torque. Accelerate to 160 KIAS and set 60 percent torque.
     Increase the pitch smoothly to 45 degrees nose high while using coordinated rudder.
     Allow the airspeed to decay, using back stick pressure to maintain 45 degrees pitch and
     ailerons to maintain wings level. Apply enough rudder inputs for coordinated flight.
     Passing 80 KIAS (or at first stick shaker), position the stick and rudder to neutral. Note
     that the nose falls and the aircraft smoothly rolls significantly to the left. When the nose
     is well below the horizon, recover from the dive. Use power as required when the engine
     parameters (oil pressure) are confirmed within limits and stable.
  A4.7.5. Stall Series. The stall portion of the AHC sortie demonstrates T-6A handling
  characteristics while stalled with different configurations and power settings. Perform AHC
  stalls above 6,000 feet AGL, complete the pre-stalling, spinning, and aerobatic checklists,
  and clear the working area prior to starting. Accomplish the following procedures:
     A4.7.5.1. Power-On Stalls. In a wings level stall with idle power, typically the right
     wing will drop first at the point of stall. With higher power settings (greater than or equal
     to 60 percent) in the same situation, the effect of torque will typically cause the aircraft to
     roll left as it stalls. Gear position has little effect on stall characteristics, but extending the
     flaps (which lowers stall speeds) aggravates the roll off tendency (slightly right with
     power off, left with high power settings) at stall. Enter the stall setup near 140 KIAS and
     raise the nose approximately 30 degrees. Increase back stick pressure as required to
     maintain this attitude until past the stick shaker and into the stall (loss of control
     effectiveness). Emphasis during the AHC sortie is on recognizing torque effect vs. stall
     recognition and recovery. Recover the aircraft by relaxing back stick pressure and using
     power, ailerons, and rudder as required. Power-on stalls require only relaxing back stick
     pressure to allow the nose to decrease to approximately 2 degrees nose high. Looking
     straight ahead and feeling the aircraft response is the most effective technique to
     determine pitch attitude and rudder requirements. Perform power-on stalls with the
     configuration, torque, and bank angle shown in Table A4.1.

       A4.7.5.2. Full Aft Stick Stall:
           A4.7.5.2.1. The aft stick stall demonstrates that the aircraft can be fully stalled
           without a nose drop, and requires a composite cross-check to determine a stalled
           condition. Accelerate to 140 KIAS and raise the nose to approximately 30 degrees
           nose high. Then set approximately 30-percent torque. Use back stick pressure,
           ailerons, and coordinated rudder to maintain level flight until reaching full aft stick.
           Note that the stick shaker is activated, AOA is at maximum (beyond 18 units),
           airspeed is 80 to 110 KIAS, and vertical speed indicator (VSI) indicates a 1,500 to
           4,000 feet per minute descent. Note how much effort it takes, using rudder and
           ailerons, to maintain wings level and that the pitch attitude remains at or near the
           horizon with no nose drop. Be aware that aggressive control inputs while in a deep
           stall may result in a pilot-induced oscillation and post-stall gyrations.
           A4.7.5.2.2. Recover the aircraft by relaxing back stick pressure and using power as
           required. Use right rudder pressure as required to center the ball through the
           acceleration and recovery. Recovery is immediate with very little decrease in pitch.
           To confirm recovery, check that the AOA is below 18 units; the altimeter has stopped
           decreasing; and VSI has reversed.
    A4.7.6. Spin Series. The spin portion of the AHC sortie demonstrates the characteristics of
    a spin and the effect of recovery controls. Because an unplanned departure from controlled
    flight can be quite abrupt and unnerving for most pilots, IPs must be familiar with aircraft
    departure characteristics and recovery procedures in order to properly teach them to students.
    Recovery from an inadvertent loss of control (including post-stall gyrations, incipient spins,
    steady-state spins, inverted spins, and spirals) can be accomplished by promptly reducing
    power to idle and positively neutralizing the flight controls in all axes. Patience and the
    maintenance of controls (including visual verification of control positions) are vital because
    the dynamics of any aircraft departure may prevent an immediate response of the aircraft to
    control inputs. Pilots will enter AHC spins with power at idle and pitch approximately 15 to
    40 degrees nose high. The following spins will be accomplished during this portion of the
    sortie: (Warning: During AHC spin training, do not exceed four 360-degree turns from the
    application of rudder at spin entry until recovery controls are applied.)
       A4.7.6.1. Neutral Controls (OCF) Recovery. This maneuver demonstrates spin
       parameters and the standard recovery technique used when the aircraft departs controlled
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      45


      flight. The IP will point out the AOA (full deflection 18+ units), airspeed (120 to 135
      KIAS), and turn rate. Normally, an OCF recovery is initiated immediately when an out-
      of-control condition is recognized, typically within a turn or two. For purposes of this
      demonstration, however, the recovery will be delayed for at least two turns in order to
      look at the spin characteristics and show that the procedure remains effective.
      A4.7.6.2. Controls-Free Recovery. This maneuver demonstrates the inherently stable
      characteristics of the aircraft. Trim the aircraft pitch into the green band before entering
      this spin. Once the aircraft has entered a normal erect spin, ensure the PCL is in idle and
      release all controls (including the rudder). The nose-down pitch angle and spin rate will
      increase, and the control stick will move slowly forward and in the direction of the spin.
      The stick will be forward of the pilot’s knee and leaning in the direction of the spin with
      an accelerated turn rate when it pops out of the spin in a nose-low attitude. Take the
      controls immediately and recover from the ensuing dive.
      A4.7.6.3. Erect Spin Recovery (Simulator Only). This maneuver demonstrates fully-
      developed spin characteristics and the ability to rapidly recover from a spin by applying
      anti-spin control inputs. The IP will point out the AOA (full deflection 18+ units),
      airspeed (120 to 135 KIAS), and turn rate. The turn needle will be deflected in the
      direction of spin. For purposes of this demonstration, the recovery will be delayed for at
      least six turns in order to observe spin characteristics and demonstrate spin recovery
      using anti-spin control inputs. Erect spin recovery is prompt after recovery controls are
      applied. In all cases, as the control stick is moved forward and rudder is applied opposite
      to the direction of turn needle deflection, the pitch attitude will steepen and spin rate will
      initially increase. Approximately 50 pounds of push force will be required to move the
      control stick well forward of the neutral position. Avoid excessive forward stick input, as
      it will result in a steeper nose-low attitude and possibly negative G. Spin rotation will
      abruptly cease with the aircraft in a steep nose-down attitude within one and one-half
      turns after applying controls. Controls should be neutralized and a smooth pullout
      initiated to stop the loss of altitude and prevent airspeed from building excessively.
      Apply the following erect spin recovery steps after six turns:
1. Gear, flaps, and speed brake - Retracted
2. PCL - IDLE
3. Rudder - Full opposite to turn needle deflection
4. Control stick - Forward of neutral with ailerons neutral
5. Smoothly recover to level flight after spin rotation stops
NOTE: This maneuver will only be flown in the OFT, and will be included in the pre-AHC
simulator profile (normally in conjunction with TI (or during ENJJPT PIT) as directed in
paragraph 4.6.1.). If follow-on (10-18month) AHC sorties are flown in the OFT, the erect
spin recovery demonstration will be included in the simulator profile. (T-2)
      A4.7.6.4. Spiral Recognition and Recovery (Simulator Only). The high-speed spiral
      is characterized by a nose low attitude, high roll rates and rapidly increasing airspeed. A
      spiral is a rolling and/or yawing motion of the aircraft that is often mistaken for a spin,
      but is not steady-state in that airspeed is increasing through 160 KIAS and motions are
      oscillatory. A spiral can result from misapplication of pro-spin controls (insufficient
      rudder or aft stick), typically seen during an improper set-up for a planned OCF
      maneuver. A spiral may easily be confused with a spin if the pilot relies solely on the
46                                                          AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


     interpretation of outside references and fails to accomplish a proper analysis of the
     cockpit flight instruments. Should the pilot misinterpret a high-speed spiral as a spin, it is
     highly unlikely that anti-spin inputs will affect a successful recovery, and will likely
     aggravate the condition. The cockpit indications differ significantly from those of a
     steady state, erect spin. The aircraft is not stalled; therefore, AOA will not be pegged as
     in an erect spin. Airspeed will most likely be rapidly building through 140 KIAS. The
     rate of descent will exceed that of a steady state spin because of the high airspeeds
     ultimately attained through this flight regime. The turn needle will, however, be fully
     deflected in the direction of the roll. The key to a safe recovery lies in the expeditious
     recognition of the aircraft’s actual flight condition. For this demonstration, set up a
     typical OCF entry using IDLE power, 15-40 degrees nose high. At 80 knots, apply full
     aft stick and ½ rudder input (not full) in the direction of desired spiral. Maintain these
     control inputs and observe both outside and cockpit indications (AOA, turn needle,
     airspeed). Slowly relax the stick forward following two turns and observe roll rate and
     airspeed increase. As airspeed passes 160 KIAS, neutralize the controls using OCF
     recovery procedures and recover to level flight. NOTE: This maneuver will only be
     flown in the OFT, and will be included in the pre-AHC simulator profile (normally
     in conjunction with TI (or during ENJJPT PIT) as directed in paragraph 4.6.1). If
     follow-on (10-18month) AHC sorties are flown in the OFT, the spiral recognition
     and recovery demonstration will be included in the simulator profile. (T-2)
  A4.7.7. ELP Series - General. Pilots flying a single-engine airplane must be aware of the
  aircraft’s engine-out capabilities. While ELPs are practiced in VMC, situations may arise
  where a pilot must be aware of different methods for recovering an engine-out T-6A through
  a cloud deck. In addition, a T-6A pilot instructing primary students may expect to spend a
  significant amount of time in the traffic pattern. An engine failure in the pattern requires
  quick thinking and instinctive reactions to optimize chances of a successful recovery. Both of
  these situations require a familiarity with ELPs. (For purposes of the AHC sortie, an ELP is
  defined as one that does not pass through high key.) This series is designed to demonstrate
  the engine-out profiles for weather penetration and techniques for engine failure in the
  standard pilot training pattern. The AHC sortie will consist of a high-speed ELP, straight-in
  ELP, and pattern ELPs from zones B, C, D, E, and F (Figure A4.1). (T-2) Additional ELPs
  may be attempted, fuel and pattern saturation permitting. Note: If weather prevents
  accomplishment of the high-speed ELP and/or straight-in ELP during an AHC sortie, these
  maneuvers will be accomplished in the simulator. (T-2)
  A4.7.8. Weather Penetration ELP Series. Generally, there are three methods for
  recovering an engine-out T-6A through the weather. In all cases, the pilot must set a
  minimum acceptable weather to attempt the ELP. Whether a pilot will actually attempt an
  engine-out weather penetration will depend on the reported weather, his or her proficiency,
  familiarity with the airfield, obstructions, and minimum altitudes. For the following weather
  penetration ELPs, the pilot will simulate ceiling and visibility at 2,000 feet and 3 miles
  according to recommended minimum weather restrictions in AFMAN 11-248.
     A4.7.8.1. Classic ELP. The first method is to fly a classic ELP from high key using the
     global positioning system (GPS) for situational awareness as described in AFMAN 11-
     248. This method is just like a normal ELP practiced every day and will not be flown on
     the AHC sortie.
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    47


     A4.7.8.2. High-Speed ELP. The high-speed ELP assumes there is sufficient energy to
     reach a high-key position. More energy is better. Excess energy will be converted into
     airspeed, which can be used to maneuver the aircraft to a low-key position when breaking
     out of the weather. For the AHC sortie, obtain approval to depart the military operating
     area, contact the RSU, and set up a 125-KIAS clean glide toward the intended field. For
     high-speed ELP training, the start point should be a locally developed point
     approximately 5 to 15 miles from the over-field point. Using either a navigational aid on
     the field or a GPS point as the overfield point, plan to intercept a one-to-one profile
     (1,000 feet of altitude loss for every mile traveled) and be over that point at 1,500 feet
     AGL. The aircraft will accelerate as the nose is pushed over to maintain profile. If
     intercepting the profile far enough away, the aircraft speed will stabilize at approximately
     230 KIAS. Once below 2,000 feet AGL, maneuver to intercept the ELP profile at a
     modified low key. Perform a touch-and-go or low approach as appropriate.
     A4.7.8.3. Straight-In ELP. A straight-in ELP is flown if energy is not sufficient to fly a
     classic or high-speed ELP. This is typically a last resort because (1) there is little room
     for error, and (2) wind effects weigh heavily on the planned profile. From outside
     downwind, continue out to 5 miles from the runway threshold and climb to 3,000 feet
     AGL. (Exception: When flown in the Randolph AFB tower controlled pattern, straight-
     in ELPs will be modified to remain within Randolph AFB class D airspace.) After
     receiving clearance from the RSU (or tower at Randolph), establish a 125-KIAS clean
     glide at 5 miles and 3,000 feet AGL, and monitor the profile. The target is to cross 1 mile
     at 600 to 800 feet AGL configured with gear and flaps as required. If the aircraft is
     maintaining a 2-to-1 profile, it would reach 1 mile at 1,000 feet AGL in a clean
     configuration. Therefore, if you are still on or near profile at 1.5 miles (approximately
     1,250 feet AGL), configure with gear and flaps as appropriate to reach the target 600 to
     800 feet AGL at 1 mile. Perform a touch-and-go or low approach as appropriate.
  A4.7.9. Pattern ELP Series (Figure A4 1): (Note: Figure A4.1 depicts the pattern ELP
  zones used in a nominal pattern. Pilots may alter the profile and ground track as mission
  needs dictate.)
     A4.7.9.1. Overview. The typical US Air Force pilot training pattern can be divided into
     zones that define how the pilot should react to an imminent engine failure and where the
     pilot should attempt to intercept the ELP profile. The ELP series allows the pilot to see
     the worst case energy limitations of different pattern positions. Because pattern sizes vary
     from field to field, each IP must be aware that results may vary. Most, but not all, areas of
     the standard pattern are defined in paragraphs A4.7.9.2 through A4.7.9.8. (Areas not
     covered, but worthy of discussion, are the straight-in ground track, breakout and VFR
     entry, and go-around.) The defined zones assume a single runway and no wind. Crossing
     or parallel runways on an airfield provide numerous other possibilities for recovery. In
     most pattern ELP scenarios, pilots should:
         A4.7.9.1.1. Simultaneously zoom the aircraft and turn toward the intended landing
         surface.
         A4.7.9.1.2. Establish 125-KIAS clean glide and intercept the ELP at the appropriate
         point.
         A4.7.9.1.3. Configure with gear and flaps as appropriate when landing is assured.
48                                                          AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


     A4.7.9.2. Zone A, Ejection Zone. This zone is defined as the departure leg, past the
     point where an airplane can be landed straight ahead, until reaching approximately 1,000
     feet AGL and 160 KIAS or until turning crosswind. If an immediate engine failure is
     experienced in this zone, the only option may be ejection. No simulated engine failures
     will be practiced in the aircraft in this zone.
     A4.7.9.3. Zone B, Crosswind Zone. This zone is defined as departure leg at
     approximately 1,000 feet AGL and 160 KIAS or anywhere on crosswind until completing
     the turn onto outside downwind. On the AHC sortie, simulate an engine failure on
     crosswind. The reaction should be to simultaneously zoom and turn back to assess the
     energy level for a glide to a low-key (landing runway) or an opposite-direction landing.
     After making the energy assessment, discontinue the maneuver by adding power and
     proceed to inside downwind for a normal pattern, or high downwind or high key for an
     ELP. For any pattern where the crosswind turn is initiated at departure end, there may be
     sufficient energy to reach a modified low-key position for the normal landing direction.
     A4.7.9.4. Zone C, Low Key or Base Key Zone. This zone is defined as most of outside
     downwind. On the AHC sortie, simulate an engine failure on outside downwind and
     attempt to intercept a low key or base key. The reaction should be to simultaneously
     zoom and turn toward low or base key. An engine failure just after turning onto outside
     downwind will be slightly low on energy, which may necessitate using less than the full
     runway. The energy state improves along outside downwind until passing abeam the
     approach end of the runway. Passing this point, the energy level starts to decrease until
     reaching zone D. Headwinds or gusts exceeding 15 knots may significantly reduce the
     ability to intercept Low Key or Base Key.
     A4.7.9.5. Zone D, Final Zone. This zone is defined as the latter part of outside
     downwind and the 90-to-initial ground track. On the AHC sortie, simulate an engine
     failure in this zone. In this zone, because of the distance from the runway, the turn back
     to the runway is vitally important. The reaction should be to simultaneously zoom and
     start an aggressive turn back to the runway. If you are already on a 90-to-initial, most of
     the turn is out of the way. Therefore, the turn to the runway need not be as aggressive. In
     all cases, the attempted result is to intercept final. Depending on pattern size and winds, it
     may not be possible to get back to the runway from this far corner of the pattern.
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    49


Figure A4.1. An Example of Pattern ELP Zones.




      A4.7.9.6. Zone E, No Zoom Zone. This zone is defined as a 45-to-initial through a 1-
      mile initial point. On the AHC sortie, simulate an engine failure in this zone. This zone is
50                                                         AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


     distinctly different than the rest of the pattern because the energy level is too low to
     intercept a low-key position but too high to intercept base key or final. The best technique
     in this zone is not to zoom but to maneuver the aircraft in level flight to dissipate excess
     energy and intercept base key or final. From 45-to-initial, either delay the turn or
     overshoot final or turn toward a low-key position as necessary, then back to the runway.
     From an initial, an immediate 45-to-90-degree level turn from the runway is required,
     then turn back to intercept base or final. From approximately a 1-mile initial, a 2G- to
     3G-level 360-degree turn will dissipate enough energy to position the aircraft on final.
     A4.7.9.7. Zone F, Low Key Zone. This zone is defined as 1-mile out on initial through
     the break until reaching the approach end of the runway on inside downwind configured.
     If carrying straight through the break point, this zone continues until intercepting zone C
     on the turn to outside downwind. On the AHC sortie, simulate an engine failure in this
     zone. The reaction should be to zoom (airspeed permitting) and turn toward a low-key
     position. The energy level is sufficient through most of this zone for a near normal low
     key. After turning crosswind on a break point straight through, the energy level will start
     to decrease. This might necessitate using less than the full runway.
     A4.7.9.8. Zone G, Second Ejection Zone. This zone is defined as inside downwind
     past the approach end of the runway through most of the final turn. If an engine failure
     occurs once slowed down and configured in this zone, there will probably not be
     sufficient energy to make the runway, which will necessitate an ejection. No simulated
     engine failures will be practiced in the aircraft in this zone.
     A4.7.9.9. Zone H, Closed Pullup Zone. This zone is defined as the closed pullup for an
     overhead pattern or low-key ELP, until reaching inside downwind or high downwind. An
     engine failure in zone H at a low-energy state (e.g., closed pullup initiated at lower
     airspeed and/or lower altitude) will be similar to zone A, where the only option may be
     ejection. At increased energy levels past departure end of the runway, a turn back to land
     opposite direction may be possible but a 360-degree pattern to land will usually not be an
     option unless engine failure occurs at a very high energy level. If the closed pullup was
     initiated prior to the departure end of the runway and an engine failure occurs at higher
     energy levels in zone H, energy may be sufficient to execute a 360-degree turn back to a
     touchdown near or abeam where the closed pullup was initiated, which may necessitate
     using less than the full runway. The higher the energy is in zone H prior to engine failure,
     the greater the opportunity will be to maneuver toward the approach end of the runway
     before initiating a low-key turn. The highest energy levels in zone H near or at closed
     downwind or high downwind eventually result in intercepting zone F. No simulated
     engine failures will be practiced in the aircraft in this zone.
     A4.7.9.10. ELP Summary. Being able to land an engine-out, single-engine aircraft
     requires exceptional flying skills and airmanship. An engine failure while flying at low
     altitudes or in or above IMC further complicates an already difficult situation. Any
     combination of factors (weather, low altitude, strong winds, etc.) that task-saturate the
     situation, exceed the pilot's flying capabilities, or cause the pilot to feel he or she is
     unable to safely land an engine-out aircraft should lead to an aircrew ejection decision.
     However, planning for and practicing these challenging ELP conditions and situations (in
     the aircraft and OFT) will invariably increase the pilot's chances for a safe engine-out
     landing. The ELP series of the AHC sortie demonstrates some of the pilot techniques,

     aircraft capabilities, situational awareness, and judgment required for these challenging
     engine-out situations.

       2)    NOTE: ENJJPT IPs who complete PIT at Sheppard AFB are required to complete
       only those ground training requirements specified in paragraphs A5.1.1.1 and A5.1.1.7.
   A5.1.2. Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP program consists of two
   different kinds of sorties—BIP sorties and sponsor sorties—as follows:
       A5.1.2.1. BIP Sorties. BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the new IP. All BIP
       sorties will be flown with the assigned BIP, a flight unit stan/eval monitor (USEM), or
       any supervisor (assistant flight commander or above) in the new IP’s chain of command
       or sister squadron leadership if approved by the new IP’s SQ/CC. (T-2) The objective of
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      53


       these flights is to further develop the new IP’s flying proficiency and instructional
       techniques. On each BIP sortie, the BIP will discuss instructional techniques, planning
       profiles, student progress, grading practices, local flying policies, common student errors,
       and possible pitfalls the new IP should avoid. These sorties will be documented in the
       new IP’s BIP record. (T-2) At least one BIP sortie will be flown in each of the following
       categories of training:
          A5.1.2.1.1. Contact. (T-2)
          A5.1.2.1.2. Formation. (T-2)
          A5.1.2.1.3. Instrument and navigation (may be flown as an out and back). (T-2)
          A5.1.2.1.4. Low level (may be flown as one leg of the out and back). (T-2)
       A5.1.2.2. Sponsor Sorties. The BIP, a flight USEM, or any supervisor (assistant flight
       commander or above) in the new IP’s chain of command will fly sponsor sorties with the
       new IP’s students to ensure they are being taught proper techniques. (T-2) The new IP
       will fly a series of three sorties in each category of training (two for instruments, one for
       low level) with the same student, after which the BIP will fly with that student. (T-2)
       The BIP will provide feedback to the new IP (within 2 workdays) on instructional
       techniques and grading practices. (T-2) Sponsor sorties and debriefings will be
       documented in the new IP’s BIP training record. (T-2)
   A5.1.3. Initial Student Sorties. Before the new IP flies any pre-solo student sorties, he or
   she will complete a minimum of three sorties with a post-solo student (in any phase of
   training). (T-2) These sorties will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2)
   A5.1.4. Student Solo. Before the new IP solos his or her first student, someone in the BIP’s
   chain of command will fly one of the last four sorties before the student’s initial solo. (This
   sortie will not be the last sortie before the initial solo.) (T-2) This sortie will be documented
   in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2)
A5.2. BIP Short Program. The BIP short program will last approximately 1 to 3 months and is
designed for the new IP who has come from an MWS with previous instructor experience.
Before accomplishing any student sorties, the new IP will obtain a briefing from the squadron
commander on instructor responsibilities. (T-2) In the squadron commander’s absence, the
squadron DO will accomplish this briefing. (T-2)
   A5.2.1. Ground Training. New IPs will accomplish the same ground training requirements
   listed in the BIP long program (paragraph A5.1.1). (T-2)
   A5.2.2. Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP short program also consists
   of two different kinds of sorties—BIP sorties and sponsor sorties—as follows:
       A5.2.2.1. BIP Sorties. BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the new IP. All BIP
       sorties will be flown with the assigned BIP, flight USEM, or any supervisor (assistant
       flight commander or above) in the new IP's chain of command. The objective of these
       flights is to further develop the new IP's flying proficiency and instructional techniques.
       At least one BIP sortie will be flown. (T-2) It can be in any category of training (contact,
       instruments, formation, or navigation). On the BIP sortie, the BIP will discuss
       instructional techniques, planning profiles, student progress, grading practices, possible
 54                                                          AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014


      pitfalls the new IP should avoid, local flying policies, and common student errors.
      Document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP's BIP record. (T-2)
      A5.2.2.2. Sponsor Sorties. The BIP, flight USEM, or any supervisor (assistant flight
      commander or above) in the new IP's chain of command (or sister squadron leadership if
      approved by the new IP’s SQ/CC) will fly sponsor sorties with the new IP's students to
      ensure the students are being taught proper techniques. (T-2) At least one sponsor sortie
      will be flown (in any category of training) after the student has had sufficient exposure to
      be influenced by the new IP's techniques. Document all sorties and debriefings in the new
      IP's BIP record. (T-2)
   A5.2.3. Initial Student Sorties. Before the new IP flies any pre-solo student sorties, he or
   she will complete a minimum of three sorties with a post-solo student (in any phase of
   training). (T-2) These sorties will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2)
   A5.2.4. Student Solo. Before the new IP solos his or her first student, someone in the BIP’s
   chain of command (or sister squadron leadership if approved by the new IP’s SQ/CC) will fly
   one of the last four sorties before the student’s initial solo. (This sortie will not be the last
   sortie before the initial solo.) This sortie will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2)
A5.3. BIP Program Completion. After completion of all of the ground and flying training
events, the squadron commander will certify program completion. (T-2)
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    55

                                 PIT RE-BLUE PROGRAM

A6.1. Re-Blue Program. The purpose of the re-blue program is to increase the quality of PIT
instruction by giving PIT IPs the opportunity to interact and fly with undergraduate flying
training (UFT) student pilots and CSOs in all categories of flying and ground training
instruction. IP re-blue should be accomplished at the discretion of the squadron commander after
considering manning, programmed flying training, and other constraints. PIT IPs who have not
flown with a T-6A UFT student within the 2 years prior to PIT IP certification should spend a
week flying with UFT students within 6 months to 1 year of receiving their IP certification at
PIT. Additionally, all PIT IPs should spend a week flying with UFT students after instructing at
PIT for 3 years.
A6.2. PIT IP Responsibilities:
   A6.2.1. Contact the host squadron point of contact to determine additional requirements or
   documentation, if any. (T-2)
   A6.2.2. Be current in all requirements and training events prior to traveling to the UFT host
   squadron. (T-2)
   A6.2.3. Report to the host squadron DO for flight assignment. (T-2)
   A6.2.4. Sample as many different categories of flying and ground training as possible while
   at the host squadron. (T-2)
   A6.2.5. Bring back AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document,
   extracts and any documentation required to log events at the home station. (T-2)
A6.3. Host Squadron Responsibilities:
   A6.3.1. Utilize the PIT IP to the maximum extent possible after consulting with the PIT IP.
   The PIT IP should be treated and scheduled like any other line IP. Schedule the PIT IP for
   student sorties over ID sorties to maximize training objectives. (T-2)
   A6.3.2. Schedule at least one local familiarization sortie to acquaint the PIT IP with local
   procedures and pattern or area references. (T-2)
   A6.3.3. Attempt to fly the IP with students in all categories and varying proficiency levels so
   he or she can get an accurate picture of the UFT environment.

                                T-6 4-SHIP CERTIFICATION

A7.1. T-6 4-Ship Basic Wingman Certification. The 4-ship upgrade program is designed to
certify T-6 IPs to fly basic 3/4-ship formation for the purpose of supporting limited ceremonial
missions (e.g., funeral flyovers, etc). Squadron commanders will limit the number of IPs
certified in 4-ship formation to the minimum number required to support 4-ship taskings. (T-2).
Document T-6 4-ship formation certification on the Letter of Xs and AF Form 4348. (T-2). The
basic 4-ship pilot certification focuses on 4-ship fundamentals and basic maneuvering.
Ground/flight training for the basic 4-ship pilot certification will, at a minimum, consist of the
following:
   A7.1.1. Ground Training: Review AFI 11-2T-6V3, AFM 11-248, AFI 11-205, and unit-
   specific 4-ship SOPs & Briefing Guide. Receive a briefing from a T-6 4-ship Flight Lead-
   certified pilot, with emphasis on 4-ship emergencies, takeoff (element & instrument trail),
   spare aircraft procedures, airborne spare, split-up procedures, lost wingman, breakout,
   rejoins, echelon turns, crossunders, and lead change. (T-2)
   A7.1.2. Flying training: Fly 2 dedicated 4-ship sorties. The upgrading IP may fly from
   either front or rear cockpit, in any formation position (#1,2,3 or 4) with a 4-ship qualified
   pilot. Attempt to fly all 4 positions in the formation, but maximize training in the #2 and #4
   positions. Both sorties will focus on wing work, crossunders, pitchout/rejoins, lead change
   procedures, and recovery procedures. Recover via initial, weather permitting. (T-2)
   A7.1.3. Currency. 4-ship basic certified IPs will fly in a 4-ship sortie every 180 days to
   maintain currency. (T-2) 4-ship basic formation currency is gained by performing wing work,
   crossunders, pitchout/rejoins, and recovery procedures via initial (weather permitting). If
   currency is lost, the non-current 4-ship basic formation IP must fly and demonstrate
   proficiency with a current 4-ship basic IP in the maneuvers described in this paragraph. (T-
   3)
   A7.1.4. Squadron commanders may tailor the 4-ship basic certification profile based on the
   prior experience level of the upgradee (e.g., former fighter or T-38 IPs may only require 1
   sortie). Squadron commanders will certify 4-ship pilots by signing the AF Form 4348 in the
   IP’s training folder. (T-2) Use locally-generated upgrade training documentation to track
   upgradee’s progress.       Maintain this documentation in the IP’s training folder until
   certification via the AF Form 4348 is complete. (T-2)
A7.2. T-6 4-Ship Flight Lead Certification. Squadron commanders will certify only the most
highly experienced IPs as 4-ship Flight Leads. (T-2) Upgrading 4-ship flight leads must be
currently 4-ship basic certified. (T-2) IPs flying in the #3 position of a 4-ship formation must be
4-ship flight lead certified. (T-2) Ground/flight training for the 4-Ship Flight Lead Certification
will, at a minimum, consist of the following:
   A7.2.1. Ground Training: Review/discuss with a current T-6 4-Ship Flight Lead: Off-
   station/cross-country 4-ship considerations, Flyover 4-ship considerations, 4-ship briefing
   techniques, 4-ship emergencies, takeoff (element & instrument trail), spare aircraft
   procedures, airborne spare, split-up procedures, lost wingman, breakout, rejoins, echelon
   turns, crossunders, lead change, and recovery procedures. (T-2)
AFI11-2T-6V1 9 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    57


  A7.2.2. Flying Training: Fly 2 dedicated 4-ship sorties as lead from either front or rear
  cockpit. (T-2) A maximum of 2 IPs may upgrade to flight lead within the same formation
  (flying as #1 and #3). Brief & debrief at least one of the two sorties. (T-2) Upgrading flight
  lead will demonstrate proficiency in safely executing a 4-ship launch, area work, and
  recovery. (T-2) Typical upgrade profile should include element or interval takeoff,
  departure, area work, and recovery. Area work should include wing work, crossunders,
  echelon turns, pitchout/rejoins, and lead change(s). Recover via initial, weather permitting.
  A7.2.3. Currency. 4-ship flight lead certified IPs will lead a 4-ship formation every 180
  days to maintain currency. (T-2) 4-ship flight lead formation currency is gained by
  performing wing work, crossunders, pitchout/rejoins, and recovery procedures via initial
  (weather/traffic permitting). If currency is lost, the non-current 4-ship lead certified IP must
  fly and demonstrate proficiency with a current 4-ship flight lead IP in the maneuvers
  described in this paragraph. (T-3)
  A7.2.4. Squadron commanders may tailor the 4-ship flight lead certification profile based on
  the prior experience level of the upgradee (e.g., former fighter or T-38 IPs may only require 1
  sortie). Squadron commanders will certify 4-ship flight leads by signing the AF Form 4348
  in the IP’s training folder. Use locally-generated upgrade training documentation to track
  upgradee’s progress.       Maintain this documentation in the IP’s training folder until
  certification via the AF Form 4348 is complete. (T-2)
