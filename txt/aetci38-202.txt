                                               Chapter 2

     UNDERSTANDING MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING

2.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of commonly used tools in managing
training resources, basics of standards development related to training, an overview of the pricing cycle,
information to aid in understanding instructor authorizations, and some unique terms.

2.2. Tools and Reports:

2.2.1. World Wide Web. Numerous sites exist to aid in understanding technical training from AF
instructions to course offerings. The HQ AETC home page has a division page for HQ AETC/XPM. Under
the division page there are several section pages; among those is one for HQ AETC/XPMRT whose focus is
related to manpower for training.

2.2.2. HQ AETC/XPMRT Homepage. Primary repository of data and programs related to manpower for
training. Contains databases, programs, and examples, training modules, news memorandums,
announcements, and frequently asked questions. All personnel associated with training are encouraged to
become     familiar    with   and    monitor    updates     to    this   site.    The     address   is:
https://www.aetc.af.mil/xp/xpm/xpmr/xpmrt/xpmrt_index.html.

2.2.3. Manpower Data System (MDS). A database program that contains UMD related information such as
position numbers, effective dates, Air Force specialty code (AFSC), organizational structure code (OSC),
and Personnel Accounting System (PAS). Each HQ/XPM and MO office will have a point of contact (POC).

2.2.4. Unit Manpower Document (UMD). A database displaying unit authorization information extracted
from the MDS. A computerized program will provide this information and can be used to make specific
inquiries on various fields of data. HQ AETC/XPM and MO offices can be requested to make UMD queries.

2.2.5. Training Planning System (TPS). A database that contains training related information such as
active courses, course length, instructor hours, student entries, and special remarks. HQ AETC/XPMRT is
the POC for this system within the manpower community.

2.2.6. Manpower Standards File Register (FR). A report of data that displays information such as course
parameters, pricing data, certification dates, and remarks. HQ AETC/XPMRT is the POC for this file.

2.2.7. Root Basic Authorization (BA) Register. A report of data that displays the AFSC types, ranks, and
percentage of distribution earned by each pricing course. HQ AETC/XPMRT is the POC for this file.

2.2.8. Programmed Technical Training (PTT) Requirements Register (RR). A report that displays
course identification number, PAS, OSC, and reflects the number of instructors priced for the course. HQ
AETC/XPMRT is the POC for this file.

2.2.9. Training Requester Quota Identifier (TRQI) Report. A report that shows the projected schedule of
students for each course and depicts the users such as Air Force, Army, Navy, or international students. HQ
AETC/XPMRT is the POC for this report.
AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                            9

2.2.10. HQ AETC/XPMRT Work Center Database. This database is available on the HQ AETC/XPMRT
homepage. It has two main data focuses--current data and the pricing snapshot. This program utilizes MDS
and TPS data. Courses can be viewed with several extracts of data such as TPS parameters, BA, UMD
authorizations, and associated courses. Individual course price-outs for new or updated courses may also be
accomplished with this program.

2.2.11. AETC Manpower Pricing System (AMPS). A program utilized by HQ AETC/XPMRT that applies
course parameters and schedules to determine instructor requirements. Also used during pricing cycle to
interface with MDS to build a project work file (PWF) to support instructor requirements.

2.3. Terms. Refer to Attachment 1 for other acronyms or terms related to technical training.

2.3.1. Offset. A manpower resource used to fund another requirement. Utilization of offsets is validated by
HQ AETC/XPMRT and approved by HQ AETC/DOO or HQ AETC/SGAE for medical training. A course
being developed or an active course having revisions may impact manpower. Costs must be funded/offset
from some source (base, requesting command, HQ AETC, HQ USAF). Savings generated by course
parameter changes or by courses deactivating become offsets.

2.3.2. Types of Authorizations:

2.3.2.1. Overhead, Support or Course Support. Authorizations or work centers established to provide
management or assistance that supports the training mission. Normally these authorizations or work centers
are established in accordance with AFMS.

2.3.2.2. Instructor or “T” Prefix Authorizations. These are authorizations that accomplish instruction.
Their primary duty is to conduct training. Normally a “T” prefix will not be loaded in an overhead or
support area. An exception to this is developmental (DEV) coded authorizations. Any “T” requirement in a
nonpodium area must be fully justified and approved by the TPM on a case-by-case basis.

2.3.2.3. Developmental (DEV) Codes. Tracking code assigned by HQ AETC/XPMRT to authorizations on
the UMD assigned to the training development element (TDE). Indicates the authorization is being utilized
to develop a specific course. Also see chapter 5.

2.3.2.4. Military Training Leader (MTL). Noninstructor authorizations that assist trainees in military
related functions. Calculations for MTLs are based on their standard.

2.3.3. Training Type Designator. There are several training course types, for example, type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6. This is a designation in the second character of the course number that identifies the course. For a full
description of course types and how to decipher a course number refer to AETCI 36-2203.

2.3.4. Special Courses. These courses are associated with other courses, primarily used in relationship to
managing manpower or student scheduling such as: mother, piggyback, feeder, common, Prerequisite,
supported-by, and interservice courses. See paragraph 2.6 for a detailed explanation of these courses.

2.3.5. Interservice Training Review Organization (ITRO). Involves more than one branch of the military
or DoD agency. A committee representing each service’s interests monitors training used by more than one
branch of service. See paragraph 2.7 for information on ITRO courses.
10                                                                   AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001

2.3.6. Course Identification Number. The training manager creates the course number and HQ
AETC/DOO assigns the dash number. It provides information such as base responsible for course, level of
training, and Air Force specialty code (AFSC). For complete description on course identification number see
AETCI 36-2203.

2.3.7. Queued Courses. A validated course that is not activated due to unavailability of resources. Such
courses will not be activated until offsets become available. HQ AETC/XPMRT maintains a log of the
queued courses.

2.3.8. Student Man-Year (SMY). Manpower resources used to compensate for lost duty time for pipeline
and permanent change of station (PCS) course students due to training, and are part of the AF end strength.
HQ USAF/XP is the central control for SMYs. The HQ AETC/XPMRT focus is the SMY impact of
technical training courses. Also see chapter 3.

2.3.9. Programmatic. Changes made to instructor authorizations that are automatically funded. These
usually occur during annual pricing and are a result of changes to the student entries from the previous fiscal
year (FY) pricing.

2.3.10. Types of Manning:

2.3.10.1. Straight-Line Manning. Straight-lining is a temporary measure that freezes the resources of a
pricing course, to prevent loss of resources due to unforeseen circumstances. Requests must be justified by
the base and approved jointly by HQ AETC/XPMRT and HQ AETC/DOO or SGA.

2.3.10.2. Block Manning. Instructor requirements will be fixed, based on justified and approved manning
levels. A block-manned course will not price, and instructor requirements will not change.

2.3.10.3. Minimum Manning. A pricing course whose variable manpower has been changed to minimum
manpower. A minimum manned course may price higher or lower than the minimum level; however, earned
instructor requirements will not fall below the minimum established level. Justification for minimum
manning includes the need for multiple instructor requirements (MIR), security, or safety.

2.3.10.4. Compute and Adds. An authorization that is added over what the course earns, and requires
justification.

2.4. Allocation of Resources for Training:

2.4.1. Overhead and support authorizations are allocated based on Air Force approved manpower standards
and variances. These standards are managed and maintained IAW AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower
Requirements.

2.4.2. Technical training courses:

2.4.2.1. Instructor allocations and SMYs are allocated to AETC for courses during each pricing and remain
committed to that course until changes in course parameters or student entries cause changes in earned
instructor authorizations or SMY.
AETCI38-202         19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                         11

2.4.2.2. Instructors are earned based on course parameters in the CTP and official total student entries
identified by the Training Flow Management Conference (TFMC). The CTP allows for both direct and
indirect academic requirements such as classroom preparation, additional duties, supervision, and podium
time. Also see chapter 3.

2.4.2.3. Course requirements are normally priced at least once a year. See paragraph 2.5.

2.4.2.4. Resource impacts to support technical training that occur outside of pricing must be funded through
command assets, base offsets, Air Staff, or requested from other commands/services. Courses will not be
activated until resources are obligated.

2.4.2.5. HQ USAF/XP determines accessions required for each FY. Changes to active courses driven by
these accessions are programmatic.

2.4.2.6. Authorizations for training are AETC assets, utilized at command discretion. A base may request
reutilization of offsets; however, HQ AETC/DOO/SGAE has final approval authority. EXCEPTION: A
command may provide authorizations to support a short-term course. Assets return to command control
when the course is discontinued. These must be correctly coded and coordinated with HQ
AETC/DOO/SGAE, and HQ AETC/XPMRT. A command may also provide the authorizations to start a
course. However, once the interim period is complete and the course is continued, the authorizations become
AETC assets.

2.4.2.7. Variances or additives to the instructor requirement are occasionally approved for unique or unusual
requirements. They must be fully justified to include supporting data that documents work beyond the CTP
for the course. These require a work-study by the local MO and are validated by HQ AETC/XPMRT and
approved by HQ AETC/DOO/SGAE.

2.4.3. Education:

2.4.3.1. Authorizations to support education and other training related activities such as Air University, 2
AF, Basic Military Training School (BMTS), Defense Language Institute, English Language Center
(DLIELC), and Inter-American Armed Forces Academy (IAAFA), are also managed by HQ
AETC/XPMRT.

2.4.3.2. Allocations for education are not affected by technical training’s pricing. Reference paragraph 2.5.

2.4.3.3. HQ AETC MAJCOM functional manager (MFM) approves AFSC or rank changes. These must be
adequately justified and funded. Also see chapter 5 for ACR information.

2.5. Pricing Cycle:

2.5.1. Pricing refers to recalculation of earned instructor authorizations for all active pricing courses based
on scheduled entries. The TFMC typically kicks off the pricing effort. However, pricing may not begin until
months after the conference is complete. See Figure 2.1 for TFMC/Pricing Timeline.
12                                                                         AETCI38-202         19 OCTOBER 2001

PRICING RESULTS ARE FINAL
NOTE: HQ does final review of courses queued for resources. Additional CTPs from the base may be requested.
This is the only exception to the training plan cut off date.


2.5.2. A snapshot of official entries (students) becomes the scheduled entries of a course for pricing. These
entries are locked-in and used for recalculating manpower requirements of a course until the next pricing
cycle.

2.5.3. HQ AETC/XPMRT will release notification to the MOs on the CTP/Annex deadlines when the dates
for the TFMC conference and pricing are established.

2.6. Understanding Course Manpower Design:

2.6.1. Fixed Cost. All pricing courses have a fixed cost associated with them in the instructor equation.

2.6.2. Shared Resources. Some courses have common curriculum associated with them. When fixed costs
are shared between courses (instead of duplicating) this is called shared resources. Some terms used to
manage shared resources are: mother, piggyback, feeder, common, and prerequisite courses.

2.6.3. Mother and Piggyback Courses:

2.6.3.1. A piggyback course shares curriculum (has blocks in common) with the mother course (see Figure
2.2). Normally the mother course earns instructors; it earns manpower using the combined student schedules
from the mother and applicable piggyback courses. See chapter 3 for more information on determining
instructors.
AETCI38-202            19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                             13

Figure 2.2. Sharing Hours Between Mother and Piggyback Courses.

    150 course hours
    30 TPR

                            Piggyback     A                                                          120 hrs

    150 common hrs
    40 TPR

Piggyback course A attends 4 blocks of the mother course (shares 120 course hours). Piggyback course B attends 5
blocks of the mother course (shares 150 course hours). Courses A & B attend the mother course because the course
curriculum is identical for the blocks attended.

The associations screen in TPS for the mother course should show the 120 and 150 hours from the piggyback
courses. The mother’s association screen will always match the piggyback common hours.

The mother course prices with the sum of the mother and piggyback TPR (based on average daily student load
[ADSL]). Piggyback courses do not price for the common hour portion.

2.6.3.2. A course manpower price-out is submitted for both mother and piggyback courses, outlining the
course parameters to be entered into the manpower standard’s file.

2.6.3.3. Manpower will draw a diagonal line through the price-out impact and add the statement
“piggybacked on (course number).” The group sizes and shift group limit are those of the basic course.

2.6.4. Feeder Courses. Feeder courses have schedules that feed into another course, normally “common
courses”. They do not earn instructors; however, they do have SMY costs (see Figure 2.3).
14                                                                              AETCI38-202           19 OCTOBER 2001

Figure 2.3. Feeder Courses.


  Course A

  Course B

  Course D


     = TPS flow

     = Student flow

From the perspective of TPS flow (which manpower uses) the student entries are loaded against the follow-on courses
(B, C, D). This schedule is pulled into course A. In this view courses B, C, and D are feeder courses.

From the perspective of student flow (which training managers [TMs] use) the students go to Course A first and then to
a follow-on course (B, C, D). In this view Course A would be a feeder course.

2.6.5. Common Courses. These courses have no schedules of their own, they price from schedules fed from
feeder courses. They are established by manpower for pricing purposes and have a “T” or “U” in the fourth
position of the course ID number (see Figure 2.4).

Figure 2.4. Common Courses.


         Common     Class
Crs A (ABR)    80 hrs                  160 hrs                         240 crs hrs (60 TPR)

Crs B (ABR)           80 hrs         80 hrs                            160 crs hrs (30 TPR)

Crs C (ABR)           80 hrs          120 hrs                         200 crs hrs (10 TPR)

Crs D (ATR)                                                             80 class hrs (100 TPR)

Courses A, B, and C all have course hours. They also have blocks of instruction that are identical to each other
(common hours).

Course D is the common hours of courses A, B, and C.

Courses A, B, and C price using their own class hours and entries. Course D prices using the common hours (80) and
sum of the entries of course A, B, and C.

For scheduling purposes the TM are only concerned with the three main courses (A, B, and C). These are Air Force
catalog listed courses.

2.6.6. Prerequisite Courses. These courses must be attended before entering the basic three-level AFSC
awarding course. Prerequisite courses have a “Q” in the fourth position of the course identification number
(see Figure 2.5).
AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                          15

Note that AQR courses may also have common hours (ATR course).
Note that an AQR course may be follow-on to another AQR course.

2.6.7. “Supported By” Courses. Courses that can be conducted between classes or in conjunction with
another course are identified as a “supported by” course.

2.6.7.1. Instructors of another course within the family group (FG) conduct these courses.

2.6.7.2. A complete manpower annex is submitted for review and approval. However, a diagonal line is
drawn through the price-out impact and the statement “supported by the family grouping” is added.

2.7. Interservice Training. Interservice training is defined as two or more military services training together
in an institutional setting (a formal school vice a joint training exercise conducted by operational
commands).

2.7.1. Interservice Training Review Organization (ITRO) Courses. The ITRO is an organization of the
military services, established to eliminate training redundancy between the services. Services voluntarily
agree to train together via the ITRO. The ITRO Deputy Executive Board (DEB) approves all ITRO
recommendations to train together. The ITRO Steering Committee, consisting of representatives from the
military services and the Coast Guard, coordinates the day-to-day activities of the ITRO. There are two
types of ITRO courses: consolidated and collocated.

2.7.1.1. Consolidated courses have curriculum that is developed through agreement by all the participating
services and managed by the host or lead service. For example, each of the services needs training for basic
weather fundamentals. Each service will provide a fair share of instructors based on that service’s
percentage of the total planned student input.

2.7.1.2. Collocated courses are managed and conducted by one service, while sharing another service’s
facilities/equipment. An example would be a course the Air Force (owning service) teaches at a naval station
using Navy equipment and facilities. Instructor requirements will be computed using each service’s own
computation procedure.
16                                                                   AETCI38-202         19 OCTOBER 2001


2.7.2. Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agency (EA) Courses. Interservice training is mandated
by a DoD agency, which assigns an EA, or lead service/agency. As with ITRO consolidated courses, each
service will provide a fair share of instructors based on that service’s percentage of the total planned student
input.

2.7.3. Quota Courses. Quota course curriculum and seats belong to a host service, which allots seats to
other services. NOTE: If a quota course begins to have a large portion of seats allocated (and used) by other
services, it should be reviewed as a candidate for consolidation. See ITRO Procedures Manual.

2.7.4. Type 3 or Type 5 Courses. Interservice courses may be either type 3 or type 5. Type 3 courses are
Air Force courses; type 5 courses are another service’s or DoD agency courses.

2.7.4.1. Type 3 Courses. These will be ITRO consolidated or collocated, DOD or quota. HQ AETC
manpower will bill other services annually for their share of instructors.

2.7.4.2. Type 5 Courses. The host/lead service annually bills the Air Force for instructors, if appropriate.

2.7.5. When an interservice CTP is submitted, the base MO must identify the course as DOD, consolidated,
collocated, or quota. See chapter 3 for an explanation on equation.

2.7.6. For more information on ITRO courses and their management, see AFI 36-2230(I), Interservice
Training and the Interservice Training Review Organization Procedures Manual (dated 22 Oct 98—obtained
from HQ AETC/DOJ).
AETCI38-202         19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                                       17

                                                       Chapter 3

                           COMPUTATION AND FORMULA INFORMATION

3.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide information on the construction and calculations
related to: manpower annex, standard course formulas (models), washbacks, student man-years, and basic
authorizations (BA). Some information is also supplied related to pricing interservice training courses.
NOTE: Changes to the CTP parameters that cause an increase in manpower (SMY/instructors), must
identify offsets before the course is activated. Reference AETCI 36-2203.

3.2. Manpower Annex:

3.2.1. Basic understanding of the areas included in the annex will assist technicians in processing training
plans, ACRs, and variances. The formula for calculating instructors is provided; however, use of automated
programs or spreadsheets is preferred to manual calculation to reduce occurrence of errors.

3.2.2. Technical training course man-hours and workload, as in any other manpower standard, falls into two
categories: direct and indirect. Direct man-hours are attributed to performance of the mission (teaching
students). Indirect man-hours are spent in support of performance of the mission (other than teaching
students).

3.2.2.1. Direct hours are the classroom and/or laboratory hours required by the plan of instruction to train
students to a specified level. See Attachment 2 for a detailed description of direct hours. Document training
hours sequentially by day or unit of instruction on the AETC Form 896, Lock Step/Multitrack Course
Evaluation Data, for all courses requiring multiple instructors (Chapter 4). Each hour or grouping of hours
requiring more than one instructor is documented separately and justified in the course evaluation data sheet
(CEDS). The total classroom or laboratory instructor hours then become academic instructor hours per group
for the course length, and are converted to monthly academic instructor hours.

3.2.2.2. Indirect hours provide support for the course, group, student, shift, and instructor (see Figure 3.1).
See Attachment 2 for a detailed description of indirect hours. Standard indirect man-hours required to
perform these tasks were obtained by operational audit and approved by HQ USAF (see Attachment 3).

Figure 3.1. Indirect Hours.

Indirect man-hours for a technical training course are divided into 5 support categories. Each category is composed of various
related tasks.

COURSE: Course materials, publications, forms, tests, training aids, equipment, awards, distribution, meetings, budget, and
training evaluation.

GROUP: Classroom preparation, tutoring, re-testing, student records, orientation, scheduling, test analysis, and graduation.

STUDENT: Student record initiation, counseling, student board meeting, review/grade student assignments, student evaluation,
and washback/elimination action.

SHIFT: Janitorial detail supervision, instructor meetings, security checks, coordinates maintenance, reviews publications,
correspondence, and supplies.

INSTRUCTOR: Course qualification, lesson plans, AFSC upgrades, proficiency temporary duty (TDY) instructor ratings,
orientation, awards, and schedule.
18                                                                             AETCI38-202            19 OCTOBER 2001


3.3. Standard Course Formulas (Models):

3.3.1. Type 1 Courses. Instructor and SMY calculations are not done for type 1 courses. These are
contractor courses whose costs are calculated through channels outside of HQ AETC/XPMRT.

3.3.2. Type 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Courses. These courses have various models that are used to identify
manpower requirements. Although courses have some common factors, each course has variations in course
length and AFSC requirements. Essentially each course is a single point standard for manpower. Reference
Attachment 4 for course price-out sheets of each type course (except type 2).

3.3.3. Type 3 Courses. Type 3 training is the more common Air Force specialty (AFS)-centered training of
a continuing nature conducted at an AETC base, location, or station. It includes basic, lateral, advanced, and
supplemental courses.

3.3.3.1. The basic manpower model used is for the type 3 courses. It consists of a mathematical equation that
quantifies the relationship between instructor manpower requirements, and the programmed variable
workload (group and student load). This equation is of the general multivariate form: Y = a + b1 (G) + b2
(L). Reference Attachment 3 for a definition of variables and a thorough understanding of technical training
model development.

3.3.3.2. Formula calculations are automatically determined when parameters are input into TPS.

3.3.3.3. Calculations for type 3 courses are summarized on a course price out and CEDS. See Attachment 4.

3.3.4. Type 2 and 4 Courses:

3.3.4.1. Type 2 courses are considered special training and are a one-time or limited nature. They normally
do not have any manpower associated with them and do not price. Most type 2 courses are supported by the
family group and do not need a BA loaded.

3.3.4.2. Type 4 courses are special or regular onsite training conducted by mobile training teams (MTT) or
field training teams (FTT).

3.3.4.3. The development of a detailed standard (similar to type 3 formula) would be a costly and time-
consuming method in relation to course duration and number of students trained. See Figure 3.2 for a typical
computation of type 4 courses. Calculations for type 4 courses are summarized on a Course Manpower
Annex (see Attachment 4).

Figure 3.2. Type 4 Course Computations.

Step                                                       Action
 1     A factor of 2.51 instructor authorizations per group is used for Type 4 courses. This factor was established by
       joint agreement between HQ AETC/XPMRT and HQ AETC/DOO based on existing factors for type 3 courses,
       and allowing for factory training, travel, new course preparation, and sporadic class frequency.
 2     Group data is computed by the formula:

       Groups = (Annual student entries required) X (Course length in weeks)
            (49.2 academic weeks per year) / (Programmed group size)
AETCI38-202         19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                              19

Step                                                     Action
       This group data is computed for each special training course.
 3     Multiply applicable group factor from step 1 by the computed groups from step 2. This yields fractional
       instructor manpower for each course, which is rounded up to the next whole number.
 4     The BA for the course determines grade and skill distribution.

3.3.4.4. Type 4 course price outs will include (as a minimum) the following information:

3.3.4.4.1. Course title and number.

3.3.4.4.2. Organizational data (OSC, PAS, functional address code [FAC]—if known or FAC area).

3.3.4.4.3. Course parameters (course length, shift group limit, programmed group size).

3.3.4.4.4. Annual student entries.

3.3.4.4.5. Manpower impact from the calculations in Figure 3.2.

3.3.4.4.6. Other. Also indicate if the course supports another course, is supported by, or piggybacked on
another course/family group.

3.3.5. Type 5 Courses. These are usually interservice courses hosted/managed by other services or DoD
agencies; for example, the Army, Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard with Air Force students in attendance.
NOTE: Not all type 5 courses are interservice or hosted/managed by other services. There are type 5
courses, which are owned by other AF agencies, and other services do not attend. For example, Phase II of
many medical training is done at AF hospitals and are numbered as J5AZO****.

3.3.5.1. The Type 5 Course Manpower Annex is used for tracking SMYs and inputs are summarized on a
Course Manpower Annex in Attachment 4.

3.3.5.2. With the exception of some medical courses, HQ AETC/XPMRT is sent an instructor bill from the
host services on an annual basis. These instructors are then added to the UMD under the respective course
number.

3.3.6. Type 6 Courses. Type 6 courses are job site training (JST). JST is technical training delivered to
students at their base of assignment without an AETC instructor physically present. Reference terms or
AETCI 36-2208.

3.3.6.1. The manpower documents required, at a minimum, are a type 6 manpower baseline data and pricing
record. Calculations for type 6 courses are summarized on a course manpower baseline data and pricing
record. See Attachment 4.

3.3.6.2. When manpower resources are associated with type 6 courses, a FAC and OSC is assigned (fourth
digit of OSC will be “V”; for example, UEAV), and are always block-manned.

3.3.7. Interservice courses have their own formula and requirements, refer to paragraph 3.9. Calculations for
interservice courses are summarized on an ITRO Pricing Record. See Attachment 4.

3.4. Development of a New Course Standard:
20                                                                             AETCI38-202           19 OCTOBER 2001


3.4.1. HQ AETC/XPMRT work center database has been developed to derive the command Bi and
classroom/lab instructor hours when new type 3 courses with no historical experience and/or insufficient
course control documents are available.

3.4.2. To manually calculate the Bi and classroom/lab instructor hours see Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3. Command Bi and Classroom/Lab Instructor Hours Calculations.

Step                                                        Action
1      Determine the type of course, i.e., initial or supplemental, officer or enlisted, and if course requires MIRs.
2      Use the criteria in step 1 and the current command pricing records of like courses, sum and average the
       classroom/lab instructor hours. This average becomes the classroom/lab instructor hours for the new course.
3      Take the figure from step 2 and multiply it by the course length in days. Divide this figure by 20.91 to
       determine the monthly classroom/lab instructor hours (or the Bi).

3.4.3. New course manpower standards based on command average Bi will be approved for 1 year only and
managed as interim courses. After that time, a new annex based on course operation experience is required.

3.4.4. Determine parameters such as group sizes and shift group limit, in coordination with the training
manager and submit justification on the CEDS.

3.5. Washback:

3.5.1. Students who are held back or restarted in a course due to academic or physical reasons are tracked as
washbacks. Washbacks impact the number of students in a course and are reflected on the course price out.

3.5.2. Program group size (PGS) may be adjusted to account for recurring washback rates. The registrar
tracks actual washbacks via the Training Course Status Report. MOs will submit a copy of the Training
Course Status Report page that reflects the data used in the washback computation.

3.5.3. The washback computation sheet will be formatted to include the date completed, course number,
actual graduates, advancements, eliminations, washbacks experienced, and the computations. This is a
manpower document and should be filled out by the local MO with input from the TM. See Attachment 5.

3.6. Aggregation:

3.6.1. Aggregation occurs in a FG during pricing only. Courses with like AFSC or area of instruction are
grouped together as a family. FG is controlled by OSC and PAS. A course will be assigned an OSC relative
to other courses in the same AFSC unless it is geographically separated or justification is provided in the
CTP as to why it shouldn’t be family grouped. FG assists in resource sharing (aggregation).

3.6.2. Aggregation is done by comparing the total instructors earned based on the FG total fractional
manpower versus the total of instructors earned for each course. See Attachment 6.

3.6.3. Regardless of whether a course is family grouped, when it is initially submitted, it stands alone. It
must identify offsets/resources as the pricing sheet indicates. Aggregation is only applied during the next
pricing cycle.
AETCI38-202          19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                       21

3.7. Student Man-Year (SMY):

3.7.1. Manpower resources used to compensate for lost duty time for pipeline or PCS course students due to
training, and are part of the AF end strength, are called student man-years (SMY). SMY are equivalent to
“average daily student load (ADSL).” Student and trainee manpower must be programmed to account for the
fact that personnel in formal school training are not available for duty with operational units. All of these
personnel must be paid, housed, and supported. SMY tracking has been established to accomplish this goal.

3.7.2. Personnel undergoing individual training while on temporary duty from their unit of assignment of
less than 100 days and students between courses are not included in SMY calculations for courses.
EXCEPTION: Students trained while enroute to new stations.

3.7.3. Use the formula in Figure 3.2 to compute SMY while students are in a technical training course.

Figure 3.4. Student Man-Year Equation.

SMY for technical training courses:

        *student entries x course length days = SMY
          246 training days

SMY for interservice training courses:

        *student entries x course length days = SMY
         250 training days

* Student entries used for SMY must be the official amount as approved by 2AF and/or the ITRO committee.



3.7.4. Training requester quota identifier (TRQI) codes are assigned by the Air Force Personnel Center
(AFPC). HQ AETC/XPMRT uses TRQI codes to assist in tracking SMYs. Figure 3.5 identifies the TRQI
codes commonly used to calculate pipeline SMY.

Figure 3.5. TRQI Codes Used for SMY.

      Training Requester Quota Identifier (TRQI) Codes Commonly Used by Manpower for SMY Calculations

                   AJ1K *Prior service enlisted
                   AJ10  *Non-prior service (NPS) basic courses (pipeline)
                   AJ20  *Military training – BMT/OTS
                   AJ30  *Follow-on training (pipeline)
                   AJ40  *Follow-on training-able programs

3.8. Root Basic Authorizations (BA):
22                                                                    AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001

3.8.1. Every course that prices must have a BA. A course that is piggyback or supported by will not have a
BA. The BA determines by percentages the grade and AFSC that a course will receive for the number of
instructors it earns. It also determines unique requirements such as set costs, compute and adds, and
subtractives.

3.8.2. When a course is developed, the requirements for the BA are also determined and should be included
in the CTP. The BA identifies the percentages needed for each rank and AFSC, plus general information
such as the course identification number, the OSC, PAS, and FAC.

3.8.3. The majority of courses have no special requirements for their BA and thus use a standard BA format
based on the AFSC the course instructs, and whether the training is initial skill or supplemental. These are
required grades; authorized grades may differ based on availability of grade resources. NOTE: Civilian
grades and AFSCs are equivalent.

3.8.3.1. Initial skills-enlisted (ABP, ABR, ALR, AQP, AQR, ATP, ATR) PEC end in ”D.” Rank percentages
are:

3.8.3.1.1. MSgt (7 skill level) – 4 percent.

3.8.3.1.2. TSgt (7 skill level) – 8 percent.

3.8.3.1.3. SSgt (5 skill level) – 44 percent.

3.8.3.1.4. SrA (5 skill level) – 44 percent.

3.8.3.2. Advanced/supplemental courses-enlisted (AAR, ACP, ACR, ADL, AGL, AIR, ART, ASR, AST,
AUR, AZP, AZR, AZT) PEC end in “E”. Rank percentages are:

3.8.3.2.1. MSgt (7 skill level) – 16 percent.

3.8.3.2.2. TSgt (7 skill level) – 44 percent.

3.8.3.2.3. SSgt (5 skill level) – 40 percent.

3.8.3.3. Officer courses (all course types). Rank percentages are:

3.8.3.3.1. Captain – 60 percent.

3.8.3.3.2. Lieutenant – 40 percent.

3.8.4. Nonstandard BAs must be identified and justified as exceptions to the standard format. These are for
courses that have actions outside the parameters of a standard BA such as: civilian authorizations, different
percentages, set costs, AFSC different from the course being taught, compute and adds, certain grades
required, a mix of grades and/or AFSC, and subtractives for civilian reductions or special circumstances.

3.8.4.1. Set cost refers to a specific authorization that is required for a course before any percentage
calculations are done. All civilian entries on a BA are coded as set cost. Set costs can also be established for
ranks and AFSCs.
AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                           23


3.8.4.2. Compute and adds are done when an additional authorization is given to a course above what they
earn based on normal course models. Very few courses justify compute and adds.

3.8.4.3. Subtractives are done when an authorization that is earned based on normal course models is not
allowed. These are usually associated with an AF directed reduction in civilians.

3.8.5. Computing BAs (see Attachment 7):

3.8.5.1. Set costs must be earned. For example, if a course earned 3 authorizations but had a set cost of 4 it
would not receive 4 authorizations; it would receive 3 (you cannot receive more authorizations than you
earn). Note that this holds true for civilian authorizations too, and may result in adverse impact for courses
that are manned totally with civilian instructors when the set cost isn’t earned.

3.8.5.2. A new or revised course must show the distribution of only the earned amount of set cost on the BA
submitted with the CTP (you cannot have a set cost on the BA that is not earned).

3.9. Interservice Course Manning:

3.9.1. Instructors earned for ITRO courses are priced by the host/lead service as determined by the ITRO
Deputy Executive Board. This section refers to ITRO courses owned by the Air Force.

3.9.2. Interservice courses managed by the Air Force, regardless of any Air Force TPR, will have a CTP
developed, validated, certified, and activated similar to other AF courses of the same type (for example, type
3 or type 4).

3.9.2.1. Base MO representative (coster) will receive approval from HQ AETC/XPMRT prior to committing
resources.

3.9.2.2. Prior to activation of course, HQ AETC/XPMRT will attain HQ AETC/DOJ concurrence that the
ITRO DEB has approved the course for consolidation or revision.

3.9.3. The equation used for calculating instructors is slightly different. Refer to AFI 36-2230(I) for
guidance.

3.9.4. The rounding rules for converting fractional instructors to earned instructors is also different (use the
table provided in the ITRO Procedures Manual).

3.9.5. Calculating SMY is also different. Training days for interservice courses is 250.

3.9.6. Methodology to price ITRO courses differs from that used to price other technical training courses.
Consolidated is ITRO priced. Collocated is priced using AF technical training (TT) standard model. Quota is
ITRO priced if they have other services attending; however, if no instructor bill results for the other services
it is repriced with the AF TT standard model.

3.10. Review of Course Manpower Standards:
24                                                                  AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001

3.10.1. Final Course Review. MO offices review each resident training course at 3-year intervals--
normally during the anniversary (month) of the DOO certification date in TPS.

3.10.2. Interim Course Review. Interim course review is completed after 3 classes have run or at the 1 year
anniversary of the CTPs certification. Interim course review dates are loaded for only one year.

3.10.3. During Reviews. During these reviews, the MO office should contact the TM for curriculum
currency. If different course parameters or MIR exist, the course requires an evaluation, which will consist
of validation through observation (sampling) of portions of a block of instruction, and an interview of course
personnel.

3.10.3.1. Reporting-No Change. If upon review it is determined that course parameters have not changed,
the base MO will send a memorandum to HQ AETC/XPMRT stating the course number, date of review, and
the statement: “This course has been reviewed with the course manager or responsible official. No changes
in multiple instructor requirements, group sizes, or course parameters were identified.”

3.10.3.2. Reporting-Undergoing Revision. If the course is undergoing revision or a new training plan is
being developed, the base MO will send a memorandum to HQ AETC/XPMRT stating the course number,
the statement: “Course is undergoing revision,” and the estimated date for submission of revision.
AETCI38-202       19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                        25

   MANPOWER ANNEX/COURSE TRAINING PLAN (CTP) CERTIFICATION PROCESS

4.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to focus on manpower documentation and processes related to
the CTPs. Information addressing nonmanpower related facets of the CTP certification process are covered
in AETCI 36-2203.

4.2. Course Training Plans (CTP):

4.2.1. Abbreviated CTP. A partial CTP for minor revisions is outlined in AETCI 36-2203. An Abbreviated
CTP supplements the most current certified CTP for the course.

4.2.2. CTP. These are submitted for a new course or for one course that is superseding/replacing another
course.

4.2.3. Draft Manpower Annex. These are submitted for a new course with known resources, however at the
time of submission, the resources are not available to activate the course. When HQ AETC/XPMRT has
validated the draft annex, they will send a memorandum to the TPM requesting approval to use/fund
resources. If approved, HQ AETC/DOO and SGA will request a final CTP from the base. If not approved,
HQ AETC/XPMRT will place the draft annex into a queued log awaiting resources.

4.2.4. Course Resource Estimates (CRE). A CRE is the initial vehicle to seek resource funding in support
of the training process. A CRE is developed by the TM and is intended to be an accurate estimate, but not in
finite detail. See AETCI 36-2203 for CRE requirements. HQ AETC/XPMRT processes a CRE as a draft
annex.

4.3. Basic Manpower Documents for CTP Processing. Refer to Figure 4.1 for required documents.
Reference Attachment 4 for examples of the documents that are identified with an asterisk (*).
26                                                                            AETCI38-202             19 OCTOBER 2001

NOTES:
1. Cover memorandum for multiple course packages must reference all involved courses and the relationship between them (how
many offsets, where offsets are needed/spent, replacement courses etc). All cover memorandums should list the MO point of
contact (POC) for the course.

2. Course chart is not required in abbreviated CTP if there are no course hour changes. Draft annex may be processed without a
course chart, however, hours submitted on the course price out must match the course chart that is submitted in the final CTP.

3. Price out sheets should match course type:

        Type 3 price out sheet      Type 5 price out sheet
        Type 4 price out sheet      Type 6 price out sheet
        ITRO price out sheet        For type 3 or 4

 MO and school CC must sign price out sheets. Price out sheets may not be needed if manpower variables did not change.

4. CEDS may not be needed if manpower variables did not change. Type 5 CTP is not needed if course does not price, however,
training hours and days must be identified.

5. Required only when submitting washback computation sheet.

6. Must have memorandum from safety office if MIR hours are due to safety reason. Not needed for ITRO consolidated, as price
sheet should reflect MIRs. Not needed if interim course using Bi (reference chapter 3).

7. Courses without Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Memorandum will be processed but will be entered into TPS
without academic education level (AEL) codes. EXCEPTION: Not required for initial skill courses. For manpower purposes all
courses that are not initial skills are supplemental.

8. Applies to ITRO courses only.

block. Must match descriptive data on course evaluation data sheet. Data is listed on an AETC Form 896.
Diagrams illustrating MIRs may be required by HQ AETC/XPMRT when deemed necessary. Diagrams
should be included in the package if expedited processing of a CTP is desired.*

4.3.7. Minimum Manning (MM). Minimum manpower provided to ensure enough instructors are available
when a course cannot be family grouped, and the MIR cannot be eliminated. Specific justification must be
submitted for MM such as MIR, safety, or security. If based on safety, a memorandum from the wing safety
office must be included. If based on security, cite regulation. Refer to Attachment 4.

4.3.8. Safety Memorandum. Document signed by wing safety office justifying MM for a course.
References specific Air Force occupational safety and health (AFOSH) or technical order (TO)
requirement.*

4.3.9. Root Basic Authorization (BA). See chapter 3 for BA requirements.

4.3.9.1. New Course. The CEDS must state either “roll over BA” from replaced course; or “use standard
BA,” identifying specific AFSC, compute and adds, or set costs.

4.3.9.2. Revised Course. A copy of the most current BA showing changes needed to support CTP
requirements. Must match CEDS instructions.

4.3.10. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Memorandum. Establishes course as CCAF
certified. Courses without CCAF memorandum will be entered in database without AEL code.
EXCEPTION: Memorandum not required for initial skill courses. For manpower purposes all courses that
are not initial skills are supplemental/advanced.

4.3.11. Environmental Assessment Annex. Documentation of environmental impact analysis, on AF Form
813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, with results from the environmental impact analysis
process. See AETCI 36-2203.
28                                                                   AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001

4.3.12. Interservice Executive Order. This applies to ITRO courses only. Any change to an ITRO
consolidated course must be approved by all participating services. HQ AETC/DOJ will distribute an ITRO
executive order, advising the base and HQ AETC/XPMRT that the course consolidation, deconsolidation,
revision, or collocation has been approved by all parties and can be implemented.

4.4. Timely Submission of Annex or TP:

4.4.1. CTPs, abbreviated CTPs, and draft annexes normally have a 30-calendar day processing time within
HQ AETC/XPMRT. This timeframe allows 10 days for certification by the TPM.

4.4.2. CTPs should arrive simultaneously at HQ AETC/XPMRT and the TPM a minimum of 60 days prior
to class start.

4.4.3. HQ AETC/XPMRT activates or modifies courses in the database after certification by the TPM.

4.4.4. If CTPs (new/abbreviated) are to be included in the next pricing cycle, drafts must be submitted to HQ
AETC/XPMRT at least 60 calendar days prior to pricing. The base MO must submit the final CTP to HQ
AETC/XPMRT 30 calendar days prior to pricing.

4.4.5. If a CTP or annex does not meet the pricing deadline, the base will have to reprice the course price out
using the latest pricings’ official entries and resubmit to HQ AETC/XPMRT. This includes obtaining
signatures on the new course price out.

4.5. Manpower Steps in CTP/Annex Process Flow:

4.5.1. General information and CTP process flowcharts are delineated in AETCI 36-2203.

4.5.2. Once the decision is made to revise or establish a course, the training manager provides the wing MO
the related data to build the manpower annex.

4.5.3. The wing MO must research and validate all manpower data related to the CTP or draft.

4.5.4. The wing MO builds the manpower annex to include but not limited to: the course price out; course
evaluation data sheet; multiple instructor requirement; minimum manning request and; all diagrams, charts,
and work study paperwork necessary for determining manpower for the CTP.

4.6. Database Entries for Manpower. Prior to a new CTP being submitted (except draft annex) by the
base, several entries must be made in the manpower database (TPS).

4.6.1. Wing MO Responsibilities:

4.6.1.1. Ensure all course parameters are complete and match CTP being submitted.

4.6.1.2. Perform MO coordination.

4.6.2. HQ AETC/XPMRT Responsibilities:

4.6.2.1. Load all pertinent course data in TPS.
AETCI38-202       19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                         29


4.6.2.2. Perform final check of course parameters in TPS against CTP.

4.6.2.3. Perform HQ AETC/XPMRT coordination and course activation.

4.7. Manpower Annex:

4.7.1. The wing MO develops and furnishes the manpower annex. This requires a cooperative effort with the
training manager. Validation of data is necessary to make an accurate determination of the required
manpower resources.

4.7.2. The manpower annex consists of the course price out, CEDS, annotated basic authorization (for
nonstandard BA), washback computation sheet (if needed), and MIR worksheet (if needed). Complete
justification of minimum manning must be included (see paragraph 4.3.).

4.7.3. Additional information or diagrams may be requested to aid in the analysis of the manpower
requirement for the CTP or annex submitted.

4.7.4. Course support or maintenance activity (other than compute and adds) are requirements associated
with conducting training and are not submitted with a CTP. A workstudy package documenting these
manpower requirements must be submitted in a variance.

4.8. Resource-Oriented Information for CTPs:

4.8.1. Discontinued Courses. A course that has as no savings left or offsets to use; however if a course is
scheduled to discontinue it may be used to provide offsets for another course. A price out showing the
savings from the discontinued course must be included in the CTP package for evaluation. Reference
AETCI 26-2203 for discontinuing a course.

4.8.2. Multiple Course Package. Two or more courses submitted for concurrent evaluation (this must be
submitted at the same time). One or more courses providing offsets in either instructors or student man-years
for another course. All courses involved must be specified in the course price out justification and the MO
cover memorandum.

4.8.3. Resources From Pricing. A decrease in instructor authorizations due to pricing are not offsets.

4.8.4. Nonallowed time. Course hours not included in manpower calculations. Do not include nonallowed
time for manpower purposes from the course chart as described in AETCI 36-2203 when building the course
price out. Nonallowed time for manpower purposes includes: directed study hours, outprocessing
appointments, traffic safety education, commander’s call, graduate evaluation, professional military
education (PME), and ancillary training.

4.8.5. Supported By. A course that does not earn manpower or manpower resources are provided by
another course or family grouping (see chapter 2).

4.8.6. Rank and AFSC of Instructor. Other than standard BA, must be fully justified on CEDS (see
chapter 3).

4.9. Rounding Rules:

4.9.1. Course Days. A standard training day is eight hours. Total course hours are divided by the course day
(eight). Nonstandard training days must be justified and approved (see AETCI 36-2203). The course chart
identifies the number of nonstandard training days.

4.9.1.1. Air Force courses 20 days or less—any fraction over a whole number is rounded up.

4.9.1.2. Air Force course over 20 days—the last day must be greater than or equal to 5 hours (.625) to round
up.

4.9.1.3. Interservice courses—all fractions are rounded up.

4.9.2. Instructors Earned. Once fractional instructor manpower is calculated any fraction is rounded up to
the next whole number. Instructor rounding is done before determining manpower impact of a course. For
interservice courses refer to the ITRO instructor rounding chart in the ITRO Procedures Manual.

4.9.3. Student Man-Year/Average Daily Student Load. Any fraction in the tenths place 0.5 or higher is
rounded to next higher whole number, lower than 0.5 is rounded down. SMY/ADSL rounding is done before
determining impact of a course. Also see chapter 3.

4.9.4. Instructor and SMY Rounding for Multiple Course Packages. Manpower impact on multiple
course packages is accomplished after totaling individual courses, and then rounding.
AETCI38-202       19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                          31

                           UPDATING MANPOWER AUTHORIZATIONS

5.1. Changes on Training Authorizations:

5.1.1. This chapter only refers to authorizations managed by HQ AETC/XPMRT. There are additional
guidelines in the Manpower Data System (MDS) user manual.

5.1.2. Authorization change requests (ACRs) change data on the unit manpower document (UMD).

5.1.3. The MDS point of contact in the MO office can provide guidance on creating projects to change
authorizations.

5.2. General ACR Guidelines:

5.2.1. All ACRs for HQ AETC/XPMRT must be submitted via an MDS project.

5.2.2. The rationale for the change must be fully justified to include a summary of the desired change, the
reason for the change, and any impact on civilian authorizations.

5.2.3. ACRs affecting civilian positions must be coordinated through the servicing civilian personnel office
and state whether or not it is an adverse action.

5.2.4. The justification should include any MAJCOM functional manager (MFM) or DP office preapproval
and point of contact.

5.2.5. Security access requirement (SAR) codes must be coordinated through the base security office and a
statement to this effect must also be included in the project rationale. EXCEPTION: Vandenberg AFB
requests can be validated by the unit’s security manager.

5.2.6. HQ AETC/XPMRT processing time for ACRs is 30 calendar days from receipt. This includes a 10-
day processing time for the MFM coordination. Conflicts may occur as a result of an extension to the
processing time or the project being returned to the submitter.

5.2.7. ACRs involving more than one MFM must be approved by all. In the event a MFM disapproves an
action the project will not be processed. If the base and MFM are able to resolve the conflict the project may
be resubmitted.

5.2.8. Changes in rank must be within career progression group (CPG) limits or as approved by HQ
AETC/XPM and MFM on a case-by-case basis. “T” prefix authorizations for MSgt and below are
exceptions to the CPG limits.

5.2.9. Requested actions should be based on mission requirements and be fully justified.

5.2.10. Authorization (manpower) related actions should be based on mission requirements. Manpower
changes should not be personnel driven.
32                                                                AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001

5.2.11. ACRs impacting personnel actions such as AFSC changes or adding or deleting a position will be
loaded with an effective date of current quarter plus two quarters. EXCEPTION: Positions with a “T” prefix
in a course area, civilian positions, and those with special justification.

5.2.12. An ACR processed with special justification must be precoordinated through HQ AETC/DP. The
explanation for the “nonstandard” effective date must also be included in the project rationale.

5.2.13. Overhead/support authorization changes for AFSCs or grade are approved by the MFM and will
conform to the AFMS.

5.3. Instructor Authorizations:

5.3.1. An authorization change in a course area must also be accompanied by an annotated copy of the
course’s BA register page.

5.3.2. Most technical training instructor positions carry a “T” prefix indicating their primary duty as an
instructor.

5.3.3. Some authorizations carry a “K” and “J” prefix. These instructor positions are required to maintain
special flight qualifications.

5.3.4. Some instructors carry a special duty identifier, for example: 8T000 and 8B000, which eliminates the
need for a “T” prefix.

5.3.5. Instructors are coded under two primary program element code (PEC) suffixes (D or E). If the
instructor is not in a course area, advice from HQ AETC/XPMRT on the PEC assignment may be needed.

5.3.6. Instructor authorizations for courses are allocated based on certified training plans. Additional
information on obtaining instructors for new or changed courses is covered in chapters 3 and 4.

5.3.7. Training development element (TDE) authorizations are established based on Air Force standards.
The standards establish normal authorizations for training management; for example, career development
course (CDC) writing and course revisions. Development authorizations are variances to the standard and
are approved by the HQ AETC/DOO and SGA TPM. An authorization established to develop a new course
is loaded with an AFSC “T” prefix, and carries a command remarks code of DEVXXX (the actual number is
assigned by HQ AETC/XPMRT). The DEV code acts as an audit trail by associating the authorization with
the course being written (DEV coded positions will be justified annually.) The authorization then becomes
the course instructor (if earned) when the course is activated. Any DEV coded authorization that is not
utilized upon course activation is removed from the TDE.

5.4. Forms Prescribed. AETC Form 896.

5.5. Forms Adopted. AF Form 813, AF Form 1768, AFTO Form 22, and AETC Form 449.

type 6 formal technical training, exportable training, and distance learning. JST extends the training
capabilities of AETC courses to meet specific job and equipment training needs in place of resident training.
As with resident training, a type 6 course is based on a training standard, and has specific objectives that
students must achieve. JST media can take the form of computer-based (CD-ROM), interactive multimedia
instruction (IMI), interactive television (ITV), videotape; Internet based instruction (IBI), paper, or some
combination of these. The media used for a given course will be based on a media selection analysis. JST
must be scheduled, tracked, evaluated, and completion verified. JST does not include career development
courses or mobile training teams. Reference AETCI 36-2208.

Lock Step Instruction—see group paced.

Major Course Change—A change that affects course content and/or course length by 20 percent or more.

with a HQ AETC/XPMRT approved washback computation may calculate a program group size using the
maximum group size minus the washback rate from the washback computation. For courses in which the
group is subdivided or where a team concept is used, the multiple instructor requirements must be identified
in the manpower annex.

Minimum Group Size—The least number of students who can be trained and still satisfy course training
objectives; team instructional requirements; safety requirements; and/or the cost-effective use of resources,
such as impact on equipment, instructors, and energy. Except in unusual circumstances, the minimum class
size will be two or more. This group size will be used to determine whether or not to cancel a particular
class.

Minor Course Change—A change that does not significantly change course content and/or course length
by 20 percent or more. This change does not require a new course number.

course. Both the mother and the piggyback have the same curriculum. The piggyback would not earn
manpower (see common hours).

Multiple Instructor Requirement (MIR)—The total number of instructors required to teach a unit of
instruction to one instructional group, at a specific time during the course, based on equipment, safety, or

Pipeline Student—A student that is funded by the Air Force, not a MAJCOM. Usually for BMT and initial
skills.

Program Group Size—The number of students per group used to schedule (program) classes. The program
group size, which is the basis for manpower computations, will be the same as the maximum group size,
except when adjustments are required due to experienced washback and elimination rates. For new courses,
when no attrition or washback data is available, the washback rate will be determined from other family-
related courses. After 1 year, the course will be reviewed and the washback will be based on actual
AETCI38-202        19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                          39

washback and elimination rate experience. The program group size may be exceeded (to maximum group
size) to reduce pretechnical training students buildup (students in-processing and awaiting training).

Requirements Register—Extract that shows number of instructors earned for each course.

Self-Paced—Individuals move through the course at varying rates within parameters established during
validation and documented in the course chart (similar to group-paced except students move through the
course as individuals not dependent on group times). The hours listed in the course chart are averages the
typical student is expected to need.

Shift Group Limit—Maximum number of classes that can be taught in one shift, usually limited by
facilities or equipment.

Student Man-Year (SMY)—Manpower resources used to compensate for lost duty time due to training
(pipeline and PCS course students only). Centrally controlled by HQ USAF/XP.

Student Training Requirements (STR)—The total number of student requirements for a given course. For
initial skills courses this includes the trained personnel requirements (TPR) plus additional requirements to
compensate for attrition, plus all other requirements (National Guard, Reserves, other services). For
supplemental and advanced courses it is the total of all requirements for a course in a given fiscal year.

Subtractive—Removes an earned authorization from the UMD based on programmatic or directed
reductions. Will remain indefinitely or until funded.

Supported By—Referring to a course that doesn’t earn instructors on its own. Usually seen in family
grouping.

Supplemental Training—Non-AFSC awarding course. Usually accomplished to reinforce or enhance the
skills of an AFS.

Training Requestor Quota Identifier (TRQI)—A four-digit personnel code that identifies the user.

Trained Personnel Requirements (TPR)—The total Air Force production requirements for a given initial
skills course. It is expressed as nonprior service (NPS), prior service, retrainees, or a combination of two or
more types. It does not include Air National Guard, Reserves, or other services.

Unit Manpower Document (UMD)—A detailed manpower listing reflecting the distribution of manpower
allocations into a finite structure of authorizations (by work center).

Unit or Module of Instruction—A segment of instruction containing one or more closely related objectives
and the supporting instructional activities.

Variance—A condition that exists that either adds to or subtracts from the core workload, or impacts the
way work is performed. A variance can be either negative or positive.

           BASIC TECHNICAL TRAINING MANPOWER MODEL DEVELOPMENT

A3.1.Technical Training Model Development:

A3.1.1. One of the important aspects of developing manpower standards for type 3 technical training courses
is understanding the multivariate equation. This section portrays how the equation was developed. A
complete listing of symbols used throughout this section is contained in paragraph A3.2. Those who wish to
hit the high spots need only understand the symbols: Y, G, L, a, b1, and b2. Those who wish to understand
more fully the developments add to those symbols: A, B, C, D, E, and F. And, for those who wish to analyze
the presentation for validity, a thorough understanding of all terms is required.

A3.1.2. Resident training course manpower standard is used to determine manpower requirements up to, but
not including, branch/division overhead. All courses have basically the same work classification, but,
because of variations in subject matter taught, equipment and facilities used, and fluctuating student entries,
each course must be treated as a separate manpower standard. Work classifications have been categorized as
follows:

Direct       Academic instruction (Hai) includes total academic instructor hours to teach one group for the course
             duration and must be converted to monthly hours. To make the conversion, we determine the
             relationship of the course length in days to the average days per month, then adjust the (Hai) by that
             relationship. Since all courses observe national holidays the normal 20.91 days per month is used.
             Monthly academic instructor hours (Bi) are computed by solving:
                     Bi = Classroom / Laboratory Instructor Hours x 20.91
                                       Course length in days

Indirect     Required activities in support of academic instruction are categorized as course support (A), group
             support (C), student support (D), shift support (E), and instructor support (F). Each category of support
             is further defined for the instructor (Mi) and supervisory (Ms) which includes the instructor supervisor
             and (or) intermediate supervisor. These support categories are at section C of this attachment.

A3.1.3. Each requirement has been defined and may now derive the multivariate equation.

                                               The Multivariate Equation
The manpower requirement (Mt )(instructor and Mt = At + Ct (G) + Dt (L) + Et (S) + Ft (Mi) + Bi (G)
supervisory) for the various support categories plus the                 MAF
academic instructor time.
Only two of the workload factors are programmable:
group load (G) and student load (L).
To allow the manpower standard equation to be
compatible with the programmable workload factors, the
equation is reduced by eliminating the shift (S) and
instructor (Mi) workload factors.
During the original development of the manpower
standard equation, a coordinated decision between HQ
ATC/TT and XP resulted in redefining the shift variable
in terms of fixed cost (At) and group (b1).
It was agreed that half of the shift support (Et) will be
included in the fixed value (a) and half will be included
in the total group support (b1).
AETCI38-202           19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                                         49

Since the instructor category by definition is personnel
generated time, this category will be algebraically
prorated to the a, b1, and the b2 coefficients.
The final manpower standard takes the form of:             a = (At + Ai (Ft / (MAF - Fi)) + ((Et + (Ft / (MAF – Fi) Ei)))
Mt = a + b1 (G) + b2 (L), and is derived as follows:       .5 / MAF

                                                           b1 = Bi (1 + Ft / (MAF – Fi)) + Ct + ((Ft / (MAF – Fi)) Ci) +
                                                           (Et + (Ft / (MAF – Fi))Ei)) .5 / SL) / MAF

                                                           b2 = Dt + ((Ft / (MAF – Fi)) Di) / MAF

                                                           L = (TPR x Course Length in Days) / 246

                                                           G = L / PGS
                                                           NOTE: A Christmas factor of 0.9804 must be applied to a,
                                                           b1, and b2 values to provide the final equation.

  Instructors are earned through the ITRO instructor standard and billed by the Army to the Air Force. There is a subtractive to the BA
because HQ AETC/SGAC does not fund one instructor authorization. The detachment commander also functions as an instructor. The
training manager provides changes, as well as FY01 program entries for this training plan. TPS is being used as the source document for
current data.

                                              Course Title

1. Group Size Justification: Group sizes are identified as maximum, program, and minimum. Additionally,
an expansion group size is used to determine wartime course requirements. Since course manpower
standards state requirements for one group of students in session, it is important that each group size be
properly stated and justified so that everyone will understand group sizes as they apply to manpower, proper
management of student flow, and optimizing all resources. The local MO and school, preferably the training
manager, will jointly determine the maximum group size (MGS) with full written justification based
primarily on classroom and/or equipment constraints.

a. Expansion Group Size (EGS): The maximum number of students (maximum group size plus) that can
be accommodated under wartime surge conditions (training expansion). Consider all local options available,
but do not allow for washbacks. This group size is to be used for wartime planning purposes only, and will
be based upon wartime course requirements.

b. Maximum Group Size (MGS): The maximum number of students that can be accommodated based on
peacetime use of facilities, equipment, safety, and instructional method.

c. Program Group Size (PGS): The number of students per group used to schedule (program) classes.
Unless there is adequate justification, this will be the same as the maximum group size. Justification must
include a detailed explanation of how using the maximum group size would lend to a degradation of training
quality. The justification should address washback rates (providing seats for washbacks), and other impacts
(reductions/increases), versus the cost of student ineffective time. If the group size is reduced due to
washbacks, ensure computations for the washback is provided in the manpower annex (reference
Attachment 5). When group size is reduced because of equipment constraints, investigate options, for
example, Fast Pay Back Capitol Investment (FASCAP). A program group size smaller than maximum will
apply exclusively to initial skills courses. The PGS will be the basis for manpower computations.

d. Minimum Group Size (MnGS): The least number of students required to meet course-training
objectives due to team instructional requirements or safety consideration. This group size will be used to
identify a projected class that should be considered for cancellation, for example, four. This is the minimum
number of students that can be trained while maintaining an effective use of manpower, facilities, and
resources. State whether this group size will/will not eliminate the need for an MIR.

2. Shift Group Limit: The maximum number of groups that can be accommodated on a single shift, limited
by facilities and equipment. Since other courses may use the same equipment or facilities on each shift, it is
important to state the number of groups properly.

3. Washbacks: Include documentation for washbacks. If washback calculations are done, then state where
the calculation sheets are located in the training package.

4. Root Basic Authorization: State the actions requested for the basic authorization. Does a standard or
nonstandard BA need to be loaded for the course or should the BA be copied from the replacement course?
This is also called rolling over the BA from one course to another. When you request a standard BA specify
AETCI38-202       19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                          59

the AFSC. If you are asking for a nonstandard BA, then include justification for why it is needed and a paper
copy of a BA with pen and ink changes reflecting what is being requested.

5. ITRO Status: State whether this is an ITRO (consolidated or collocated), a DoD executive agent or a
quota course. If it has other services entries and has gone through a study, it is an ITRO (consolidated or
collocated) course. If consolidation has been mandated by a DoD agency or JCS, the course is a DoD EA
course. If it has other services entries and does not meet any of the criteria above, it is a quota course.

6. CCAF Accredited: State yes or no. If yes attach memorandum.

7. Other Information: Any special requests, data, or instructions related to the course in question.

8. Minimum Manning Requirements: Minimum manpower is provided to ensure sufficient instructors are
available when: (1) a course cannot be family grouped; or (2) pricing of the course could earn less than the
multiple-instructor requirement. If minimum manpower is indicated, provide complete justification. The
minimum manpower is based on supporting the program group size.

9. Multiple Instructor Requirements (MIR): Classroom and/or laboratory hours that requires more than
one instructor to conduct the training specified in a plan of instruction. Usually this occurs when the group
must be subdivided due to equipment, facility, or safety limitations/requirements. Justify safety requirements
by referencing applicable AF or AETC directives, and obtain a memorandum from the ground safety office
citing the applicable OSHA standard. MIRs are always based on the maximum group size. Justifications
containing generalities will not be accepted; justification must be specific (include diagrams or graphics for
clearer understanding). The information in the MIR justification must also match data reported in any other
charts, the AETC Form 896, or listings on course/block hours and numbers of instructors needed.

1. Group Size Justification:

a. Expansion Group Size (EGS): Six is the maximum number of students that can be accommodated under
wartime surge conditions due to equipment limitations.

b. Maximum Group Size (MGS): Six is the maximum number of students that can be accommodated. The
course is limited by the classroom design of three emulator bays, which can be used to train two students
each.

c. Program Group Size (PGS): Six.

d. Minimum Group Size (MnGS): Two. This group size does not eliminate the MIR.

2. Shift Group Limit: One.

3. Washbacks: Zero.

4. Root Basic Authorization: Roll BA from course T3ABR3U031-000.

5. ITRO Status: N/A

6. CCAF Accredited: No.

7. Other Information: This course replaces T3ABR3U031-000.

8. Minimum Manning Requirements: Two. Two instructors are needed at all times for a simulator to be
operated.

9. Multiple Instructor Requirements (MIR):

Block 1, Unit 7
Instructors required: Six.
Type of Instruction: Performance evaluation.

10. Hours Required: 39. In order to train at the maximum group size of six students, all three emulator bays
must be operated. Six instructors (two instructors per student) are required to adequately evaluate these six
students on the assigned operation and associated procedures. Due to the complexity of console operations,
each student is individually evaluated. Each action the student makes must be closely monitored to ensure no
mistakes are made. Six instructors are paired on three emulator bays. Each emulator bay will consist of two
instructors and two students. One instructor (per emulator bay) will evaluate students’ response while
simultaneously supporting them as a contractor, commander, reorganizational engineer, and/or consultant.
The second instructor (per emulator bay) will support them as a physically separated resource engineer (for
AETCI38-202       19 OCTOBER 2001                                                                        61

any external agencies that the student may require). They will also monitor the students’ computer
responses, and provide program input as necessary. The requirement for two instructors is also specified for
safety reasons in TO 7X-1-1-2, paragraph 2-1 and AFOSH 167-12X . See attached memorandum from the
safety office and classroom diagram.

SUBJECT: Approval of Safety Multiple Instructor Requirements (MIRs) for the Pararescue Apprentice
Course (L3ABP1T231-002)

1. This memorandum supercedes the previous memorandum dated 11 Mar 96, same subject, requesting
approval of the minimum safety MIR manpower authorizations in the Pararescue Apprentice Course taught
at Kirtland AFB (see AETC Form 896).

2. This action is required to allow for an increase in the maximum number of MIR manpower authorizations
from eight in course L3ABP1T231-001 to twelve in course L3ABP1T231-002. The maximum class size for
this course has increased from 16 to 22. This course must be validated and therefore a thorough review and
validation of the MIRs will be accomplished during the validation period.

                                  HOW AGGREGATION WORKS

NOTE: This process only occurs during the pricing cycle.

Step 1: Calculate fractional instructor manpower (EM) for each course involved then list in the EM column.

 Course       Equation     Rounded              Aggregation (AG)     Final
 Number       Manpowe      Manpowe                                  Manpowe
                  r           r                                        r
               (EM)         (RM)              Integer    Fractional  (FM)
Course A        .28
Course B        1.37
Course C        3.02
 Total

Step 2: Determine the RM for each course—any fraction is rounded up to the next whole number.

 Number       Manpowe      Manpowe                                  Manpowe

Course B        1.37          2
Course C        3.02          4
 Total

Step 3: Total the EM column. Round the EM total to the next integer (whole) number and record this
number in both the AG and FM total columns.

Step 5: Compare the AG total to the RM total. If the AG total = RM total, the RM for each course is the
Final Manpower required. If the AG total < RM total then proceed to step 6 (Aggregation).

Step 6:
a. For each course, take the integers from the EM column and record in the AG’s Integer column (in this
example Course B and C earn 1 and 3, respectively).

b. Compare the fractional EM of each course. For the course with the highest fractional manpower, record 1
in the corresponding AG factional column.

c. Repeat step b until the course total of the combined Integer and Fractional columns equals the amount pre-
recorded in the AG total column. If exceeded, check for errors.

Step 7: Using the AG column, add the Integer + Fractional amounts to obtain the course’s Final Manpower
for instructors and record in the FM column. Some courses may not receive instructors as the family group
will support them.

NOTE: Courses in the same OSC are a family group and are checked for aggregation during pricing. Unless
submitting merged courses or type 4 courses, bases don’t normally use aggregation.

                         BASIC AUTHORIZATION (BA) COMPUTATION

NOTE: The following is an example of how percentages are distributed to authorizations. The example is
based on a scenario in which a course earns a total of 20 authorizations and is an initial skill course with a
nonstandard BA for a set cost.

Order of Distribution Actions:

1. Subtractive
2. Set Cost
3. Percentages
4. Compute and Add

Course earns 20 authorizations. There are no subtractives to apply. The course has a set cost of one civilian.
Therefore, the percentages will be figured on 19 authorizations (20 – 1), since the set cost will always be
allotted first.

Percentages are as follows (Standard BA for initial skills course):

       MSgt                      TSgt                   SSgt                    SrA
        4%                        8%                    44%                     44%


Distribution is figured as follows (break point is .5999):

              MSgt                     TSgt                        SSgt                  SrA
   Rate        4%                       8%                         44%                   44%
Calculation 19 x 4% =             19 x 8% = 1.52             19 x 44% = 8.36       19 x 44% = 8.36
               .76
Adjustment +.24 to                1.52 - .24 from            8.36 + .28 from        8.36 - .36 from
             equal 1               MSgt = 1.28                 TSgt = 8.64            SSgt = 8.00
  Earns         1                         1                         9                       8

NOTE: The last number will always be a whole number. If a fraction remains, there is an error in the
computation. BA calculation may be done by hand or by using a BA computation worksheet.
