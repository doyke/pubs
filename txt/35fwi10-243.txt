4. Using the AUGFOR Program:
  4.1. Creating and deleting augmentation requirements.
     4.1.1. Requests to expand or reduce AUGFOR positions or to create a new AUGFOR
     tasking should be routed as follows: initiated by AUGFOR Task Leader, owning
     Squadron Commander, Group Superintendent, owning Group Commander, Base
     AUGFOR Manager, and then presented at the next AWG. Emergency requests for
     AUGFOR manpower should be presented to the 35 FW/CV through the chain of
     command.
     4.1.2. The AUGFOR program, including AUGFOR Task requirements and unit “fair
     share” will be revalidated by the Group Superintendent annually.
     4.1.3. Group Superintendents will validate each unit’s wartime manpower requirements
     by operational audit. Manpower requirements will be calculated using the applicable
     wartime Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF). The formula will be assigned strength –
     UTC-tasked personnel – mission essential personnel = available personnel for
     augmentation use. Manpower will calculate the number of squadron mission essential
     personnel in their validation.
6                                                         35FWI10-243 3 OCTOBER 2012


       4.1.4. Group Superintendents will request each unit annually review the manpower
       validation worksheet from the prior year. If the unit has a substantial mission or
       personnel change, the Group Superintendent will revalidate their wartime manpower
       requirements.
           4.1.4.1. Group Superintendent provides results of the validation to the AWG for
           review and recommendation to the 35 FW/CV. The 35 FW/CV approves the
           recommendations, and directs implementation.
    4.2. Training.
       4.2.1. AUGFOR Task Leaders should schedule all augmentees for training through their
       Group Superintendent, to ensure information flow correctly to the owning squadron.
       4.2.2. Training will be conducted during Wing Warrior Days unless otherwise directed.
       All AUGFOR training dates will be approved by the 35 FW/CV.
       4.2.3. Training will be conducted in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Volume 1-6, to
       include proper documentation annotated on specifically devised AF Fm 797 and
       additional information sent to supervisors for submission into AF Form 623A, On-The-
       Job Training Record-Continuation Sheet.
       4.2.4. Training plans will be developed and utilized by the AUGFOR Task Leader.
       4.2.5. The Base AUGFOR Manager will keep the 35 FW/CV appraised of all training
       schedules and follow up with post-training feedback.
    4.3. Initiating the AUGFOR Program.
       4.3.1. All requests for AUGFOR Task activations outside of normally scheduled wing
       level exercises must be approved by the 35 FW/CV.
           4.3.1.1. AUGFOR Task Leader requests activation of the AUGFOR Program
           through his/her chain of command.
       4.3.2. The AUGFOR program will be initiated by CAT Installation Directive. This will
       be the primary method of activation of an AUGFOR team. Using a CAT Installation
       Directive (CID) reduces miscommunication, ensures rapid dissemination and protects
       Operation Security (OPSEC).
