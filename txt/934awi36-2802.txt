example, if a member was a SrA for 65 days of the quarter and an SSgt for only 25 days of the
quarter; the member will compete in the Airman category. For these rank situations please add a
note of explanation in a memorandum for record from the unit commander or Sr ART.
   4.1. Personnel Requirements: Nominated reserve member/civilian must be in good standing.
   Each nominee’s commander must only recommend individuals who have favorable records.
   Disqualifying items would include:
       4.1.1. Individuals with an open unfavorable information file (UIF).

       AW Staff).
 4                                                               934AWI36-2802 19 JUNE 2014


        4.2.2. Wing quarterly award winners cannot be nominated in the subsequent quarter (i.e.
        if individual won first quarter they cannot be nominated for the second quarter).
     4.3. Award Nomination Inclusion Period Guidance.
        4.3.1. Traditional reservists who have not been on tour lengths longer than a sum total of
        30 days may list significant events and/or accomplishments that have transpired within
        the preceding 12 months in the quarterly award cycle. For example, quarterly
        nominations for the 1st Qtr. could include information from 1 Apr (previous year) to 31
        Mar (current year).
        4.3.2. If a nominee is a full-time employee (ART, AGR, civilian) or on long-tour (greater
        than 30 total days in the quarter), the member must only list events/accomplishments
        from the award quarter. For reservists who have had more than 90 total days of orders in
        the preceding year, only 50% of the bullets can come from their long-tour orders period
        (using the 12 monthly look-back for a reservist).
5. Quarterly Award Nomination Procedures. The wing quarterly awards program is designed
to be straightforward for commanders while providing sufficient information for the board to
make an informed selection.
     5.1. Quarterly awards will be managed on a calendar year cycle with the year divided into
     quarters as described in Table 1. Note the wing quarterly award boards will be the 2nd UTA
     after the end of the quarter allowing for each group to hold their own quarterly awards board.
     For example, 1st Qtr is Jan-Mar.             Group quarterly awards board selects their
     recommendation during the Apr UTA. Wing quarterly award board held May UTA.

                                     BOARD GUIDANCE

A3.1. BOARD PRESIDENT:
   A3.1.1. Be familiar with AWI36-2805 and ensure strict adherence to this instruction.
   A3.1.2. Oversee board operations; also serve as a scoring board member for tiebreakers
   only.
   A3.1.3. Upon board completion, immediately return completed score sheets to 934 AW/CCE
   or designee.
A3.2. BOARD MEMBER:
   A3.2.1. Review the score sheet.
   A3.2.2. Note the fact that all accomplishments must have been accomplished during the
   period of the award
   A3.2.3. Ensure each bullet is in the proper category.
   A3.2.4. Objectively review each package in detail.
   A3.2.5. Judge how important each bullet is, based on your own intellect, experience, and
   common sense. Don’t bring in your own knowledge of the person. Judge solely on the facts
   contained on the AF Form 1206, appearance, ability to answer questions and military
   bearing.
   A3.2.6. Grade each nomination package individually.
A3.3. 1206 Package:
   A3.3.1. Look at the member’s ability to lead and all aspects of his or her job performance.
   Include the member’s development of new techniques and focus on how each bullet (on the
   AF Form 1206) contributes significantly to increased mission effectiveness during the
   quarter.
   A3.3.2. The member must show self-improvement through on- and off-duty education,
   achievements in professional or cultural societies or associations, and (or) development of
   creative abilities during the quarter. Consider the member’s grade and status. (Was the
   member completing CDCs or PME during this period? Was he or she TDY for a
   contingency operation?)
   A3.3.3. The nature and results of the member’s other accomplishments must set him or her
   apart from others of equal or higher grade. The member must have shown tangible
   demonstrated ability as an articulate and positive member of the Air Force during the
   quarter/year. Look for facts, not just quality statements.
