                   STANDARDS OF NURSING CARE AND PRACTICE.

3.1. Definition of Nursing Care. Every organization must define nursing care and identify
areas in the facility/unit where nursing care is delivered. Definitions of nursing care are based on
the nursing process. Consider the following in developing the organization-specific definition of
nursing care:
   3.1.1. The applicable state nurse practice act where applies.
   3.1.2. Department of Defense (DOD) guidelines, AF policies, directives and instructions.
   3.1.3. The standards of clinical nursing practice published by professional nursing
   organizations.
   3.1.4. Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice, current edition, American Nurses
   Association.
3.2. Standards of Nursing Care. Standards of care are authoritative statements that describe a
competent level of nursing care as demonstrated by the nursing process through assessment,
diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation, and evaluation.
   3.2.1. The Standards of Care chapter in the “Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice”
   published by the ANA forms the basis for professional nursing care within AF Nursing
   Services.
   3.2.2. The CN ensures written administrative and clinical guidance and procedures directing
   the provision of nursing care are current and available in all patient care areas. At a
   minimum, directives should address:
       3.2.2.1. Standards published by professional nursing organizations adopted for use.
       3.2.2.2. Specific nursing standards of care if required by regulatory agencies including
       the DoD, AFMS, The Joint Commission, and AAAHC.
       3.2.2.3. Method(s) to measure, assess, and improve patient outcomes.
       3.2.2.4. Method(s) to review and revise standards of care, including review by the CN.
3.3. Standards of Nursing Practice. Standards of practice are authoritative statements that
describe a level of care or performance common to the profession of nursing by which the
quality of nursing practice can be judged. The “Code for Nurses” and the Standards of
Professional Performance Chapter in the “Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice” published by
the ANA form the basis for a competent level of behavior expected of AF Nursing Services
personnel.
3.4. Scope of Practice. Scope of practice refers to the range of responsibilities/activities
registered nurses and/or other licensed nursing service personnel are educated, trained and
authorized to perform.
3.5. Authorization for Extended Scope of Practice. The Air Force may, for the purpose of its
mission, utilize nurses for tasks that may be beyond those authorized by the state that issued the
AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     15


individual’s license. Similarly, aerospace medical service technicians may be asked to perform
tasks beyond their achieved skill level training outlined in their CFETP.
   3.5.1. Utilization of nurses and aerospace medical service technicians (4NXXX) for
   extended scope of practice must meet three criteria:
       3.5.1.1. The expanded scope of the task or procedure must be mission essential.
       3.5.1.2. The member must be trained for the expanded scope by a competent trainer and
       that training must be documented.
       3.5.1.3. The expanded role is restricted solely to military mission performance; it
       requires annual review and approval.
   3.5.2. When the medical leadership or health care team decides an RN needs to perform
   clinical tasks outside his/her scope of care, or a 4N needs to perform tasks not in the CFETP,
   the organization must request a Scope of Practice Waiver along with a copy of the lesson
   plan for waiver approval. Such requests will be coordinated through the MTF SGH/SGN/4N
   FM, MTF/CC, AFMOA/SGH/SGN, AF/SG1N (Director, Nursing Services/4N Career Field
   Manager). The AF 4N0X1/4N1X1 Career Field Manager considers and grants waivers as
   appropriate for enlisted matters. All Scope of Practice Waivers must be accomplished IAW
   AFI 44-119, Chapter 7.
3.6. Nursing Responsibilities. Include but are not limited to the following high risk problem
prone areas:
   3.6.1. Telehealth Nursing.
       3.6.1.1. Telehealth nursing, as defined by the AAACN, is the delivery, management, and
       coordination of care and services provided via telecommunications technology within the
       domain of nursing. It includes any encounter that results in assessment and management
       of acute and episodic health care concerns, health maintenance and promotion, disease
       prevention and management, patient education and counseling, patient advocacy, case
       management, and coordination of care for patients throughout the health care system.
       Telehealth nursing includes such components as nursing triage, home care advice which
       might be considered part of the triage process, providing health care information such as
       lab and radiology results, and care coordination.
       3.6.1.2. Telehealth nurses are licensed registered nurses with at least three years of
       clinical experience in various settings who have demonstrated appropriate knowledge and
       skills necessary to provide safe and effective telehealth nursing care and service. This
       requirement for 3-5 years of “demonstrated competence in all aspects of nursing care and
       independent decision making” comes from American Academy of Ambulatory Care
       Nursing (AAACN) “A Guide to Ambulatory Care Nursing Orientation and Competency
       Assessment” (2005). The years of experience can be waived on a case-by-case basis as
       assessed and recommended by the local CN to the Air Force Medical Operations Agency
       (AFMOA) CN. Clinical experience in pediatrics, obstetrics and medical-surgical nursing
       is highly desirable.
          3.6.1.2.1. Telehealth nursing practice requiring patient triage, home care advice and
          involving symptom-based decision-making will be guided by the use of clinical
16                                                           AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011


         decision support tools that are verified and documented according to nursing practice
         standards.
         3.6.1.2.2. Nursing service personnel use of nationally recognized nursing triage
         protocols, algorithms, or guidelines will be coordinated between the CN and Chief of
         Medical Staff, and approved and reviewed initially and at least annually by the
         Executive Committee of Medical Staff (ECOMS).
     3.6.1.3. All telehealth calls involving nursing decision-making will be documented as
     telecons in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) and
     coded appropriately. Symptom-based calls requiring decision-making will be signed by
     the nurse providing care and reviewed and co-signed by a privileged provider within 24
     hours.
     3.6.1.4. Telehealth nursing is not meant to be the primary function of the ambulatory
     care nurse. Process improvement efforts should be carried out locally to channel calls to
     the appropriate office, such as calls that might be more appropriately handled by Referral
     Management, TRICARE, Disease Management, or Case Management. Additionally,
     internal processes should be evaluated and managed to maximize effectiveness of each
     clinic’s telehealth nursing practice, such as MTF procedures for medication renewals.
     3.6.1.5. The CN is responsible for ensuring local guidance and procedures for telehealth
     nursing practice are written to include such parameters as: the clinical decision support
     tools, protocols, guidelines and the documentation requirements; appropriate staff
     training and competencies documentation; clinical chain of command; deviation from
     protocol guidance; and a peer review process.
     3.6.1.6. MTF guidance and procedures for telehealth nursing practice should mirror
     AAACN’s Telehealth Nursing Practice Administration and Practice Standards, current
     edition.
  3.6.2. Medication Practice. Patient safety is paramount. The CN must ensure medication
  administration is conducted IAW DOD and Air Force guidance, accepted standards of
  practice as defined by The Joint Commission and National Patient Safety Standards. Nursing
  Services personnel must comply with The Joint Commission “Do Not Use” terminology, the
  National Patient Safety Goals, as well as the following basic principles of medication
  practice.
     3.6.2.1. Licensed Registered and Vocational nurses may administer medications IAW
     their scope of practice after successful completion of the computational pharmacology
     and medication administration test per local guidance, and competency is validated and
     documented in the member’s CAF or electronic equivalent.
     3.6.2.2. 4N0s may administer medications after completion of: 5-Level CFETP training,
     and a computational pharmacology and medication administration test. Competency will
     be validated and documented in the member’s CFETP.
         3.6.2.2.1. Section-specific medication administration lists will be coordinated with
         the CN and Chief, Medical Staff; and approved by ECOMS. Aeromedical
         Evacuation Squadrons, RMUs and ANG MDGs will coordinate medication
AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     17


        administration lists with the senior physician and the Executive Management
        Committee (or equivalent).
        3.6.2.2.2. 4N0s will not accept verbal orders for medication administration.
        (Exception: IDMTs/Paramedics/4N0 7-9 levels may function within their CFTEP
        with appropriate training and validation).
        3.6.2.2.3. 4N0s will not give narcotics. (Exception: IDMTs/Paramedics/4N0 7-9
        levels may function within their CFETP with appropriate training and validation).
        3.6.2.2.4. IDMTs/Paramedics/4N0 7-9 levels may administer intravenous
        medications IAW with their CFETP and with appropriate training and validation.
     3.6.2.3. The individual preparing medication must be the person to administer it.
     3.6.2.4. A prepared medication must never be left unattended. If it is not going to be
     immediately administered, it must be labeled with the drug, dosage, time of preparation
     and initials of preparer.
     3.6.2.5. Nursing Services personnel must have thoroughly written, dated, signed orders
     for medication administration to include the name of the drug, dosage of the drug, route
     of the drug, and frequency or time of administration. In the AD MTF outpatient setting,
     a prescription placed in Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application
     (AHLTA) to the pharmacy does not constitute an order for medication administration
     purposes.
     3.6.2.6. Injectable medications will be checked for clarity, foreign particles, and
     expiration date before the medication is prepared. If the medication does not pass this
     quality check, it will not be used and will be returned to the pharmacy.
     3.6.2.7. Medications will be prepared using the Three Step Rule:
        3.6.2.7.1. Read the label before removing from the medication storage area or

        3.6.2.9.6. Patient teaching or instruction (i.e., side effects, safety— “remain in bed”
        or “remain for 20 minutes and report any allergic reaction symptoms”).
        3.6.2.9.7. Expected effects of the medication (i.e., pain or nausea relief).
        3.6.2.9.8. Actual effects of the medications must be documented prior to the patient’s
        release from the outpatient setting or within a specified period of time in the inpatient
        setting.
     3.6.2.10. Intravenous Therapy.
        3.6.2.10.1. The order for intravenous therapy must include:
        3.6.2.10.2. Type of solution.
        3.6.2.10.3. Amount of solution to be infused.
        3.6.2.10.4. Rate of infusion.

     3.6.2.11. Dispensing of Medications: IAW AFI 44-102, the ordering privileged provider
     is ultimately responsible for the dispensing of medications outside of the Pharmacy
     setting. The issuing of prepackaged medications to a patient will be done according to
     the following procedure:
AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     19


         3.6.2.11.1. Any staff member on the Authorized Access List for automated and non-
         automated drug storage equipment may remove the prescribed medication.
         3.6.2.11.2. The medication will be given to the ordering privileged provider for
         completion of labeling information and validation before the medication is provided
         to the patient.
     3.6.2.12. Medication Ordering Practices (nurses): Only P-APNs are allowed to prescribe
     medications within the MTF. IDMTs can order medications IAW AFMAN 44-158;
     however, non-privileged Registered Nurses working in MTFs are authorized to process
     requests for refill medications in CHCS/AHLTA only under the following circumstances:
         3.6.2.12.1. The nurse can assess the patient’s need for continued use.
         3.6.2.12.2. The nurse ensures the patient has been on the medication previously and
         has run out of refills.
         3.6.2.12.3. The nurse uses approved support staff protocol guidance to determine if
         the patient is having problems with the prescribed medication.
         3.6.2.12.4. The nurse is expected to gather a pertinent history, obtain any relevant
         preliminary diagnostic test results as required, and provide patient
         education/instruction on the medication usage, side effects, plan of care and front line
         prevention as appropriate.
  3.6.2.12.5. The nurse will enter the correct medication order into AHLTA and complete a
  telecom or AHLTA template with all pertinent information. The document will be forwarded
  to the ordering provider for co-signature.
         3.6.2.12.6. Registered Nurses and IDMTs cannot renew controlled substances,
         corticosteroids and psychotropics. In addition, Registered Nurses cannot renew
         antibiotics.
         3.6.2.12.7. All registered nurses inputting medication in CHCS/AHLTA must have
         documented training in order entry, computational pharmacology and medication
         administration.
         3.6.2.12.8. In MTFs, Primary Care Managers (PCMs) or competent trainers must
         train the registered nurse on the use of the protocols and document the training in the
         nurse’s CAF or electronic equivalent.
         3.6.2.12.9. In MTFs, PCMs or competent trainer will review registered nurse
         competency annually. If at any time a registered nurse is found to be deficient in the
         use of protocols they will have the medication ordering protocol/function removed
         from their scope of practice.
     3.6.2.13. Prescriptions to Outside Pharmacies.AF nursing personnel may not call in
     prescriptions to pharmacies. In the event a patient is unable to pick up a written
     prescription, nursing services personnel may fax the prescription to the designated
     pharmacy if the pharmacy and the patient’s provider concur with this practice, and with
     permission of the patient.
  3.6.3. Support Staff Protocols (SSPs). For Use in MTFs. Support Staff Protocols can be
  used in the ambulatory care setting for providing coordinated care for high volume, low or
20                                                            AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011


  high risk symptoms and/ or diagnoses. Examples: sore throat/strep culture protocol (high
  volume/low risk); depression screen protocol (high volume/high risk); chest pain protocol
  (low volume/high risk). SSPs are intended to increase patient access to care, reduce
  variations in clinical practice and increase the support staff’s clinical competency and
  currency. Protocols are intended to augment, but never substitute, for a provider or nursing
  assessment of a patient. The privileged provider is ultimately responsible for the assessment
  and care of the patient.
     3.6.3.1. SSPs will be coordinated between the MTF SGN and SGH.
     3.6.3.2. SSPs will include the following elements:
         3.6.3.2.1. Evidence-based practice. Evidence-based practice is a problem solving
         approach to the delivery of health care that integrates the best evidence from clinical
         inquiry and combines it with patient preferences and values and nursing personnel
         expertise.
         3.6.3.2.2. Flow chart which outlines patient flow through a given process and
         includes exclusionary criteria that identifies when the encounter is no longer within
         the scope of practice for support staff (i.e., “If temp of 102 degrees, must be seen by
         provider”).
         3.6.3.2.3. Training Plan that identifies resources and/or references for the evidence-
         based practice that the support staff protocol is based upon.
         3.6.3.2.4. Training of support staff protocols should be documented in training record
         for aerospace medical service technicians and RNs.
         3.6.3.2.5. Standardized documentation of encounter using AHLTA template or
         questionnaire.
         3.6.3.2.6. Periodic peer review both an initial and annual review.
     3.6.3.3. SSPs will be co-signed by the PCM.
  3.6.4. Clinical Inquiry. Clinical inquiry is the ongoing process of questioning and
  evaluating nursing practice, providing informed patient care, and creating practice changes
  through research utilization and experiential learning (American Association of Critical Care
  Nurses, The AACN Synergy Model for Patient Care).
     3.6.4.1. Nursing Services personnel will promote the best patient outcomes through
     participation in clinical inquiry at multiple levels of expertise, ranging from knowledge of
     research evidence to conducting research.
         3.6.4.1.1. Consultation and mentoring with research activities can be provided by
         nurse researchers and/or DNP/PhD assigned to the MTF and/or a research cell within
         the AFMS. A list of these researchers can be found on the Nurse Corps Homepage at
         https://kx.afms.mil/nurseresearch.

                      VERIFICATION OF NURSING COMPETENCY.

4.1. Definition of Competency Assessment. Competency assessment is a continuous process
that includes but is not limited to orientation, license verification, certification maintenance, in-
service training, continuing education and skills/task performance. The right skill mix, job
knowledge, and appropriate competency levels of staff are critical factors in providing quality
patient care and customer service. Competence is the ability of a staff member to apply
decision-making, psychomotor, and interpersonal skills at the level of knowledge expected for
the current duty position. Competency is demonstrated by performance in a designated setting,
consistent with established standards of performance determined by the work setting and the
individual’s role in that setting.
4.2. Competency Assessment. IAW The Joint Commission and AAAHC standards, the CN
and the 4N FM are responsible for ensuring the competence of all nursing staff members is
assessed, maintained, demonstrated, and improved.
   4.2.1. To meet The Joint Commission and AAAHC intent for a periodic competency
   assessment, the CN and 4N FM should ensure that:
       4.2.1.1. There is a job description for each nursing service position. Job descriptions
       should contain items such as job title, work location, job summary, duties, and
       responsibilities, equipment used, supplies and forms used, supervision given or received,
       age of population served, working conditions and hazards. Basic job descriptions for
       nursing AFSCs can be found in the Air Force Officer Classification Directory. Basic job
       descriptions for enlisted nursing AFSCs can be found in the Air Force Enlisted
       Classification Directory. It is recommended these be used as baseline documents and
       should be tailored to include the staff member’s role.
       4.2.1.2. There are performance standards for all positions, including age-specific
       competence and pain management, as appropriate.
       4.2.1.3. The job-specific orientation is completed during orientation process IAW AFI
       36-2201V3, Air Force Training Program on the Job Training Administration.
       4.2.1.4. There is a tracking system in place to ensure competency assessments are
       conducted.
       4.2.1.5. There is a system of documentation to ensure that staff competency assessments
       are completed on schedule, IAW their performance standards. Documentation of
       standards review will be in the member’s CAF or electronic equivalent.
       4.2.1.6. A report will be submitted to the MTF/RMU executive team annually on
       Nursing Services competence. The report may include but not limited to relevant
       patterns and training needs and competence maintenance activities.
   4.2.2. Enlisted Nursing Personnel. Competency requirements for aerospace medical service
   technicians and surgical service technicians are outlined in their respective CFETP, Part II,
   Section F, and Documentation of Training. Reference AFI 36-2201, Developing, Managing,
   and Conducting Training, for use of the CFETP to plan, conduct, evaluate, and document
 22                                                          AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011


   enlisted training. Core competencies for aerospace medical service technicians are found in
   the CFETP, Part II.
   4.2.3. Privileged Advanced Practice Nurses (P-APNs). Skills assessment and competency
   evaluation of P-APNs who are privileged providers is accomplished through the credentials
   and privileging function described in AFI 44-119. P-APNs, regardless of assignment, will
   maintain certification and privileges in a MTF to continue clinical practice.
   4.2.4. AF Nursing Services Competency Assessment Checklists. Mosby’s Nursing Skills
   (MNS) is the standard basic clinical nursing procedure reference for Nurse Corps
   competencies. MNS is located on the Knowledge Exchange (Kx), in the virtual library, at
   https://kx.afms.mil. The CN, in collaboration with other nursing leaders, will determine
   which competency assessment checklists will be applied within the MTF.
4.3. Readiness Skills Verification (RSV) Program. It is the responsibility of the CN and 4N
FM to ensure Nursing Services personnel are clinically current and prepared to meet medical
readiness requirements during home station, humanitarian assistance, homeland security/defense,
disaster response and global medical operations. They will coordinate efforts in matching
Nursing Services personnel to UTC assignments and taskings.
   4.3.1. All Nursing Services personnel will comply with AFI 41-106, Unit Level Management
   of Medical Readiness Programs
4.4. Operational Clinical Skills Sustainment. Given the challenges of today’s Expeditionary
Air Force, all Nursing Service members must have current operational clinical skills to meet
UTC and home station mission requirements.
   4.4.1. All nurses, CNs and below, will sustain operational clinical currency within their
   primary AFSC IAW their respective RSVs.
   4.4.2. Obstetrical Nurses (46N3G) are valid UTC substitutions for the 46N3 AFSC. These
   officers need to ensure operational currency IAW their primary RSVs as well as be able to
   perform duties in her/his mobility AFSC.
   4.4.3. For Air Force Reserve Command nurses and aerospace medical service technicians,
   operational clinical sustainment opportunities exist via specific AD MTFs as well as
   Veterans Administration and civilian Level 1 Trauma Centers in the U.S.; AFRC’s
   Sustainment Training to Advance Readiness Skills (STARS) training site at Lackland AFB,
   Texas; as well as through the Air Force’s Sustaining Trauma and Resuscitation Skills
   Program (STARS-P) and associated Modeling and Simulation centers across the U.S. These
   opportunities will be available to Reservists during Unit Training Assemblies and Annual
   Tours; rotations will be coordinated with AFRC SGX.
   4.4.4. Air National Guard nurses and medical technicians, operational clinical sustainment
   opportunities exist in specific AD MTFs as well as Veterans Administration and civilian
   Level 1 Trauma Centers in the U.S.; AFRC’s Sustainment Training to Advance Readiness
   Skills (STARS), CSTARS, and Readiness Frontiers. These opportunities will be available to
   Guardsman during Unit Training Assemblies and Annual Tours.
4.5. Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) and Special Experience Identifiers (SEIs). It is
imperative that key AF organizations are able to correctly identify current clinical and
administrative capabilities/AFSCs Nursing Services personnel possess (i.e., Air Force Personnel
AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     23


Center, Air Reserve Personnel Center, Air National Guard Bureau, Air Force Reserve Command,
and the Air Expeditionary Forces Center).
   4.5.1. To ensure maintenance of all mission-relevant AFSCs, the CN, or equivalent, will
   review their NC officers’ military and civilian credentials, education, and experience to
   determine if the officers meet the criteria for the award of additional AFSCs, IAW the on-line
   Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD). The CN will identify the primary,
   secondary, and/or tertiary entry or fully qualified AFSCs on an AF Form 2096,
   Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, and forward the form with supporting
   documentation to the appropriate Commander’s, Support Staff (CSS)/Military Personnel
   Flight for processing.
       4.5.1.1. For officers possessing more AFSCs than the SURF can accommodate, the
       46N3E (Critical Care Nurse), 46N3J (ED/Trauma Nurse), and 46F3 (Flight Nurse) will
       have priority. The 46F3 will only be the primary AFSC while the NC officer holds a
       46F3 authorization while on active flying status. CN’s should contact AFMOA or
       MAJCOM nurses for further guidance on AFSC prioritization.
       4.5.1.2. To improve force management, the primary AFSC will be determined based on
       selected criteria outlined in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
       Enlisted).
          4.5.1.2.1. 46AX and 46FX AFSCs will only be used as a duty AFSC or awarded as a
          secondary or tertiary AFSC and not as a primary AFSC (except as noted in 4.5.1.1
          above and 4.5.1.2.3 below).
          4.5.1.2.2. Air National Guard Nurse Corps officer’s duty AFSC, including prefixes,
          suffixes, and skill levels, must match the authorized unit manpower document
          position.
          4.5.1.2.3. Air Force Reserve Command Nurse Corps officers are authorized 46FX as
          a primary AFSC only when assigned to a 46F UMD position.
       4.5.1.3. Only Nurse Corps officers who meet the following mandatory criteria will be
       awarded the 46A3 as a secondary or tertiary AFSC:
          4.5.1.3.1. Minimum of 12 months experience as a CN, squadron commander or
          group commander.
          4.5.1.3.2. Completion of the Air Force Medical Service Intermediate Executive Skills
          (IES) course. (IES can be waived for AFRC Nurse Corps Officers by AFRC IES
          Waiver requests to AFRC/SGN). IES attendance is encouraged but not mandatory for
          ANG CNs.
   4.5.2. To ensure maintenance of all mission-relevant SEIs, 4N FMs will ensure all assigned
   enlisted personnel have the correct SEI listed in the Military Personnel Data System.
4.6. Award of 46YX for Non-AF sponsored APNs. Use the following process for Non-AF
sponsored APNs or clinical nurses who have achieved an advanced academic degree and want to
be considered for privileging and utilization in an APN billet (applies to AD APNs only).
24                                                             AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011


  4.6.1. The requesting nurse will submit an application including a letter of recommendation
  from the MTF CN, interview and recommendation by the AF/SG consultant for the specialty,
  and proof of licensure and certification as an APN to AFPC/DPAMN.
     4.6.1.1. AFPC/DPAMN will forward the application to the AF Nurse Corps
     Development Team (DT) for review.
  4.6.2. The DT will review the application to determine if the nurse meets the criteria for the
  award of 46YX and may award the 46YX if one of the following conditions can be met;
     4.6.2.1. A valid billet exists for the specialty 46YX at nurses’ current duty location.
     4.6.2.2. A valid billet exists for the specialty 46YX in another duty location and the
     nurse is eligible to move.
  4.6.3. The Nurse Corps officer may only practice in the APN role if they are filling an
  authorized billet in one of the advanced practice specialties for the AFSC. P-APNs cannot
  practice if they are not in a P-APN billet. An exception applies to those who have been
  awarded and practiced in an authorized P-APN billet and need to maintain currency
  while assigned to a non-clinical position (e.g. Commander, Chief Nurse, Staff position).
AFI46-101 28 OCTOBER 2011                                                                        25

                NURSING STAFFING NEEDS IN ACTIVE DUTY MTFS.

5.1. Medical Annual Planning and Programming/Resourcing. The planning, programming
and resourcing process defines the number and type of personnel required to fulfill the
organization’s mission. The CN and 4N FM are required to participate in the development and
execution of the current year Business Plan, next-year Financial Plan and Program Objective
Memorandum (POM) distribution plan for the out years. The CN and Senior 4N FM will review
results of resourcing tools to ensure the appropriate placement and grading of manpower to
provide safe patient care.
5.2. Nurse Assignments and Staffing.
   5.2.1. Facility staffing priorities will be based on greatest needs to sustain both inpatient and
   outpatient missions and needs of the Air Force. ICUs, inpatient medical/surgical units, ORs,
   EDs and PACUs provide robust UTC clinical training opportunities and should be considered
   priority clinical platforms for currency sustainment.
       5.2.1.1. Nurse Utilization Officers at AFPC in coordination with the MTF SGN will
       ensure staffing fill rates are based on currency sustainment and needs of the Air Force.
       AFPC will ensure highest priority areas are filled at levels equal to or above the staffing
       rate of lower priority areas.
       5.2.1.2. The CN will make every effort to execute local staffing assignments to ensure
       highest priority areas are filled at levels equal to or above the staffing rate of lower
       priority areas.
       5.2.1.3. NC DT must approve consecutive assignments outside clinical training
       platforms.
5.3. Staffing Effectiveness. Standards require the availability of an adequate number of
competent staff to provide nursing care. Each MTF must have a process or mechanism in place
to monitor nursing workload and procedure(s) to adjust staffing in response to workload
fluctuation. As a minimum, the ANA recommends the following factors be considered in
determining nursing staffing requirements: patient volume, levels of intensity of patients for
whom care is being provided, contextual issues including architecture and geography of the
environment and available technology, and level of preparation and experience of those
providing care. Increased nursing workload could require use of on-call staff, contract staffing,
or the diversion of patients to other units/agencies for care.

                        DOCUMENTATION OF NURSING CARE.

6.1. Documenting Nursing Care. The CN is responsible for ensuring guidelines are in place
for documenting direct nursing care and other patient encounters such as telephone contacts.
The guidelines must be consistent with documentation standards. At a minimum, documentation
should include: patient assessment, direct/indirect care provided, patient response to that care,
and patient/family education and their understanding of the information provided. Additional
guidelines on administration of medical records can be found in AFI 41-210, Patient
Administration Functions.
   6.1.1. In-Patient Documentation. Nursing staff will comply with the use of approved and
   established Electronic Health Records, such as ESSENTRIS, when available. The
   documentation process used will be approved by the CN and ECOMS or Nurse Executive
   Committee in each MTF.
   6.1.2. Outpatient Documentation. Electronic documentation in CHCS/ AHLTA is
   preferred. Face-to-face and telephonic encounters will be entered and coded IAW current
   coding guidelines.
       6.1.2.1. Use of computer-based templates, questionnaires and AHLTA COMPAS AIM
       forms are encouraged.
   6.1.3. Nursing documentation accomplished on paper will be made in reproducible black or
   blue-black ink.
       6.1.3.1. Errors will be corrected by lining through the incorrect entry (with blue or black
       ink only), annotating correct information next to the lined-through data if space permits
       and initialing and dating the corrective entry above the erroneous entry. Do not leave
       lines or blank spaces between entries. (See AFI 41-210, Attachment 4, Correcting Health
