1. Scope.
     1.1. A long-term stay in a military hospital, sometimes thousands of miles from home, could
     mean expensive lodging and long separations from loved ones. In recognition of the special
     sacrifices of severely wounded or ill service members and their families, the Fisher House
     Foundation donates “comfort homes” so that families can face medical crises together. Built
     on the grounds of major military and VA medical centers, these “home away from home”
     residences, extend the support normally provided by the respective military services and the
     Department of Veterans Affairs. This instruction was created to ensure this extended support
     is properly implemented and administered at the Travis Air Force Base Fisher House.
     1.2. The Fisher House Foundation was created in 1990 by Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher.
     The Foundation constructs and donates Fisher Houses to the Department of Defense (DOD)
     and VA for use by families of patients hospitalized in military and VA hospitals. Fisher
     Houses are given to the U.S. government as gifts. Military service secretaries and the
     Secretary of Veterans Affairs are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
     homes. The Fisher House Foundation, Inc., a not-for-profit organization under section
     501(c)(3) of the IRS code, builds new houses, assists in coordinating private support, and
     encourages public support for the homes. Donations to the Fisher House Foundation, Inc.
     and to the Air Force Fisher House Fund (AFFHF), the central NAFI created in accordance
     with 10 USC Section 2493, are tax-deductible to the maximum extent allowed by law. Each
     Fisher House is professionally decorated and furnished and has a common kitchen, laundry
     facility, dining room and living room.
     1.3. The mission of the TAFB Fisher House is to provide support and temporary lodging
     adjacent to the David Grant Medical Center (DGMC) for patients with critical medical
     problems who use the DGMC facilities and their families.
     1.4. Section 906 (10 U.S.C. 2493) of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999
     (Public Law 105-261) provides the basic responsibilities, procedures, and practices for all Air
     Force Fisher Houses which are activities of the AFFHF, and Air Force Central
     Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) administered by the Air Force Fisher House
     Fund Board (AFFHFB).
     1.5. The AFFHF provides and administers the funds for the operations, maintenance, and
     improvement of Air Force Fisher Houses at Air Force installations on behalf of the Secretary
     of the Air Force. The AFFHF is funded by a transfer of funds from the disestablished Air
     Force Fisher House Trust Fund; a supplemental Operations and Maintenance appropriation, a
     transfer of NAF assets from former Fisher House NAFIs; gifts, donations, contributions, and
     grants; proceeds from the disposal of any owned, donated, or acquired property; and fees and
     charges.
     1.6. Installation level Fisher House NAFIs were dissolved and their NAF assets were
     transferred to AFFHF sub-activity accounts effective 28 February 1999. Funds in these sub-
     activity accounts will continue to be managed at the installation level subject to AFFHFB
     oversight.
     1.7. Fisher Houses are designed for use by family members of hospitalized military members
     or veterans. However, military members or veterans undergoing outpatient treatment who do

     used for the purpose specified in the offer of gift.
     3.2. A PO or other donors may offer an unconditional monetary gift offer or property. If

4. Funding.
     4.1. The Air Force Fisher House Fund (AFFHF) is an Air Force Supplemental Mission
     Support NAFI. Its operations at installation level are carried out through subaccounts of the
     AFFHF. Installation subaccount NAF revenues come from service charges collected from
     authorized personnel residing in the houses, sundry sales, interest income, donations,
     contributions, and other income. NAFs may be accumulated to maintain stable rates and to
     provide for capital expenditures such as room refurbishment and amenity upgrades.
     4.2. Single Fund Source. To prevent budgeting for the same expenditure using APFs and
     NAFs, the 60MDG/CC must use a single fund source for each element of operation,
TRAVISAFBI65-102 23 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          7


   maintenance, repair, and construction costs. When the fund source is APF, NAFs are not
   authorized and vice-versa unless a waiver to the fund source is granted.
      4.2.1. SAF/FMC approves requests for fund source waivers. The 60th Force Support
      Squadron submits requests for exceptions to these funding policies to HQ AMC/A1 for
      review. HQ AMC/A1 then forwards recommendations for approval to AFSVA,
      USAF/ILV and SAF/FMCEB, in turn.
      4.2.2. Each organization level may disapprove requests without forwarding the request to
      the next organization level. Only recommendations for approval should be forwarded to
      the next higher organization level.
5. Adopted Forms. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
