                                            Chapter 1

                             GENERAL PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) is to
provide leadership at all levels with an evaluation of a unit’s ability to perform key logistics
processes in a safe, standardized, repeatable, and technically compliant manner. Major
Commands (MAJCOM) will conduct LCAP evaluations at subordinate units to assess their
proficiency in key logistics processes. This AFI standardizes the LCAP breadth, depth,
frequency, grading, and reporting requirements. The LCAP is focused on evaluating the
effectiveness of personnel and logistics processes. The LCAP will:
    1.1.1. Evaluate units across the entire logistics enterprise to a common Air Force standard.
    1.1.2. Establish oversight, evaluation, and internal audit processes to effectively identify,
    prevent, and resolve deficiencies. It will also identify issues which are beyond the unit’s
    control that require headquarter’s resolution.
    1.1.3. Establish a robust trend review, comprehensive causal analysis, and open sharing of
    lessons learned across all units.
    1.1.4. Establish standard AF functional checklists across the logistics enterprise focused on
    personnel proficiency and process effectiveness.
1.2. Scope. The LCAP applies to AF units performing duties across the full spectrum of
logistics. This includes conventional force logistics units; nuclear and nuclear support units;
space; special operations; wholesale-level procurement, sustainment, and maintenance; logistics
support to research, test, and development units; and logistics support to special access programs.
It does not include medical logistics, civil engineering logistics, and pre-award contracting
functions.
    1.2.1. The overlap in scope between LCAP evaluations and Inspector General (IG)
    Inspections (i.e., Unit Compliance Inspections (UCIs)) will be minimized to the maximum
    extent practical. LCAP evaluations focus heavily on personnel proficiency to verify
    compliance with established policy and procedures. However, it is possible to have some
    duplication especially in functional areas that are more process oriented versus task oriented.
       1.2.1.1. When LCAP evaluations are conducted simultaneously with UCIs the LCAP
       evaluation will remain a separate entity. All provisions of this AFI shall apply.
       1.2.1.2. LCAP evaluations will not be conducted simultaneously with Nuclear Surety
       Inspections.
1.3. Logistics Activities. This instruction provides policy and establishes program requirements
for logistics activities performing the following functions:
    1.3.1. Supply Chain Management Functions. Consists of the end-to-end processes and
    functions of the logistics enterprise which include: Plan; Source; Make and Repair; and
    Deliver and Return.
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                               5

          1.3.2.3.3. Training of logistics personnel to perform their assigned duties in a safe,
          standardized, repeatable, and technically compliant manner.
    1.3.3. Contractor Managed Organizations. Contracted units performing the logistics
    functions described in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3 present unique challenges for conducting
    LCAP evaluations. The following procedures will be followed for Contractor Managed
    Organizations:
       1.3.3.1. If the provisions of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) or Performance
       Plan (P-Plan) allow for higher headquarters direct evaluation (i.e., on-site observation by
       evaluators) of the contracted organization, then the LCAP evaluation shall be conducted
       in conjunction with the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) in accordance with
       the guidance contained in this instruction and governing Quality Assurance directives.
       NOTE: For the purpose of this instruction, COR is synonymous with Quality Assurance
       Evaluator (QAE) and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).
       1.3.3.1. (AMC) The COR is also synonymous with the Quality Assurance Representative.
          1.3.3.1.1. LCAP evaluators conducting direct evaluation of the contracted
          organization must be properly trained in QAE functions and must coordinate closely
          with the COR on all aspects of the evaluation.
       1.3.3.2. If direct evaluation of the contractor managed organization is not permitted by
       the PWS or P- Plan, then follow the below guidance.
          1.3.3.2.1. Evaluate the contractor’s performance by conducting a joint surveillance
          with the COR and/or examining the COR documentation as compared to the Quality
          Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) or P-Plan for that contract.
          1.3.3.2.2. Evaluate that the COR is providing effective oversight of the contract by
          ensuring that the QASP or P-Plan is being followed as written, that the
          multifunctional team periodically reviews the plan and initiates modifications to the
          plan when needed, and that it adheres to applicable governing directives.
          1.3.3.2.3. Evaluate the PWS requirements and service summary objectives against
          the organizational objectives to ensure they are adequately written to satisfy mission
          requirements.
          1.3.3.2.4. Ensure the Contracting Officer and COR review findings associated with
          contractor performance prior to inclusion in the LCAP Unit Report. NOTE: Only
          the Contracting Officer can take formal action against the contractor for non-
          compliance or direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during evaluations.

                 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS AND METHODOLOGY

3.1. Evaluated Units . LCAP evaluations will be conducted on logistics activities performing
functions described in paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3.
        3.1.1. (Added) (AMC) TDY/Host Base Personnel. Any personnel not assigned to the
        evaluated unit, but working with the unit during an evaluation, will be subject to an
        evaluation. Their evaluations will count towards the host unit. This includes any
        observed events or conditions with safety implications or technical violations.
3.2. Evaluation Notification. LCAP evaluations will be conducted on a minimal notice basis.
The LCAP Unit Coordinator will be notified prior to the start of an evaluation no earlier than:
     3.2.1. Active Duty (AD) Units: Forty-five (45) calendar days.
     3.2.2. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Units: One-hundred and eighty (180) calendar days.
     3.2.3. Associate Units (Classic, Active, or ARC associate units): Follow the notification rule
     of the host unit.
3.3. Evaluation Frequency. LCAP evaluations will be conducted on a recurring cycle based on
the type of unit being evaluated. LCAP evaluation intervals are:
     3.3.1. AD Units: Not to exceed 24 months.
     3.3.2. Nuclear Capable and Nuclear Support Units: Not to exceed 18 months. NOTE:

     3.3.3. ARC Units: Not to exceed 48 months. NOTE: The 48-month frequency is the
     standard for Air National Guard units given augmentation by the Lead Commands as
     described in paragraph 2.2.8.2. The Director, ANG, may extend the frequency to a
     maximum of 60 months on a case-by-case basis for special circumstances, including lead
     command or ANG resource limitations that prevent assembling a sufficient LCAP team.
     Approval authority cannot be delegated.
     3.3.4. Associate Units (Classic, Active, or ARC associate units): Follow the frequency
     interval of the host unit.
     3.3.5. Follow-up Evaluations. Logistics activities or focus areas rated “Marginal” or
     “Unsatisfactory” will have a follow-up evaluation within 180 days of the conclusion of the
     initial LCAP evaluation. The follow-up evaluation team shall be tailored to properly re-
     assess the “Marginal” or “Unsatisfactory” activities/areas.
        3.3.5.1. (Added) (AMC) The following are also eligible for follow-up evaluations:
                3.3.5.1.1. (Added) (AMC) Logistics activities rated “Satisfactory” or better, but
                with a substandard sub-activity, area, or program.
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                             11


              3.3.5.1.2. (Added) (AMC) Logistics activities rated “Satisfactory” or better that
              were downgraded as the result of a “Team Chief Review” (see paragraph
              3.9.2.1.).
              3.3.5.1.3. (Added) (AMC) For AMC or AMC gained units; AMC/A4 will be the
              decision authority for follow-up evaluations.
3.4. Evaluation Focus Areas. The below areas are used to group unit deficiencies in the LCAP
Unit Report for focusing management attention where needed.
   3.4.1. Compliance with Nuclear Surety Standards (if applicable). Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for ensuring nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, and nuclear weapon
   related materiel are safe, secure, and reliable. Ensure weapon system safety rules,
   owner/user security, and reliability standards are strictly adhered.
   3.4.2. Qualified and Proficient Workforce. Ensure a properly trained and qualified
   workforce is maintained to accomplish the mission. Commanders are responsible for
   ensuring unit personnel receive the proper training to accomplish the mission. Factors that
   impede the unit’s ability to adequately achieve or maintain a qualified workforce should be
   identified to higher headquarters.
   3.4.3. Compliance with Technical Orders (TO), Instructions, Manuals, and Directives.
   Personnel at all levels are responsible and accountable for enforcing mandatory standards.
   Ensure all applicable TOs, instructions, manuals, and directives are complete, current, and
   used. This includes ensuring required forms and records are properly completed and
   maintained in accordance with applicable directives for any logistics-related activity.
   3.4.4. Compliance and Management of Safety Programs.            Personnel at all levels are
   responsible for minimizing risk to equipment and personnel.
   3.4.5. Facilities and Equipment Condition. Supervisors at all levels are required to ensure
   adequate facilities and equipment required to accomplish the mission are available and
   properly maintained. Commanders are responsible for identifying facility and equipment
   conditions and shortfalls that impact mission accomplishment to the appropriate
   agency/higher headquarters.
   3.4.6. Asset Accountability. Personnel at all levels are responsible for ensuring the proper
   accountability of tools, materiel, equipment, and weapons. This includes ensuring Positive
   Inventory Control (PIC) of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, Nuclear Weapons
   Related Materiel (NWRM), classified assets, CCI/COMSEC, equipment, serialized control
   items, small arms, conventional munitions, and sensitive related materiel. It includes
   ensuring that accurate logistics data is reflected for the materiel in appropriate functional
   information management systems.
3.5. LCAP Methodology. The LCAP will be conducted through the use of evaluations,
inspections, and observations.
   3.5.1. Evaluations. Represents the direct evaluation of a logistics action, inspection, or
   training conducted/performed by an individual or team. Evaluations are used to evaluate job
   proficiency, degree of training, and compliance with technical data or instructions. Any
   individual performing, supervising, or evaluating logistics tasks is subject to a direct
   evaluation. LCAT personnel performing evaluations must have sufficient subject matter
12                                                   AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011


     expertise to properly and safely conduct the evaluation. Refer to Attachment 3 for specific
     procedures on conducting and rating evaluations. Evaluations include:
        3.5.1.1. Personnel Evaluations (PE). A PE is the direct evaluation of an individual or
        team conducting/performing a logistics action. PEs may be conducted on task-oriented
        functions such as equipment maintenance as well as process-oriented functions such as
        vehicle dispatch.
        3.5.1.2. Evaluator Proficiency Evaluations (EPE). An EPE is the direct evaluation of
        a Quality Assurance (QA) individual or any individual performing a quality/compliance
        assurance function in a unit.
        3.5.1.3. Trainer Proficiency Evaluations (TPE). A TPE is the direct evaluation of a
        unit instructor/trainer to determine their ability to teach accurately and sufficiently.
        TPEs also assess weapon system, equipment or process knowledge; teaching methods
        and techniques; the ability to operate trainers; and adequacy and effectiveness of training
        programs. Any individual training personnel on a task or process is subject to a TPE.
        3.5.1.4. Trainer Maintenance Proficiency Evaluations (TMPE). A TMPE is the
        direct evaluation of unit personnel who maintain nuclear weapon training
        systems/facilities to assess their ability to sustain the systems.
     3.5.2. Inspections. Represents inspections of equipment and processes, often through the
     use of LCAP functional checklists, to ensure compliance with established standards.
     Inspections are rated as “Pass” or “Fail”.
        3.5.2.1. Quality Verification Inspection (QVI). A QVI is an inspection of equipment
        condition or a process after an inspection, repair action, or process has been completed by
        a technician or supervisor to assess if it was properly completed. The QVI finding should
        reflect deficiencies by the individual who accomplished the task and identify specific
        discrepancies.
        3.5.2.2. Special Inspections (SI). SIs are inspections not covered by QVIs or
        Evaluations and may include, but are not limited to, inspections of: aircraft and
        equipment forms, document control procedures and file plans, consolidated tool kits,
        inventory controls, TO files, vehicle inspections, housekeeping, safety practices, FOD
        program, and other interest items identified by Headquarters Air Force and Lead/C-
        MAJCOMs. SIs may be compliance or proficiency oriented.
     3.5.3. Observations. Represents observed events or conditions with safety implications or
     technical violations not related to an evaluation or inspection that are considered unsafe, not
     in accordance with established procedures, or in the case of equipment, unfit to operate.
        3.5.3.1. Detected Safety Violation (DSV). A DSV is an observed unsafe act by an
        individual. The LCAT evaluator must stop the unsafe act immediately. Do not document
        a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a direct evaluation since the unsafe act
        automatically results in a “Fail” rating. Annotate the failure with “Safety” when a safety
        violation is committed during an evaluation.
        3.5.3.2. Technical Data Violation (TDV). A TDV is an observation of any person
        performing maintenance or another logistics process without the required technical data
        present at the job site and in use. The technician must have knowledge of all general
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                                13


       directives associated with the job prior to performing the task. However, these directives
       do not need to be present at the job site. Do not document a separate TDV on an
       individual undergoing a direct evaluation since failure to use technical data automatically
       results in a “Fail” rating. Annotate the failure with “Tech Data” when a TDV is
       committed during an evaluation.
       3.5.3.3. Unsatisfactory Condition Report (UCR). A UCR is an unsafe or
       unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to the work center supervisor.
       UCRs will be documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the
       condition.
3.6. Findings. Findings are validated deficiencies and will be tracked at the appropriate level
until resolved.
   3.6.1. Major Finding. Any deficiency that results or could result in widespread or significant
   mission impact or failure. Major findings are tracked and closed out at the MAJCOM level.
   3.6.2. Minor Finding. Any deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has minor
   mission impact. Minor findings are tracked and closed out at the installation level.
3.7. LCAP Checklists.
   3.7.1. LCAP functional checklists are developed and published by AF/A4L in coordination
   with Lead MAJCOMs and posted on the AF Portal in the LCAP Community of Practice
   (CoP).
   3.7.2. Checklists serve as a guide for evaluated units and are not all-inclusive nor do they
   limit the flexibility of LCAT evaluators to address other logistics processes in a unit.
   3.7.3. Critical and Non-Critical Checklist Items. Checklist items will be identified as critical
   or non-critical depending on the process or task.
       3.7.3.1. Definition of Critical: Items identified as key result areas for successful mission
       accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-compliance would affect
       system reliability or result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or litigation.
       Failure to comply with processes or tasks identified as critical could result in significant
       mission impact or failure. Failure to meet any “critical” checklist item will result in the
       task/process being rated “Fail”.
       3.7.3.2. Definition of Non-Critical: Areas that require special vigilance and are
       important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-
       compliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result
       in injury, unnecessary cost, or possible litigation.
3.8. Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL). AQLs will be used to minimize subjectivity in the
LCAP evaluation. An AQL denotes the maximum allowable number of “non-critical” checklist
items or “minor” evaluation discrepancies that a task, process or product may receive and still be
rated “Pass”.
   3.8.1. Failure to meet an AQL standard will result in a task/process rating of “Fail”.
   3.8.2. Checklist AQLs will be annotated on the individual checklist.
   3.8.3. Evaluation AQLs are found in Table A3.1.
14                                                  AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011


3.9. LCAP Grading . Consistent with LCAP’s purpose to evaluate a unit’s ability to perform
key processes in a safe and compliant manner, units will receive an overall grade based on a five-
tier grading scale.
     3.9.1. Grades will be reported for the lowest reasonable level of an organization based on the
     scope of the evaluation. It shall also be accomplished across the evaluated unit’s chain of
     command up to the Wing-level or equivalent. Associate units will receive one grade and one
     unit report. The unit grade will be part of the LCAP Unit Report using the format in
     Attachment 2.
     3.9.1. (AMC) For Classic and Active Associate units, a copy of the report will be sent to both
     owning MAJCOMs.
        3.9.1.1. (Added) (AMC) Combined Tool Rooms: For units with a combined tool room
        supporting more than one squadron, the tool room findings will be counted against the
        MXG.
     3.9.2. The LCAT Team Chief will assign ratings that accurately reflect observed
     performance. The Team Chief will use the described scoring methodology as the starting
     point for determining unit grades. However, the grading criteria is designed as a guide and is
     not a substitute for the judgment of the Team Chief. When the Team Chief ratings differ
     from the established grading criteria, the rationale will be explained in the LCAP Unit
     Report.
     3.9.2. (AMC) When assigning ratings that accurately reflect observed performance, the
     LCAP Team Chief should give extra consideration to those units who earn a large number of
     Deductions relative to the grade assigned. Note: Refer to AMC LCAP team chief book for
     additional details
     3.9.3. The Five-Tier Grading Scale is:

Table 3.1. Grading Scale.
                              Outstanding           95 - 100%
                              Excellent             90 - 94.99%
                              Satisfactory          80 - 89.99%
                              Marginal              70 - 79.99%
                              Unsatisfactory        0 - 69.99%
3.10. LCAP Scoring. The overall score will be determined by calculating a baseline score and
then deducting for penalties.
     3.10.1. Baseline Score. The baseline score is calculated by dividing the total number of
     passed events by the total of all events. Events are defined as Evaluations (paragraph 3.5.1)
     and Inspections (paragraph 3.5.2). Do not include observations in the baseline score.
     3.10.2. Deductions. Deductions are calculated by assessing a .5% penalty for each
     observation as defined in paragraph 3.5.3 and repeat LCAP findings. A repeat finding is
     defined as any identified “Major” finding from the previous LCAP evaluation. Refer to
     Attachment 4 for a score calculation example.
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                           15


  3.10.2. (AMC) Repeat findings are further defined as “Major” findings as part of processes;
  not just individual events. They are normally widespread and systemic issues that could lead
  to significant mission impact or failure. Repeat findings may also include observations. The
  Team Chief will make the final determination of chargeable repeat findings.
     3.10.2.1. (Added) (AMC) For the first LCAP cycle, the previous LSEP report will be
     used to identify repeat findings.
  3.10.3. For nuclear units, each condition resulting in, or meeting the criteria for, an
  “Unreliable Nuclear Weapon”, “Unsafe Environment”, or “Insecure Environment” as defined
  in TO 11N-25-1, Department of Defense Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection System,
  Section 3-2.2 will be treated as a .5% deduction as defined in paragraph 3.10.2. Each of
  these conditions will be reported as a Major Finding as defined in paragraph 3.6 and
  annotated with “UNACCEPTABLE CONDITION THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE
  ATTENTION.”
16                                                    AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011

                                             Attachment 3
                                  EVALUATION PROCEDURES

A3.1. General Evaluation Guidance. The procedures in this attachment apply to all
evaluations including nuclear tasks. Evaluation requirements specific to nuclear LCAT
evaluations are clearly identified.
     A3.1.1. Evaluators can conduct evaluations on any personnel who perform, supervise,
     inspect, evaluate, instruct, or train a logistics task. This includes nuclear weapons, nuclear
     weapon systems, warheads, nuclear support equipment and/or their components.
     A3.1.2. The term “technician/team” used in this attachment includes personnel who are
     supervisors, evaluators, trainers, and inspectors. It also includes personnel who instruct a
     technical task involving on-equipment task performances governed by a technical data
     training reference.
     A3.1.3. Evaluations will encompass tool usage, general maintenance practices, technical
     data usage, conduct of logistics processes, adherence to instructions/manuals/directives,
     nuclear surety practices, etc.
     A3.1.4. Evaluators may conduct an evaluation while using training items or in training
     facilities.
     A3.1.5. To the maximum extent possible, before conducting an evaluation, evaluators must
     verify the technician/team under evaluation is task certified in their Training Business Area,
     Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP), or AF FORM 2435, Load Training and
     Certification Document. This verification must be completed before the final grade is
     validated.
     A3.1.6. When selecting tasks for evaluation, evaluators must ensure they evaluate a variety
     of tasks involving different equipment and/or different actions for each technician/team. In
     addition, they must ensure evaluations cover various systems for which a unit is qualified.
     A3.1.7. To the maximum extent possible, evaluators will have their own copy of technical
     data/instructions available for the task being evaluated. If unavailable, the evaluator will
     confirm the currency of the technical data/instructions used to accomplish the task.
     A3.1.8. Evaluations will only be accomplished during actual task performance or while
     inspecting equipment or documentation. Evaluators will not participate in the task being
     performed.
     A3.1.9. Evaluators must afford every reasonable opportunity for technicians/teams to detect
     a defect or deficiency.
     A3.1.10. Nuclear weapons maintenance and handling evaluations may be performed on
     trainers or in training facilities. When using trainers, the unit must treat the trainer as if it is
     War Reserve (WR). See T.O. 11N-25-1, Department of Defense Nuclear Weapons Technical
     Inspection System for additional guidance concerning this information.
     A3.1.11. Evaluations on nuclear weapons maintenance and handling certifiable tasks
     identified in AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance Procedures must be performed by
     7-level or above, Job Qualification Standard (JQS) qualified evaluators.
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                               23


A3.2. Evaluation Briefing. Before starting an evaluation, the evaluator will conduct a briefing
with the technician/team. During the briefing, the evaluator must advise the technician/team of
the following:
   A3.2.1. The evaluation starts when the technician/team begins the task, or portion of the task
   to be evaluated, and is completed when the entire task or previously determined portion of
   the task is finished. For tasks already in progress, the evaluator will notify the
   technician/team they are under evaluation and brief them as soon as practical.
   A3.2.2. All logistics actions performed are subject to evaluation.
   A3.2.3. Safety and security should not be compromised for any reason.
   A3.2.4. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall award
   of “Pass” or “Fail”.
   A3.2.5. The technician/team can request permission from the evaluator to take short breaks
   not to exceed 15 minutes during the evaluation. The evaluator will use professional
   discretion to approve or disapprove the request.
   A3.2.6. The technician/team must notify the evaluator of applicable information that could
   affect the task evaluation.        This includes any Previously Complied With (PCW)
   task(s)/step(s). If the technician/team fails to do this, they may be charged with an error for
   requirements that were omitted during the task performance that were not identified as PCW
   prior to the evaluation critique.
   A3.2.7. The evaluator may ask questions to determine technician/team knowledge of the task
   under evaluation. The technician/team may use technical references to answer any questions.
   A3.2.8. The technician/team is responsible for completion of all tasks and related actions.
   The evaluator's presence does not shift this responsibility.
   A3.2.9. The technician/team may ask for technical help from personnel/agencies normally
   available during day-to-day operations. The LCAT evaluator will use professional discretion
   to determine if the request and time delay are reasonable.
   A3.2.10. For nuclear LCAT evaluations, the evaluator will not be considered the second
   person to satisfy the Two-Person Concept.
A3.3. Evaluator Task Performance Actions. During every task evaluation, the evaluator must
detect and correct, to the maximum extent possible, all errors. The evaluator must select the best
option available to correct the situation. It may be advantageous to correct minor errors during
the critique phase; other errors may warrant immediate correction. The evaluator should consider
giving the technician/team the opportunity to make decisions on courses of action on their own
using the resources available to them.
   A3.3.1. All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall grade
   using the criteria listed in Table A3.1.
   A3.3.2. Detected errors during the evaluation will be classified as “Major” or “Minor” using
   the criteria listed in Table A3.2.
   A3.3.3. Technicians/Teams that commit any error classified as a “Major” in Table A3.2
   anytime during the evaluation process will be rated “Fail”.
24                                                   AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011


     A3.3.4. If the evaluator determines during the evaluation that a technician/team cannot
     correctly or safely accomplish the task without excessive outside intervention or assistance,
     the evaluator must apply the following guidelines:
        A3.3.4.1. Terminate the task immediately.
        A3.3.4.2. Notify the       technician's/team’s   work     center   supervisor   or   Flight
        CC/Superintendent.
A3.4. Evaluator Post-Task Performance Actions. The evaluator must perform the following
actions as soon as practical after the evaluation:
     A3.4.1. Award an overall rating of “Pass” or “Fail” for the evaluated task using guidance in
     Table A3.1.
     A3.4.2. Critique the technician/team on the entire task.        The critique must cover the
     following:
        A3.4.2.1. A detailed explanation of each detected error including who received it,
        category, mission impact and correct procedures.
        A3.4.2.2. A review of the technician’s/team’s strengths and weaknesses.
        A3.4.2.3. Recommended methods of task accomplishment.
        A3.4.2.4. An exchange of ideas and techniques.
        A3.4.2.5. For failed evaluations, notify the technician's/team’s work center supervisor or
        Flight CC/Superintendent and identify the substandard performance that contributed to
        the rating.
     A3.4.3. Report detected observations outside the scope of the evaluation as a Detected
     Safety Violation (DSV), Technical Data Violation (TDV), or Unsatisfactory Condition
     Report (UCR), based on applicability. For these detected observations, the evaluator will:
        A3.4.3.1. Correct the observation immediately, if possible.
        A3.4.3.2. Document all facts surrounding the observation for report purposes.
        A3.4.3.3. Notify LCAT leadership of the observation for verification purposes.
        A3.4.3.4. Ensure the verified observation is included in the initial report.
     A3.4.4. Render an Evaluation Report using an AF Form 2419, Routing and Review of
     Quality Control Reports, or AF Form 2420, Quality Control Inspection Summary, or a
     computer-generated report that meets the forms’ minimum requirements.
A3.5. Additional Trainer Proficiency Evaluation (TPE) Guidelines. In addition to the
general guidelines described in paragraphs A3.1 thru A3.4, when conducting TPEs, LCAT
evaluators will:
     A3.5.1. Coordinate with unit instructors/trainers on which tasks are acceptable for TPEs.
     A3.5.2. Brief the following items to the instructor/trainer under evaluation:
        A3.5.2.1. The instructor/trainer must prevent/immediately correct the following: Weapon
        System Safety Rules (WSSR) violations, weapon system code compromises, Two-Person
        Concept violations, significant security violations or safety errors which could result in
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                                25


       serious injury to personnel, failure to use required technical data during the logistics
       process and any error which could result in potential/imminent equipment damage or
       personnel injury.
       A3.5.2.2. The instructor/trainer must correct other errors before completing the training
       session. This correction may include anything from verbal feedback to re-
       accomplishment of the erroneous procedures. The training session is considered complete
       when the instructor/trainer critiques the student’s performance.
       A3.5.2.3. Evaluators will not generate an evaluation report on the trainees. The
       evaluation will focus solely on the instructor’s/trainer’s proficiency and the efficiency of
       training delivered. Errors committed by the trainees will have no impact on the
       evaluation unless the instructor/trainer does not detect and correct the errors.
       A3.5.2.4. Evaluators will consider the instructor’s/trainer’s familiarity with procedures,
       use of and adherence to technical data and lesson plans, verbal skills, ability to clearly
       and precisely describe procedures, and the degree of control over the trainees.
       A3.5.2.5. A TPE will be rated “Fail” if the instructor/trainer does not detect, correct, and
       provide/defer re-training for any error classified as “Major” using criteria described in
       Table A3.2 of this instruction. Additionally, the evaluation will also be rated as “Fail” if
       an incomplete training process takes place such as failing to instruct critical portions of
       the task.
A3.6. Trainer Maintainer Proficiency Evaluations (TMPE ). MAJCOMs with nuclear-
capable units evaluate unit trainer maintainers to assess their ability to operate/maintain unit
nuclear trainers. Nuclear capable MAJCOM LCAT evaluators will follow the evaluation
procedures described in this attachment to conduct TMPEs.

a compromise of a no-lone zone or critical component(s) (Actual or Possible).
6. Significant Security Violations. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in
compromise of the weapon system, subsystem, or support equipment (Actual or Possible).
7. Failure to have available and comply with required technical data while performing an action.
8. Individual not trained/certified on task being performed.
9. Failure to accomplish a critical portion of a task that results in incomplete task performance
by not verifying the operability/serviceability of support equipment, subsystem, or weapon
system component.
10. Failure to document actions/conditions that, as a reasonable expectation, would result in
erroneous equipment availability status or weapon system status; or create a significant
safety/security deficiency.
11. Failure to recognize an unacceptable condition/test result that is cause for rejection of
equipment or prevents support equipment/system or weapon system component from operating.
12. Failure to recognize an acceptable condition/test that caused rejection of serviceable
components or equipment.
13. Clearly demonstrated inability to successfully complete the task due to a lack of job
knowledge. Cannot correctly or safely accomplish task without excessive outside intervention.
14. Failure to follow custody transfer procedures.

15. A condition which creates an unreliable nuclear weapon, and unsafe environment, or an
insecure environment as defined in T.O. 11N-25-1, Department of Defense Nuclear Weapons
Technical Inspection System, Section 3-2.2.
AFI20-111_AMCSUP_I 15 MARCH 2011                                                               27



16. A condition that creates an unreliable missile, missile component, equipment item or an
unsafe or insecure environment.

17. Failure to ensure proper storage, shipment and positive inventory control of nuclear
weapons, nuclear weapon systems, Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM), classified
assets, Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI)/ Communication Security (COMSEC), equipment,
serialized control items, weapons, and sensitive assets.
18. Significant system input errors. Errors that, as a reasonable expectation based on quantity or
sensitivity of the input(s) would result in significant loss of data accuracy.
MINOR ERRORS:
1. An error that does not prevent a support equipment/weapon system component from being
used for its intended purpose, but would, as a reasonable expectation, have a detrimental effect
on the operational life of the component/equipment/system. This may include damage to
common hand tools due to misuse.
2. An error that, as a reasonable expectation, could require support equipment to be returned to
another agency for recalibration/reverification.
3. An error that lacks the seriousness to meet the criteria for a major error.
4. Failure to read a warning or caution is a minor error, provided the warning/caution is not
violated.

                        LCAP SCORE CALCULATION EXAMPLE

A4.1. During a particular LCAP evaluation, a unit is subjected to 150 Evaluations and
Inspections. Of those 150 events, 135 are rated as passed. Additionally, during the evaluation,
the LCAT observed 2 DSVs, 1 TDV and identified 1 repeat finding.
A4.2. To obtain the overall grade.
   A4.2.1. Calculate the unit’s baseline score. Baseline Score: 135 passed events divided by
   150 total events = 90%.
   A4.2.2. Calculate the deductions. Deductions: 4 penalties (2 DSVs + 1 TDV + 1 repeat)
   multiplied by .5% = 2%.
   A4.2.3. The unit overall grade is calculated by subtracting the deductions from the baseline
   score. Unit Overall Score: 90% baseline - 2% deductions = 88%.
   A4.2.4. Using the five-tier grading scale from paragraph 3.9.3, the unit is rated
   “Satisfactory.”
