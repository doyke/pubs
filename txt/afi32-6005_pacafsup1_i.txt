           UNACCOMPANIED HOUSING PHILOSOPHY AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Philosophy. This instruction provides policy for managing unaccompanied permanent party person-
nel housing. Emphasis on unaccompanied housing as a quality of life issue, and its impact on readiness
and retention, have driven new Department of Defense standards and priorities. The Air Force is fully
committed to increasing privacy and improving unaccompanied housing as quickly as resources allow.
    1.1.1. Customer expectations form the baseline for delivery of service.
    1.1.2. The guiding precept in quality unaccompanied housing is to create a residential community
    promoting pride, professionalism and personal dignity. Unaccompanied housing should be simple,
    durable and functional.

      1.4.5.2. Occupants shall be responsible for such routine maintenance, minor repair, and house-
      keeping as would be expected of tenants in private housing of similar type and value. Standards
      for occupant cleaning responsibility shall consider fair wear and tear. Responsibility for occupant
      cleaning will be minimized when the rooms are scheduled for change of occupancy maintenance
      and repair.
      1.4.5.3. Occupants shall account for their conduct in government controlled rooms, conserve util-
      ities according to energy conservation programs, report facility and furnishings maintenance
      needs, and follow fire, health, and safety instructions.
      1.4.5.4. (Added) At the time an individual is assigned to a dormitory, he/she will be issued two
      sets of bed linen (sheets and pillowcases). When dormitory washers and dryers are provided at no
      charge, it will be the occupant’s responsibility to maintain the linens. If linen replacement is
      required during dormitory occupancy, the occupant takes the unserviceable item(s) to the office
      making the initial issue of items for replacement. The organization may turn in unserviceable
      linen items to the base linen exchange or other organizations locally designated for disposal.
      When unaccompanied housing is terminated, the occupant shall return serviceable linen to the ini-
      tial issuing office, or the occupant may dispose of any unserviceable items. Note: this does not
      apply to basic training or pipeline student environments, where linen exchange service is still
      required and is not considered a student dormitory occupant’s responsibility.
   1.4.6. Occupant liability. Occupants shall be held liable for loss or damage to housing, equipment, or
   furnishings caused by the abuse or negligence of the occupants or their guests and for failure to satis-
   factorily clean an assigned room upon termination (10 U.S.C. 2775).
      1.4.6.1. The manager requests a report of survey be performed to determine liability when cost is
      $500 or greater, unless the individual volunteers to pay. Occupants' financial liability will be
      determined in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2775 and chapter 7 of DoD 7200.10-M.
      1.4.6.2. The authority to make deductions from a military member's pay sufficient to cover the
      cost of necessary repairs, replacements, or cleaning is contained in 10 U.S.C. 2775. Salary offset
      for civilian employees is authorized in section E, enclosure 3, of DoD Instruction 7045.18.
      1.4.6.3. The amount collected for loss or damage to UH shall be credited to the O&M account of
      the Military Department or Defense Agency concerned and shall be available for use for the same
      purpose and under the same circumstances as other funds in those accounts.

1.5. Housing Males and Females. Males and females may be assigned to the same building provided:
   1.5.1. Males and females do not share sleeping rooms or bathrooms. They may share semiprivate
   baths only when there are no available units to share with the same gender, the assignment is volun-
   tary and there are functioning locks on both the inside and outside of each door.
   1.5.2. Living rooms with kitchens between adjacent rooms or modules have functioning locks on
   both the inside and outside of each door.
   1.5.3. Joint use of laundry rooms, TV rooms, lounges, study, and exercise areas is authorized.
   1.5.4. Buildings with central bathrooms may be shared, provided:
      1.5.4.1. Male and female living areas are not intermingled. Clearly define and identify separate
      areas by using a floor, a wing, or one end of a hallway.
8                                                      AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


       1.5.4.2. Separate central bathrooms are an integral part of the defined area and are clearly desig-
       nated as male or female bathrooms.
       1.5.4.3. Corridors in the defined areas are part of the living area. Do not use common corridors
       for both sexes in the normal course of UH use, entrance and exit.
       1.5.4.4. Provide some form of fixed or free standing partition to clearly define the male or female
       living area, and prevent visual access by the opposite sex. Locked or barred doors are not
       required.
    1.5.5. Field Housing Conditions. In the event of military necessity or readiness, installation com-
    manders have authority to deviate from male and female housing policies as necessary to meet mis-
    sion requirements.
       1.5.5.1. Meet the above described privacy conditions to the extent possible during mobility
       deployments and exercises.
       1.5.5.2. When private facilities are not possible, use temporary partitions and time sharing of
       bathroom facilities as necessary.
       1.5.5.3. When private facilities are not possible, make every attempt to assign shared quarters
       only on a voluntary basis.

1.6. Smokers and Nonsmokers. Consider smoking and nonsmoking preferences in individual UH
room assignments. When assigning two people to the same room, assign smokers with smokers and non-
smokers with nonsmokers. If a smoker and nonsmoker are assigned to the same room, the rights of the
nonsmoker will prevail. Common areas are considered non-smoking.
    1.6.1. (Added) If a nonsmoker detects second-hand smoke regardless of its source, the rights of the
    nonsmoker will prevail. Installation commanders may designate dormitories as nonsmoking, if nec-
    essary, to eliminate second-hand smoke exposure. If dormitories are designated as nonsmoking, com-
    manders will make provisions for smokers through a segregated area that has separate ventilation.
    1.6.2. (Added) Reference AFI 40-102 and seek assistance from base environmental health techni-
    cians if air quality measurement is required.

1.7. Changes in Use. See AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities.
    1.7.1. Commanders may reallocate quarters between permanent party and transient use to achieve
    optimum utilization.
    1.7.2. MAJCOMs approve change in use of UH. MAJCOMs may delegate this authority to installa-
    tion commanders.
    1.7.3. The rated capacity of quarters is the minimum net square foot (NSF) standards (Table 3.1.) for
    the lowest grade officer (2nd Lieutenant) and airman (Airman Basic) in permanent party categories.
    Do not base rated capacity on how the quarters are assigned. Permanent party central latrine dormito-
    ries will be rated as single occupancy.

1.8. Inspections. It is Air Force policy to keep the number of UH inspections at the absolute minimum.
Installation commanders establish standards for their base (see Attachment 2).
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                      9


1.9. Tenant and Attached Units. The host base provides UH support to eligible tenant and attached
unit people whenever possible.
   1.9.1. Require support agreements in accordance with AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Require-
   ments, if a unit or element of one MAJCOM is located on or near an installation of another command.
   Require interservice support agreements if units of another service are located on or near an Air Force
   installation.
   1.9.2. The host base is the approving authority for tenant and attached unit UH BAQ authorizations.

1.10. Reporting Requirements. UH inventory and utilization reports justify allocating UH assets, con-
structing new quarters, and paying BAQ.
   1.10.1. Prepare reports on a DD Form 2085. Include Air Force Supplemental data and any MAJCOM
   data as required. These reports cover a six-month period with report close out as of 31 Mar (interim
   report) and a one-year period ending 30 Sep (final report).
   1.10.2. Use automated software to electronically produce and send the UPH Quality Performance
   Metric and supplemental data. Bases not having automated capability will manually compile the data
   and forward it to the MAJCOM.
   1.10.3. Unit commanders or consolidated dorm managers keep daily auditable records on UEQ occu-
   pancy and provide monthly occupancy reports to the housing flight chief for consolidation.
   1.10.4. Housing managers keep daily auditable records on UNCOQ/UOQ occupancy and permanent
   party people authorized to live off-base without BAQ. The housing office transmits the consolidated
   permanent party portion of the data plus any supporting information to the MAJCOM by the estab-
   lished due date.
   1.10.5. Housing flight chiefs and lodging managers brief the installation commander on utilization
   and occupancy of both permanent party and transient facilities to ensure proper allocation of quarters.
   1.10.6. MAJCOMs will:
       1.10.6.1. Check each installation report to make sure it is correct, valid, and complies with direc-
       tives and policy guidance.
       1.10.6.2. Send one copy of each installation UPH Quality Performance Metric with supporting
       data and one copy of the command summary UPH metric to arrive at HQ USAF/ILEH by 5 May
       and 5 November.

                                                 Chapter 2

                             UH ASSIGNMENTS AND TERMINATIONS

2.1. Private Room Implementation. The Air Force goal is private rooms for permanent party airmen
(E-1 through E-4's) by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2002. Interim UH assignment policy is needed to phase
implementation of private rooms, and minimize the impact on the military pay account for increased
housing allowances (BAQ, VHA, OHA). The transition phase period is as follows:
     2.1.1. Phased private dormitory room schedule:


                             Begin:        By (end of):
Central Latrines             now           ASAP
E-4s                         FY97          FY98
E-3s                         FY98          FY00
E-1s and E-2s                FY00          FY02

     2.1.2. To create extra dormitory space needed for Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel as private room
     assignments are phased in, use the following guidelines to vacate dormitories:
        2.1.2.1. First priority to move off-base is Priority 4 personnel when total space available (Priority
        3 and 4) occupancy exceeds 10 percent of total base dormitory assets. Give priority to the most
        junior person for retaining quarters.
        2.1.2.2. Second priority to move off-base is Priority 3 personnel when total space available (Pri-
        ority 3 and 4) occupancy exceeds 10 percent of total base dormitory assets. Give priority for
        retaining quarters to the most junior person.
        2.1.2.3. Last priority to move off-base are Priority 2 volunteers on the BAQ waiting list (all
        grades), with senior grades having priority. Total space required (Priority 1 and Priority 2) occu-
        pancy must exceed 90 percent of total base dormitory assets.
        2.1.2.4. In assigning shared dormitory space (rooms, kitchens, or bathrooms), follow paragraph
        1.5. for male-female housing policies. Other factors to consider include shiftwork, age, smoking
        and shared/common interests.
        2.1.2.5. Exceptions: MAJCOM commanders maintain flexibility in all assignment policies and
        may keep rooms at double occupancy until additional new dormitory space is provided at hous-
        ing-constrained locations both CONUS and OCONUS.
        2.1.2.6. (Added) Space available personnel assignment termination: When Priority 3 and Priority
        4 (space available) personnel must vacate the dormitory to make room for space required person-
        nel: give priority for retaining quarters to the most junior persons among all space available per-
        sonnel. For example, if there is an E-5 and an E-7 in the space available category, the E-5 would
        have priority to retain quarters and the E-7 would have to vacate quarters first. Ensure all Priority
        3 and Priority 4 personnel sign a statement acknowledging they are occupying UH on a space
        available basis and may be required to terminate quarters given 30 days notice. Additionally, Pri-
        ority 4 personnel must acknowledge in writing that all moves into and out of dormitory, including
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                       11


       local drayage and nontemporary storage of personal property, as well as cable TV and telephone
       reconnections will be at their own expense. The only exception is when these members are
       directed to move from an on-base assigned dormitory room to another on-base dormitory room for
       the convenience of the government
       2.1.2.7. (Added) Provisions for hardship BAH requests remain the same during the phase-in to
       private dormitory rooms (see paragraph 2.4.1.).

2.2. Unit Integrity. Unit integrity shall be maintained as long as it does not cause the base occupancy
rate to fall below 90 percent. If a basewide occupancy rate of 90 percent cannot be maintained due to unit
(squadron) integrity, group integrity may be implemented. To permit maintaining unit integrity, dormi-
tory assets will be distributed equitably among using organizations. When an individual arrives at a base
and dormitory space is not available with their unit’s dormitory, assign the individual to a hospitality room
or available space in another unit dormitory until space in the individual’s unit dormitory becomes avail-
able. If assigned to another unit’s dormitory, moves between dormitory rooms are considered govern-
ment-directed moves for the purpose of reimbursing an individual’s expenses to reconnect telephone and
cable television service.
2.2. (PACAF) Unit Integrity. Unit integrity shall be maintained at all times at PACAF bases. The goal
within PACAF is to maintain 100% unit integrity for improving mentoring, morale, and camaraderie with
in units. Unit integrity is defined as the assignment of personnel from an organization, squadron or similar
sized unit (i.e. detachment, GSU, etc) to adjacent rooms in a contiguous block of rooms in a single dormi-
tory. Individuals not accommodated in a single dormitory will be housed in adjacent rooms in a contigu-
ous block of rooms in the fewest number of other dormitories as possible. This definition applies to all
unaccompanied E1 - E6 personnel assigned to a wing/base dormitory including tenant units. Non-com-
missioned officers (NCOs) may be housed in separate dormitory campuses, but the NCOs must be housed
to meet the requirements and intent of dormitory unit integrity. NCO dormitories may have several units
assigned to them, but NCOs from the same unit must be housed in contiguous blocks of rooms. Hospital-
ity rooms are not counted in unit integrity due to their temporary use in housing airmen until permanent
rooms become available.
   2.2.1. If unit allocation of dormitory space is used, the housing flight chief will monitor space utiliza-
   tion rates between units and report recommended adjustments to the installation commander who
   ensures each unit receives an equitable share of required dormitory space based on their population of
   unaccompanied Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel (see paragraph 2.4.).
   2.2.1. (PACAF) To maintain unit integrity, dormitory assets will be distributed equitably among using
   organizations. When a member arrives at the installation and dormitory space is not available the unit
   dormitory, assign the member to a hospitality room or available space in another dormitory until space
   in the member’s unit dormitory becomes available. If assigned to another dormitory, moves between
   dormitory rooms are considered government-directed moves for the purpose of reimbursing an indi-
   vidual’s expenses to reconnect telephone and cable television service.
   2.2.2. The installation commander may establish UOQ and UNCOQ from available assets. When
   established, the Housing Flight manages these assets.
   2.2.2. (PACAF) If unit allocation of dormitory space is used, the housing flight chief will monitor
   space utilization rates between units and report recommended adjustments to the installation com-
12                                                         AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


     mander who ensures each unit receives an equitable share of required dormitory space based on their
     population of unaccompanied Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel (see paragraph 2.4.).
     2.2.3. (Added-PACAF) The installation commander may establish UOQ and UNCOQ from available
     assets. When established, the Housing Flight manages these assets.
     2.2.4. (Added-PACAF) Installation/Wing calculations for dormitory unit integrity shall consist of
     providing (1) the total number of personnel assigned to the dormitories and (2) the total number of
     personnel assigned in the dormitories according to the definition of unit integrity given at paragraph
     2.2.
        2.2.4.1. (Added-PACAF) Dormitory managers are the primary source of information for imple-
        menting and maintaining dormitory unit integrity. A strong dormitory management program will
        ensure proper accounting of residents and their associated units.
        2.2.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Bases may be requested to provide additional supporting information
        for unit integrity calculations. Data collection will be consistent the definition given in this supple-
        ment, but representation of the data in a visual format will be determined by the bases (i.e. Power-
        Point, Excel, etc.). A detailed explanation in a clear, concise manner will definitely speed
        understanding of the installation’s situations and plans for accomplishing goals.
        2.2.4.3. (Added-PACAF) To support the Executive Decision Support System (EDSS), installa-
        tions/wings shall be required to enter the total number of personnel assigned to the dormitories and
        the total number of personnel properly assigned to the dormitory according to the definition of unit
        integrity. The actual calculation of the percentage and trends will be conducted by EDSS. This
        data will be entered on a quarterly basis, but may be updated more frequently as needed.
            2.2.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Unit integrity will be the result of dividing the total number of per-
            sonnel properly assigned in the dormitories according to the definition of unit integrity by the
            total number of personnel assigned to the dormitories multiplied by 100%. The formula below
            clarifies the expression:




            2.2.4.3.2. (Added-PACAF) Unit Integrity ratings in EDSS are as follows:
            UNIT INTEGRITY DEFINITION
            Meets StandardsGreen100 – 95 %
            ProblemsYellow94.999 – 90%
            Not Meeting StandardsRed89.999 – 0 %

2.3. People Eligible for UH. The following personnel are eligible for assignment to the UOQ,
UNCOQ, and UEQ, according to their grade:
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                    13


  2.3.1. US military active duty people referenced in paragraph 2.4. (members with dependents sepa-
  rated for 30 days or less, and waiting for family members to arrive, are assigned to lodging quarters.)
  2.3.2. Civilian employees (as defined in Attachment 1) are generally expected to rely on the civilian
  community for housing support. Special considerations are:
     2.3.2.1. In the continental United States (CONUS), including Alaska and Hawaii, civilians are
     eligible only if required to live on base for reasons of military necessity.
     2.3.2.2. In foreign countries and US overseas areas (includes Alaskan isolated sites), they are eli-
     gible on a space available basis only if they are authorized living quarters allowance (LQA). Eli-
     gibility for housing is limited to five consecutive years occupancy at any given location (except
     for key or essential civilian employees). The installation commander may authorize extensions not
     to exceed 90 days when necessary to relieve hardships. Civilians must meet one of the following
     conditions:
         2.3.2.2.1. Required to live on base due to military necessity.
         2.3.2.2.2. Civilian community facilities and services do not exist, are substandard, or are
         restricted.
         2.3.2.2.3. Use of government quarters is required in the employee's contract.
         2.3.2.2.4. Excess to government needs.
  2.3.3. US Coast Guard, US Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
  tration (NOAA) people may be assigned quarters using priorities determined by the installation com-
  mander. Normally, full-time personnel are eligible on the same basis as civilian employees.
  2.3.4. Contract people and US college faculty who perform duties according to terms of a DoD con-
  tract stating that housing support must be provided and faculty of US colleges that provide Air Force
  sponsored on-base courses are eligible on the same basis as civilian employees.
  2.3.5. Other non-DoD US government employees are eligible on a space available basis in foreign
  countries and US Trusts and Territories, or as stated in official agreements.
  2.3.6. American Red Cross full-time employees are eligible on the same basis as civilian employees.
  These personnel are exempt from rental charges at foreign locations. In CONUS, US territories, and
  possessions, they must pay a rental fee based on the rates charged for comparable private rental hous-
  ing in the adjacent area (see AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property, and
  AFI 36-3105, Red Cross Activities Within the Air Force).
  2.3.7. Reserve and National Guard people on active duty for training (school tours, annual tours) and
  other than for training (man-days, activation, mobilization) are determined by the installation com-
  mander at the permanent duty station (PDS). Note: The PDS for members of reserve components
  ordered to active duty for training is the training location to which each member travels. The PDS
  for members ordered to active duty, other than for training, is their monthly drill or training station.
  The PDS for reserve members who have no monthly drill or training station, i.e., individual ready
  reserve (IRR), some individual mobilization augmentees (IMA), standby reservists, is the place
  from which they were called or ordered to active duty.
  2.3.8. Foreign people are eligible, provided they are:
14                                                       AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


        2.3.8.1. Engaged in, or sponsored through security assistance or other similar programs. These
        people are eligible on the same basis as US military personnel, or as stated in official agreements.
        2.3.8.2. Allied exchange people, who are eligible on the same basis as US military personnel.
        2.3.8.3. Foreign liaison people, who are eligible on a space available basis.
     2.3.9. The installation commander has the authority to allow groups such as youth and national orga-
     nizations, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, Civil Air Patrol, etc., to occupy UH on a space
     available basis and when considered to be in the best interests of the government.

2.4. Assignment Priorities. Quarters are assigned according to the following priorities:
     2.4.1. Priority 1. Space required. People required to live on base for reasons of military necessity,
     readiness, or discipline, including unmarried and unaccompanied married people who are incumbents
     of designated key and essential positions listed in the base supplement to AFI 32-6001, Family Hous-
     ing Management, and members with a bonafide hardship as determined by the installation com-
     mander. The requester's organization commander recommends approval or disapproval of the
     hardship request through the housing office to the installation commander who makes the final deci-
     sion. A signed copy of approval or disapproval actions must be provided to the housing office.
     Approval or disapproval authority for hardship assignments may be delegated no lower than the Sup-
     port Group Commander or equivalent.
     2.4.2. Priority 2. Space required. People in grades E-1 through E-4, with lower grade people having
     precedence where there are not enough quarters.
        2.4.2.1. Involuntarily separated people overseas (except Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam).
        2.4.2.2. Unaccompanied people in the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam not entitled to travel
        of family members and transportation of household goods.
        2.4.2.3. Unaccompanied people assigned to CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam isolated loca-
        tions identified in AFI 36-2110, Assignments.
        2.4.2.4. A military person married to another military person when geographically separated and
        not accompanied by any family members.
        2.4.2.5. People receiving BAQ differential (BAQ-DIFF).
     2.4.3. Priority 3. Space available. Unmarried (single) people in grades E-5 through E-9, beginning
     with the most junior person.
     2.4.4. Priority 4. Space available. Unaccompanied people in grades E-1 to E-9, beginning with the
     most junior person. Other people eligible for quarters on a space available basis.
     2.4.5. (Added) Priority 3 and Priority 4 personnel should not constitute more than ten percent of the
     total base dormitory capacity, unless the base has excess dormitory space and no additional housing
     allowances are paid to unaccompanied E-1 to E-4 personnel.

2.5. Assignment Priorities in Housing-Constrained Locations. When the Housing Market Analysis
(or equivalent document for Japan and Korea) reflects a deficit of adequate, affordable, and safe off-base
housing to support unaccompanied people in grades E-5 through E-9 at any location, the MAJCOM com-
mander may designate the affected grades of unaccompanied people as Priority 2, space required. The
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                     15


HMA must fully justify the lack of adequate housing for E-5 to E-9 personnel, and installations should
program to build unaccompanied housing for the affected grades (reference AFH 32-1084).

2.6. Assignment Procedures. Assignments to UOQs and UNCOQs are made by the housing office;
assignments to UEQs are made by the unit commander or CDM. Assignments are made as soon as possi-
ble after a person arrives at a base. Commanders/first sergeants or CDM will develop local procedures to
ensure that when individuals are assigned to a dormitory appropriate actions to start or stop BAQ are
taken.
   2.6.1. Hospitality Rooms. If permanent party rooms are not available for members arriving during
   nonduty hours, arrange temporary accommodations in a unit/CDM hospitality room if possible, or in
   lodging quarters. Newly-assigned enlisted individuals occupying lodging facilities will pay the daily
   lodging fee. Hospitality rooms are controlled and assigned by the units or CDM and used as tempo-
   rary quarters for arriving and departing people. The UPH Quality Performance Metric reflects a
   space(s) adjustment for the hospitality room(s).
   2.6.2. Make assignments in writing using AF Form 291, Unaccompanied Quarters Assign-
   ment-Termination Record, or automated product. The office or unit making the assignment keeps a
   record and a copy of any determination that may have been made by the installation commander.
   2.6.3. Require people to inspect their room and its contents during the initial room assignment pro-
   cess. Residents will acknowledge receipt of linen, condition of all furnishings, and assigned room by
   signing an AF Form 228, Furnishings Custody Receipt and Condition Report, or automated prod-
   uct. It is important to annotate any damage to the room and furnishings at this time.
   2.6.4. UH Waiting Lists. The housing flight chief will maintain the following lists for UOQs and
   UNCOQs; unit commanders or first sergeants or CDM will maintain these lists for UEQs.
       2.6.4.1. Waiting list for priority 2 personnel.
       2.6.4.2. List of priority 3 and 4 personnel currently assigned to quarters on a conditional, space
       available basis.

2.7. Involuntary Assignments. Involuntary assignments to UH are made when:
   2.7.1. Required for reasons of military necessity, readiness, or discipline. This applies to all person-
   nel and to adequate or inadequate quarters.
   2.7.2. Occupancy of adequate UH by Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel is below the 90 percent utili-
   zation rate. Involuntary assignment applies only to personnel in grades E-4 and below. The member
   must be given 30 days advanced written notice. Start with the most junior people. Note: Priority 2
   personnel will not be recalled solely to accommodate the change from the previous Priority 1, 2, and
   3 to the new Priority 1 & 2 occupancy goal.
   2.7.3. Make every effort to fill UH vacancies with newly arrived people. If projected unaccompanied
   people gains will not raise the occupancy rate to 90 percent within 120 days, the installation com-
   mander recalls those space required people who were previously authorized to live off base and
   receive BAQ, and who initialed statements A or B of Block III, AF Form 291 or automated product.
   2.7.4. Unless required for military necessity, readiness, or discipline, do not involuntary assign peo-
   ple in grades E - 4 and below under the following conditions:
16                                                         AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


        2.7.4.1. If an individual has official notification to depart the installation PCS.
        2.7.4.2. After the death of a sole family member.
        2.7.4.3. When a military person married to another military person lives off base and remains at
        the original location, while the spouse is reassigned to another base (see DoD Pay Manual
        [DoDPM]).
        2.7.4.4. If the installation commander decides that a significant hardship will be experienced. For
        example, financial hardship because the individual was not briefed and did not sign one of the
        statements in Block III of AF Form 291 or automated product and made permanent arrangements
        to live off base; financial hardship due to the forced sale of a home; or penalties according to the
        terms of an existing lease.
     2.7.5. Civilian employees may not be involuntarily assigned to occupy on-base quarters, except
     when required by military necessity. However, if adequate quarters are made available in foreign
     countries and US overseas areas on a permanent basis and are refused by the employee (DoD
     1400.25-M, Chapter 592, Overseas Allowances and Differentials), LQA is not authorized. Temporary
     quarters living expense will continue.

2.8. Termination Procedures.
     2.8.1. Terminate UH assignments in writing when:
        2.8.1.1. A person departs PCS, or ends active military service or civilian employment.
        2.8.1.2. A person gains BAQ at the with-dependent rate.
        2.8.1.3. A person has been authorized by proper authority to live off base with BAQ and VHA/
        OHA.
        2.8.1.4. A person in a higher priority (paragraph 2.4.) requires quarters. Terminate housing in
        reverse order of priority.
        2.8.1.5. A person voluntarily occupies inadequate UH and requests termination.
        2.8.1.6. A military or civilian person is away from their permanent duty station, and status is
        changed to PCS, missing in action, extended confinement, Absent Without Leave (AWOL), or
        captured by the enemy; or on the death of an individual. In these cases, see AFI 34-244, Disposi-
        tion of Personnel Property, regarding protection of personal property.
     2.8.2. Issue notice to terminate priority 3 and 4 personnel, giving the occupant prior written warnings
     and at least 30 days advance notice, when conduct is either contrary to accepted standards, or is
     adverse to military discipline.
     2.8.3. Occupants must schedule an inspection appointment with the unit making the original assign-
     ment or with CDM. Remove all personal property in the room before the final inspection. After the
     inspection, turn in the room key and pay any applicable fees or charges. Meet the requirements of
     paragrah 1.4.5 of this instruction. After these actions, quarters termination is certified by the appropri-
     ate manager (housing flight chief for UOQ or UNCOQ, the unit commander or first sergeant or CDM
     for UEQ) by issuing an AF Form 291 or automated product to the occupant. Start/stop BAQ as appro-
     priate.

2.9. Leased or Contract Housing. Installation commanders may obtain UH facilities through lease or
contract arrangements for priority 1 and 2 personnel when adequate government owned quarters are not
available. The requirement for leasing as stated in AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, must be
followed.
   2.9.1. Do not lease or contract quarters if:
       2.9.1.1. There is less than optimum utilization of all adequate on-base UH by priority 1 and 2 per-
       sonnel.
       2.9.1.2. Adequate quarters at the base are occupied by personnel in priorities 3 and 4.
       2.9.1.3. Adequate government quarters controlled by other Air Force bases or other services
       within the local commuting distance are available through a host-tenant, interservice support, or
       other agreement.
       2.9.1.4. Adequate and affordable civilian housing is available.
       2.9.1.5. If in the opinion of local police authorities through a climate assessment deem quarters
       unsafe.
       2.9.1.6. Excess transient facilities are available.
   2.9.2. If the need for quarters is long term and stable, a lease arrangement should be considered. If
   the need is short term or fluctuating, a contract arrangement should be considered.
   2.9.3. Quarters must meet the minimum adequacy standards of Chapter 3.
   2.9.4. Leased or contract quarters are government controlled housing and managed according to this
   instruction.
   2.9.5. Pay for lease or contract costs from operations and maintenance (O&M) funds. Base leasing
   capability on the availability of O&M funds. Limit costs to basic rent, utilities, and furnishings unless
   otherwise approved by the MAJCOM.
   2.9.6. Provide furnishings support.
   2.9.7. Housing flight chiefs will stop entitlement to partial BAQ to people assigned in leased or con-
   tract UH when the cost to the government exceeds person's BAQ plus VHA/ OHA.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                       ADEQUACY STANDARDS

3.1. Unaccompanied Housing Standards. Unaccompanied Housing supplies the space, privacy, and
furnishings required for comfortable living. Adequacy standards apply to all government owned or con-
trolled UH, unless otherwise specified by contract or lease between the Air Force and a private contractor.
Use Table 3.1. and Table 3.2. to decide whether UH is adequate for involuntary assignment of people to
on-base quarters. When the installation commander decides existing on-base UH is not adequate, perma-
nent party members may reside off base with allowances. Note: The minimum standards in Table 3.1.
pertain only to existing facility inventory. Any future construction or renovation project must meet the
minimum standards outlined in Table 3.2.
     3.1.1. UH standards are established to support the mission and maintain the quality of life for person-
     nel. However, until Congress changes public law, standards shall not be set that exceed those in this
     chapter if such action by itself would result in increased cost in BAQ and VHA/OHA. If there are
     excess UH facilities at a base, installation commanders will make sure all members are assigned sin-
     gle rooms before redesignating the space for another use or closing UH.
     3.1.2. The following two tables establish Air Force adequacy standards for existing inventory (2+2
     construction standard) and for future inventory constructed or converted in FY96 and later (1+1 con-
     struction standard).

NOTES:
  1. The net living area of a UOQ private room or suite is measured from the inside face of the room
  walls and includes all enclosed, unshared spaces and partitions.
   2. The net living area of enlisted dormitories is measured from the inside face of the room walls and
   is generally defined as any area of the floor that can accommodate an item of free-standing furniture.
   Items included in net living area calculations are:
   wardrobes (measured from outside face to outside face; closets (inside face of wall to inside face of
   wall); entry door swings that encroach upon the living area; and items of mechanical equipment such
   as fan-coil units, radiators, and baseboard heaters. Items excluded from net living area calculations
   are: furred-out columns, pilasters, and mechanical chases that extend into the living area and run from
   floor to ceiling; circulation space in vanity areas, where the vanity is clearly separated from the living
   area (where vanities occur within the living area, exclude the area occupied by the vanity. Measure
   such vanities as if they were wardrobes.).
   3. E-5 through E-9 are limited to one room if space available.
   4. After 1 Oct 96, there will be no separate standard for "career" E-4 versus "noncareer" E-4.
   5. All permanent party personnel occupying central latrine dormitories are authorized a private room.

NOTES:
  1. Open bay, maximum of 50 persons.
     2. For basic trainee, net area is one equal share of the open bay room measured to the inside of the
     peripheral walls.
     3. Net living area is generally defined as the ceiling area in the dormitory (sleeping) room, allocated
     for furniture and room circulation. Refer to the most recent edition of the Facility Design Guide for
     Enlisted Dormitories for specific areas to be included and excluded from net living area measure-
     ments/calculations.
     4. For officers, net living area is measured from the inside face of the suite's peripheral walls and
     includes all space including private bathroom, thereby enclosed.
     5. Combination living room/bedroom, private bathroom, and kitchen.
     6. Living room, bedroom, private bathroom and kitchen.
     7. E-7 thru E-9, when identified by the Housing Market Analysis as space required(i.e., there is no
     adequate off-base community housing), will be authorized two rooms or an entire 1+1 module.
     8. There is no separate standard for "career" versus "noncareer" E-4 personnel.
     9. E-1 thru E-4 PCS student personnel will be housed in accordance with the "Pipeline" Student Dor-
     mitory Construction Standard, i.e., two persons per 196 net sq ft room, one bath per room shared by
     not more than one other person.

3.2. Housing Constrained Locations Adequacy Standards. In areas where the installation Housing
Market Analysis (HMA) fully justifies a deficit of adequate and affordable off-base housing for any por-
tion of unaccompanied E-5 through E-9 personnel, the MAJCOM/CC may designate the affected grades
of unaccompanied personnel as Priority 2, space required. At these installations, grades affected in the
HMA will be housed on base at the appropriate standard provided in Table 3.1. and Table 3.2.. In dormi-
tories built to the 1+1 standard, space required E-7's through E-9's will be authorized the entire module.

3.3. Exceptions to Standards. The installation commander may waive standards for a period not to
exceed 30 days for reasons of military necessity or to satisfy mission needs. For periods exceeding 30
days, the MAJCOM Civil Engineer must give written approval to the base before standards are reduced or
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                   21


waived; notification must be sent to HQ USAF/CEH and include the basis for reducing or waiving stan-
dards, the estimated get-well date, and plan of action to correct.

3.4. Non-Air Force Installations. When Air Force people are assigned to an Army, Navy, or Marine
Corps installation, the adequacy standards set by that Service apply, except where otherwise provided for
in an official support agreement.

3.5. Dormitory Programming Criteria. For dormitory programming information, reference AFH
32-1084, Chapter 14.

3.6. Dormitory Design Guidance. For dormitory design guidance, reference the Facilities Design
Guide for Enlisted Dormitories.

                                        FINANCIAL MATTERS

4.1. Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ). The housing office is the only base activity that processes
AF Form 594, Application and Authorization to Start, Stop or Change Basic Allowance For Quar-
ters (BAQ) or Dependency Redetermination, for unaccompanied personnel occupying UH. The lodg-
ing manager processes BAQ actions for permanent party personnel occupying lodging facilities (see AFI
34-601, Air Force Lodging).
     4.1.1. Unaccompanied people are authorized to live off-base and receive BHA when the base-wide
     occupancy exceeds 90 percent or when the total number of people assigned to quarters plus the num-
     ber of people who have given up their UEQ entitlement exceeds 100 percent of the accountable base
     dormitory spaces. Issue BAH to the next member on the waiting list until the occupancy rate achieves
     the appropriate occupancy level. People residing off-base without BAH are not automatically the
     most eligible and must compete with other members on the BAH waiting list.
        4.1.1.1. Keep waiting lists by seniority. When the total basewide occupancy of Priority 1 and 2
        people in UEQs exceeds 90 percent, the next member on the waiting list may be issued BAH.
        4.1.1.2. Keep a separate waiting list for females when separate female dormitories (i.e., an entire
        building) have been designated. Authorize BAH on the same basis as other dormitories, or when
        the occupancy exceeds 90 percent of Priority 1 and 2 personnel.
     4.1.2. There are conditions when people are authorized to live off base with allowances, regardless of
     the occupancy rate, as long as the installation commander does not require them to live on base for
     reasons of military necessity, readiness, or discipline (DoDFMR, volume 7A, part 3). These moves
     are at government expense.
        4.1.2.1. People (without family members anywhere) in grades E-5 and above. Stop or start BAQ
        according to the rules in DFAS-DEM 177-373, Volume II, Defense Joint Military Pay System
        (DJMS) Unit Procedures Excluding FSO, only when quarters are assigned or terminated. Nor-
        mally, BAQ for newly assigned members in grades E-5 and above will continue from their last
        duty station; however, if necessary, the local Financial Services Office (FSO) starts BAQ during
        in-processing once the member has certified nonoccupancy of government quarters. Establish
        local rules to make sure an AF Form 594, signed by the member, is sent to the accounting and
        finance office within five workdays after the member moves into UH.
        4.1.2.2. People (without family members) in grades E-4 and below for whom adequate quarters
        are not available. People desiring to live off base with BAQ are placed on a base-wide waiting list
        kept by the housing office.
        4.1.2.3. People experiencing hardships. People with a bonafide hardship, as determined by the
        installation commander, are authorized to live off base. The requester's squadron or unit com-
        mander submits the request to the housing office. The housing office ensures the information
        related to the hardship is fully documented and justified, then forwards the request to the installa-
        tion commander who makes the final decision. An information copy of all approval or disap-
        proval actions must be provided to the housing office. Documentation is kept in a case file at the
        housing office during the period until the authorization expires. Annual recertification is required
        by the member to continue the entitlement.
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                    23


     4.1.2.4. People with privately owned mobile homes that have been moved from the previous duty
     station to the new duty station at government cost (authorized in PCS orders). A copy of the
     authorization for moving the mobile home must accompany the request for BAQ. See AFI
     32-6001 for guidance on assigning mobile home spaces.
     4.1.2.5. Pregnant women residing in UH who request BAQ. Pregnant women, at their option and
     with unit commander's approval, may submit a request to the housing office to move from
     assigned UH to community housing at the 20th week of pregnancy. An earlier move may be
     requested if determined necessary by medical authority. Installation commanders may direct the
     move of pregnant members between the 30th week of pregnancy to the date of birth. If a live
     birth does not occur, or the child is placed for adoption after BAQ is authorized,paragraph 2.7.
     applies.
     4.1.2.6. People with extensive household goods when the annual cost of drayage and storage of a
     person's household goods would exceed 50 percent of authorized BAQ and VHA, he or she may
     reside off base with allowances. Formula to figure annual cost of drayage and storage: (drayage
     + 12 months storage costs) divided by 12 = (BAQ + VHA) for a month.
     4.1.2.7. People within 30 days of marriage who are setting up a household in the local area. If the
     marriage fails to occur, paragraph 2.7. applies.
     4.1.2.8. Reservists on active duty for training. BAQ entitlement for reserve members is deter-
     mined by the availability of government quarters at each location the member visits. Each training
     location is viewed as a different PDS in this situation.
     4.1.2.9. People in a reserve component on active duty tours other than for training are entitled to
     BAQ under the same conditions as members serving on full-time active duty. The person's reserve
     unit at the permanent duty station (normal drill or training location) prepares and sends the follow-
     ing to the housing flight chief, who verifies the authorization, certifies the AF Form 594, and
     sends the package to the servicing pay office for processing:
        4.1.2.9.1. AF Form 594.
        4.1.2.9.2. AF Form 1373, MPO Document Control Log-Transmittal.
        4.1.2.9.3. Copy of the member's orders.
        4.1.2.9.4. Letter of determination from the unit commander if necessary.
        4.1.2.9.5. Address of the member's servicing pay office.
        4.1.2.9.6. For people in a reserve component on active duty for training, the place where the
        training duty is being performed is deemed the permanent duty station for BAQ entitlement
        purposes. When government quarters are not available, the unit commander will start AF
        Form 594 and AF Form 1373 and forward the documents to the housing flight chief. The
        housing flight chief must certify and send the forms to the servicing FSO for processing.
     4.1.2.10. Unaccompanied Office of Special Investigation (OSI) Agents and Agent-Trainees.
     Unaccompanied enlisted OSI agents and agent-trainees are authorized to reside off-base with
     allowances when the AFOSI region commander or squadron commander determines assignment
     to unaccompanied housing would impair the agent's or the agent trainee's mission effectiveness.
24                                                       AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


        4.1.2.11. Unaccompanied E-6 members assigned to inadequate quarters. Effective 1 July 1996,
        unaccompanied E-6 members assigned to housing which does not meet Department of Defense
        minimum adequacy standards may elect not to occupy the quarters and receive BAQ. This
        includes unaccompanied housing that falls under the jurisdiction of another Service.
        4.1.2.12. (Added) Join-spouse: Military married to other military members expecting the arrival
        of their spouse may request BAQ/VHA thirty days prior to the arrival of the spouse. If joint
        assignment does not occur, refer to paragraph 2.7.
        4.1.2.13. (Added) Terminal leave: Members with approved terminal leave may request BAQ/
        VHA when their assigned unaccompanied quarters are terminated.
     4.1.3. There are conditions when members with dependents residing elsewhere may occupy UH with-
     out affecting their right to receive BAH at the “with-dependent rate” (see DoDFMR 260301C”). This
     situation can occur when family housing units are temporarily converted to UH. However, members
     may not occupy UH which exceed the unaccompanied minimum standards for the member’s grade
     without affecting their right to BAH unless the only quarters available (a) exceed the unaccompanied
     minimum adequacy standards, and (b) are made available for joint occupancy with other members.
        4.1.3.1. Housing flight chiefs should make every effort to assign unaccompanied members to
        quarters which meet minimum adequacy standards (reference Table 3.1.) for their grade.
        4.1.3.2. UH exceeds the minimum adequacy standards if fewer than the maximum number of
        people who could occupy it as adequate housing occurs. UH is adequate for joint occupancy only
        when all elements of the minimum adequacy standard can be provided for each occupant. For
        example, UH for officers in the grade of 0-3 and above is not adequate for joint occupancy unless
        the quarters contain a minimum of 800 net square feet living area (400 net square feet for each
        occupant), two private bedrooms, two private bathrooms, two private living rooms or equivalent,
        and access to kitchen and dining facilities. For purposes of joint occupancy, private area is any
        space assigned for an occupant's exclusive use.
            4.1.3.2.1. Note that authorized living room space for officer joint occupants can be considered
            adequate if the equivalent of 460 net square feet of private area or 400 net square feet of pri-
            vate area plus access to 120 square feet of shared living area can be provided.
            4.1.3.2.2. Reference Table 3.1. notes for instructions on how to measure net living area.
     4.1.4. People may live off base at their own expense (without BAQ, VHA, or OHA) if they are not
     required to live on base for reasons of military necessity, readiness, or discipline. When people want
     to live off base at their own cost, but:
        4.1.4.1. Want to keep assigned quarters. They must keep them according to set standards, and
        may be assigned regular UEQ cleanup duties.
        4.1.4.2. Do not want to keep assigned quarters. They must sign the statement in block IV, AF
        Form 291 or automated product, and have it approved by their unit commander. The signed state-
        ment is kept by the housing office and unit until the member is authorized BAQ, recalled to the
        base, or departs PCS. These people are not counted in occupancy rates, and they are not assigned
        regular UEQ cleanup duties. If they wish to live on base later they are accommodated within set
        priorities if quarters are available. If quarters are not available and they are the most eligible on
        the waiting list, BAQ is authorized.
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                   25


   4.1.5. Partial BAQ. Unaccompanied personnel assigned to UH and those living off-base without
   BAQ are authorized partial rate BAQ. Finance automatically starts this payment for unaccompanied
   members without BAQ. Partial BAQ is not authorized when members occupy leased or contract
   quarters which cost more than their BAQ plus VHA or OHA.

4.2. Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). Eligible civilian employees are authorized LQA when over-
seas and not assigned to government quarters. When UH is assigned or vacated, the housing office pro-
vides written notice to the servicing civilian personnel office to stop or start LQA.

4.3. Dislocation Allowance (DLA). People without family members may be entitled to DLA as
described by the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), volume 1, chapter 5, part G. The term "without
family members" includes people who have family members but do not relocate them in conjunction with
permanent change of station. This entitlement accrues only when the housing manager determines that
permanent quarters will not be assigned within 60 days of the person's arrival at a new duty station. The
housing office prepares and sends to the local FSO two copies of a final determination that permanent
quarters will not be assigned.
   4.3.1. The DLA entitlement does not exist for:
       4.3.1.1. People who occupy government lodging quarters and are later assigned to permanent
       government quarters within 60 days of arrival.
       4.3.1.2. People in the grades E-5 and above (with family members), and people in grades E-4 and
       below (with or without family members) who have been offered permanent quarters, but elect to
       live off base at their own expense.
   4.3.2. Members in grade E-5 and above who elect to reside off base are eligible to receive DLA,
   regardless of the availability of quarters and may self certify their nonoccupancy of government quar-
   ters.
   4.3.3. Before certifying that government quarters will not be assigned to a military person married to
   another military person (with no family members), the housing office must make sure government
   family quarters will not be assigned within 60 days of arrival.

4.4. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). Authorize military people in PCS status TLA as required
in overseas areas. Specific circumstances, conditions and needs for payment of TLA are identified in the
DFAS-DEM 177-373, Volume II and guidance prescribed by the governing agency responsible for TLA
administration. Make sure people in a PCS status report to the housing office within two days of arrival.

4.5. Temporary Living Expense (TLE). Authorize military people in PCS status TLE as required to
partially offset added living expenses incurred within CONUS. Conditions and needs for payment of TLE
are identified in the JFTR and DFAS-DEM 177-373, Volume II.

4.6. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA). Authorize people who reside off base overseas and who
receive BAQ and OHA as required. The housing office certifies eligibility on DD Form 2367, Individual
Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) Report, and notifies the FSO. Move In Housing Allowance
(MIHA): In applicable overseas areas, authorize MIHA for members moving off base at government
expense. Conditions for payment of MIHA are identified in the JFTR.

4.7. Housekeeping and Custodial Service. For UOQ/UNCOQ, housekeeping for individual rooms
and common areas may be performed by lodging facility personnel on a reimbursable basis. Set up a writ-
ten agreement between lodging and housing, and ensure occupants pay applicable service charge to lodg-
ing. Notify all occupants in writing of the charges for the services which are provided. Provide minimum
services which maintain cleanliness standards. Set charges at the lowest possible rate that will recover
direct costs and a fair share of the lodging administrative and other indirect costs.
     4.7.1. Custodial service in permanent party enlisted quarters is voluntary, however when the service
     is received payment is mandatory. Commanders may make housekeeping service or custodial service
     a mandatory condition for people voluntarily occupying UNCOQ/UOQ. Note: Security assistance
     military trainees who receive funds from the US Government are required to pay these charges.
     4.7.2. Involuntarily assigned occupants are provided standards in writing and given the opportunity to
     pay service charges for a cleaning service. When they elect not to pay the service charge, they are
     responsible for:
        4.7.2.1. Making sure their quarters meet approved cleanliness standards.
        4.7.2.2. Cleaning/maintaining a proportionate share of common areas.

4.8. Fair Market Rental Charges and Collection.
     4.8.1. Civilian Personnel. Set rental charges for civilians occupying UH facilities according to OMB
     Circular A-45, Policy Governing Charges for Rental Quarters and Related Facilities. Civilian occu-
     pants (except full-time Red Cross employees at foreign locations) not entitled to LQA must pay rental
     charges. Collect charges as stated in AFM 177-102, Commercial Transactions at Base Level (PA).
     Civilian employees overseas will forfeit LQA in lieu of paying rental charges. Contract employees
     will pay rental charges unless otherwise stated in their agreement with the government.
     4.8.2. Foreign Personnel. Rental charges for security assistance personnel are included in the tuition
     rate. For other foreign (liaison and exchange) personnel rental charges are set according to AFI
     32-9003, and collected as stated in DFAS Regulation 177-102, unless otherwise stated in an official
     agreement.
     4.8.3. Summer camps, national organizations, and youth groups. No charge is made if occupants per-
     form all housekeeping and cleaning functions.

4.9. Records Review. The housing flight chief will make sure members assigned to UH are not receiv-
ing unauthorized housing allowances.
     4.9.1. Annually the local FSO prepares a listing of members who receive single rate and partial rate
     BAQ (OFFLINE Reporting Control System). FSOs at overseas locations will include a list of mem-
     bers who receive variable housing allowance (OFFLINE Reporting Control System) for family mem-
     bers residing in the CONUS. The housing flight chief will:
        4.9.1.1. Compare the list of names to UOQ/UNCOQ assignments records and provide the FSO
        with the name, rank, and social security number of all unmatched UH residents.
        4.9.1.2. Send each unit listing to unit commanders or CDM for UEQ occupants certification.
        Upon unit commander certification, the unit returns the listings with a list of unmatched UH resi-
        dents to the housing flight chief, who forwards the information to the FSO for determination of
        BAQ status.
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                    27


       4.9.1.3. Receive the final BAQ status of each unmatched resident from FSO for proper action.
       4.9.1.4. Submit a change in BAQ authorization, using AF Form 594, to the FSO within 5 days for
       any necessary BAQ adjustments. The action date on the AF Form 594 will be retroactive to the
       date BAQ payments should have been stopped.
       4.9.1.5. Keep a copy of the AF Form 594.
       4.9.1.6. Keep the BAQ listing in the housing office until superseded.
   4.9.2. The housing office also makes sure semiannually, that civilians assigned to quarters are either
   paying rental charges or forfeiting LQA.

4.10. Drayage and Storage. Local drayage and nontemporary storage of personal property is autho-
rized at government expense in connection with assignment or termination of government quarters if the
move is directed by the government (JFTR, paragraphs U4770, U5355, and U5380). Use the following
guidance to determine local drayage and storage entitlements as required by the JFTR:
   4.10.1. Moves from one UH accommodation to a different UH accommodation to provide for
   increased entitlement as a result of promotion, regulation changes, personal preferences, etc., are
   requested, not directed moves. Requested moves, when approved by the commander, are made at the
   discretion of the individual and are at personal expense.
   4.10.2. If there is doubt over whether an item will be accepted for storage by a government contractor,
   resolve the issue with the traffic management office (TMO).
   4.10.3. People may be directed to move into and out of UH for the benefit of the government (e.g., to
   vacate facilities for renovations or private room assignment policy, to make moves into renovated or
   newly constructed facilities). Relocation of eligible personnel is at government expense. The housing
   flight chief:
       4.10.3.1. Provides a fund cite; use PE XXX79F for local drayage.
       4.10.3.2. Advises eligible people to submit a request for drayage and storage as soon as possible,
       but no later than 30 days after quarters are assigned.
       4.10.3.3. Requires members to turn in an inventory of property that they feel must be stored.
       Does not approve items that are suitable for use in the assigned quarters.
   4.10.4. Those authorized to live off-base with single rate BAQ regardless of the dormitory occupancy
   rate (reference paragraph 4.1.2. )
   4.10.5. When a member gains a dependent, drayage from on-base UH to local community housing is
   authorized at government expense.
   4.10.6. (Added) Funded drayage and storage does not apply to Priority 4 personnel living space
   available in the dormitory, unless the member has been directed to move from one set of on-base quar-
   ters to another on-base quarters for the convenience of the government.

4.11. Reconnection Fees. Comptroller General of the United States Decision B-187833 allows the Air
Force to pay the cost of reconnecting one commercial telephone and one cable television service resulting
from involuntarily relocation between government housing or local off-base housing (DFAS Regulation
177-102). This does not apply to Priority 4 space available people who are required to move out of their
28                                                        AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


quarters (see paragraph 2.1.2.6. added). Limit reimbursement to one cable TV service and one standard
telephone line per member. This cable TV/phone reimbursement authority does not apply to self-help
installation of TV dish antenna or cellular phone service activation. A member will not be reimbursed
when the Air Force has evicted an occupant who did not adhere to housing policies. To receive reim-
bursement, a military or civilian member must:
     4.11.1. Send a request through the unit commander and the housing flight chief to the FSO for pay-
     ment.
     4.11.2. Provide special orders or a signed letter directing the move.
     4.11.3. Provide a receipt or bill for the cost of reconnecting telephone and cable television line.

                           DORMITORY MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS

5.1. Installation Dormitory Management. This chapter defines dormitory management concepts,
responsibilities, and operational procedures. Installation commanders may adopt a unit dormitory man-
agement concept (dormitory managers work for unit commanders), consolidated dormitory management
concept (dormitory managers work in one consolidated office), or a combination representing the best
methods of these two concepts unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM. The following paragraphs list
suggested alignment of responsibilities and operational procedures under the unit and consolidated dormi-
tory management concepts.

5.2. Types of Dormitory Management. Installation commanders may adopt one of the following dor-
mitory management concepts or a combination of the two unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM.
Regardless of the management system used, unit integrity will be maintained as long as it does not impact
the base ability to maintain a 90 percent occupancy rate. If a basewide occupancy rate of 90 percent can-
not be maintained due to unit (squadron) integrity, group integrity may be implemented.

                          GLOSSARY OF SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Terms
Abuse—Deliberate unauthorized use of government property or willful misconduct (damage).
Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ)—An amount of money set by law which a member may be
entitled to according to their status. There are four BAQ rates:
    • With Dependent Rate. An allowance given to defray the cost of housing for the member and
        their family members when government quarters are not available.
    • Without Dependent Rate. An allowance given members without dependents to defray the cost
        of housing when government quarters are not available.
    • Partial Rate. An amount of money approximately equal to the amount reallocated from basic
        pay at the time of pay raises. This payment is authorized for all unaccompanied (members with-
        out dependents) people who are not entitled to full BAQ,. except unaccompanied members occu-
        pying contract or leased quarters which cost more than their BAQ plus VHA/OHA..
    • Basic Allowance for Quarters Differential (BAQ-DIFF) Rate. The amount of BAQ equal to
        the difference between the with dependent and without dependent rates for the member's grade,
        rank, or rating.
Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)—New terminology for BAQ, the individual’s housing allowance
to include former BAQ payment, Variable Housing Allowance, and/or Overseas Housing Allowance.
Term may be used interchangeably in this AFI with the terms of BAQ, VHA, and OHA.
Civilian Employees—US civilian federal employees paid from DoD appropriated or nonappropriated
funds.
Commuting Distance—The distance from the installation which can normally be traveled by a person
during normal commuting hour traffic in one hour or less, or within other limits the installation
commander sets based on military necessity.
Consolidated Dormitory Management (CDM). —A syst em w he re pe rm anent party enl ist ed
dormitories are managed by a consolidated or centralized office. Unit integrity is maintained in room
assignments. A CDM system does not relieve unit commanders and first sergeants from their
responsibility for involvement in dormitories with respect to the living conditions and needs of their unit
personnel.

   •   A parent of the member if:
       • The parent is in fact dependent on the member for more than one-half of the parent's support.
       • The parent has been so dependent over a period prescribed by the Secretary concerned or
          became so dependent due to a change of circumstances arising after the member entered on
          active duty.
       • The dependency of the parent on the member is determined on the basis of an affidavit sub-

Military Necessity—Military considerations that, in the installation commander's judgment, require an
individual to live in government-owned or controlled quarters for completion of essential duties that
cannot be deferred or scheduled for normal duty hours. When military necessity is invoked by an
installation commander for purposes of assigning personnel to government housing, the nature and the
reasons for the military necessity must be specified. Conservation of BAQ or other funds is not a basis for
a determination of military necessity.
Negligence—The failure to act as a reasonably prudent person would act under similar circumstances.
Overseas or OCONUS—All locations, including Alaska and Hawaii, outside the continental United
States.
Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA)—An allowance (in addition to the member's BAQ) to which a

Space Required —Unaccompanied personnel in grades E-1-E-4. For installations where the Housing
Market Analysis (HMA) fully justifies a deficit of adequate, affordable, and safe off-base housing to
support unaccompanied E-5 through E-9 personnel, the affected grades (as identified in the HMA) may be
considered space required. Unaccompanied quarters must be programmed for all space required
personnel, to ensure these grades of unaccompanied people are housed on base.

commander or CDM.
Unaccompanied Enlisted Quarters (UEQ)—Enlisted unaccompanied permanent party personnel
housing.

                                   QUARTERS INSPECTION PLAN

A2.1. Who Inspects and Rates Quarters. The installation commander determines who inspects and
rates quarters. Self-inspection by dorm residents is authorized. Inspections generally are scheduled and
announced, but may be no notice. Each installation establishes inspection standards and designates
authorized inspectors.

A2.2. Inspection. Installations must ensure all occupants are briefed on inspection criteria, frequency,
and who is designated to inspect their rooms. The focus for quarters inspection is safety and health.

A2.3. Category Definitions and Frequency of Inspection:
     A2.3.1. Category A (Outstanding). Cleanliness and neatness exceeding standards.
     A2.3.2. Category B (Satisfactory). Meets standards.
     A2.3.3. Category C (Unsatisfactory). Does not meet standards. Report quarters not meeting safety
     and health standards to the member's first sergeant and establish a reinspection schedule for a neces-
     sary period of time to ensure standards are met and maintained.

A2.4. Rooms Displaying "SHIFT WORKER" Signs. Establish inspection schedules to accommo-
date occupants work/sleep schedules.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change provides revised guidance for managing Air Force unaccompanied housing.


 1.2.1. Change to: “HQ USAF/ILE. The Civil Engineer establishes policy and staff oversight for man-
agement of UH.”
 1.2.2. Change to: “HQ USAF/ILEH. The Housing Division Chief develops policy and implements UH
programs.”
 1.4.1.4. Change to: “Maintain 90 percent occupancy of adequate UH quarters, and validate UH occu-
pancy and use on “Unaccompanied Personnel Housing Quality Performance Metric (UPH Metric).”
 1.4.1.5. Change to: “Authorize BAQ when total basewide occupancy of Priority 1 and Priority 2 per-
sonnel residing in the UEQs and UNCOQs exceeds 90 percent (see paragraph 2.3.). This authority may
be delegated, in writing, to the base engineer or housing flight chief.”
  1.4.4.5. Change to: “Budgeting, purchasing, and controlling UEQ supplies, including initial issue and
replacement linens. Provide common-area supply items for individual occupant use, such as toilet paper,
light bulbs (government-owned items only), toilet/shower cleaner, window cleaner, paper towels, etc.
Also, provide cleaning supplies needed by bay orderlies to maintain common areas, i.e., light bulbs, win-
dow cleaner, paper towels, vacuums, wax, furniture polish, etc. Note: all dormitory supplies will be bud-
geted and funded in the Real Property Services PE (XXX79F); unit mission funds will not be used for
this purpose. The unit commander (in the unit dormitory concept) or CDM submits a budget for dormi-
tory supplies, and the host budget office integrates dormitory supply requirements into the base Real
Property Services budget. Air Force tenants (intraservice) will be provided dormitory supply support
consistent with that of the host dormitories. Interservice tenants will be provided supply support consis-
tent with AFI 25-201 and DoDI 4000.19.”
 1.4.5.4. (Added) “At the time an individual is assigned to a dormitory, he/she will be issued two sets of
bed linen (sheets and pillowcases). When dormitory washers and dryers are provided at no charge, it will
be the occupant’s responsibility to maintain the linens. If linen replacement is required during dormitory
occupancy, the occupant takes the unserviceable item(s) to the office making the initial issue of items for
replacement. The organization may turn in unserviceable linen items to the base linen exchange or other
organizations locally designated for disposal. When unaccompanied housing is terminated, the occupant
shall return serviceable linen to the initial issuing office, or the occupant may dispose of any unservice-
able items. Note: this does not apply to basic training or pipeline student environments, where linen
exchange service is still required and is not considered a student dormitory occupant’s responsibility.”


Note: Supersedes AFI 32-6005, 1 Nov 96
 1.6.1. (Added) If a nonsmoker detects second-hand smoke regardless of its source, the rights of the non-
smoker will prevail. Installation commanders may designate dormitories as nonsmoking, if necessary, to
40                                                      AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


eliminate second-hand smoke exposure. If dormitories are designated as nonsmoking, commanders will
make provisions for smokers through a segregated area that has separate ventilation.
  1.6.2. (Added) Reference AFI 40-102 and seek assistance from base environmental health technicians
if air quality measurement is required.
  1.10.1. Change to: “Prepare reports on a UPH Quality Performance Metric. Include Air Force supple-
mental data and any MAJCOM data as required. Cover a six-month period with close out as of 31 Mar
(interim report) and a one-year period ending 30 Sep (final report).”
 1.10.2. Change to: “Use automated software to electronically produce and send the UPH Quality Per-
formance Metric and supplemental data. Bases not having automated capability will manually compile
the data and forward it to the MAJCOM.”
 1.10.4. Change to: “Housing managers keep daily auditable records on UNCOQ/UOQ occupancy and
permanent party people authorized to live off-base without BAQ. The housing office transmits the con-
solidated permanent party portion of the data plus any supporting information to the MAJCOM by the
established due date.”
 1.10.6.2. Change to: “Send one copy of each installation UPH Quality Performance Metric with sup-
porting data and one copy of the command summary UPH metric to arrive at HQ USAF/ILEH by 5 May
and 5 November.”
 2.1.2. Change to: “To create extra dormitory space needed for Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel as pri-
vate room assignments are phased in, use the following guidelines to vacate dormitories:”
 2.1.2.1. Change to: “First priority to move off-base is Priority 4 personnel when total space available
(Priority 3 and 4) occupancy exceeds 10 percent of total base dormitory assets. Give priority to the most
junior person for retaining quarters.”
 2.1.2.2. Change to: “Second priority to move off-base is Priority 3 personnel when total space available
(Priority 3 and 4) occupancy exceeds 10 percent of total base dormitory assets. Give priority for retaining
quarters to the most junior person.”
 2.1.2.3. Change to: “Last priority to move off-base are Priority 2 volunteers on the BAQ waiting list (all
grades), with senior grades having priority. Total space required (Priority 1 and Priority 2) occupancy
must exceed 90 percent of total base dormitory assets.”
  2.1.2.6. (Added) “Space available personnel assignment termination: When Priority 3 and Priority 4
(space available) personnel must vacate the dormitory to make room for space required personnel: give
priority for retaining quarters to the most junior persons among all space available personnel. For exam-
ple, if there is an E-5 and an E-7 in the space available category, the E-5 would have priority to retain
quarters and the E-7 would have to vacate quarters first. Ensure all Priority 3 and Priority 4 personnel
sign a statement acknowledging they are occupying UH on a space available basis and may be required to
terminate quarters given 30 days notice. Additionally, Priority 4 personnel must acknowledge in writing
that all moves into and out of dormitory, including local drayage and nontemporary storage of personal
property, as well as cable TV and telephone reconnections will be at their own expense. The only excep-
tion is when these members are directed to move from an on-base assigned dormitory room to another
on-base dormitory room for the convenience of the government.”
 2.1.2.7. (Added): “Provisions for hardship BAH requests remain the same during the phase-in to private
dormitory rooms (see paragraph 2.4.1.).”
AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004                                                                       41


  2.2. Change to: “Unit Integrity. Unit integrity shall be maintained as long as it does not cause the base
occupancy rate to fall below 90 percent. If a basewide occupancy rate of 90 percent cannot be maintained
due to unit (squadron) integrity, group integrity may be implemented. To permit maintaining unit integ-
rity, dormitory assets will be distributed equitably among using organizations. When an individual arrives
at a base and dormitory space is not available with their unit’s dormitory, assign the individual to a hospi-
tality room or available space in another unit dormitory until space in the individual’s unit dormitory
becomes available. If assigned to another unit’s dormitory, moves between dormitory rooms are consid-
ered government-directed moves for the purpose of reimbursing an individual’s expenses to reconnect
telephone and cable television service.”
 2.2.1. Change to: “If unit allocation of dormitory space is used, the housing flight chief will monitor
space utilization rates between units and report recommended adjustments to the installation commander
who ensures each unit receives an equitable share of required dormitory space based on their population
of unaccompanied Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel (see paragraph 2.4.).”
 2.4.5. (Added) “Priority 3 and Priority 4 personnel should not constitute more than ten percent of the
total base dormitory capacity, unless the base has excess dormitory space and no additional housing
allowances are paid to unaccompanied E-1 to E-4 personnel.”
 2.5. Change to: “Assignment Priorities in Housing-Constrained Locations. When the Housing Market
Analysis (or equivalent document for Japan and Korea) reflects a deficit of adequate, affordable, and safe
off-base housing to support unaccompanied people in grades E-5 through E-9 at any location, the MAJ-
COM commander may designate the affected grades of unaccompanied people as Priority 2, space
required. The HMA must fully justify the lack of adequate housing for E-5 to E-9 personnel, and instal-
lations should program to build unaccompanied housing for the affected grades (reference AFH
32-1084).”
 2.6.1. Change to: “Hospitality Rooms. If permanent party rooms are not available for members arriving
during nonduty hours, arrange temporary accommodations in a unit/CDM hospitality room if possible, or
in lodging quarters. Newly-assigned enlisted individuals occupying lodging facilities will pay the daily
lodging fee. Hospitality rooms are controlled and assigned by the units or CDM and used as temporary
quarters for arriving and departing people. The UPH Quality Performance Metric reflects a space(s)
adjustment for the hospitality room(s).”
 2.7.2. Change to: “Occupancy of adequate UH by Priority 1 and Priority 2 personnel is below the 90
percent utilization rate. Involuntary assignment applies only to personnel in grdaes E-4 and below. The
member must be given 30 days advanced written notice. Start with the most junior people. Note: Priority
2 personnel will not be recalled solely to accommodate the change from the previous Priority 1, 2, and 3
to the new Priority 1 & 2 occupancy goal.”
 2.8.1.6. Change to: “A military or civilian person is away from their permanent duty station, and status
is changed to PCS, missing in action, extended confinement, Absent Without Leave (AWOL), or captured
by the enemy; or on the death of an individual. In these cases, see AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personnel
Property, regarding protection of personal property.”
 Table 3.2, Note 1, change to: “Note 1. Open bay, maximum of 50 persons.”
 4.1.1. Change to: “Unaccompanied people are authorized to live off-base and receive BHA when the
base-wide occupancy exceeds 90 percent or when the total number of people assigned to quarters plus the
number of people who have given up their UEQ entitlement exceeds 100 percent of the accountable base
dormitory spaces. Issue BAH to the next member on the waiting list until the occupancy rate achieves the
42                                                      AFI32-6005_PACAFSUP1_I 5 MARCH 2004


appropriate occupancy level. People residing off-base without BAH are not automatically the most eligi-
ble and must compete with other members on the BAH waiting list.”
 4.1.1.1. Change to: “Keep waiting lists by seniority. When the total basewide occupancy of Priority 1
and 2 people in UEQs exceeds 90 percent, the next member on the waiting list may be issued BAH.”
 4.1.1.2. Change to: “Keep a separate waiting list for females when separate female dormitories (i.e., an
entire building) have been designated. Authorize BAH on the same basis as other dormitories, or when
the occupancy exceeds 90 percent of Priority 1 and 2 personnel.”
 4.1.2.12. (Added) Join-spouse: Military married to other military members expecting the arrival of
their spouse may request BAQ/VHA thirty days prior to the arrival of the spouse. If joint assignment does
not occur, refer to paragraph 2.7.
 4.1.2.13. (Added) Terminal leave: Members with approved terminal leave may request BAQ/VHA
when their assigned unaccompanied quarters are terminated.
 4.1.3. Change to: “There are conditions when members with dependents residing elsewhere may
occupy UH without affecting their right to receive BAH at the “with-dependent rate” (see DoDFMR
260301C”). This situation can occur when family housing units are temporarily converted to UH. How-
ever, members may not occupy UH which exceed the unaccompanied minimum standards for the mem-
ber’s grade without affecting their right to BAH unless the only quarters available (a) exceed the
unaccompanied minimum adequacy standards, and (b) are made available for joint occupancy with other
members.”
 4.7.1. Change to: “Custodial service in permanent party enlisted quarters is voluntary, however when
the service is received payment is mandatory. Commanders may make housekeeping service or custodial
service a mandatory condition for people voluntarily occupying UNCOQ/UOQ. Note: Security assis-
tance military trainees who receive funds from the US Government are required to pay these charges.”
 4.10.3.3. Change to: “Requires members to turn in an inventory of property that they feel must be
stored. Does not approve items that are suitable for use in the assigned quarters.”
 4.10.6. (Added) “Funded drayage and storage does not apply to Priority 4 personnel living space avail-
able in the dormitory, unless the member has been directed to move from one set of on-base quarters to
another on-base quarters for the convenience of the government.”
 4.11. Change to: “Reconnection Fees. Comptroller General of the United States Decision B-187833
allows the Air Force to pay the cost of reconnecting one commercial telephone and one cable television
service resulting from involuntarily relocation between government housing or local off-base housing
(DFAS Regulation 177-102). This does not apply to Priority 4 space available people who are required to
move out of their quarters (see paragraph 2.1.2.6. added). Limit reimbursement to one cable TV service
and one standard telephone line per member. This cable TV/phone reimbursement authority does not
apply to self-help installation of TV dish antenna or cellular phone service activation. A member will not
be reimbursed when the Air Force has evicted an occupant who did not adhere to housing policies. To
receive reimbursement, a military or civilian member must:”
 5.2. Change to: “Types of Dormitory Management. Installation commanders may adopt one of the fol-
lowing dormitory management concepts or a combination of the two unless directed otherwise by the
MAJCOM. Regardless of the management system used, unit integrity will be maintained as long as it
