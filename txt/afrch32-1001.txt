This handbook implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It contains guidelines and
information for facility requirements in support of Air Force Reserve Command missions. The
criteria in this handbook represent standard space allowances. These guidelines shall be used by
key personnel in AFRC civil engineering, and key personnel in other AFRC organizations who
allocate space in existing facilities or develop or approve facility requirements. This publication
does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) but does apply to the Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and their units. The use of existing facilities will conform to criteria
contained within this handbook unless the physical configurations of existing structures require
variances from these guidelines. Criteria for items not addressed in this handbook may be found
in AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm.              Refer recommended

                                           Chapter 1

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The guidelines in this handbook are applicable to the Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and implement DOD construction criteria directives.
1.2. Requirements and Criteria Development:
   1.2.1. The criteria in this handbook are the space allowances authorized within AFRC. HQ
   AFRC functional managers are consulted for space requirements within their areas of
   responsibility. HQ AFRC/A7PP gathers and compiles these requirements into this
   handbook. Actual space requirements for each facility (existing or to be constructed) are
   programmed and justified on the basis of the authorized unit strength and the quantity and
   type of equipment and supplies to be stored. Adaptive use of existing facilities should be
   implemented to the maximum extent possible. The use of existing facilities should conform
   to the following criteria as nearly as possible; however, it is recognized that physical
   characteristics of existing structures will, in some cases, restrict adherence. Although the
   facility space standards contained herein are expected to adequately accommodate the
   majority of AFRC units, we recognize that, due to the highly diversified and, in some cases
   unique, structure of AFRC operations, a single facility standard will not accommodate every
   need. Exceptions to facility space criteria will be considered when specific unit functions are
   not addressed within the established standards or when unique and compelling circumstances
   exist.
      1.2.1.1. All requests for facility space exceptions and waivers shall be forwarded in
      writing to AFRC/A7P for staffing and coordination through HQ AFRC. The waiver
      request will contain an analysis of the requirement and depict cost avoidance as
      applicable.
      1.2.1.2. All requests for facility space exceptions and waivers will be reviewed by
      appropriate members of the HQ AFRC staff and functional experts within the Command.
      Requests for waivers and exceptions shall be reviewed in a timely fashion and a written
      reply provided back to the generating unit.
   1.2.2. All facility space requirements are given in terms of net area, unless noted otherwise.
   Gross area for new construction can be computed by use of noted factors (overhead
   {common use space} 33%) and includes the entire facility to the outside enclosure walls.
      1.2.2.1. The gross authorization calculation does not always apply to the use of existing
      facility space (renovation or alteration). A circulation space factor of only 10% is applied
      if the mechanical rooms, entryways, bathrooms, hallways, and other common use spaces
      are not modified.
   1.2.3. The space allowances for communications closets and electrical closets are intended
   for planning purposes and are not to be taken as design criteria. A communication/electrical
   closet area is added to each reserve facility space. This calculation is 3% of the subtotaled
   net authorization.

    1.2.4. All new construction and renovation projects shall configure buildings to support an
    open office concept with moveable partitions, demountable walls and systems furniture to
    allow maximum flexibility for the projected and future users. Hard walls shall be used only
    when necessary to provide required building integrity, security or to meet building code
    standards. Where possible, offices shall be joint use and the number and size of exclusive
    offices kept to a minimum. The allocation for cubicle space in Table 2.1 includes circulation
    space within the open office area.
    1.2.5. When more than one activity occupies a single facility, overhead space (mechanical
    rooms, halls, etc.) is accounted appropriately against the individual functional authorizations.
    1.2.6. Program joint use facilities to the maximum extent practicable where the ANG, Active
    Force, and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) are collocated. Consider facilities such as
    medical training, dormitories, dining halls, bulk fuel storage, vehicle maintenance,
    communications centers, small arms ranges, fire stations, munitions/ pyrotechnics storage
    facilities, etc., for joint use.
    1.2.7. Facility space authorizations are based on actual personnel authorizations for each
    function. Although it is recognized that local variations in unit manning, facility
    configurations, and customer needs will result in diverse arrangements of internal space, total
    (gross) authorizations for facilities should not be exceeded and, in many cases, will be
    reduced to reflect actual unit authorizations.
AFRCH32-1001 25 JANUARY 2012                                                                   9

                               BUILDING A REQUIREMENT

2.1. This handbook does not cover every possible mission or function within its chapters
and tables. In order to identify new requirements, HQ AFRC/A7PP, in coordination with
functional experts within the Command, creates new templates or tables for the purpose of
defining space authorizations for a particular mission need. Space authorizations for unique
activities are reviewed by HQ AFRC/A7PP on a case-by-case basis. When establishing a space
authorization for a new or unique mission need, the programmer should make a comparison with
similar facilities as well as review active duty Air Force and DOD facility standards, guidance,
and design standards.
2.2. Open areas will be constructed for administrative functions (see 1. 2.4.).

          Traditional reservists (TRs) requiring administrative office space 40
2.3. Conversion of net scope to gross facility scope: There are typically three calculations that
may be used to arrive at the gross SF authorized depending on the scope of work being done;
minor modification to an existing facility, major modification to an existing facility or new
construction, and construction of storage space.
   2.3.1. Minor modification to existing facility: When completing minor modifications to an
   existing facility, add 10% circulation space to the net scope for the gross authorization.
   2.3.2. Major modification to existing facility or new construction: If major facility
   modification or new construction is required, determine the gross facility requirement by
   adding 3% to the subtotaled net scope for communications/electrical closet requirements, add
   10% for circulation space, and then add an additional 20% for facility overhead.
   2.3.3. Storage space construction: When constructing storage space, add 20% facility
   overhead to the net scope for the gross authorization. Only add the 3% communications/
   electrical closet factor if these elements are required within the facility.
2.4. Facility Category Codes: Real Property Cat Codes are assigned based on the functions of
the subject facility.
   2.4.1. Facilities located on AFRC host installations should be coded in accordance with
   active duty Cat Codes contained in AFH32-1084.

  2.4.2. In order to avoid duplication of facility coding at AFRC tenant unit locations, use Cat
  Codes noted herein.
  2.4.3. Category Codes for unique AFRC facilities, or other facilities not addressed in this
  publication will be determined by HQ AFRC/A7IA on a case-by-case basis.

5. Calculating storage requirements will involve several factors unique to each individual
installation. These factors include: number/type of SFS unit daily weapons, munitions and
equipment; i.e., radios, night vision equipment and other essential equipment. Also included in
the calculation are any other weapons stored in the armory, to include: tenant, mobility,
privately owned, aircrew, honor guard, etc.
6. Calculation is based on 700 square feet per authorized unit equipped UTC. Adjust
authorization to reflect actual number of unit equipped UTCs.

                                  AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS

4.1. General Criteria. AFRC Requirements for items in this group are determined in the same
manner as for active duty units when located at Air Force installations. Adherence to these
requirements at other locations may not always be possible due to the multiplicity of situations
under which AFRC operates. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airfield criteria are
normally used for construction of runways, taxiways and associated work located on civil
airports. Use naval airfield criteria for construction of airfield facilities located at Naval Air
Stations.
4.2. Civil Airport Criteria. The criteria are detailed in AFH 32-1084.
4.3. Runway (Cat Code 111-111): Use active force criteria for runway length and other design
elements. Standard runway width is 150 feet. Determine minimum runway width and lengths
by operating function based on type of aircraft, weather conditions, and mission requirements.
4.4. Paved Overrun (Cat Code 111-115): Use AFH 32-1084 criteria.
4.5. Taxiway (Cat Code 112-211): Use active force criteria (UFC 3-260-1). A taxiway width
of 15.2 m (50 ft) and 22.9 m (75 ft) are standard for class A and B runways respectively.
Taxiways supporting towing operation will adhere to the following: Taxiway width will be in
accordance with outside gear width of design aircraft plus 3.05 m (10 ft) or 15.2 m (50 ft) total
width, whichever is less
4.6. Apron (Cat Code 113-321): Follow active force criteria. AFRC will not construct ramp
space for transient aircraft parking but will provide transient aircraft parking on existing ramp
space on as as-available basis.

NOTES:
1. The working area for a Command Post is based upon the functions to be performed and on the
maximum number of persons required to perform those functions during anticipated peak
workloads.
2. An area will be reserved for the Chief, Superintendent, and the administrative staff with
adequate office space to accommodate the number of personnel and any equipment necessary to
perform their day-to-day duties. Privacy and immediate access to the console area are key
considerations for the administrative area.
3. The training section should have easy access to the console area to facilitate training and
testing of C2 personnel.
4. Special attention should be made to ensure the Emergency Action (EA) controllers are
provided a secure area to execute EA procedures. Emergency Action Message (EAM) formats
may only be viewed by certified command post controllers, controller trainees, and the Crisis
AFRCH32-1001 25 JANUARY 2012                                                                     27


Action Team Director. A means of restricting visibility by other personnel in the Battle Staff
/Battle Staff Support and Command Post must be in place and used during EAM processing. If
unit missions dictate that Top Secret discussion between controllers must take place, then a
workable method must be in place to ensure that personnel without both a need to know and the
proper clearance are restricted from hearing these conversations. Collocated command posts
occupied by personnel with differing levels of clearances must ensure provisions are made to
ensure protection of the classified material or equipment.
5. Crisis Action Team (CAT) / Installation Command Center (ICC) Area. To ensure a good
cross flow of information, a collocated ICC area is highly desired. If not possible, secure
communications must exist between the Command Post and the ICC to ensure effective
coordination. The area should be sized to accommodate the ICC and all associated equipment
requirements, but is at the discretion of the unit commander.
6. Wall and ceiling silencing materials or other means of noise reduction will be used in
Command Posts to reduce noise level to a minimum. Raised flooring will be used to facilitate
the addition of future communications systems.
7. All Command Posts must have a non-interruptible power supply. All facilities will be
equipped with emergency lighting.
8. The facility that contains the Command Post must be designated as a USAF Restricted Area
at the protection level equal to the highest protection level resources they support operationally.
Entry control to the Command Post, associated equipment/communications rooms, and
emergency generators are outlined in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program,
as supplemented.
9. Command Post Facility Remodeling: Prior to construction, C2 managers will coordinate
design/plans with the local Security Forces’ Information Security and Physical Security sections,
local Communications Squadrons EMSEC personnel and HQ AFRC/A3T to ensure compliance
with guidelines.
7.4. Crew Readiness (Aircrew Alert Facility) (Cat Code 141-459): Units that require crew
readiness facilities to meet primary mission requirements will use criteria established in AFH 32-
1084. Dedicated facilities are not authorized for installations that have secondary mission
statements requiring aircrew alert training. At these locations, temporary aircrew alert operations
will be established in existing facility space as required to meet mission training and exercise
requirements.
7.5. Squadron Operations (Cat Code 141-753): Each flying squadron requires a facility for
planning, briefing, administration, storage, and critique of combat crews. Functions within this
facility may include weapons and tactics, intelligence, briefing/debriefing, standardization and
evaluation, flight planning, flying safety, flight records, physical training, scheduling, general
training, and space for unit administration. Space is provided for storage of aircrew chemical
warfare ensemble in the personal equipment area. Additional functions including, but not
limited to, Aircrew Flight Equipment, Base Operations, Operations Support Squadron,
Operations Group Command, and Wing Command Post may also be located in the Squadron
Operations facility. Space authorizations for these additional functions are established separately
within this handbook.
   7.5.1. Squadron Operations Facility. Space authorization for the Squadron Operations
   facility is dependent on the type and number of weapons systems operated by the flying
   squadron. The authorizations shown in the following tables are established based on typical
 28                                                   AFRCH32-1001 25 JANUARY 2012


   squadrons. Space authorizations for unique weapons systems or mission configurations will
   be determined on a case-by-case basis. Tables 7.3 (airlift) and 7.4 (fighter) show space
   allocations for a Squadron Operations facility. Modification to these allocations will be
   necessary to accommodate unique functions associated with individual weapons systems, but
   should be accomplished within the limits of the total authorized facility space standard.
   Squadron Operations facilities for fighter units should be constructed to JAFAN 6/9
   standards as a Special Access Program Facility (SAPF) accredited work area. Intelligence
   flights require access to a DCID 6/9 accredited Sensitive Compartmented Information
   Facility (SCIF) work area.

Additional consideration must also be given to the type and number of weapons systems
supported and any associated specialized equipment and training requirements.
   7.6.1. The AFE function is authorized the approximate square footage of workshop space
   (based on a standard 8 PAA squadron {21/24 PAA for fighter squadrons}), as shown in
   Table 7.8 Requirements are based on mission support for aircrew training/classroom space,
   supported aircrew equipment storage, night vision device storage/maintenance/testing,
   equipment inspection/maintenance, mobility operations, and administrative space.
   7.6.2. For flying personnel equipment storage (primary MDS, Aeromedical, Flight Surgeon,
   Combat Camera, etc. aircrew), 3 square feet per supported position is authorized.
   7.6.3. An additional 500 square feet is authorized for egress shop space at fighter equipped
   units.
   7.6.4. HC-130/MC-130 units are authorized an additional 1,400 square feet for Crew Storage
   Space.

8.9. Deployment Processing Facility (Cat Code 141-786): Deployment processing facilities
are applicable to AFRC host installations. Each base develops its own Installation Deployment
Plan (IDP) defining its deployment process. The following information is provided to ensure
adequate space is identified and necessary infrastructure is available for AFRC unit deployment
processes. Existing facilities should be used or modified to meet these requirements. When the
deployment control center (DCC) is not active, Deployment Processing Facility space will be co-
used for other functions such as the Installation Deployment Readiness Cell (IDRC). Each
AFRC installation will deploy personnel and cargo using the five automated Air Force standard
systems for deployments, integrated deployment system (IDS). IDS incorporates logistics
module (LOGMOD) for providing Load & Packing Lists to deploying squadrons and
Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE) to monitor all deployments; the Cargo Movement &
Operating System (CMOS) & Automated Air Load Planning System (AALPS) for the movement
and tracking of Air Force assets; Manpower & Personnel (MANPER) system for processing
personnel; and LOGMOD Stand-Alone (LSA) to aid deploying squadrons in managing their
assets and training. The IDS uses an installation's local area network (LAN). Basic "minimum"
facility requirements are listed below.
   8.9.1. Deployment Control Center (DCC). AFRC Host Bases are authorized 1,670 square
   feet for all functions associated with the Deployment Control Center. Deployment command
   and control for the Wing Commander is monitored from this room. This room requires
   "controlled access," and must be capable of operating in classified mode in support of
   classified DMS, Global Command and Control System (GCCS), and operations plan (OPlan)
   directives. DCC Manning includes the following personnel: IDO, Logistics Plans, Personnel,
AFRCH32-1001 25 JANUARY 2012                                                                    61


  Transportation, DSOE Monitors, Supply, Admin, runners, and selected unit representatives
  (minimum manning eight, maximum depends on the number of deployment tasked units but
  could exceed 20). DCC Equipment Requirements: Robust communications in the DCC are
  essential for positive control. Minimum IDS communications requirements include access to
  SIPRNET, NIPRNET, secure and unsecured telephones, and access to secure and unsecured
  facsimile machines. DCC personnel require a GCCS terminal to access JOPES, DCAPES,
  Base support Planning Tool (BaS&E - formerly LOGCAT), LOGFAC, LOGMOD,
  MANPER-B, classified newsgroups, secure web sites, collaborative decision support tools,
  and other planning aids. Additional requirements include uninterrupted power and classified
  storage. Video surveillance of marshaling yards and aircraft loading operation areas is
  optional, but desired if direct line of sight of these areas is not available from the DCC.
  NOTE: LOGMOD requires, as a minimum, T-1 LAN connectivity to all Unit Deployment
  Managers (UDMs) facilities and the wide area network. A minimum of nine workstations
  with combined NIPR/SIPR connectivity are required. The ideal location of the DCC is in the
  same building or near the personnel and cargo deployment functions, personnel processing
  facilities, and the flight line. All deployment facilities must be heated, air-conditioned, and
  lighted as well as normal offices. Automatic switching backup power generation is
  authorized, and back-up facilities should be identified in case fire, natural disaster, terrorist
  activity, or other event renders the primary facilities unusable. The DCC should be
  collocated with the Logistics Plans office
     8.9.1.1. Space authorization for the DCC includes a conference/briefing room for
     deployment concept briefings. This room may be one normally used for other purposes,
     such as a deployment training classroom or personnel deployment function (PDF)
     passenger briefing room. The concept briefing room should be located within the same
     building as the DCC and be secure to brief classified SECRET.
     8.9.1.2. The load planning function is included in Space authorization for the DCC and
     must be adjacent to or in the immediate proximity of the DCC and the Cargo Processing
     Facility (CPF). It should accommodate at least two people and two computers connected
     to the LAN. It should be a quiet and secure area.
     8.9.1.3. The quality control function is included in Space authorization for the DCC and
     must be adjacent to or in the immediate proximity of the DCC. It should accommodate at
     least four people and two computers connected to the LAN. It should be a quiet and
     secure area.
  8.9.2. Installation Deployment Readiness Cell (IDRC). On a routine basis, the DCC may
  not be required to stand up if the responsibilities can be handled effectively in the normal
  operating location of the IDRC (i.e., the IDRC must mirror the DCC requirements). The
  IDRC is responsible for identifying, validating, and distributing tasking and information.
  Coordinates with UDMs to ensure appropriate units are tasked in DCAPES, and making
  corrections as necessary. AFRC host locations are authorized 1,400 square feet of facility
  space for this function. Authorization includes all logistics plans functions, personnel
  readiness unit, transportation and installation deployment officer and must have SIRP and
  NIPR capabilities.
     8.9.2.1. Reserve Deployment Readiness Cell (RDRC). Wings at AFRC Tenant
     locations are authorized a total of 1,400 square feet for a RDRC that is separate from the
62                                                       AFRCH32-1001 25 JANUARY 2012


     active duty deployment readiness cell. RDRC manages taskings associated with Reserve
     specific deployment requirements, includes space for all logistics plans functions,
     personnel readiness unit, transportation and installation deployment officer, and must
     have SIPR and NIPR capabilities.
  8.9.3. Personnel Deployment Function (PDF). AFRC Host Bases are authorized 3,025
  square feet for the Personnel Deployment Function. This allocation includes all
  administrative, work, waiting/holding, and personnel processing functions. The PDF office
  is usually manned by two to four people, must have LAN connectivity, and must include a
  copier unless a suitable one is available nearby. The PDF continuously monitors deploying
  personnel requirements and publishes deployment orders. Communications requirements
  include access to SIPRNET, NIPRNET, secure and unsecure telephones, and access to
  facsimile machines. The PDF must be located in immediate proximity to the personnel
  processing facility:
     8.9.3.1. Personnel Processing Facilities. This facility requires a personnel processing
     line consisting of eight work stations. Each station is manned by 1-2 people behind
     tables, in booths, or in cubicles. The facility also has a private area for legal and chaplain
     counseling and a medical station for administering injections in the hip; an indoor
     holding/briefing area at the beginning of the line for 100 people (seating desired); and at
     least two rooms to brief passengers after processing for deployment, and "hold" them
     until they board transportation (should hold at least 100 people and provide comfortable
     seating). These rooms at the end of the personnel processing line must allow PDF
     personnel to control entry and exit, to maintain the integrity of the deploying force;
     should include a projection screen or large screen TVs to provide training or
     entertainment (cable TV desired) to the deploying personnel; must be near well-stocked
     vending machines, water fountain, and restrooms. The holding/briefing rooms must be
     quiet and secure and cleared for classified SECRET. Holding/briefing rooms may be
     used for other functions during normal operations, such as other training or meetings, and
     may be used for the deployment concept briefing. Personnel processing facilities should
     be located adjacent to, or in the proximity of, the DCC and PDF.
  8.9.4. Cargo Deployment Function (CDF). This function is usually located on or near the
  cargo marshaling area. It is the installation's focal point for all cargo processing activities.
  LAN connectivity is required in this area. This area should provide enough room to check
  and process all accompanying cargo documentation. Dispatch of cargo load teams to load
  and unload support aircraft occurs in this facility. Normal CDF operations (cargo in-check,
  marshaling, and loading) can be done outdoors (ramp, apron, etc.) or in designated hangar
  space. The unit Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) should specify procedures for this
  process.
  8.9.5. Deployment Training Classrooms. At least two rooms conducive to training at least
  20 people at a time are required. Training rooms must be equipped to use standard audio-
  visual equipment and have LAN connectivity to train UDMs in LOGMOD. Passenger
  holding/briefing rooms and the room used for the deployment concept briefing may be ideal
  for this purpose. The IDO, PDF, and CDF must provide various initial and recurring courses
  to UDMs, augmentees, and deploying personnel. These rooms may also be used for
  meetings, conferences, and other base requirements. Ten LAN drops and computers are
  needed in at least one deployment training classroom for IDS training.
AFRCH32-1001 25 JANUARY 2012                                                               63


8.10. Reserve Forces Medical Training and Administration Facility (Cat Code 171-
450): Medical units include Aeromedical Staging Squadrons (ASTS) and Medical Squadrons
(MDS). While units differ in tasking, they share similar administrative and training space
requirements. However, unit tasking and unit manning must be considered when calculating
space requirements. Variations in space authorization for medical units will be reviewed and
validated on a case-by-case basis by HQ AFRC/SG.
8.10.1. Aeromedical Staging Squadrons (ASTS) train to perform on-ground patient care at
forward and deployed locations. There is considerable variation in aeromedical staging
squadron size throughout the Command. Small to mid-sized ASTS (those assigned a 50 to 150
bed UTC) are authorized 7,730 square feet of administrative, training and storage space. Large
ASTS (those assigned a 151 to 250 bed UTC) are authorized 8,880 square feet of administrative,
training and storage space. Table 8.20 shows proposed space allocation for an ASTS.

     8.10.1.1. If an ASTS unit located on an Active Duty installation includes an aerospace
     medicine package (responsible for physical exams on AFRC personnel), they are
     authorized an additional 975 square feet (gross) for the Chief of Aeromedical Services
     and the Physical Exam Section staff. Space for conducting physical exams is joint-use
     space located in the host Active Duty clinic. If an ASTS unit located at a Host
     installation includes an aerospace medicine package (responsible for physical exams on
     AFRC personnel), treat them as an AMDS for facility space authorization purposes.
  8.10.2. Medical Squadrons (MDS) and Aerospace Medicine Squadrons / Flights
  (AMDS) are responsible for operation of medical exam facilities at AFRC installations
  (AMDS) and may have mobility taskings (MDS). There is considerable variation in medical
  squadron size throughout the Command depending primarily on the size of the wing they are
  assigned to support. Small to mid-sized MDS (those located at a base with a Traditional
  Reserve (TR) population of less than 1,500) are authorized 7,970 square feet for
  administrative, training and medical exam space. Large MDS (those located at a base with a
  TR population greater than 1,500) are authorized 9,170 square feet for administrative,
  training and medical exam space. Table 8.13 shows proposed space allocation for an
  MDS/AMDS. Each installation is authorized only a single medical exam facility. Medical
  exam space should be joint-use with other co-located services (i.e. Navy, Air National Guard,
  etc.) where possible. Reserve Medical Units located on Active Duty facilities are authorized
  space for administrative and training functions but will perform physical exams / customer
  service within the Active Duty clinic. Space authorization for MDS/AMDS tenanted on
  Active duty facilities is shown in Table 8.21

                              MAINTENANCE FACILITIES

9.1. Hangar (Cat Code 211-111): Protected space for aircraft maintenance. Includes
necessary utility systems and limited office/administrative space. Each AFRC airlift or aerial
refueling unit with 8 PAA is authorized one fully enclosed scheduled maintenance hangar, one
nose dock unscheduled maintenance hangar, and adequate access to one nose dock fuel systems
maintenance hangar as required to meet mission and training requirements. Northern tier bases
should be provided access to a fully enclosed hangar for accomplishing fuel systems
maintenance. Dedicated corrosion control or paint / de-paint hangars are not authorized for
AFRC units. The number of dock spaces to be provided for fighter/helicopter units, as well as
units with more than 8 PAA can be determined by multiplying the number of primary assigned
aircraft (PAA) by the following factors as shown in table 9.1.

Table 9.1. Hangar Quantity Factors.
                              AIRCRAFT               FACTOR
                              Fighter/helicopter     0.25
                              C-5                    0.16

                              C-130, KC-135, B-52 0.15
Formula: Number of aircraft by type x factor = Required covered spaces. Fuel
maintenance/corrosion control hangar (Cat. Code 211-179) is not included in this number.
Example: 12 each C-130 x .15 = 1.8 or 2 covered spaces + one fuel maintenance hangar.

1. Paint booths require 10 foot minimum ceiling height. Only one AFRC owned paint spray
bay/booth is authorized per base. AFRC units are not authorized any aircraft painting other than
maintenance touch-up and then only to the extent authorized by the base environmental office.
2. All units with refueling capability require additional space to service the re-fuel boom. This
periodical task is normally accomplished in any open area (that is, engine shop aisle, support
equipment shop, etc.); however, if no other area is available, an additional 260 square feet
(gross) is authorized for the hydraulic shop.
3. If a NDI shop exists on a given base, joint use is required. Facility will not be duplicated.
9.5. Aircraft Organization Maintenance Shop (Cat Code 211-154): Aircraft Maintenance
Squadron (AMXS) or ―flightline maintenance‖ is responsible for maintenance and inspection of
unit assigned aircraft. Facility requirements are determined by the weapons system supported,
number of assigned aircraft (PAA), and hours of maintenance operations. Use the authorizations
shown in Table 9.5 for units supporting 12 PAA airlift/aerial refueling, 21/24 PAA fighter, and 8
PAA bomber units. Additional authorizations for units required to support additional PAA will
be determined on a case-by-case basis in coordination with HQ AFRC/A4M.

        STORAGE FACILITIES - COVERED/OPEN, AND SPECIAL PURPOSE

11.1. Base Hazardous Storage/Hydrazine Storage and Servicing Facility (Cat Code 442-
257):
   11.1.1. Base Hazardous Material Storage (Pharmacy Program). This provides for the
   centralized storage and dispensing of paints, oil, solvents, chemicals, bottled gases, and other
   hazardous materials as required at each host base. May be constructed as a separate facility
   or identified as a separate area within the base general warehouse. This function is
   authorized 300 square feet for administrative, computer and customer service space and a
   total of 2,500 square feet for hazardous material storage.
   11.1.2. Base Hazardous waste Storage. Facility provides centralized storage for hazardous
   waste materials prior to transport off base for ultimate disposal. Facility must be constructed
   and operated in accordance with federal and State environmental regulations. May be
   constructed as a separate facility or identified as a separate area within the base hazardous
   material storage facility. This function is authorized 140 square feet for administrative,
   computer and file storage space and a total of 800 square feet for hazardous waste storage.
   11.1.3. Hydrazine Storage and Servicing Facility. For F-16 equipped units, provides
   space for servicing and storage of hydrazine fuel containers. HQ AFRC/A4M determines on
   a case-by-case basis whether to provide a full service facility or storage only.
11.2. Liquid Oxygen/Nitrogen Storage (LOX/LIN) (Cat Code 442-258): A pad, cover,
fencing and road access to provide protected storage are authorized for this equipment. Use
AFH 32-1084 criteria.
11.3. Base Supply and Equipment Warehouse (Cat Code 442-758):
   11.3.1. Warehouse Space. Warehouse space is required for bulk and bin storage of
   materials. This facility includes space for aisles, receiving, shipping, packing, crating,
   equipment storage and issue, central mobility weapons storage, general supply and base
   issue/supply point, personnel clothing and equipment, latrines, utility room, administration,
   equipment management, and transportation management. Due to the various taskings of
   AFRC units, use scope in this section for planning purposes only. Design actual
   requirements on a case-by-case basis in coordination with HQ AFRC.
      11.3.1.1. Administrative Space. At AFRC host installations, multiply number of full
      time personnel assigned to the base supply warehouse administrative staff by 70 square
      feet to determine net administrative facility space authorization. Add 30% facility
      overhead to determine gross facility space authorization.
      11.3.1.2. Basic Supply Storage. Multiply base population of any given UTA weekend
      (not total assigned personnel) by 15 square feet to determine basic supply storage
      requirement. Supply storage may be located in centralized warehouse or distributed
      within individual unit facilities.
