                                            Chapter 2

                               INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

2.1. Workflow Management Process
     2.1.1. AFSPC Business Rules directly support the tasking, tracking and coordination of
     AFSPC’s Command Section staff packages.
     2.1.2. To the greatest extent possible, all tasking, coordination and staffing within AFSPC is
     accomplished electronically in TMT. The AFSPC Tasker Workflow is the central point for
     all tasks requiring AFSPC Command Section review. Directorates/NAFs/Centers will route
     all tasks through this workflow for formal coordination.
     2.1.3. Use TMT to manage and coordinate any task requiring a signature from, decision by
     or deliverable to HQ AFSPC leadership. Any task requesting equivalent (2-Letter or higher)
     coordination, must be tasked and managed in TMT. Use of TMT for coordination at the 3-
     Letter and below is highly encouraged.
     2.1.4. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 provide additional detail on AFSPC tasking, coordination and
     staffing.
2.2. Records Management. TMT is not a Records Management tool. Directorates must copy
Official Records from TMT and place in an authorized Electronic Records Management Tool as
required by the respective organizational File Plan or guidance from the organizational
Functional Area Record Manager (FARM).
2.3. E-mail Responses to the Command Section. During meetings, the AFSPC/CC,
AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA may ask questions that may be answered via e-mail. The Director or
Commander may respond to AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA, with courtesy copies to
HQ AFSPC/CCE, HQ AFSPC/CVE and AFSPC/CA Workflow, as appropriate. Relevant
background information should be included with the response. Provide the AFSPC/CA
Workflow with a courtesy copy unless the response is “Eyes Only.”
2.4. Overdue AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA tasks: Require a written explanation
via SSS, push note or e-mail from the Director or Commander explaining why the OPR missed
the suspense.
AFSPCI33-303 7 MAY 2014                                                                         7

                                     TASKING PROCESS

3.1. Task/Tasking Process
     3.1.1. Sources of tasks include, but are not limited to HHQ (by phone, E-mail or TMT),
     AFSPC Senior Leadership (resulting from meetings, conferences, etc.) or Department of
     Defense organizations.
     3.1.2. External tasks are those tasks received from a non-AFSPC entity or tasks delivered
     outside the AFSPC organization. External tasks received from outside organizations,
     requiring 2-Letter or General Officer/Flag Officer (GO/FO) coordination must be relayed
     through HQ AFSPC/CAE2.
     3.1.3. Internal taskers are tasks originating from an AFSPC organization or tasks which are
     coordinated between AFSPC organizations exclusively.
         3.1.3.1. Top-down taskers are tasks assigned by one organization to another which has a
         lower level tasking authority (e.g., a Level 2 organization that tasks a Level 3
         organization).
         3.1.3.2. Bottom-up tasks are created by a directorate, NAF, Center or Direct Reporting
         Unit and pushed to the AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV and/or AFSPC/CA for review.
         3.1.3.3. Horizontal taskers are tasks sent only between organizations that have an
         equivalent tasking authority as described in Table 3.1.
     3.1.4. Equivalent Tasking Authority: For internal and external tasking, only equivalent
     office levels in the following table may task AFSPC directorates, commands or subordinate
     organizations. Commands or directorates will reject tasks sent by a lower-level organization.

Table 3.1. Equivalent Tasking Authority
 Level      Office
 1          CSAF/SECAF/VCSAF/USECAF/MAJCOM CC/CCMD CDR
 2          HAF 2-Letter/MAJCOM CV/CA/CCMD DCDR
 3          HAF 3-Letter/MAJCOM 2-Letter/ NAF-Center-CC/CV/CA/CS/CCMD
            2-Letter/FOA 2-Letter
 4          HAF 4-Letter/MAJCOM 3-Letter/ NAF 2-Letter/SPO/CCMD 3-Letter

     3.1.5. AFSPC 2-Letter, NAF or Center Commanders will request AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV
     and/or AFSPC/CA coordination on any external task establishing a command position or
     requiring Command Section attention.
3.2. Tasker Categories and Timelines
     3.2.1. The following describes the suspense timelines each tasking authority may set.
     Tasking authorities will not suspense other organizations above their authority without the
     approval of the next level.
 8                                                                AFSPCI33-303 7 MAY 2014


Table 3.2. Tasker Categories

                        CC Level: due to AFSPC/CA NLT 5 duty days prior to CC or
                        HHQ suspense.
                        CV Level: due to AFSPC/CA NLT 4 duty days prior to CV or
                        HHQ suspense.
                        CA Level: due to AFSPC/CA NLT 3 duty days prior to CC or
                        HHQ suspense.
 Hot                    Task is due to AFSPC/CA in less than 48 hours
 Critical               Task is due to AFSPC/CA in less than 24 hours

3.3. Tasker Acceptance/Redirect
     3.3.1. If the tasked directorate asserts a different organization within AFSPC should assume
     primary responsibility, the tasked directorate must gain concurrence from that other
     organization before primary responsibility of the task can be transferred.
        3.3.1.1. The original OPR will E-mail AFSPC/CA Workflow and “cc” the new OPR’s
        workflow upon agreement.
        3.3.1.2. Tasks must be transferred within 24 hours upon tasking.
        3.3.1.3. The task suspense will not be extended due to transfer of OPR.
        3.3.1.4. Until HQ AFSPC/CA changes the OPR, the original directorate tasked is
        responsible for action on the package.
        3.3.1.5. If both directorates provide sound rationale why the other should be the OPR
        and cannot come to an agreement, HQ AFSPC/CAE will review that rationale and break
        the stalemate.

                               COORDINATION PROCESS

4.1. Coordination Requirements. OPRs begin the coordination process by identifying and
tasking the OCR(s) (within and outside the OPR’s organization) that have equity in the task
(equivalent tasking rules apply). OCR organizations respond directly to the OPR. The OPR will
adjudicate comments from coordinating offices and prepare the final staff package. Once staff
coordination is complete, the OPR routes the tasking through the organization’s
chain-of-command.
4.2. Concur With Comments. If an OCR concurs with comments during directorate-level
coordination, it is the OPR’s responsibility to resolve any comments and deconflict duplicative
comments. The OPR will detail unresolved comments in the SSS under “Views of Others.”
4.3. Nonconcurrence. If an OCR nonconcurs during directorate-level coordination, the OCR
will send a comment resolution matrix to the OPR stating reasons for nonconcurrence. The OPR
and OCR will attempt to resolve the nonconcur. Any unresolved nonconcurs will be explained
in the SSS under “Views of Others.” The OPR will make the final recommendation to the
Command Section as to concur or nonconcur on a task.
4.4. Suspense Extension/Rejection
   4.4.1. AFSPC OPRs are empowered to request extensions on external tasks as necessary.
   4.4.2. AFSPC/CA will request extensions on HHQ tasks from the SECAF, CSAF, USECAF,
   VCSAF, as required.
   4.4.3. Tasked offices will provide an appropriate response when rejecting a task; ignoring
   taskers is not acceptable.

                   COMMAND STAFF PACKAGE DEVELOPMENT

5.1. General Information
   5.1.1. Guidelines. Specific guidelines for the preparation and staffing of packages are
   provided in this chapter. HQ AFSPC/CAE2 will return packages that do not comply with
   these guidelines.
   5.1.2. Adhere to the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) for proper formatting,
   naming conventions and specific guidance. Current TTPs are located on the AFSPC/CA
   SharePoint page, AO Tools.
5.2. Transmittal Documents. AFSPC uses the approved SSS as the primary transmittal
document to prepare and staff packages for members of the Command Section. All staff
packages presented to the AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA must utilize a SSS (electronic
or hard copy). However, Directors and Commanders may use informal transmittal documents
such as push notes or E-mails in lieu of the SSS.
   5.2.1. Staff Summary Sheet (SSS). A stand-alone document that explains what actions are
   required and why. The SSS is used to introduce, summarize, coordinate or obtain approval
   and/or signature on staff packages. Use the approved SSS format for both classified and
   unclassified tasks.
      5.2.1.1. Electronic: Unclassified SSSs are submitted via TMT.
      5.2.1.2. Paper/Hard Copy: Classified tasks are delivered as hard copy and include a SSS.
      If a portion of the package is classified and the remaining material is unclassified, all
      material will be combined into one hard copy package with applicable security markings.
      5.2.1.3. The SSS must have the following paragraph headings: Purpose, Background,
      Discussion, Views of Others and Recommendation.
          5.2.1.3.1. Each SSS section must have text. “N/A” is not acceptable. Use “No
          additional coordination required” or “No additional coordination requested” if there is
          nothing else to put in Views of Others.
      5.2.1.4. Signature. Transmittal documents must be approved and signed by the Director,
      Deputy Director or equivalent. Reference AFSPC TTPs for proper annotation.
      5.2.1.5. Tabs. List tabs at the bottom of the SSS and order as follows: actionable,
      supporting, authority/reference and incoming letter (original tasker).
      5.2.1.6. Coordination Block. The approved action verbs are: coordinate (coord),
      approve, information (info) and signature (sign). Only the final reviewer will perform the
      action: approve, info or sign (e.g., AFSPC/CA Coord, AFSPC/CV Coord, AFSPC/CC
      Info) or (e.g., AFSPC/CA Coord, AFSPC/CV Sign).
   5.2.2. Push Note. A short and informal transmittal document used to inform or update the
   Command Section staff. This document will not request a decision.
5.3. Package Content. Follow the guidelines outlined in AFH 33-337, AFMAN 33-326, this
instruction and AFSPC TTPs to develop appropriate content.
AFSPCI33-303 7 MAY 2014                                                                      11


   5.3.1. Format. The command standard font is MS Word Arial 12 point font, for all paper
   products routed to the Command Section. Arial 11 point font is permitted to make a single
   page. All PowerPoint presentations made to AFSPC/CC in Building 1 Large Conference
   Room, Small Conference Room and Commander’s Vault will utilize the approved
   PowerPoint template. Templates are available at AFSPC/CA SharePoint page, AO Tools.
   5.3.2. Pen and Ink Changes. Documents sent outside AFSPC must be error-free without pen
   and ink changes. Pen and ink changes are acceptable at the discretion of the AFSPC/CA and
   AFSPC/CV for documents remaining within the headquarters.
   5.3.3. Changes to Staff Packages. Recoordinate a new package when significant changes are
   required. Include why the package requires recoordination, a summary of all changes and a
   copy of the original SSS. The original and revised packages are kept for record by the OPR.
   5.3.4. Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM). Provides comments on coordination documents.
   For external taskers, a CRM may be provided by the tasking organization. For all other
   taskers, the AFSPC approved CRM will be used. CRM will list all critical comments first,
   followed by major, then substantive comments. Administrative errors are not included in the
   CRM for AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA coordination/approval. Instead, annotate
   these findings in the SSS and return administrative comments to the originator under separate
   cover (e.g., seven administrative errors were found).
   5.3.5. Comments. OPRs will coordinate and consolidate comments from all equitable
   directorates, NAFs and Centers. Comments must be documented in a CRM and/or the SSS
   for Command Section coordination.
5.4. Sensitive and Classified Packages
   5.4.1. Sensitive Information. Communications referring to negative or adverse information
   on an individual or program (e.g., personnel or inspector general actions) or that contain
   proprietary or source selection information are considered sensitive.
       5.4.1.1. Tasks containing sensitive, non-classified, information can utilize TMT if
       marked private. However, it is the directorate’s/NAF’s/Center’s decision if a sensitive
       package is hard copy or electronic.
       5.4.1.2. Hard copy packages will use folders with a Sensitive Information or AF IMT
       3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet, on the front cover.
   5.4.2. Classified Information. Classified packages will be processed via hard copy.
       5.4.2.1. Directorates and Commands will track classified packages via TMT using an
       unclassified title.
       5.4.2.2. The OPR will hand-carry classified packages to HQ AFSPC/CAK for initial
       processing. OPRs will coordinate meeting times with HQ AFSPC/CVS and HQ
       AFSPC/CAS prior to delivery of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special
       Access Program (SAP) packages.
       5.4.2.3. The AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA office will store SECRET packages
       until Command Section review is complete.
 12                                                               AFSPCI33-303 7 MAY 2014


      5.4.2.4. The AFSPC/CC office will store Top Secret (TS)/Sensitive Compartmented
      Information (SCI) packages until the AFSPC/CC review is complete. The AFSPC/CV
      and AFSPC/CA offices cannot store TS and/or SCI information.
      5.4.2.5. AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV and AFSPC/CA offices are not accredited for storage
      of SAP materials.
5.5. Packages Requiring Rework
   5.5.1. HQ AFSPC/CAE2 will return packages requiring corrections, rework or are missing
   pertinent information. Once corrected, the tasked organization will return the reworked
   package to HQ AFSPC/CAK with the original/annotated material (if provided in hard copy).
   5.5.2. The OPR will return packages sent back for corrections within 24 hours or by a time
   set by HQ AFSPC/CAE. Unless otherwise directed, the suspense is not extended for
   returned taskers.
5.6. Meeting/Event Preparation Materials
   5.6.1. Event Books are required for all formal events, ceremonies, dinners, DV visits or
   functions scheduled for AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA attendance in the local area.
   The directorates, NAFs or Centers with the most equity in the event will be assigned as OPR.
      5.6.1.1. The OPR will submit an Event Book with an attendees list as part of the RAH
      task to ensure the AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA has the necessary details of the
      event.
      5.6.1.2. Separate Event Books are required for the AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV and
      AFSPC/CA if all are attending the same event.
   5.6.2. Trip Books, bios, talking papers and/or point papers are required for all formal events
   or functions attended by the AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA in locations not
   considered “local” in accordance with local travel policy memo available on the Action
   Office Workspace. AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV, AFSPC/CA or HQ AFSPC/CCX will task a
   command or directorate to provide material in support of the trip.
   5.6.3. Initial Planning Meetings (IPM) are essential for events requiring a vector from
   AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA. The product is not a decision book; it is a
   PowerPoint slideshow that facilitates discussion, obtains a required vector or answers
   questions. Use the PowerPoint template in the AO Tools website for IPM materials.
      5.6.3.1. The directorate or command responsible for the issue will be assigned as OPR.
      5.6.3.2. OPRs will schedule an IPM using the normal meeting request format with
      AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV and/or AFSPC/CA, allowing adequate time for significant event
      changes.
   5.6.4. Read Aheads (RAH) are required for all formal meetings scheduled with the
   AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA. RAH materials are due to the principal’s office
   NLT two working days prior to the scheduled meeting.
      5.6.4.1. HQ AFSPC/CAE2 will adjust RAH tasker suspenses to account for projected
      leave, TDY, non-duty days and CV/CA review as necessary.
      5.6.4.2. RAHs will contain the following information at a minimum:
AFSPCI33-303 7 MAY 2014                                                                    13


         5.6.4.2.1. SSS or push note from the Commander or Director that summarizes the
         information in the package.
         5.6.4.2.2. A coordinated list of attendees, in rank order, that indicates name, rank,
         Distinguished Visitor (DV) status, organization and “go by” name. Include
         AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA as an attendee if required. AFSPC/CV and
         AFSPC/CA staffs will delete them as appropriate.
         5.6.4.2.3. All pertinent information and any necessary attachments in the package.
         Examples of other necessary attachments are biographies, itinerary, briefing slides,
         point papers, floor plans or maps.
  5.6.5. AFSPC/CA and AFSPC/CV will coordinate on RAH for the AFSPC/CC. AFSPC/CA
  will coordinate on RAH for the AFSPC/CV. AFSPC/CCC will coordinate on all RAHs with
  enlisted equity.

                                           Chapter 6

                                     TMT GUIDELINES

6.1. Overview
   6.1.1. The HQ AFSPC TMT is the single system for assigning and managing taskers
   throughout AFSPC. TMT is currently only hosted on the NIPRNET.
   6.1.2. HQ AFSPC/A6 provides technical support and help desk functions, manages the
   support contractor, training materials and creates/maintains organizational E-mail boxes,
   TMT groups, TMT individual user lists and permissions.
   6.1.3. For classified taskers, TMT will be utilized for tracking purposes only. Classified
   taskers at the Secret level will be tasked out using NGeS on the SIPRNET.
6.2. Suspense Tasking, Tracking and Coordination Procedure
   6.2.1. TMT provides the visibility needed to manage virtually any staff activity and should
   be utilized to the maximum extent possible. The term “task” is used for a wide variety of
   activities: requesting assessment of a proposal, soliciting feedback on changes to an
   instruction, calling for award nominations, mandating input to reports and staff meetings, etc.
      6.2.1.1. Any task requiring a signature from, decision by or deliverable to AFSPC/CC,
      AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA must be assigned to or managed by the AFSPC Tasker
      Workflow using TMT in order to maintain proper oversight.
      6.2.1.2. Organizations may act on behalf of a higher tasking authority to release/manage
      a tasker provided that they have first gained approval to do so.
      6.2.1.3. In TMT, the OPR is responsible for assigning (through “Manage Assignments”)
      any OCRs to work the task. To minimize inactivity, OPRs must assign OCRs
      expeditiously.
      6.2.1.4. Directorates, NAFs and Centers will never utilize the Senior Leadership
      Approval Process (SLAP) for AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA coordination. HQ
      AFSPC/CAK will manage all coordination for AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV and AFSPC/CA
      (i.e., behind the glass).
      6.2.1.5. Directorates receiving taskers from outside the Command (MAJCOM 2-Letter
      or higher) must forward the task to AFSPC/CA Workflow or hand-off a bottom-up task
      assigning AFSPC Tasker Workflow as the initiator.
      6.2.1.6. Any tasks requiring coordination from Wings or units within a NAF or Center
      must be sent through the NAF or Center workflow. (T-2)
   6.2.2. The OPR can submit extension requests through the TMT suspense extension request
   function or via E-mail to AFSPC/CA Workflow. Include the requested date and a brief
   justification for the extension.
AFSPCI33-303 7 MAY 2014                                                                        15


6.3. Guidance for Staffing
   6.3.1. Tasks submitted to AFSPC/CA for coordination will contain the AFSPC approved
   SSS uploaded in the “My Response” section. The OPR will also load all final documents to
   the “Tabs” section. The naming convention for the tabs must match those listed on the SSS.
   6.3.2. The task initiator will ensure all working documents are loaded under “Original
   Documents” section in TMT. When creating tasks in TMT, adhere to Table 6.1 standards.

My Instructions        The task initiator is responsible for providing sufficient background
                       information, documents and guidance so AOs can complete the requested
                       action. “My Instructions” will be in SSS format using the “Default
                       Instruction Template.”


                       The OPR must identify an AO (not just office symbol), who can answer
                       specific questions related to the tasker. The OPR must provide required
                       reference/source materials in the Original Documents section of TMT and
                       a template (if needed) for answering the tasker.

OCR Coord              Ensure all OCRs have completed coordination or provide a statement in the
                       SSS regarding incomplete/missing response.


Tabs                   Ensure all final documents (attachments, attendees list, response E-mail,
                       etc.) are loaded in the “Tabs” section of TMT. Reference the AFSPC TTPs
                       for actual formatting.
My Response            Add “Ready for CAK review” and complete the SSS using the
                       AFSPC “Default SSS Template” in the “My Response” of TMT. Ensure
                       the appropriate signature block is at the bottom of the SSS. Add the digital
                       signature of the primary that approved release.

                       Or


                       Provide action taken to complete the tasker (e.g., E-mail sent to CC or
                       coordination with HHQ completed).

Approved               Once the package is approved, HQ AFSPC/CAK will return the package to
                       the primary OPR for any final action and to close the tasker. It is the AO’s
Package
                       responsibility to disseminate any signed documents or pass on approvals.


                       If it is a RAH, HQ AFSPC/CAK will close the tasker.

  6.3.3. Task Management
       6.3.3.1. Bottom-up tasks are created in TMT by the directorates, special staffs, NAFs or
       Centers that request AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA coordination.
           6.3.3.1.1. Utilize “Manage Assignments” to either “Hand-off Draft” a task to
           “AFSPC Tasker Workflow” or assign “AFSPC Tasker Workflow” as Primary OPR.
           Tasks assigned directly to AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA will be rejected.
           HQ AFSPC/CAK will only accept tasks from 2-Letter or equivalent offices in TMT.
           6.3.3.1.2. Manage all bottom-up tasks for AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CV or AFSPC/CA
