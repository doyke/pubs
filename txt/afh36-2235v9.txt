                               Chapter 1
                          GENERAL INFORMATION
                                   Overview

Introduction      This handbook serves as a guide for applying the Instructional
                  System Development (ISD) process to the design, development,
                  implementation and management of technical training in the Air
                  Force. It adheres to the policies of AFPD 36-22 and follows the
                  principles and procedures outlined in AFMAN 36-2234. It is
                  intended as an easy reading guide for novices, experienced
                  training managers, curriculum developers, and instructors. While
                  it is designed as a "stand-alone" document, you should read and
                  be familiar with AFPD 36-22 and AFMAN 36-2234. You should
                  also be familiar with the training development documents
                  referenced throughout this handbook, as applicable.


Background        In the past, the Air Force ISD manual and handbook were
                  focused on how ISD applied to technical training. There was little
                  or no guidance on applying the ISD process to other areas such
                  as aircrew training, acquisition, or education. The revised
                  AFMAN 36-2234 provides the guidance and procedures
                  necessary for applying the ISD process throughout the Air Force,
                  regardless of the type of training or education being developed.
                  Various volumes of AFH 36-2235 provide specific guidance and
                  procedures for applying ISD to aircrew training, acquisition,
                  education, and technical training. Other volumes of AFH 36-2235
                  have been developed to cover applications of ISD in other areas
                  such as computer-based training (CBT) selection and interactive
                  courseware (ICW) decisions.


Purpose           This handbook provides specific information and guidance for
                  using the instructional development process to develop technical
                  training. It provides information on the ISD model, planning for
                  ISD projects, phases of the ISD process, system functions, and
                  quality improvements.

Is this handbook      This handbook addresses the question: "How do you apply the
for you?              ISD process in technical training?" It is applicable whether a
                      contractor or the Air Force develops the training. But is it for
                      you?

                      Are You Responsible For . . .                           Yes    No
                      Developing specialty training?
                      Using Occupational Survey Report (OSR) data to
                      develop training for an Air Force Specialty (AFS)?
                      Developing courseware to train personnel to
                      maintain equipment at organizational, intermediate,
                      or depot level?
                      Are You . . .                                           Yes    No
                      A training manager, curriculum developer, training
                      specialist or instructor with a few years' experience
                      in ISD?
                      A Subject Matter Expert (SME) with no ISD
                      experience?
                      An ISD expert?
                      A novice or "entry-level" curriculum developer?

                      If you checked YES to any of these questions, this handbook will
                      help you do your job.


What is ISD?          ISD is a systematic but flexible process used to analyze, design,
                      develop and implement training in an effective and cost-efficient
                      manner. It is a total quality process that continuously strives to
                      improve the system (continuous evaluation). ISD ensures that:

                         There is a training need.
                         There is an effective and efficient solution to the need.
                         The solution can be implemented.
                         The solution can be assessed to determine whether it meets
                         the need.
                         Continuous quality improvements are made throughout the
                         ISD process.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                             6



Basis for ISD       The ISD process used in the Air Force is based on:

                       Basic research on how people learn.
                       Basic research on how people communicate.
                       The systems engineering process.
                       The concepts of instructional technology.


Why use ISD?        Using the ISD process ensures that training is both effective and
                    cost-efficient. ISD requires that you:

                       Assess the need for training.
                       Analyze training requirements.
                       Design training to meet specific job requirements that have
                       been identified through a training needs assessment.
                       Design training for all job elements that are critical to
                       successful performance.
                       Design training to meet specific training objectives.
                       Choose methods and media to optimize the effectiveness and
                       cost-efficiency of training.
                       Evaluate courses to make sure they meet the objectives and
                       revise them if they fail to do so.
                       Collect and use student data to improve the quality of the
                       training.


Goal of ISD         The goal of ISD is to produce graduates who can perform their
                    jobs after receiving training and to reduce overall costs of training
                    by accurately identifying training requirements.


How to use ISD      ISD is:

                       Flexible and systematic.
                       A tool to get the right training for the problem.
                       Not a lock-step, linear process.

                               Don't have a "checklist mentality" when
                                    you're using the ISD process.

              INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT MODEL
                                         Overview

Introduction           Designing, developing, delivering and supporting a training
                       system requires considerable time and effort on the part of
                       managers and curriculum developers. Curriculum developers
                       must design, develop, and implement effective and cost-efficient
                       training, while managers must control, coordinate, and integrate
                       the training into a total training system using the principles of
                       Quality Improvement (QI). A total instructional system model
                       includes the phases of ISD, the system functions, and the QI
                       process. This chapter will address these areas.


Objectives             The objectives of this chapter are to:

                          Define the phases of the ISD process.
                          Discuss the system functions.
                          Explain the QI process.


Updated Air Force      The updated ISD model has been designed to represent
ISD model              simplicity and flexibility so that instructional developers with
                       varying levels of expertise can understand the model and use it to
                       develop effective, cost-efficient instructional systems. The model
                       also depicts the flexibility that instructional developers have to
                       enter or reenter the various stages of the process as necessary.

                       process.


System functions       An extension of the systems approach places the ISD process
                       within the functional design of a total instructional system.
                       Figure 1 shows the basic top-level system functions of the
                       instructional system: management, support, administration,
                       delivery, and evaluation.

What are they?        The system functions of the ISD model are:

                      Management: the function of directing or controlling instructional
                      system development and operations.

                      Support: the function of maintaining all parts of the system.

                      Administration: the function of day-to-day processing and record
                      keeping.

                      Delivery: the function of bringing instruction to students.

                      Evaluation: the function of gathering feedback data through
                      formative, summative, and operational evaluations to assess
                      system and student performance.


Relation to ISD       Using these essential functions to design the overall instructional
                      system architecture and then allocating them to the respective
                      instructional system components or people responsible, ensures
                      that these functions are operational when the total training
                      system is fielded. ISD products are integrated into the total

Relation to ISD      instructional system, and aspects of the system functions are
(Continued)          active throughout all phases of the ISD process.

                     Figure 2 shows the phases most often used in the systems
                     approach, which are analysis, design, development, and
                     implementation, with evaluation activities integrated into each
                     phase of the process. The phases are embedded within the
                     system functions. Evaluation is shown as the central feedback
                     "network" for the total system.

                     Figure 2 Functions with Phases




                     The instructional development process, which the model
                     summarizes, calls for instructional developers to:

                        Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.
                        Design instruction to meet the need.
                        Develop instructional materials to support system
                        requirements.
                        Implement the instructional system.
                        Evaluation is a central function that takes place at every
                        phase.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9       1 November 2002                                          11



Relation to ISD      Symbolically, Figure 2 shows that all phases of the model depend
(Continued)          on each of the other phases. The ISD process allows the
                     instructional developer or design team to enter or reenter the
                     various phases of the process as determined by the nature and
                     scope of the development or revision activity. The phases of the
                     updated model are described below.


Analysis phase       In courses that tie the content directly to preparing a student to do
                     a job, the instructional developer analyzes the job performance
                     requirements and develops a task list. This helps ensure that the
                     customer's needs are being met. The developer then analyzes
                     the job tasks and compares them with the skills, knowledge, and
                     abilities of the incoming students. The difference between what
                     they already know and can do and what the job requires them to
                     know and be able to do determines what instruction is necessary.


Design phase         In the design phase, the instructional developer develops a
                     detailed plan of instruction that includes selecting the instructional
                     methods and media, and determining the instructional strategies.
                     Existing instructional materials are reviewed during this phase to
                     determine their applicability to the specific instruction under
                     development. In this phase, the instructional developers also
                     develop the instructional objectives and test and design the
                     instruction. The implementation plan for the instructional system
                     is also developed in this phase and a training information
                     management system is designed, if required. Formative
                     evaluation activities continue in this phase.


Development          In the development phase, both the student and instructor lesson
phase                materials are developed. If the media selected in the design
                     phase included items such as videotapes, sound/slides,
                     interactive courseware (ICW), and training devices, these are
                     developed. If a training information management system was
                     developed for the instructional system, it is installed in this phase.
                     As a final step in this phase, the implementation plan is updated.
                     During this phase, instructional developers also validate each
                     unit/module of instruction and its associated instructional
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                            12



Development         materials. They correct any deficiencies that may be identified.
phase (Continued)   Validation includes:

                       Internal review of the instruction and materials for accuracy.
                       Individual and small-group tryouts.
                       Operational tryouts of the "whole" system.

                    Revision of units/modules occurs as they are validated, based on
                    feedback from formative and summative evaluation activities.
                    The final step in this phase is to finalize all training materials.


Implementation      The instructional system has been designed and developed, and
phase               it is now time for the actual system to become operational. In this
                    phase, the instructional system is fielded under operational
                    conditions and the activities of operational evaluation provide
                    feedback from the field on the graduate's performance.


Evaluation          Evaluation is a continuous process beginning during the analysis
                    phase and continuing throughout the life cycle of the instructional
                    system. Evaluation consists of:

                    Formative Evaluation, consisting of process and product
                    evaluations conducted during the analysis and design phases,
                    and validation that is conducted during the development phase.
                    Included are individual and small group tryouts.
                    Summative Evaluation, consisting of operational tryouts
                    conducted as the last step of validation in the development
                    phase.
                    Operational Evaluation, consisting of periodic internal and
                    external evaluation of the operational system during the
                    implementation phase.

                    Each form of evaluation should be used during development,
                    update, and revision of instruction, if possible, and if the form of
                    evaluation is applicable.

                    The QI process, which is further discussed in this chapter, is
                    briefly described below.

                    Quality improvement is the continuous, organized creation of
                    beneficial change to the system. The objective of quality
                    improvement is to foster continuous improvement in the process
                    and products of ISD. It is an independent evaluation to determine
                    whether the products are meeting the users' needs. The
                    objective of quality improvement is to ensure on-time
                    development of high-quality courseware that enables students to
                    reach the desired performance levels in an effective and cost-
                    efficient manner.

                    The updated model graphically illustrates that:

                       Evaluation is the foundation of the ISD process.

Updated AF ISD         ISD is a continuous process with the flexibility to enter and
model                  reenter the various phases, as necessary, to develop, update,
(Continued)            or revise instruction.
                       All ISD activities take place within and are dependent on the
                       system functions.

                    Teamwork is required between personnel performing system
                    functions and those designing, developing, and implementing
                    instructional systems.

                    All ISD activities and system functions focus on continuous
                    quality improvements in the system.

                        MANAGEMENT             The practice of directing or controlling all
                                               aspects of the training system.
                        SUPPORT                Provides for and maintains the training
                                               system on a day-to-day as well as long-
                                               term basis. Examples are the resources
                                               you need to keep equipment functioning.
                        ADMINISTRATION         The part of management that does day-
                                               to-day tasks such as documentation,
                                               student assignments, and student
                                               records.
                        DELIVERY               The means by which training is provided
                                               to students. Instructors, computers,
                                               printed materials, audiovisual programs
                                               are all examples of ways to deliver
                                               training.
                        EVALUATION             The function of gathering feedback data
                                               through formative, summative, and
                                               operational evaluations to assess system
                                               and student performance.


When do you             For the training system to be effective and cost-efficient, system
implement them?         functions must be working before the actual design, development
                        and implementation processes begin.

When you do it      Conduct analysis before you begin to design and develop a new
                    training system or revise an existing system.


What you get        If you have conducted analysis correctly, you will get valid
                    training requirements and accurate predictions of the resource
                    requirements.

What you need      To conduct analysis, you need to assess items such as:

                      Equipment
                      Subject matter experts
                      Weapon system data

                      Occupational Survey Report data
                      Engineering data
                      Similar systems or programs
                      Performance standards

                                      Section C
                                       Design

What it is          Training design is like architectural design. You figure out what
                    you want the training to look like and how you want it to work
                    before you build it. The analysis that you previously conducted
                    helps determine the basic structure in the design phase.


Why do it?          The purpose of design is to be sure that the product teaches. If a
                    product does not teach it has no value. Way too much training
                    does not teach. Supposedly a designer knows what is effective
                    in promoting learning for different kinds of outcomes. The
                    designer then builds into the instruction those conditions that are
                    necessary for effective and efficient learning to occur. If these
                    conditions are not built into the materials then there is strong
                    likelihood that the materials will not teach.

What you get       Proper design will result in:

                      Objectives that you will prioritize, cluster, and sequence.
                      Tests that measure the objectives.
                      Training methods, media, and strategies to deliver the training.
                      A training information management system.
                      A review of existing material.


What you need      For the ISD design phase, you need all the products you
                   developed during initial planning and in the analysis phase.

                                   Section D
                                  Development

What it is          During ISD development you develop, validate, and revise the
                    training. Development activities for technical training include:

                       Writing (print)
                       Producing (video or audiovisual materials)
                       Installing (management systems)
                       Building (devices/simulators)
                       Validating (formative, summative, and operational evaluation)
                       training (instruction)
                       Revising (training)


Why do it?          Development is the production of the materials. Without
                    development there is no instruction except perhaps in the case of
                    extemporaneous live instruction. With technology production
                    (development) has become a highly specialized area with
                    different people needed for different aspects of the production
                    (artists, technical writers, computer programmers, web site
                    designer.)

What it is          In the implementation phase, the training system is implemented
                    and the course becomes operational.


Why do it?          You implement and conduct training to meet a specific need.

What it is          Evaluation measures the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of
                    the training system. Evaluation answers the questions:

                       Is the process effective and cost-efficient?
                       Are quality products being developed?
                       How well are the course graduates performing on the job?
                       How can the system be improved?


Why do it?          Evaluation improves the quality of the ISD process and products
                    while producing graduates who can meet job performance
                    requirements.

                               Quality Improvement

Introduction          ISD is a continuous, systematic process that incorporates a
                      never-ending evaluation process. The Air Force uses the ISD
                      process as a tool to ensure that quality instructional systems are
                      developed. It helps managers and instructional developers
                      design, develop, and implement quality instruction for Air Force
                      personnel in the most effective and cost-efficient manner
                      possible. The ISD process implements all of the principles of the
                      Quality Air Force (QAF) program. A process-focused approach is
                      a major way of achieving continuous, measurable improvements
                      in the quality of the instructional development process. As you
                      implement a structured approach for process improvements, you
                      will be identifying problems, analyzing data, evaluating problem
                      solutions, and working together with other members of the
                      training design team to improve the process. This section covers
                      Quality Improvement (QI) and explains total quality process
                      improvement.


What it is            Quality Improvement is the continuous, organized creation of
                      beneficial change to the system. It is an independent evaluation
                      to determine whether the instructional products are meeting the
                      students' needs.


Objectives of QI      The objectives of quality improvement are to foster continuous
                      improvement in the processes and products and to ensure on-
                      time development of high-quality courseware that enables
                      students to reach the desired performance levels in an effective
                      and cost-efficient manner.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9       1 November 2002                                         27



Results of QI        Quality instructional product development results in:

                        Increased student satisfaction.
                        Products that are easy to use and maintain.
                        Increased ability of students to perform on the job.

                     Quality instructional design results in:

                        Fewer errors.
                        Less rework (and waste).
                        Higher success training.
                        Less time spent in development of new training products.
                        Lower life cycle costs.


ISD and quality      All of the principles of quality are implemented in the ISD
relationship         process. The ISD process ensures total quality in the training
                     environment by continuously evaluating the process and
                     products. The relationship between the key concepts of QI can
                     be easily seen in the ISD process. For example:

                     Customers:
                       The customer defines quality. ISD emphasizes criterion-
                       based training. The criteria are directly linked to performance
                       requirements. Field representatives (supervisors, squadron
                       commanders, etc.) identify training requirements, which
                       training providers such as Air Education and Training
                       Command (AETC) or other training organizations are then
                       under "contract" to satisfy. All evaluations are focused on the
                       trainee's actual job performance.
                       Know your customer. The information gained in the
                       mission/job analysis process gives you or the training design
                       team information that defines the customer's expectations.
                       Since ISD requires all training to be directly tied to job
                       requirements, the customer is the gaining unit or work center.
                       Everything is done on the premise that what the individual
                       needs to do the job determines the training requirements.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9       1 November 2002                                          28



ISD and quality         Focus on customers. As mentioned earlier, the gaining unit
relationship            or work center needs to determine training requirements. By
(Continued)             continuing to trace the relationship between the job
                        requirements and the individual's needs to do the job, a
                        continual focus on the actual field requirement is maintained.
                        In addition, the ISD process requires that the capabilities,
                        aptitudes, and attitudes of the target audience be considered
                        during the design phase.

                     Team Players:
                       Foster teamwork. A training program cannot be designed
                       and developed in a vacuum. In order to develop effective,
                       cost-efficient training, the development team should be in
                       constant touch with the work center and evaluation offices to
                       ensure that the training matches the performance
                       requirements on the job.
                       Empower your people. ISD is a problem solving, decision-
                       making model. Since ISD is flexible and since there are many
                       ways to solve a given training problem, a development team
                       should be allowed freedom and given authority to analyze,
                       design, develop, and implement training meeting job
                       performance requirements and standards.

                     Final Product:
                        Know your mission. ISD depends on mission and job
                        analysis for the necessary data to design, develop, and
                        implement training. All training must be based directly on
                        mission or job requirements. The quality checks in the
                        analysis process help eliminate training that is unnecessary or
                        unrelated to the job.

                        Job analysis uses data from many sources, including mission
                        statements found in policy directives or locally developed
                        statements. Curriculum developers also make use of
                        management engineering reports, occupational survey data,
                        and direct observation to determine the actual job
                        requirements.

                        As part of the job analysis process, a training needs
                        assessment (TNA) is conducted to determine the actual
                        performance problems. In some cases, a problem is not due
                        to a lack of training, but to deficiencies within the job structure

(Continued)             may also be developed as a "preventive" measure — that is,
                        to prevent potential problems and to meet the informational
                        and educational needs of Air Force personnel.
                        Set goals and standards. The goals and standards for the
                        training design and development effort come in many
                        variations. First, the job requirements and the impact of the
                        performance deficiency determine the timing required for the
                        design and development process and the conducting of the
                        training program. Second, the content of the training is
                        determined by the individual's need to do the job. You or the
                        development team must directly translate the cues, conditions,
                        and performance standards for the job directly into the training
                        program.
                        Manage by fact. Each phase of the ISD process requires
                        constant evaluation against the job requirements identified
                        earlier in the process. In addition, a variety of tools have been
                        developed to ensure that the design and development
                        decisions are made with supporting data. For example, a
                        number of media selection tools are being used to provide
                        training managers with information that matches the training
                        media with the training requirements. These matches are
                        based on learning theories and development cost factors
                        (money and time). ISD is designed to guide training
                        managers and curriculum developers to the awareness of
                        factors affecting their decisions.
                        Integrate quality in all phases. Evaluation is continuous
                        quality checking. This is true during each phase of the ISD
                        process, from analysis to evaluation. Built-in checks in each
                        phase ensure the quality of the ISD process and training
                        products with emphasis on the trainee's performance.
                        Evaluate quality constantly. The ISD process is a cyclic,
                        ongoing process of continuous improvements. As you
                        progress through the different phases of ISD, the processes
                        and products of each phase are constantly evaluated against
                        the training requirements and the principles of learning. The
                        results of the evaluations determine which phase of ISD to
                        enter next. Constant evaluation identifies changes in training
                        requirements due to update in equipment and personnel,
                        resulting in new ISD efforts to provide the best possible
                        education and training for Air Force personnel.

Basis of process      The basis of process improvement is Quality Air Force (QAF).
improvement           QAF is a management philosophy and a methodology that work
                      together to produce continuous process improvements. It is
                      based on ten principles.

                         All work is a process.
                         Processes receive work from suppliers, add value and deliver
                         output to customers.
                         Anyone from whom a process receives work is a supplier.
                         Anyone to whom a process delivers output is a customer.
                         Customers have needs and expectations.
                         Customers will define and measure quality in terms of those
                         needs and expectations.
                         Quality is meeting customer needs and expectations.
                         Improving process quality increases productivity.
                         Processes can be identified, understood, measured, and
                         improved.
                         The people who operate the processes know best how to
                         improve them.


Procedure for         In order to ensure process improvements, you will need to use a
process               systematic method to identify and correct the causes of the
improvement           problems. The six steps of process improvement are outlined
                      below.

                         Step      Activity
                              1    Define the process and determine the main problem
                                   areas.
                              2    Analyze the problems and identify the causes of
                                   each.
                              3    Identify and evaluate possible changes to the
                                   process.
                              4    Implement the changes and monitor the process.
                              5    Institutionalize the changes.
                              6    Repeat for continuous improvements.

                    Each of these techniques uses the six basic steps mentioned
                    above.

                           Chart It, Check It, Change It


What it is         This technique is a systematic approach to continuous
                   improvement. This approach has three principal steps, as shown
                   below and in Figure 4.

                   problems and opportunities.
                   Evaluate the process to identify
                   alternative approaches.                            CHECK IT
                   Identify opportunities (i.e., useful
                   changes) from the alternatives.

                   Improve the process by
                   implementing changes identified
                   as opportunities.                                 CHANGE IT
                   Institutionalize the changes
                   through training, standardization,
                   etc. Then, use another process
                   (or use this same one again) to
                   make further improvements.

How to use it       To use the Shewhart Cycle, follow the steps listed below.

                    Plan an approach for quality improvement. Study the process
                    flow and any existing data. Formulate possible improvements,
                    experiments to be run, or additional data to be gathered.

                    Do the activity planned. Implement the improvement effort that
                    you planned. Train the people who are responsible for
                    implementation.

                    Check the results. Measure the results of the improvement
                    effort you implemented. Analyze the data you collected.

                    Act on the results. If the effort was truly an improvement,
                    standardize and document it. If it wasn't successful, determine
                    what could be done to improve it.

                    Repeat. Continue around the cycle again by planning and
                    carrying out further activity.

A process             that is often used to analyze process problems is the flowchart.
improvement tool


What it is            A flowchart is a graphical representation of all the major steps of
                      a process. It can help you:

                         Understand the complete process.
                         Identify the critical stages of the process.
                         Locate problem areas.
                         Show relationships between different steps in a process.


How to use it         Identify the process. Define the start point and finish point for
                      the process to be examined.

                      Chart the ideal process. Try to identify the easiest and most
                      efficient way to go from the start block to the finish block. While
                      this step isn't absolutely necessary, it does make it easier to find
                      improvements.

                      Describe the current process. Chart the whole process (i.e.,
                      lay out all the steps) from beginning to end. You can use
                      standard symbols to improve the clarity of your flowchart.

                      Search for improvement opportunities. Identify all areas that
                      hinder your process or add little or no value. Examine all areas
                      that differ from your ideal process and question why they exist.

                      Update your chart. Build a new flowchart that corrects the
                      problems you identified in the previous step.

Using process
                     There are numerous process improvement tools that can be used
improvement          to document and improve the training development process. As
methods              an instructional developer, you are encouraged to use a process
                     improvement tool such as flowcharting any time you are involved
                     in developing a new process or revising an existing process.
                     Also, if you haven't documented your current training
                     development process, it is recommended that you do so in order
                     to improve the process.

 Example of the       Figure 7 depicts the overall training development process used to
 training             develop technical training. You may want to adapt this flowchart
 development          to the specific or unique needs of your training organization. The
 process              blocks that have a number by them represent the stages within
                      the ISD process where the Technical Training Management
                      Systems (TTMS) can help support the process.


Automated training     The TTMS is an integrated, computer-based system for the entire
development process    technical training environment. The system provides the
                       technical training community with a modernized information
                       environment that includes networks, workstations, data servers,
                       and an integrated suite of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
                       software. The TTMS provides training design and development,
                       evaluation, instructor and student management, and resource
                       administration. The TTMS is designed for use by the USAF Air
                       Education and Training Command training centers to increase
                       effectiveness and efficiency of their resident and remote training
                       activities.

Metrics              Metrics are standards of measurement or quality indicators that
                     are critical to maintaining quality in the training development
                     process. The purpose of metrics is to provide qualitative and
                     quantitative evaluations of the process and products within each
                     phase of ISD. Metrics are based on key factors such as
                     performance, cost, and schedule. Types of metrics include, but
                     are not limited to, items such as:

                        Qualitative
                           Directives

                                     Overview

Introduction       Effective and cost-efficient training systems don't just happen –
                   they must be planned. Planning is a key element in the
                   management of the overall training system as well as in the ISD
                   process itself.

                   You play a vital role in the system. That role requires you, an
                   instructional developer, to identify any situation where inadequate
                   planning has occurred and report it to your supervisor or manager
                   of the training system. Your input is essential.

                   Inadequate planning is costly.


Objectives         The objectives of this chapter are to:

                      Determine ISD tasking.
                      Perform the training needs assessment.
                      Plan and execute training strategies.

                     Receive Training Development Tasking

Introduction          Your supervisor may tell you to develop a new human relations
                      course or to revise an F-16 fuels course to include new defueling
                      procedures. Did you ever wonder where your boss came up with
                      the need to develop new courses or revise existing courses? In
                      this section, you will learn how your boss may have come up with
                      the tasking which starts the training development effort.


What is a tasking?    A tasking is any formal request to develop new or revise existing
                      training.


Who issues a          A tasking to develop training may come from different
tasking?              organizations or levels within an organization. Formal tasking will
                      flow through predetermined channels depending on the level and
                      source of its origin.

                      The following are examples of the different levels from which
                      tasking may be issued.

                         Functional Manager – Air Staff (HQ USAF)
                         Functional Manager – Major Air Command (MAJCOM)
                         Training Manager – Training Center (TC)


Sources of tasking    The tasking to develop training may come from any number of
                      sources. Examples are:

                      External

                         Air Force Directives
                         Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW)

                                   Section B
                      Conduct Training Needs Assessment

Introduction           Training is expensive, requiring valuable resources to design,
                       develop, implement and maintain. Before starting to develop
                       training, you should make sure there is a training-related
                       problem. As a matter of fact, if at all possible, you should do a
                       Training Needs Assessment (TNA).


What is a problem      A problem or need is a deficiency or "gap" between actual
or need?               performance and desired performance. In other words, the "gap"
                       is the difference between what ought to be occurring (optimal)
                       and what is occurring (actual). A problem exists when the actual
                       performance level is below the optimal level of performance that
                       has been established. If the discrepancy is caused by people's
                       lack of skills, knowledge, or attitude to accomplish a job, then you
                       have a training-related problem.


What are some of       The following are some examples of problems or needs that may
the problems or        call for a TNA.
needs?
                          The personnel turnover rate is increasing.
                          The number of work-related injuries needs to be reduced.
                          A recent inspection has indicated that the quality of work
                          needs to be improved.
                          Equipment downtime needs to be reduced below 10%.
                          Worker dissatisfaction is widespread.
                          Deadlines are not met.


Possible causes of     Performance problems have many causes. Some are:
the problem
                          Workers do not have the necessary skills, or knowledge, or
                          attitude to perform the task.
                          Workers may not know they are doing a poor job. As a matter
                          of fact, they may even think they are doing a great job.
                          The task is rarely performed on the job so workers forget how
                          to do it.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9        1 November 2002                                      49



Possible causes of      The work environment is contributing to poor performance
the problem             because of a poorly designed machine, bad equipment/tools,
(Continued)             inadequate layout, insufficient lighting, uncomfortable
                        temperature, etc.
                        The organization is undermining performance because it tends
                        to punish good performance (e.g., by giving a person more
                        workload).
                        Workers are overworked (e.g., they have been on two shifts
                        straight).
                        Workers are absent-minded because of personal problems.

                     Only deficiency in skills, knowledge, or attitude calls for a
                     training solution.


What is TNA?         TNA is a systematic process to determine if a performance
                     problem is training-related.


Remember             The purpose of a TNA is to analyze the actual training need to
                     determine how to solve the problem.

                     Training is the solution for skills, knowledge, and attitude
                     deficiencies, and nothing else.


When is TNA          Ideally, TNA should be done before any other planning takes
Done?                place. You should make sure there is a training problem before
                     you start planning a training solution.


Stages of TNA        In general, a TNA consists of six stages as outlined below.

                       Stage          Activity
                         1         Define purpose.
                         2         Identify data sources.
                         3         Select and develop data gathering methods.
                         4         Collect data.
                         5         Analyze data.
                         6         Document findings and make recommendations.

Stage 1:            In the initial stage of TNA, you need to know:
Define purpose
                       Who is involved, who wants the problem solved, who needs
                       the problem solved, who is causing the problem, etc.
                       Where to get the information.
                       Nature of the problem.


Stage 2:            After you have initially defined the purpose of the TNA in general

                                                  task.
                    Interview                     Ask the supervisor if the worker can
                                                  do the task.
                    Observation                   Have the worker do the task in your
                                                  presence.
                    Analysis of Work              Review the worker's performance
                    Samples, Records and          records to determine if he/she can do

Stage 5:            After data collection, you need to analyze the data that you have
Analyze data        collected to:

                       Determine if the performance gap is caused by the worker's
                       lack of required skills, knowledge, or attitude.
                       Confirm the accuracy and quality of the data gathered by:
                           Having individuals who provided the information review
                           the data and analysis results.
                           Rechecking the data.
                           Verifying the results of the analysis. If the problem is not
                           training-related, you should notify appropriate individuals
                           to ensure that the problem is further addressed.


Stage 6:            After you have verified the accuracy of data and analysis results,
Document findings   you need to:
and recommend
solutions              Document the problem.
                       Identify the cause.
                       Recommend solutions to the problem.

Before making a      Before making a training recommendation, make sure training is
training             justified. Consider the following questions:
recommendation
                        How critical is the task?
                        How many people perform the task?
                        How difficult is the task?
                        How frequently is the task performed?
                        Would it be more cost-efficient to contract the task?

                     Because training is expensive, do not recommend a training
                     solution unless:

                        The task is highly critical i.e., inadequate performance will
                        result in injury or loss of life, damage to equipment, or mission
                        degradation.
                        Many people perform the task.
                        The task is highly complicated and difficult to learn.
                        The task is performed frequently.


Possible             You may face resource constraints when you conduct a TNA,
constraints          such as time, personnel, or money. If possible, you should work
                     around the constraints to the best of your ability. The following is
                     a brief example of some alternative methods of collecting data.


Job aids             A simple job aid can be designed to help determine when to
                     develop formal training. Two examples of job aids are provided
                     below.

                     Example 1

                     To use the job aid, simply provide the required information. The
                     information will help determine if the training development effort is
                     justified.

Job aids                                Justification For Training
(Continued)      1.   State the performance problem this training is to solve.
                 2.   State the evidence that the target population does not have
                      the skills, knowledge, or attitudes to do the task(s).
                 3.   Explain why the task is worth training:
                           Safety
                           Task criticality
                           Task difficulty
                           Number of members performing
                           Frequency of task performance
                 4.   Explain why the following alternatives are not feasible:
                           Provide a job aid
                           Find qualified workers
                 5.   List sources that have been searched for existing training.
                 6.   List existing training material identified, if any.
                 7.   Final decision:
                              Don't develop training; refer to          .
                              Develop new training.
                              Revise existing training.
                 8.   Explain why existing training is not used or needs revision.


                 Example 2

                 To use the following job aid, simply use the rating scale to fill in
                 the number of individuals performing the task and rate each task
                 according to criticality, difficulty, and performance frequency
                 (shaded area). In the case of the first task, the number
                 performing is many (2), criticality is high (3), difficulty is moderate
                 (2), and frequency is high (3). As a rule of thumb, if many people
                 perform the task or the number in the total column adds up to
                 seven or more, or the task is critical to safety, formal training
                 should be developed. Keep in mind there may be other factors
                 raising the importance of a task needing training.

                                     Section C
                        Establish Training System Concept

Introduction            The training system concept provides the framework for applying
                        the ISD process. It provides your best initial estimate of what the
                        instruction should do and what it should look like. The
                        determination of the needs and the application of learning theory
                        guide determination of a training system concept. Instructional
                        developers or design teams are normally not responsible for
                        establishing a training system concept. However, they need to
                        make sure that a concept has been established before
                        developing training. Whether it has been established or not, they
                        will get involved in the process.

                        Developing a training system concept is the first stage of
                        planning.


What is a training      A training system concept is the initial, broad definition of:
system concept?
                           Why the system is being developed or revised.
                           What type of training is involved?
                           When the system needs to be implemented to meet users'
                           requirements.
                           Where the system will be implemented – resident, field unit, or
                           others.
                           Where the system and process will be managed.
                           Who will be responsible?

                        The concept is the first "fuzzy" picture of the training system.


Why do you need a       A training system concept serves as the basis for overall system
concept?                planning. Although the concept may change later, right now it
                        gives you the needed focus and direction for all further activities.


Who is                  As an instructional developer or member of a design team, you
responsible?            normally do not develop training system concepts. This
                        responsibility usually falls on the manager of the system.
                        However, you may be called upon to provide input.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9       1 November 2002                                        56



How is a concept      Concept planning does not require a long, laborious process or a
developed?            great deal of documentation. Focus on getting the training
                      system concept down on paper so you have a basis for future
                      planning. Don't be bogged down by the process or the
                      documentation. The concept is what's important.

                      The best way to develop a concept is to select an appropriate
                      team and have a "brainstorm" session. If you can't assemble a
                      team, do it yourself. Put your ideas on paper or a marker board.
                      Keep refining them until you have a concept for the system.

                      To formulate a concept, try to answer questions you or your team
                      members may have about the system. Some example questions
                      are listed.

                      Areas of Concern                  Example Questions
                      System                   What is the purpose of the system?
                                               Why is the system changing?
                                               What is the nature of the change?
                      Target Audience          Who will receive the training?

                                               What is the most appropriate delivery
                                               method?
                                               Are the identified training needs
                                               current?
                                               Where will the training be conducted?
                      Resources                What is the possible resource impact?
                                               What are the possible resource
                                               constraints?
                                               If there are constraints, what are the
                                               possible alternatives?
                      Responsibilities         Who has management responsibilities?
                                               Who has support responsibilities?

                                Develop Strategies

Introduction          Once you have established the training system concept, it is time
                      to develop the strategies or plans to support implementation of
                      the concept. Be aware that the strategies you develop now will
                      more than likely be revised in each successive phase of the ISD
                      process.


What are              Strategies identify and document:
strategies?
                         What must be done and the resources required to do it.
                         Why it needs to be done.
                         Who is responsible for doing it?
                         How it is going to be done.
                         When it needs to be completed.


Why have              Strategies or plans should:
strategies?
                         Provide the "roadmap" for training system development and
                         process management.
                         Establish the system and process milestones.
                         Ensure development of effective and cost-efficient training
                         systems.


Scope of strategies   The scope of the strategies should cover:

                         Management strategies, which include both system and
                         process management.
                         Evaluation strategies, which include formative, summative,
                         and operational evaluations.


Who is                The responsibility for developing strategies falls on the managers
responsible?          of the system. However, various organizations may provide input
                      to the manager. Examples of inputs that may come from other
                      organizations are listed below.

Considerations        Each ISD project requires different strategies. You may consider
                      the following areas:

                         Training system management.
                             How the system will be managed.

Updating strategies   As you progress through the various phases of ISD, you need to
                      constantly update the strategies to reflect current planning and
                      project status.

                              Develop ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction          Whether you call it evaluation or quality improvement, it's
                      important. As a manager, one of your top priorities is to develop
                      a plan to evaluate the training system during analysis, design,
                      development and implementation. Evaluation ensures that a total
                      quality system is developed. The evaluation plan may be a
                      subset of the plan or a separate plan.


Quality concerns      Quality is your first and last concern when making plans to
                      develop a new training system or revise an existing system. The
                      concern for quality continues throughout each phase of the
                      process.

                      Evaluating or assessing the quality of the process and products
                      of each phase of instructional development is the foundation of
                      ISD, and it ensures customer satisfaction.


Why have a plan?      An ISD evaluation plan is necessary to establish what and how
                      you are to evaluate during the training development process.
                      The plan, which is the metric for quality, ensures that the ISD
                      process results in a total quality system.


Who is                Managers are responsible for developing a comprehensive ISD
responsible?          evaluation plan including formative, summative, and operational
                      evaluations. Some organizations may have an evaluation office
                      to prepare this plan. However, everyone is responsible for
                      quality.


What is in the        The ISD evaluation plan is to include information sufficient to
plan?                 ensure that the ISD process results in total quality in both process
                      and products. The plan may include, but is not limited to, the
                      following information:
                          Identification of responsibilities including tasking.
                          Scope and purpose of the evaluation.
                          How and when the evaluation activities are to be
                          accomplished.
                          Documentation and report requirements.

                        Identify Resource Requirements

Introduction          The most critical element in ISD is resources. Throughout the
                      entire ISD process, resources will always be your major concern.
                      Regardless of your role in the training system, you have a
                      resource responsibility. In the planning stages of ISD, your
                      responsibility is to identify the resource requirements to design,
                      develop, implement, and continue to maintain a training system.


What is a             "Resource" in this handbook refers to:
resource?
                         Equipment – training, support, spare
                         Facilities – classrooms, laboratory, range
                         Human Resources – instructional developers, instructors,
                         students
                         Money – equipment, facilities, and personnel cost
                         Time – development time, course time


Who has the initial   Although each individual in the training system has a resource
responsibility?       responsibility, managers have the initial responsibility, during the
                      planning stage of the ISD project, to identify the types and
                      amounts of resources required to support the system.

                      Consider the following questions when you are identifying
                      resources.

                                 Sample Questions for Identifying Resources
                      System
                        What are the system requirements?
                        Is it a new system or a revision to an existing system?
                        What is the training need?
                        Has management specified a particular delivery method?
                        What are the system and process strategies?

                        activities?
                        How many students per year will need to be trained?
                        Are there any personnel constraints? If so, what are they?
                      Funds
                         How much will it cost to design, develop and implement the course?
                         How much will it cost to support, operate, and maintain the course?
                         Are there any funding constraints? If so, what are they?
                      Time
                         Are the identified training needs current?
                         How long will it take to design and develop the course?
                         How long will the course be?
                         Are there any time constraints? If so, what are they?


Revising initial      At this point, you may not be able to answer all of those
requirements          questions. However, later in the training development process,
                      you will be able to define the resource requirements more clearly.


Sources of            The results of your initial planning will be valuable sources of
identifying           information when you identify resource requirements. Other
resources             sources are:

                         SMEs
                         System specifications
                         Technical data
                         Missions/system requirements
                         Directives
                         Existing systems

Availability of        Resource availability is critical to effective and cost-efficient
resources              training development. You cannot do a good job unless you have
                       the necessary resources at the right time.

                       Early identification of resources helps ensure that resources are
                       available when needed.
                       For example, some training may require:

                          More than two years for long-lead equipment.
                          One year for an instructional developer or instructor.
                          Three years for a Military Construction Project (MCP).
                          Four to five years for the budget process.


How do you deal        You will probably always be working under some kind of
with constraints?      constraint. You will seldom have all the resources you need or
                       would like to have.

Introduction          Before entering the actual ISD process, make sure adequate
                      planning and preparation have been accomplished. The previous
                      chapter discussed all the tasks that need to be performed in order
                      to get ready for the ISD process. The nature and scope of each
                      ISD project will be determined by the assessed training deficiency
                      or training requirement established by the user. This chapter
                      discusses various activities that are performed during the

                                 Section A
                      Conduct Occupational/Job Analysis

Introduction          Before you begin the analysis phase of ISD, make sure you have
                      identified a problem that can be solved with training. Training can
                      solve only performance problems caused by a performer's lack of
                      skill, knowledge, and ability to perform a task. If training cannot
                      solve the identified performance problem, do not enter the ISD
                      process.

                      This section explains the first activity, occupational/job analysis,
                      in the analysis phase.


What it is            An occupational or job analysis identifies the jobs that define
                      an occupational entity and then identifies duties and tasks that
                      comprise each job. It starts by breaking a job into various duties
                      that are the major segments or divisions of the job. The duties
                      are further broken into tasks that make up each duty. Figure 10
                      illustrates the breakdown of a job into duties and tasks.

                                             Systems                        Fuel Systems

Why                   An occupational/job analysis allows instructional developers to
occupational/job      break a job down to a list or inventory of tasks, which will be
analysis?             further analyzed in the subsequent task analysis.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                       69



Who is              The USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron (OMSq) has
responsible?        the responsibility for periodically collecting and analyzing data
                    from each occupation or job in the Air Force. The results of the
                    job analyses are reported in Occupational Survey Reports
                    (OSRs) that are distributed throughout the Air Force. If there is a
                    need for a survey before the scheduled time, the Air Force
                    functional manager or AETC training manager for that Air Force
                    Specialty Code (AFSC) can request an OSR.

                    As an instructional developer or member of a design team, you
                    normally are not responsible for occupational/job analysis.
                    However, you may be asked to complete a job inventory or serve
                    as a subject matter expert (SME) for your AFSC during the
                    analysis. As a manager or developer, you will be using the OSR
                    and training extract developed by OMSq to determine what tasks
                    require training.


Sources of job      Data for job analysis can be gathered from many sources, such
analysis data       as:

                       Existing OSRs
                       Job inventories
                       SMEs
                       Technical Orders
                       AF publications such as regulations and manuals
                       System specifications/requirements
                       MAJCOM inputs
                       System Program Office (SPO) inputs
                       Contractor data

                    As you can see, there is a wide variety of data sources. Other
                    data sources may be available depending on the occupation or
                    job being analyzed.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9       1 November 2002                                         70



How to conduct a      Since it is unlikely that you will conduct an occupational or job
job analysis          analysis, the process will only be outlined. The basic tasks are:

                         Develop an inventory of tasks that make up the job. To
                         develop an inventory, you should:
                            Review documentation from similar jobs.
                            Use existing training standards for the Air Force Specialty
                            (AFS).
                            Use SMEs to provide detail job information.
                            Observe jobs being performed.

                         Validate the task inventory by using questionnaires to collect
                         data from the field.

                         Analyze the data from the questionnaires and prioritize the
                         tasks. Tasks are normally prioritized based on:
                             Percent of the members who perform each task.
                             Learning difficulty of each task.
                             Training emphasis of each task.

                         Recommend the appropriate method of training for each task
                         such as classroom, on-the-job training (OJT).

                         Document survey results in an OSR and training extract.
                         Information in an OSR may include:
                              Complete listing of all job tasks.
                              Percent of members performing each task. This
                              information is also listed by MAJCOM, skill level, grade,
                              and member's time in the career field.
                              Learning difficulty of each task.
                              Training emphasis rating of each task.
                              Recommended method of training.


Occupational          The TTMS will import OSR task factors as well as task analysis
measurement           data. Having this data in an automated system assists in
squadron to TTMS      analyzing the tasks by providing a means to sort and associate
interface             various tasks according to their task factors. This analysis will
                      allow you to quickly determine which tasks should be trained in
                      the classroom or by OJT.

information      requiring personnel in various specialized areas such as

                               Section B
                          Conduct Task Analysis

Introduction      Now that an occupational/job analysis has been conducted and
                  the tasks that make up the job have been identified, you are
                  ready to start the next stage of analysis, analyzing the tasks.
                  Since every job in the Air Force is made up of numerous duties
                  and each duty is made up of many tasks, it is unlikely that you
                  could ever identify and analyze each task that personnel might
                  perform within a given AFS. However, as a training developer,
                  you will need to be an expert at task analysis since failure to do a
                  good task analysis will likely result in an ineffective training
                  system.


What it is        A task is normally an observable and measurable unit of work
                  activity or operation that forms a significant part of a job. It
                  constitutes a logical and necessary step in performance, and has
                  a logical beginning and end. It may also be defined as a series of
                  actions leading to a terminal outcome such as "maintain an F-16
                  fuel system" or "operate a P-19 fire truck."

                  Task analysis is the process of breaking a task down and
                  identifying:

                     Component steps of a task.
                     Sequence of those steps.
                     Conditions or limits under which the task will be performed
                     such as what tools, equipment, materials or information will be
                     needed to perform the task.
                     Standard of performance that must be achieved.


Purpose           During task analysis, each task is analyzed to determine
                  performance requirements such as which tasks must be
                  performed, the conditions under which they are performed, and
                  the performance standard that must be achieved. This
                  information, which becomes the task statement, is used to

Data collection       As an instructional developer, your first step in task analysis will
                      be to collect the necessary data for analysis. As you begin to
                      collect the data, you will find there are many sources that you can
                      collect data from.


Data sources          Some of the data sources are:

                         OSR
                         Technical Orders (TOs)
                         Job Aids
                         Checklist
                         Training Documentation
                         AF Regulations and Manuals
                         Standard Operating Procedures

Identifying tasks      After you have identified the duties and written the duty
                       statements, you are ready to identify the tasks involved in each
                       duty. When identifying the tasks:

                          Use all of the available data sources.
                          Don't hesitate to assume that some tasks are required, even if
                          they are not identified in the data that you have collected.


Task criteria          Understanding the criteria for the task will help identify tasks
                       during the analysis phase of ISD. Task criteria are listed on the
                       following page.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                          75




Task criteria                                    Task Criteria
(Continued)
                         A task is a group of related physical or mental activities
                         directed toward a goal.
                         A task has a definite beginning and end.
                         A task involves people interacting with equipment, media, and
                         other items.
                         A task may be directly or indirectly observable.
                         A task is measurable.
                         A task is an independent part of a duty.
                         A task, when performed, results in a meaningful product or
                         process.
                         Tasks include activities such as physical, decision making,
                         problem solving, knowledge, attitudes and perceptions that
                         are required of individuals.
                         A task may be any size or degree of complexity.


Guidelines for task   Identifying tasks is a repeating process based on human activities
statements            that meet the above criteria. Each time it is repeated, the results
                      of the process are made more complete or accurate. Continually
                      repeating the process refines the list of tasks. The process
                      should be continued until the list covers every task making up the
                      duty.

                      After you have identified the tasks that make up the job, the next
                      step is to develop a list of task statements. You should follow
                      specific guidelines and standards to ensure that you develop
                      quality task statements. The guidelines are provided below.

                          Guidelines for Developing a List of Task Statements
                        Step 1    Arrange major duty responsibilities in order of
                                  typical performance.
                                  Indicate which ones are performed in a fixed order
                                  and which ones have no particular order.
                        Step 2    Translate duty responsibilities (or human functions)
                                  into a list of task statements, composed of an action
                                  verb and an object.
                        Step 3    Edit the list according to the standards that are
                                  provided on the following page.

Identifying      After you have identified the tasks that make up the duties of a
subtasks         job, it is time to identify the subtasks. Subtasks are work
                 activities that, when combined, make up a task. It should be
                 noted that not all tasks are made up of subtasks. There are
                 several reasons for identifying subtasks.

                    For some task statements to be useful in training
                    development, the developers must identify the subtasks so
                    they will know the steps that are involved in performing the
                    task.
                    Complex tasks can be analyzed more easily if they are broken
                    into subtasks.
                    Breaking a task into subtasks often helps the instructional
                    developer sequence the training.

                                   Guidelines for Identifying Subtasks
                      Step 1      Examine each task statement. See if it contains
                                  more than one group of activities that must be
                                  performed sequentially or independently.
                      Step 2      Review the complete list of subtasks for each task.
                                  Make sure that no subtask overlaps, and that
                                  together they account for all performance required
                                  in the task.

Sequentially and      As you identify the subtasks, you should be aware that some
independently         subtasks must be performed sequentially while other subtasks
performed             can be performed independently. An example is provided below.

Validated task        Now that you have analyzed the data and determined the duties
information           contained within the job, the tasks that make up each duty, and
                      the subtasks involved in each task, your next step is to verify the
                      information. For each ISD effort, the data collected and the
                      results of the data analysis need to be verified. There are several
                      techniques you can use for verifying and deriving task lists.
                      Examples are provided in the following table.

Selecting tasks for   After you have verified the data, it is time to select the task to be
training              taught in the course. OSR data and the training extract provide
                      information that helps you determine which task should be taught.
                      However, if you are not using OSR data or a training extract,
                      consider the following issues when selecting the tasks to be
                      taught in the course.

                         Can most job incumbents perform the task without training?
                         How often is the task performed on the job?
                         Will job degradation occur if the task is not taught?
                         Is the task critical to the job or the mission?
                         Is it economical to teach the task?
                         Is there enough time to teach the task adequately?
                         If students are trained to do another task, will they be able to
                         transfer what they have learned to perform this task without
                         additional training?
                         Will geographical, procedural, and environmental conditions
                         make it unreasonable to train everyone to perform the task?
                         How many people perform the task? What is the percentage
                         performing the task?
                         Is the task difficult to learn?
                         If students are trained to perform the task, will they remember
                         how to perform the task when they get to the job?


Document task         You may use a variety of formats to document task analysis
analysis results      results. A simple way is to use a Task Analysis Worksheet like
                      the one shown on the next page. Regardless of the format that
                      you choose, document only the necessary identification, training,
                      and support information. The key is to provide adequate
                      information in order to develop the objectives in the next phase of
                      the ISD process.

Developing training   Once the tasks to be taught in the course have been selected
standards             and documented, the training standard for the course should be
                      developed. There are several different formats for standards
                      depending on the type of course you are developing. Following
                      are examples of a course training standard and a specialty
                      training standard. For additional information on developing
                      standards, see AFR 8-13.

                               Conduct Learning Analysis

Introduction           Now that the tasks to be trained have been determined, you may
                       feel you are ready to start designing training. However, before
                       starting you need to conduct a learning analysis. Conducting a
                       learning analysis will aid you immeasurably when designing
                       training. Results of the learning analysis enable you to design
                       training based on desired learning outcomes.


What it is             Learning analysis is the process of analyzing the tasks to be
                       taught to establish learning outcomes in terms of types of
                       learning involved and level of learning desired.


Purpose                Learning analysis serves several purposes in the training
                       development process. It translates tasks into learning outcomes,
                       identifies prerequisite learning requirements, establishes the
                       requirement for entry behavior, and builds a learning hierarchy.
                       Learning analysis sets the stage for designing the training.


When to conduct        Learning analysis should be done immediately after the task
learning analysis      analysis has been completed and before designing the
                       instructional system. However, this analysis may also be
                       conducted while the objectives are being developed.


Who conducts           Instructional developers or the design team are responsible for
learning analysis?     conducting the necessary learning analysis. However, managers
                       have the overall responsibility of ensuring that a learning analysis
                       is performed, as necessary.


Learning analysis      When you conduct a learning analysis, you should:
steps
                          Identify the skills and knowledge needed to support
                          performance.
                          Build a learning hierarchy of knowledge and skills to be taught.
                          Identify the types of learning involved.
                          Determine the level of learning needed.
                          Identify prerequisite knowledge and skills required.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 9       1 November 2002                                              87



Learning analysis      Learning analysis allows you to determine the best way to
procedures             structure the training to ensure that it is effective and cost-
                       efficient. The two steps in the learning analysis procedure are:

                          Step 1 – Categorize tasks
                          Step 2 – Identify prerequisite requirements


Step 1 – Categorize    The first step in learning analysis is to categorize tasks according
tasks                  to types of learning outcomes. Learning theorists have
                       categorized human activity into types of learned behavior.
                       Gagné's (1985) categories of learning types are the most
                       inclusive. They include intellectual skills, verbal information,
                       cognitive strategies, motor skills, and attitudes. Gagné suggests
                       that each type of learning requires different internal conditions for
                       processing to occur. Internal conditions may be cued or
                       prompted by external conditions present in the learning
                       environment.

                       Types of Learning
                          Intellectual Skills. Intellectual skills are the foundation for all
                          higher learning. They consist of discrimination, concepts and
                          rule-using. Cognitive strategies are often called a higher-
                          order type of intellectual skill.

                          Intellectual skills are hierarchical in nature. In order to learn a
                          higher-order skill, the learner should possess the
                          prerequisites. To learn a rule or principle, the learner should
                          understand the component concepts and the relationships
                          among the concepts.
                              Discriminations. Discriminations are skills related to
                              seeing differences between stimuli. Most adult problems
                              in discrimination come from physical disabilities like color
                              blindness, hearing loss, or some injury that affects
                              sensory perception.
                              Concrete Concepts. Concrete concepts are skills related
                              to categorizing physical objects into one or more classes
                              based on their physical attributes. Identifying resistors
                              from among other electrical components is an example of
                              concrete concept learning.
                              Defined Concepts. Defined concepts are skills related to
                              classifying symbolic objects into one or more classes
                              based on a definition. The definition is actually a rule for
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                        88



Step 1 – Categorize         classification. For example, classifying a verbal statement
tasks (Continued)           from an officer as a command is an example of a learned
                            defined concept.
                            Rule Learning. Rule learning skills relate to applying
                            principles or procedures to solve problems. Problem
                            solving is the ability to recall relevant rules and use them
                            to solve a novel problem. The product of problem solving
                            is not only a solution to the problem, but also learning a
                            new rule or procedure to be used if a similar situation
                            should arise in the future.

                       Verbal Information. Verbal information is the learning of
                       names and labels that can be verbalized. It is also called
                       declarative knowledge. Verbal information learning requires
                       some basic language skills. In addition, verbal information is
                       more readily retained when it is learned within a larger context
                       of meaningful information.

                       Cognitive Strategies. The basic premise of an information-
                       processing model is that individuals mentally process their
                       environment. This process consists of a number of stages in
                       which the stimuli become information, which is given meaning
                       by previous knowledge and current expectations. Cognitive
                       strategies are employed to maintain the knowledge in short-
                       term memory and translate it to a structure that enters long-
                       term memory as a type of knowledge in the form of
                       propositions, productions or schemas.

                       Cognitive strategies are thought of as executive control
                       mechanisms for learning. Monitoring the use of strategies is
                       "metacognition." Cognitive strategies used in metacognition
                       are called metacognitive strategies.

                       There are different types of cognitive strategies such as
                       clustering items into similar groups to reduce memory load,
                       reading strategies to increase comprehension, and others.
                       Good learners have a variety of strategies they can use to
                       process new information.

                       Motor Skills. Motor skills are learned behaviors that involve
                       the smooth coordinated use of muscles. Motor skills most
                       often involve a sequence of activities that may be described
                       verbally as an "executive subroutine." This verbal information


Step 1 – Categorize
AFH 36-2235         Volume 9       1 November 2002                                             89


tasks (Continued)         is learned to provide guidance for learning the execution of
                          the motor skill. When the learner has acquired the motor skill,
                          the verbal routine is no longer needed and the skill is
                          performed in a smooth and continuous manner.

                          Motor skills may be learned by modeling, as when a coach
                          shows a student how to swing a golf club.

                          Motor skills require practice and kinesthetic (natural)
                          feedback. Verbal feedback from an observer also helps the
                          learner make corrections in performance. Much of the
                          instruction is aimed at getting the student to recognize the feel
                          of the motor performance when it is executed correctly.

                          Attitudes and Motivation. The acquiring of particular
                          attitudes may require the prior learning of intellectual skills or
                          particular sets of information. For example, if a positive
                          attitude toward safety is to be acquired, the learner should
                          have (1) intellectual skills (concepts and procedures)
                          associated with safety, and (2) a variety of verbal information
                          about the advantages of following safety procedures or the
                          consequences of not following them.

                          Attitudes have mutually supportive relationships. An
                          individual generally tries to maintain consistency with regard
                          to choice behaviors. However, attitudes are based on
                          perceptions of reality. Misinformation or critical experiences
                          color these perceptions. Attitudes are learned by observing
                          others and viewing the consequences of their behavior. This
                          type of learning (vicarious) is a distinct principle of social
                          learning. External conditions for learning attitudes include a
                          human model.

                       Experiences play a major role in the formulation of attitudes.

                       Motivation plays a significant role in learning. Keller (1987) has
                       developed a general model integrating the various sources of
                       motivation for learning. He calls it the ARCS model, an acronym
                       for the four sets of conditions that should be met to have a
                       motivated learner:
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9         1 November 2002                                          90



Step 1 – Categorize   A for attention.
tasks (Continued)     Attention involves grabbing the learner's interest at the
                      beginning of instruction and maintaining that interest throughout
                      the lesson and course.

                      R for relevance.
                      Relevance is the personal significance and value to the learner
                      of mastering the learning objectives.

                      C for confidence.
                      Confidence relates to the learner's expectancy of success.

                      S for satisfaction.
                      Satisfaction comes from achieving performance goals.


                      Integration of Human Activities. In real life, the types of
                      learning are integrated. This integration is discussed in terms of
                      schemas, enterprise theory and metaskills.

                         Schemas. Intellectual skills should be integrated into existing
                         knowledge to be remembered and recalled. They are thought
                         to be stored as schemas and as part of propositional
                         networks. A schema is an organization of memory elements
                         (propositions, images, and attitudes) representing a large set
                         of meaningful information pertaining to a general concept.
                         The concept may be of an object, such as a jet fighter,
                         weapon, or officer. Or it may be an event, such as a preflight
                         check or preventive maintenance procedure. Regardless of
                         type, schemas contain information on certain well-understood
                         features of the object or event. The learner fills in these
                         features, called slots, when encountering new information that
                         relates to the schema. Schemas are acquired through
                         experience and may be the greatest benefit of
                         apprenticeships.

                         Recent theory proposes that intellectual skills are "situated."
                         That means their utility is in a large part a function of how they
                         are learned. In order that they do not become "inert
                         knowledge," they should be learned and practiced within a
                         broader context.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 9      1 November 2002                                        91



Step 1 – Categorize        Enterprise Theory. Gagné and Merrill (1990) proposed a
tasks (Continued)          method to identify learning goals that requires an integration
                           of multiple objectives. They proposed that such an integration
                           of multiple objectives be conceived in terms of the pursuit of a
                           comprehensive purpose in which the learner is engaged,
                           called enterprise. An enterprise is a purposeful, planned
                           activity that may depend for its execution on some
                           combination of verbal information, intellectual skills, and
                           cognitive strategies, all related by their involvement in the
                           common goal. A task for the instructional developer is to
                           identify the goal of a targeted enterprise along with its
                           component skills, knowledge, and attitudes, and then to
                           design instruction that enables the student to acquire the
                           capability of achieving this integrated outcome.

                           Metaskills. The metaskill concept (Spears, 1983) refers to
                           the complex skills of adapting, monitoring, and correcting the
                           use of individual skills in complex performances that integrate
                           cognitive, perceptual, and motor processes. Proficiency in
                           metaskills depends on the number of individual skills
                           practiced. Plateaus in performance are related to the intervals
                           required for students to put together new sets of metaskills.

                           Processes involved include:
                              Gaining organic knowledge of the effects of actions on
                              overall goals.
                              Organizing knowledge hierarchically to include cause-

               Analyze Resource Requirements/Constraints

Introduction       Resources are critical in every step of training system
                   development, from the initial planning, through training
                   development, to operation and maintenance of a training system.
                   During analysis, you probably will not be able to determine the
                   exact resource requirements. However, you need to identify
                   long-lead-time resource requirements such as training equipment
                   and facilities in order to allow sufficient time to secure the needed
                   resources or to work out alternatives in case of resource
                   constraints.


What are           Training resources are the supplies and support required to
resources?         design, develop, implement, support, operate, and maintain a
                   training system. Resources for a training system are categorized
                   into five major areas:

                      Equipment
                      Facilities
                      Funds
                      Personnel
                      Time


Why analyze        Resource analysis allows you to identify and estimate the
resources?         resources required to design, develop, support, operate, and
                   maintain a training system. Resource analysis identifies:

                      Course development resources.
                      Quantity of resources required such as number of instructors,
                      classrooms, and trainers.
                      When the resources are needed in order to meet the training
                      delivery date.
                      Total cost of resources.
                      Resource limits.


Who is             Many training and support personnel and organizations such as
responsible?       instructional developers, resource management, and support
                   services, are responsible for analyzing and identifying resources.
                   Managers have the overall responsibility to ensure availability of
                   adequate resources.

Before analyzing      Before you begin analyzing resource requirements, keep the
resource              following things in mind.
requirements
                      Equipment

                         Identify major system-peculiar or unique equipment items as
                         early as possible in the ISD process since they normally
                         undergo a cycle of design, development, production, and
                         testing prior to their use in a training system.
                         Failure to identify training, support, and test equipment
                         requirements early may delay training implementation.
                         Do not order or procure equipment until course objectives
                         have been tentatively set to make sure there is a valid
                         requirement for the equipment.
                         When selecting equipment, consider:
                              Suitability or appropriateness.
                              Usability.
                              Reliability.
                              Maintainability.
                              Cost.

                      Facilities

                         Identify facility requirements as early as possible because:
                             Time required to get funds is normally long.
                             Time to build new facilities or modify existing facilities can
                             be considerable.

                      Funding

                         You must prepare or revise a budget and get funds
                         appropriated to allow for:
                             Procurement of equipment.
                             Construction or modification of facilities.

requirements
(Continued)           Budgets are normally submitted and approved long before money
                      is actually spent. Therefore, managers and instructional
                      developers must determine as precisely as possible what
                      resources will be required for the training system.

                      Human Resources

                         Lead-time for additional personnel such as instructional
                         developers, instructors, student allocations, and maintenance
                         support can be lengthy since it involves budget and personnel
                         authorizations.
                         When requesting personnel such as instructional developers
                         and instructors, allow sufficient time to properly train them to
                         do their assigned duties.
                         Identify additional support personnel such as typists and
                         hardware fabricators, if applicable.

                      Time

                         If possible, allow sufficient lead time to:
                              Obtain the necessary equipment.
                              Build new or modify existing facilities.
                              Get personnel authorizations approved and personnel
                              properly trained.
                              Secure the required funding.
                              Design, develop, and implement an effective and cost-
                              efficient training system.

Updating resource   In initial planning and analysis, you identify the resources
requirements        required to support and service the training system. As training
                    development progresses through the design and development
                    phases of ISD, you will need to continually redefine and fine-tune
                    system resource requirements. Updating resource requirements

                          Develop Training Plan

Introduction      From the very beginning of this handbook the importance of
                  planning has been stressed. If you are to have an effective and
                  cost-efficient training system you must continually make and
                  update plans as required. Lack of sufficient planning or the
                  failure to continually update the plans may result in less than
                  adequate training. A part of the planning required in the analysis
                  phase is developing a training plan, which may also be called a
                  training implementation plan, or which may be a subset of
                  another plan. The training plan development process usually
                  starts in the latter stages of the analysis phase, when you have
                  adequate data to start documenting your plan for the training
                  system. Development of the training plan will normally continue
                  through the design phase of ISD and possibly into the
                  development phase before it is finalized.


What it is        A training plan describes the training system in terms of:

                     Purpose
                     Type of training
                     Training design
                     Training content
                     Course parameters
                     Resources required

                  Training plans may include resource and course control
                  documents such as:

                     Personnel documentation
                     Equipment listings
                     Training standards
                     Course charts

                  The training plan should never document, nor should it contain,
                  any information that is not necessary to describe and document
                  the training system.

Purpose of training   A well-developed training plan can serve several purposes
plan                  depending on the nature and scope of the training itself. Some of
                      its purposes are to:

                         Describe and document the training system.
                         Identify resources that are required to operate and support the
                         training system.
                         Serve as the approval document to operate the training
                         system.

                      A training plan may serve other purposes depending upon the
                      need or requirement to describe and document the training
                      system.


Who is                Managers are directly responsible for developing a plan to
responsible?          describe and document the training system. In an effort to
                      develop a training plan, the manager will need inputs from
                      training and support personnel such as instructional developers,
                      instructional staff, resource managers, base environmental
                      coordinator, and others as required.

                               Update ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction           During initial planning, you develop a strategy for evaluating the
                       quality of the process and products of each ISD phase. This
                       strategy or plan becomes the "metric" or standard for evaluating
                       the products generated by each ISD phase. To ensure that the
                       ISD evaluation strategy is effective throughout the life cycle of the
                       project, you need to update it periodically.


Assessing quality      During analysis, you may ask questions such as the following
                       when updating your evaluation strategy.

                          Does the evaluation strategy for the analysis phase assess
                          both process and product quality?
                          Are the quality standards for the analysis process and
                          products adequate and realistic?
                          Can the job analysis process be improved? If so, how?
                          Can the job analysis products be improved or simplified? If
                          so, how?
                          Do the job analysis products provide the necessary
                          information? If not, what additional information is needed?
                          Is there any information in the job analysis products that is not
                          needed and can be deleted from the product?
                          Are other job analysis products needed? If so, what products
                          are needed?
                          Can the task analysis process be improved? If so, how?
                          Can the task analysis products be improved or simplified? If
                          so, how?


Why update             Each ISD project is different in nature and scope, and therefore
evaluation             requires a different evaluation strategy. As you complete the
strategy?              analysis phase, you may want to update the evaluation strategy
                       to reflect the results of your evaluation efforts during analysis.
                       The updated strategy will ensure a current and accurate ISD
                       evaluation strategy for the subsequent design process and
                       products of that phase.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                      102



Who is                Everyone involved in training development is responsible for the
responsible?          quality of the ISD process and products. Various individuals
                      including instructional developers may be involved in developing
                      or updating the ISD evaluation strategy. Managers have the
                      overall responsibility for the evaluation strategy.


What should you       It is essential that you keep the ISD evaluation strategy updated.
do?                   Items to be updated may include:

                         Analysis products such as task analysis worksheets or OSRs
                         Quality standards for evaluation
                         Evaluation procedures
                         Evaluation schedules
                         Products to be evaluated

                      After you have revised the above items, you need to:

                         Document the evaluation results of the analysis phase.
                         Provide rationale for changes made to the ISD evaluation
                         strategy.
                         Document lessons learned in evaluating the analysis process
                         and products.


Tracing the quality   Quality of the analysis process and products is very important to
process               the training development process. Document the evaluation of
                      the analysis phase to ensure that the quality process can be
                      traced throughout the entire ISD process. Document only as
                      needed. Do not document just to fill a case file.

                               Section G
                      Update Management Strategies

Introduction       Management strategies are developed early in the initial planning
                   stages to serve as a "roadmap" for managing the training
                   development process and the training system. In the analysis
                   phase, you may want to update those strategies as more and
                   better information becomes available concerning management
                   issues.


Importance of      The management strategies developed during the initial stages of
management         planning allow you to enter the analysis phase with a "plan."
strategies         Without such a guide, development could be slow and
                   haphazard. Management strategies:

                      Serve as "tools" to manage the process and the system.
                      Establish process and system milestones to ensure that
                      training is delivered to the user on time.
                      Ensure development of an effective and cost-efficient training
                      system.


Why update         It is necessary to update the management strategies to reflect
management         any changes resulting from the analysis phase of ISD. For
strategies?        example, it took six weeks longer than expected to complete the
                   task analysis. If you do not update the management strategies
                   with this new information, all subsequent milestones in the
                   analysis phase and the remaining phases of the ISD process will
                   be off by six weeks. It is important for you to update the
                   management strategies after each phase of the ISD process or
                   when any significant change occurs.


Who is             Managers are responsible for ensuring that the management
responsible?       strategies are updated with the most current information at the
                   end of each ISD phase or after a significant change has occurred.

What should you      When updating management strategies at the end of the analysis
update?              phase, include the latest information such as:

                        Changes to the overall strategy for managing the training
                        system or process
                        New or revised milestones
                        Refinements to project definition

Introduction          During the design phase, you, as the instructional developer or
                      member of the design team, built the framework for the training
                      by developing objectives and designing the instruction. What you
                      do here plays a key role in determining the effectiveness and
                      cost-efficiency of the training you will develop in the next phase of
                      the ISD process. Also in this phase, as well as throughout the
                      entire ISD process, you will be concerned with the quality of the
                      process and products.

                               Develop Objectives

Introduction         One product of the analysis phase was a list of tasks that require
                     training. In the design phase, you use this task list and the task
                     analysis to develop objectives for the course. Objectives should
                     be stated in terms of what the students must be able to do at the
                     end of training.


What it is           An objective is a precise statement of the learned capability,
                     skills, knowledge or attitudes (SKA), a student is expected to
                     demonstrate, the condition under which the SKA is to be
                     exhibited, and the standard of acceptable performance upon
                     completion of training.

                           Characteristics of Objectives

Introduction       Before starting to develop objectives, you should become
                   thoroughly familiar with each part of an objective. Familiarity with
                   the different parts will enable you to develop better objectives,
                   and thus, better training. Objectives should be worded carefully
                   so that all readers or listeners have the same understanding.

                                       Condition

Introduction         A thorough understanding of the conditions will help you
                     develop more effective objectives. Whenever possible, the
                     condition specified in an objective should be the same as the
                     actual conditions under which the job is performed. For example,
                     if a particular piece of test equipment or a specific technical order
                     is required to perform a task, it should be identified as a condition
                     in the objective.


What it is           A condition identifies the situation under which a student is
                     expected to demonstrate a behavior. A properly prepared
                     objective clearly states the limits or conditions of student
                     performance. A condition may specify:

                        If the student can use technical orders.
                        If the student is allowed to use a checklist.
                        The tools/test equipment a student is allowed to use.
                        If students can use notes they have taken during instruction.


Things to consider   When determining the conditions for the objectives, consider that:

                     Conditions should specify the objects, events, human behavior,
                     words, or symbols that will be presented to the students.
                     Conditions under which the training is performed should be the
                     same as the actual job conditions, if possible.


Examples of          Condition statements can be derived from the task analysis. The
conditions           following are some examples of conditions.

                                Learned Capability (Behavior)

Introduction            The capability part of the objective states what a student will do to
                        demonstrate that he/she learned a specific skill, knowledge or
                        attitude. The capability must be written in measurable,
                        observable terms so that student performance can be objectively
                        evaluated. As an instructional developer, you should learn to
                        write the capability part of an objective so that the tasks to be
                        taught are clearly stated so that everyone – students, instructors,
                        and developers – know exactly what must be learned by the
                        students.


What it is              A capability (behavior) is defined as an SKA that is observable
                        and measurable.


Things to consider      When stating the capability in an objective, use action verbs to
                        reduce ambiguity. Action verbs are observable and measurable
                        while ambiguous verbs are not. The following table provides
                        some examples.

                                        Standard

Introduction         The final part of a well-prepared objective is a clearly stated
                     standard of performance. The student's performance will result in
                     an output; the quantity or quality of which is the standard of
                     performance. When you were gathering information to build the
                     task analysis list, you probably found many of the tasks had
                     standards of performance specified. However, if no standards
                     have been set, you will be required to set standards based on
                     other sources such as experience or similar tasks. You will likely
                     need to "refine" the standards after they have been verified
                     against on-the-job performance.


What it is           A standard defines the criteria for acceptable performance by the
                     student. It is stated in terms such as completeness, accuracy
                     requirements, time constraints, performance rates, and qualitative
                     requirements. It identifies the proficiency the students must
                     achieve when they perform the behavior under the specified
                     conditions. Without a standard, it is impossible to determine
                     when the students have achieved the objective.


Types of standards   Standards can be classified in one of the following types.

                            Type of Standard                       Examples
                     Standard operating procedure      ". . . will comply with AFRs and

                     performance                       nearest tenth."

                      Guidelines for Developing Objectives

Introduction        To this point, background information and the three components
                    of an objective have been discussed. Now, you are ready to
                    develop objectives. The first thing you need in order to develop
                    objectives is the list of tasks (task worksheet) that you developed
                    during task analysis. Using the information on the task list, what
                    you have learned about objectives to this point, and a few
                    guidelines, you will be able to develop effective objectives.


Guidelines for      Several guidelines for developing objectives are provided below.

                                     Use task descriptions developed during the
                    General          analysis phase.
                                     Analyze each task or knowledge item on the task
                                     list to determine the number of objectives that
                                     are required for each item.
                                     Document each objective on a worksheet.
                                     Use learning analysis results to assign skills and
                                     knowledge to support each objective and
                                     subobjective.
                                     Document results on worksheet.
                                     Select conditions that match job conditions as
                    Condition        closely as possible.
                                     Ensure that conditions are realistic.

                                  Hierarchy of Objectives

Introduction           Most tasks are made up of steps and procedures; however, there
                       are also non-procedural tasks. Students need to learn each of
                       these steps or procedures before they can perform a particular
                       task. In other words, you need to specify objectives for those
                       steps or procedures, in addition to the task itself. These different
                       levels of objectives can be structured into an objective map that
                       depicts the relationship of various objectives and their sequence.
                       This map is called objective or learning hierarchy.


Purpose                The purpose of the objective hierarchy is to depict the
                       relationship of objectives so that the most effective and efficient
                       learning sequence can be developed.


Classification of      Objectives can be classified into two categories, as shown below.

               Prioritizing, Clustering, and Sequencing Objectives

Introduction         The effectiveness and cost-efficiency of a course will depend in
                     part on how well you prioritize, cluster, and sequence the
                     objectives. Guidelines for prioritizing, clustering, and sequencing
                     objectives will be provided in this portion of the section. Also,
                     additional information on clustering and sequencing objectives
                     can be found later in this chapter in the section on designing
                     training activities.


Prioritize           Prioritizing objectives may not be required in all training
objectives           development projects. However, as the Air Force's budget
                     continues to shrink, it may be necessary to prioritize the
                     objectives in order to provide the training that is most needed by
                     the MAJCOMs (users).

                     For example, a 25-day course is required to teach a particular set
                     of objectives. However, due to student allocation constraints, you
                     can only develop a course that is 20 days in length. To reduce
                     the course length by five days, it is necessary to determine which
                     objectives are less critical and can be eliminated from the course.


Guideline            Have the user prioritize the line items in the training standard.
                     Then the objective can be prioritized to meet the user's need.


When should you      If you expect that you may not be able to provide the needed
prioritize?          training due to resource constraints, you should request that the
                     user prioritize the training standard line items during meetings
                     such as the Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) or
                     Training Planning Team (TPT). Another way is to have the user
                     prioritize requirements during training standard coordination.


Who is               The users are responsible for determining the priority of their
responsible?         training needs. If they can't reach a consensus, then the AF
                     functional manager for that specialty sets the priority.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 9       1 November 2002                                      121



Clustering         The purpose of clustering or grouping objectives is to develop
objectives         logical and meaningful portions of training such as units, lessons,
                   or segments. When clustering objectives, use the following
                   guidelines.

                      Cluster objectives that are common prerequisites to other
                      objectives. For example, basic electronic skills and
                      knowledge may be required for many tasks in a course;
                      therefore, they may be clustered in the same unit and taught
                      in the core training.
                      Cluster objectives that are related to the same system or
                      engage the same type of action. For example, all tasks
                      related to the maintenance of a particular piece of navigation
                      equipment may be clustered into a unit.
                      Cluster objectives with common skills and knowledge. For
                      example, some maintenance tasks require identical skills and
                      knowledge across different systems, such as computer
                      maintenance or aircraft refueling.
                      Cluster objectives with potential for the same training method
                      or delivery system. For example, you can cluster knowledge
                      objectives utilizing the lecture method while clustering skill
                      objectives taught by demonstration/performance. Also,
                      objectives with the same type of learning may be clustered to
                      facilitate training such as classroom and equipment.


Sequencing of      A curriculum or course requires decisions about the sequencing
objectives         of objectives. The goal of good instructional design is to establish
                   sequences within courses that promote effective learning. The
                   sequence and lessons within a course should be based on the
                   prerequisite relationship among the objectives. The most obvious
                   sequence follows the order from simple to complex or from
                   general to specific. The table below summarizes the major
                   considerations regarding sequential arrangement within a topic
                   for each type of learning outcome.

                                      Develop Tests

Introduction            After you have specified the objectives for the course, the next
                        task is to develop tests to assess the student's attainment of the
                        objectives. To ensure that tests adequately measure the
                        objectives, the performance required in the test should match the
                        performance required in the objective. You should develop tests
                        immediately after the objectives have been written.


Purpose                 The primary purpose of testing is to assess the student's
                        attainment of the behavior specified in the objective. Tests can
                        also serve several other purposes such as:

                           Identify and correct problems or weaknesses in the training.
                           Indicate whether a class is performing up to standards on
                           specific objectives.
                           Indicate instructor proficiency.


Criterion               The Air Force measurement program is based on the concept of
referenced testing      criterion-referenced testing (CRT). (In some training
                        communities, the term "sampling testing" is used instead of
                        "criterion testing.") Sampling tests measure knowledge
                        objectives and knowledge components of performance objectives
                        in sufficient quantity to provide an acceptable degree of
                        confidence that the students have attained the required
                        knowledge. The students must successfully achieve a minimum
                        overall passing score. Individual students are measured against
                        the standards specified in the objectives. To attain an objective,
                        the student must meet or exceed the standard specified in the
                        objective. The criterion test is basically a pass/fail type of test.

Types of tests      The basic types of tests used in the Air Force are described
                    below.

                                           Used after the instructional system
                                           becomes operational to determine how
                                           much instruction individual students need.

                        measure what is intended each time they are administered. The
                        characteristics are shown in the following table.

Assessment              Most Air Force tests can be classified into two main groups:
method                  predictive and performance tests. A common question is: When
                        should designers use performance tests and when should they
                        use paper-pencil tests? These are the wrong categories for
                        comparison. The comparison should really be between
                        performance tests and predictive tests.


Performance test        A performance test is one in which the student actually performs
                        the skill required by the terminal objective. If the objective of the
                        lesson is to recall information, then a test where the student has
                        to recall the information by writing it on a piece of paper is a
                        performance test. Many concept and rule-using type perfor-
                        mances are tested with paper-and-pencil tests. For instance,
                        many problem-solving skills involving the use of scientific
                        principles can be observed from written performance tests.

Performance test      Many types of tasks, especially equipment operation tasks,
(Continued)           involve many different capabilities that have to be performed in
                      an integrated manner. For example, the task of bleeding a
                      hydraulic brake system involves recall of a procedure (information
                      learning), physical performance of the steps (motor performance),
                      recognition of the parts and tools (concepts), observation of the
                      brake fluid conditions in the system (rule using), and attitudes
                      (cleanliness and safety). In these types of tasks, performance
                      cannot be measured by a paper-and-pencil test. A performance
                      test would require a real or operational mock-up of a brake
                      system. Because performance tests require the student to
                      demonstrate mastery of the task previously learned, they are said
                      to have content validity. The most content-valid test of any kind
                      of learning is a performance test.


Predictive test       Performance tests of integrated tasks are generally time-
                      consuming because they often have to be conducted one-on-one
                      with real equipment or simulators. If the actual behavior cannot
                      be tested in a performance test (because it is too costly,
                      dangerous or impractical), the next best option is to test the
                      behaviors that enable performance of the desired skill. From that
                      information make a prediction as to whether the student would be
                      able to perform the task. For example, if a student could write the
                      steps for bleeding a brake system, there is a better probability
                      that the student could actually perform the task than someone
                      who didn't know the steps. Tests that do not test the actual
                      behavior, but test component or related behaviors, are valid to
                      the extent that they predict student performance on the actual
                      task.


Comparison of         In the past, most predictive tests were written paper-and-pencil
performance and       type tests, because they are easy to produce, administer and
predictive tests      score. The most common types of written test questions are
                      essay, short answer, fill-in-the-blank, labeling, multiple-choice,
                      matching, and true-false. Today's media provide other testing
                      options. Computers provide different types of input systems that
                      can have a high degree of fidelity with real-world tasks. Even a
                      simple input device such as a joystick or a mouse allows for
                      identification by pointing with a cursor. More elaborate devices

predictive tests
(Continued)            How does an instructional designer decide what type of test to
                       construct or what type of item to use? The best type of test is
                       one that gives the decision-maker the best information regarding
                       the student's mastery of the objective. Different types of test
                       items have advantages and disadvantages with regard to good
                       test construction. These advantages and disadvantages have to
                       be considered in terms of validity and reliability of the test.

Test construction      Several key factors should be considered when constructing
factors                tests.

                       What to measure. Analysis of objectives should identify what
                       should be measured. To determine what to measure, list the
                       tasks to be performed or objective statement to be covered by the
                       test. One or more test items may be needed to adequately
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                         128



Test construction     measure each objective. Tests should measure application of
factors (Continued)   principles, knowledge of factual information, ability to perform
                      task, and transfer of knowledge and skills to solve similar
                      problems.

                      Testing level. The level of testing (know, comprehend, etc.)
                      should correlate with the stated level of learning for that portion of
                      the instruction being tested – no higher and no lower.

                      Test length. Adequate coverage of the objective is the major
                      factor in determining the length of test that is required. Longer
                      tests are normally more reliable since they usually cover the
                      material better.

                      Selection and arrangement of test items. Select test items
                      that cover the most essential and significant portions of the
                      material. Test items selected should be clear, concise and well
                      written to minimize misunderstandings. Items of the same type
                      should be grouped together in a test, if possible. Individual test
                      items should also be arranged in approximate order of difficulty,
                      which allows the students to progress as far as they can without
                      spending excessive time on difficult items at the first part of the
                      test.

                                       Steps To Develop Written Tests
                      Step 1        Determine the test format and the number of items
                                    per objective.
                      Step 2        Generate test items.
                      Step 3        Arrange test items (logical, simple-to-complex, and
                                    procedural).
                      Step 4        Write directions for the test administration.
                      Step 5        Review the test for accuracy and completeness.
                      Step 6        Publish the test in adequate copies.

Multiple Choice      Multiple choice tests are probably the most used type of written
                     tests. They test recall, problem-solving skills, application of facts
                     and principles, and understanding. A multiple choice item
                     consists of a stem (a question or uncompleted statement), a
                     correct response, and distractors (incorrect responses).

                     Example

                     Directions: Carefully read the questions or statements below and
                     circle the correct response. There is only one correct response.

                     1. Hydraulic systems using mineral base fluids are flushed and
                     cleaned with:

                         a.    Alcohol
                         b.    Kerosene
                         c.    Soap solution
                         d.    Carbon tetrachloride


                     Construction Guidelines
                       Do not use the articles "a" and "an" at the end of the stem; this
                       tends to indicate the correct answer.
                       All responses should follow grammatically from the stem.
                       All responses should be of approximately the same length.
                       All responses should have a similar grammatical structure.
                       All responses should use similar terminology.
                       Provide as many responses as necessary but normally four.
                       Position the correct response randomly throughout the test.
                       Limit the use of responses such as "none of the above" or "all
                       of the above."
                       Ensure that there is only one correct answer.
                       Distractors should be plausible but incorrect.
                       Responses should be arranged in order so they increase or
                       decrease in length.

Multiple/Multiple      These are sometimes referred to as "K-type" questions.
Choice                 Multiple/multiple choice questions are used when there are
                       multiple correct responses possible. A broad scope of
                       information can be covered within a single question, thus
                       increasing the complexity and difficulty of the question.

                       Example

                       Directions:    For question 8, SELECT:

                               a.     if only 1, 2, and 3 are correct.
                               b.     if only 1 and 3 are correct.
                               c.     if only 2 and 4 are correct.
                               d.     if only 4 is correct.
                               e.     if all four are correct.

                       8. Which of the following possess(es) a clearly established
                       relationship as a risk factor for coronary artery disease?

                          1.   High stress
                          2.   Tobacco use
                          3.   Alcohol use
                          4.   Hypertension


                       Construction Guidelines
                         Group all of the questions of this type together on a test so
                         directions can be given once for several questions.
                         Provide clear directions on the choosing of the correct answer.
                         Use singular/plural verbs in stem to prevent grammatical cues
                         to the correct response.
                         Use direct questions that end with question marks.
                         Use four responses.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 9       1 November 2002                                        131



True/False       A true/false test should be used sparingly since the chance of
                 random guessing is high. True/false tests may be used when you
                 want a student to identify a completely true or completely false
                 statement.

                 Example

                 Directions: Carefully read the question below and circle true or
                 false to indicate the correct response.

                 True False 1. When cleaning solvents are being used, it is
                 extremely important to provide adequate ventilation.

                 True False 2. A good mechanical connection helps ensure a
                 good electrical connection.


                 Construction Guidelines
                   Include only one idea in each statement.
                   Place the crucial element at or near the end of the statement.
                   Avoid using negatives such as "no" or "not." They tend to
                   confuse students.
                   Do not use absolutes such as "all," "every," "none," and
                   "never."
                   Do not use statements containing "some," "any," and
                   "generally."


Matching         A matching test is used to measure a student's ability to identify
                 and discriminate among related or similar items. Matching items
                 normally use two columns of related items, and students are
                 required to match a series of items listed in one column with
                 related items in the other column. It provides a way to test

(Continued)        Provide clear, concise directions on how to match the items in
                   the two columns.
                   Indicate whether the responses may be used more than once.
                   Limit test items to a single area and choices to a single subject
                   category.
                   Arrange the responses in the same logical order.


Completion       A completion test item requires the students to recall and supply
                 one or more key words that have been omitted from the
                 statement. When placed in the appropriate blanks, the word(s)
                 make the statement complete, meaningful, and true. An example
                 is given below.

                 Example

                 Directions: Complete the sentences below by adding the correct
                 word(s) in the blank spaces provided.

                 1. Good ____________ connections help to ensure a good
                 ____________ connection.

                 2. A test item consisting of a sentence or statement from which
                 a word or phrase is omitted is called _______________.


                 Construction Guidelines
                   Leave blanks for key words only.
                   Keep items brief.
                   Make all blanks approximately the same size.
                   Grammatical cues to the correct answer, such as the articles
                   "a" and "an" just before the blank, should be avoided.
                   Ensure that only one correct answer is possible for each
                   blank.

Labeling         Labeling or identification tests are used to measure a student's
                 ability to recall and label parts in pictures, schematics, diagrams,
                 or drawings. This form of testing is most often used to measure
                 recognition of equipment components or other concrete objects.

                 Example:

                 Directions: Identify the numbered items of a CPU-26 computer.

Labeling         Construction Guidelines
(Continued)        Make all sketches, drawings or illustrations clear and of
                   sufficient size. If possible, use the actual parts of a unit.
                   Provide sufficient information to indicate what the equipment is
                   and which part is to be labeled.
                   The parts to be labeled or identified should be clearly pointed
                   out by using lines or arrows.
                   Ensure that only one definite answer is possible.


Essay            An essay test, which is not normally used in technical training,
                 requires a more or less extensive discussion by the student. It
                 should be used only when the students are expected to think
                 reflectively or creatively, to organize knowledge in the solution of
                 a problem, and to express their solution in writing.

                 Example

                 Directions: Complete the essay question in 500 words or less.
                 Use only one side of the paper to write your response.

                 Test Item: Describe how the ISD process applies to development
                 of technical training.


                 Construction Guidelines
                   State the essay item clearly so the student knows exactly what
                   type of discussion is expected.
                   The essay item should ask for comparisons, decisions,
                   solutions, cause-effect relationships, explanations or
                   summary.
                   When possible, use more essay items and limit the discussion
                   on each.
                   Set limits on essay questions such as time or number of
                   words.

                                      Steps to Develop Performance Tests
                         Step 1       List steps/activities/behaviors (process) or
                                      characteristics (product).
                         Step 2       Note common errors that are made when using the
                                      checklist.
                         Step 3       Arrange the activities or steps and characteristics in
                                      correct order.
                         Step 4       Review the checklist for accuracy and
                                      completeness.
                         Step 5       Publish the checklist in adequate quantities.


Constructing           Performance tests, which require the student to perform a task,
performance            usually have the format of a checklist. The checklist is developed
test/checklist         to correspond to the steps or activities of the task being
                       performed. During the performance test, an evaluator observes
                       the student performing a series of steps or activities while rating
                       the steps on a checklist (process evaluation). An evaluator may
                       also rate the end product of a performance on a checklist
                       (product evaluation).


Performance test       When a performance test requires the steps or activities to be
using a process        rated, a process checklist is used. The process checklist should
checklist              contain all of the essential steps or activities required for
                       successful performance.

                       Example
                                          PROCESS CHECKLIST:
                                   INSTALL RESISTOR ON CIRCUIT BOARD
                        Check                 Step or Activity             Description of Error

                                  2. Mount the circuit board in the jig.
                                  3. Select the proper resistor.
                                  4. Install resistor on circuit board.
                                  5. Solder resistor leads.

Performance test      Guidelines for Construction and Use
using a process         Use when the performance of steps or activities of a task is to
checklist               be evaluated.
(continued)             The steps or activities must be observable.
                        Define all of the steps or activities of the task being performed.
                        Sequence steps or activities in order of performance.
                        Provide space for "checking" the performance of each step or
                        activity.
                        Provide space for recording and describing errors.

                      When a performance test requires the product of a process or
                      task to be evaluated, you will likely want to use a product
                      checklist. The product checklist should identify criteria or
                      characteristics of product acceptability.

                      Example
                                           PRODUCT CHECKLIST:

                                        Criteria/Characteristics
                                   1. Is the value of the resistor
                                      correct?
                                   2. Is the resistor correctly
                                      mounted on the circuit
                                      board?
                                   3. Is the soldering iron properly
                                      tinned?

                      Guidelines for Construction and Use:
                        Use checklist when the objective requires the student to
                        produce something.
                        Use checklist when the product can be readily evaluated.
                        Use checklist when there are no fixed or set procedures.
                        Identify the characteristics of the product.
                        Provide space on the checklist for product rating.
                        Provide space on the checklist for comments about the
                        product.

Test review and      Review and analysis of tests or measurement devices during the
analysis during      summative evaluation process ensures that they measure what
summative            they are supposed to measure. Normally, data from the first
evaluation           several administrations (classes) of the test will provide sufficient
                     data to complete the summative evaluation process. However, if
                     the development team is not confident that adequate data has
                     been collected, the summative evaluation process can be
                     extended until the necessary data has been collected.

                     During the summative evaluation period, it is suggested that data
                     be collected and analyzed after each administration of the test.
                     Analysis of the data should identify any potential problems with
                     the testing instrument. For example, if a test item is a high-miss
                     (usually 50 percent or more) or students fail to perform the
                     specified task within the prescribed time limit, the item should be
                     analyzed to determine if there is a problem. Analysis may identify
                     a problem with the test item or it could be that the instruction
                     being provided does not adequately cover the objective that the
                     test item is to measure. Regardless of the source of the problem,
                     action should be taken to correct any identified problem to ensure
                     quality of process and products of the summative evaluation
                     process.

                     Once the summative evaluation process has been completed,
                     which includes test validation, the instructional system is then
                     placed into operational status. Once the system is operating
                     under normal conditions, curriculum developers or the
                     instructional staff should periodically review and analyze the
                     composite data resulting from all administrations of the tests
                     since the instructional system became operational or since the
                     last time the test data was analyzed.

                     It is suggested that the frequency of test data analysis be based
                     on the number of times the test is administered (student flow
                     through the course). However, if student flow through a course is
                     low, it is recommended that a composite of the test data results
                     be analyzed at least once each year. It should also be noted that
                     the number of versions of a particular test will impact the
                     frequency of test data analysis since the time between
                     administrations of a particular test version increases with the
                     number of test versions.

(Continued)
                     As with test item analysis during the summative evaluation
                     process, all test items should be analyzed to determine if there
                     are any possible problems or trends with any of the test items.
                     For example:

                        Are there any items on the test that are always low-miss?
                        There are test items such as security and safety that should
                        normally be low-miss items.
                        Are there any items on the test that are always high-miss?
                        Are most students having difficulty completing a particular
                        performance task?

                     Any test item identified as a potential problem should be analyzed
                     and the appropriate corrective action should be taken.

                               Review Existing Materials

Introduction           Developing training materials can be expensive and time-
                       consuming. Therefore, after developing objectives and tests,
                       review existing training materials to determine if materials exist
                       that will support course objectives. If materials are found, it is
                       possible that they will not totally support the objectives. If so,
                       don't hesitate to modify the material to fit your need.


Benefits               Using existing materials saves time, human resources, materials,
                       and money.


Sources of existing    Existing training materials may be obtained from:

                          DoD
                          Other services
                          Other federal agencies
                          Commercial/industrial organizations
                          Colleges and universities


Types of existing      When reviewing existing training materials, you may find them in
materials              one of the following forms:

                          Printed materials (e.g., textbooks, publications, technical
                          orders, job aids)
                          Slides
                          Video
                          Audio cassettes

Modifying existing   Sometimes you may find that existing material is available for use
materials            but it needs modification. When modifying existing materials, you
                     may:

                        Add new materials such as information on the operation of a
                        particular piece of equipment that was not covered in the
                        existing material.
                        Expand existing materials to include more detailed
                        information, diagrams, illustrations and examples.
                        Delete materials that do not support the objective(s).
                        Update material to include the most current information such
                        as revised procedures and data, and to correct inaccuracies.
                        Resequence material to make it compatible with the training
                        design.

Introduction       If you cannot find any existing material that fits your needs,
                   proceed to design your own training. Your design determines the
                   effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the training system. Training
                   design should be determined by what best meets the training
                   needs rather than just using a particular training design that has
                   always been used in your training organization.

                                 Determine Training Strategies

Introduction             After the objectives and related tests have been developed and
                         you know what behavior must be shaped, you should plan and
                         develop the most effective and cost-efficient learning environment
                         using the principles of learning. This process starts by
                         determining the training strategies or plan you intend to use. A
                         training strategy is necessary in order to manage the design of
                         the training activities and the learning process. Selection of the
                         instructional strategy needs to be consistent with the prior
                         learning analysis and objectives hierarchy decisions. It also
                         needs to support the instructional aims and overall instructional
                         concept.


Determining              Training strategies can be determined from the following four
training strategies      issues:

                            Student participation
                            Student feedback
                            Student pacing
                            Training sequence

                         Student Participation
                         Active student participation is essential for learning to take place.
                         Students learn by doing, thinking, and feeling through answering
                         questions, discussing, computing, manipulating, and putting ideas
                         together. The training strategy ensures that students are active
                         in the learning process and can apply or demonstrate what they
                         have learned. Learning is a process in which students gain skills
                         and knowledge, and shape attitudes through their own activities,
                         experiences, and motivations. For each type of learning,
                         consider using the following strategies.

                                         Have each student perform the entire task with
                                         minimum guidance.
                                         Provide drill and practice to reinforce recall.
                         Knowledge       Use examples and non-examples to reinforce
                                         understanding.
                                         Provide opportunity to practice the knowledge in
                                         context.
                                         Use human modeling to shape student attitude.
                         Attitude        Use guided discussions for affective lessons.
                                         Give or withhold rewards.

                         Student Feedback
                         Students participating in the teaching/learning activity will need
                         feedback on how well they are doing. Feedback not only informs
                         the students on how well they are doing, but also serves as a
                         valuable source of motivation. The training strategy should
                         provide each student with feedback, whether it is the results of a
                         written test or instructor comments during the performance of a
                         task. Ask frequent questions and provide feedback to address
                         any possible student misunderstanding about the content.

                            through the training within certain parameters. This form of
                            pacing is very effective in courses using CBT, interactive video
                            and self-study.
                            Group-Paced – Students progress through the training
                            together as a group, at the same rate. This is a very effective
                            pacing method when training large numbers of students.
                            However, it does not allow individuals to deviate from the
                            group rate.
                            Group Lock-Step – The group progresses through the training
                            at a predetermined pace, completing training on schedule.
                            Normally, this is the most costly form of pacing. However, in
                            cases where the group's pace through the training is critical, it
                            is very effective.
                            Combination Pacing – Any of the above-mentioned forms of
                            pacing may be used in combination.

                         Instructional Sequence
                         The following sequence considerations also determine training
                         strategies.

                            Proficiency Advancement – This technique is used to advance
                            students who have prior knowledge, practical experience, or
                            are exceptionally fast learners. Students show their
                            proficiency by passing a criterion test. Students may by-pass
                            the training in which they have passed the criterion test.
                            Multiple Track – A training sequence may be divided into
                            various tracks to allow students to go through training best
                            suited to their abilities and needs. The best track for a student
                            is determined by a pretest.
                            Modular Scheduling – Training is divided into different
                            modules and students are pretested to determine which
                            modules of training they need. Modular scheduling is normally
                            used only when the learning sequence is not critical.

                           Design Training Activities

Introduction      Design of the training activity depends largely on two factors:
                  training sequence and the size of the training unit. Effective and
                  cost-efficient training depends on how well you sequence and
                  size the training.


Reasons for       Properly sequenced training provides:
sequencing
                     Student motivation – Students learn best when they are
                     motivated to do so. In most cases, motivation depends on a
                     proper sense of direction. The early stages of training should
                     provide the sense of direction to the training. Properly
                     sequenced training will provide this direction and will give the
                     students a "mental roadmap" of where they are going and how
                     they are going to get there. If the students have this "mental
                     roadmap" they are less likely to be confused, thus increasing
                     their motivation.
                     Meaningful relationship – A proper sequence can provide the
                     students with a pattern of relationships so that each training
                     activity will have a purpose. If the training is meaningful to the
                     students, they will learn more easily and quickly.
                     Consistency in content – Proper sequencing helps to avoid
                     inconsistencies in the training content. Carefully sequenced
                     training will eliminate gaps and duplication in the training.
                     Consistency of content ensures that skill progression is orderly
                     and that prerequisite knowledge and skill have been acquired
                     prior to the introduction of advanced subject matter content or
                     performance of more complex tasks.


Sequencing        There are several methods of sequencing training:
training
                     Job performance order – This method sequences training in
                     the order in which the tasks and subtasks are performed on
                     the job. Learning tasks and subtasks arranged in this order is
                     very effective since it is orderly in process, builds learning on
                     learning, and adds realism to the training.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                        149



Sequencing             Psychological order – This method of sequencing arranges
training               the training content based on ease of learning. Simply stated,
(Continued)            students are taught the easier tasks first, then progress to the
                       more complex tasks. This method also includes the process
                       of starting with what the student already knows and
                       proceeding to new information.
                       Logical order – Normally, training activities should be
                       designed to proceed from the simple to complex or from the
                       known to unknown. However, training activities will not always
                       lend themselves to these design methods. In such cases, you
                       may want to design the training activity using both the perfor-
                       mance order and the psychological order. This arrangement
                       normally includes the whole-part-whole concept. For
                       example, when teaching how to assemble a carburetor, the
                       demonstration would start with the whole carburetor. The
                       carburetor would then be disassembled into its component
                       parts and reassembled into the whole unit.


Guidelines for      Various methods of sequencing can be used to design training
sequencing          activities based on the content of the training and the availability
                    of resources. When selecting methods to design training
                    activities, consider the following:

                       Place easily learned objectives early in the training sequence.
                       Provide any common or "core" training early in the training
                       sequence.
                       Subobjectives should be sequenced with the objective they
                       support, when possible.
                       Place skills and procedures within each objective in job order,
                       when possible.
                       Introduce concepts at the first point where the understanding
                       of those concepts is a prerequisite for successful
                       performance.
                       Provide training in prerequisite skills before the time when
                       they must be combined as required on the job.
                       Introduce a knowledge or skill in the task in which it is most
                       likely or most frequently to be used.
                       Provide practice of skills and concepts in areas where transfer
                       of like or related skills is not apt to occur.
                       Place complex and cumulative skills late in the sequence.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9       1 November 2002                                      150



Optimum size of      There are no hard and fast rules on the proper size of each
training unit        increment of training. Nevertheless, it is a very important concern
                     for the instructional developer or design team. There is a natural
                     tendency to "play it safe" and give more training than is
                     necessary. This costs valuable resources and normally causes
                     boredom on the part of the students. The best approach to
                     designing the proper size or increment of training is to start with
                     minimal training, and rely on validation to show if more training is
                     needed in a particular unit or increment. This method, combined
                     with feedback from training evaluations, will indicate the need for
                     more training. If you provide more training than is necessary in
                     the beginning, you will not have a good indication that you have
                     done so.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 9       1 November 2002                                            151



                                  Select Training Methods

Introduction            One of the most important tasks you will perform as an
                        instructional developer or a member of a design team is that of
                        selecting the training method. The method you select will have a
                        direct impact on both the qualities of the training system and its
                        cost-effectiveness.


What is a training      Training method is the process used to deliver the training
method?                 content and to provide guidance for students to retain the skills
                        and knowledge imparted. Examples include lecture,
                        demonstration, and self-study.


Who is                  The instructional developer has the overall responsibility for
responsible?            selecting the training method. However, in cases where the
                        design team approach is used, team members play an active,
                        vital role in selecting the most effective, cost-efficient method of
                        delivering the training.


Training method         Once the instructional developer or design team has designed
options                 the training activities, use the information to select the best
                        training method(s) to achieve the objective. There are many
                        training methods you can select. Some options are outlined
                        below.

                                 TRAINING METHODS
Presentation            Presentation methods include:
methods                    Lecture – A formal or semiformal oral presentation of
                           information by a single individual; facts, concepts, problems,
                           relationships, rules or principles presented orally either
                           directly (as by classroom instructor) or indirectly (as by video).
                           Demonstration – Presentation or portrayal of a sequence of
                           events to show a procedure, technique, or operation;
                           frequently combines an oral explanation with the operation or
                           handling of systems equipment or material. May be
                           presented directly (as by a classroom instructor) or indirectly
                           (as by video).

                     TRAINING METHODS (Continued)
Presentation           Exhibit – A visual or print display used to present information;
methods                for example, actual equipment, models, mockups, graphic
(Continued)            materials, displays, chalkboard, or projected images.
                       Indirect Discourse – Verbal interaction among two or more
                       individuals which is heard by the student; may be a
                       dramatization, such as role playing, or a dialogue between
                       panel members, or a teaching interview (a question and
                       answer session between instructor and visiting "expert").
                       Assigned Reading – Printed verbal materials such as books,
                       periodicals, manuals, or handouts. Reading may be course-
                       assigned or self-assigned.
                       Teaching Interview – Question and answer session between
                       the instructor and visiting "expert" following a highly structured
                       plan.


Student verbal      Student verbal instruction methods include:
instruction            Questioning – An instructor and/or courseware controlled
methods                interactive process used to emphasize a point, stimulate
                       thinking, keep students alert, check understanding, or review
                       material. Questioning may be direct, as by a classroom
                       instructor, or may be designed into a film or television
                       presentation.
                       Programmed Questioning – An instructor and/or courseware
                       controlled interactive process used to systematically demand
                       a sequence of appropriate student responses; may be used
                       directly (as by an instructor in a classroom) or indirectly (as by
                       programmed booklets or computers).
                       Student Query – The provision by which students are given
                       the opportunity to search for information, as by questioning a
                       classroom instructor, tutor, coach, or an appropriately
                       programmed computer.
                       Seminar – A peer-controlled group interactive process in
                       which task- or objective-related information and experience
                       are evoked from the students. Questions may be used to
                       evoke student contributions, but the seminar is distinguished
                       from questioning.
                       Discussion – An instructor-controlled interactive process of
                       sharing information and experiences related to achieving a
                       training objective.

                     TRAINING METHODS (Continued)
Knowledge           Knowledge application methods include:
application            Performance – Student interactions with things, data, or
methods                persons, as is necessary to attain training objectives; includes
                       all forms of simulation (for example, games and interaction
                       with hardware simulators) and interaction with actual
                       equipment or job materials (for example, forms).

                       Performance may be supervised by classroom instructor,
                       tutor, coach, or peer to provide needed feedback.

                       Case Study – A carefully designed description of a problem
                       situation, written specifically to provoke systematic analysis
                       and discussion.



Selection           There are several factors you should consider when selecting the
considerations      appropriate training method. These factors can be categorized
                    into three major areas: constraints, cost-efficiency, and training
                    considerations.

                    Constraints
                      Geographical spread of target audience – If the target
                      audience is widely spread it may not be feasible to bring
                      students to a central location for training. If this is the case,
                      classroom training may not be the appropriate training
                      method. You would want to consider other training methods
                      such as OJT or self-study.
                      Availability of students – If there will be an insufficient flow of
                      students due to lack of travel funds, number of students to be
                      trained, or other reasons, it is not likely that formal classroom
                      training is appropriate. Again, a better method may be OJT or
                      self-study. Also, you may want to consider using CBT if there
                      are large numbers of students to be trained over a long period.
                      Availability of instructors/trainers – If instructors/trainers are
                      not available, you would want to consider other training
                      methods such as self-study or CBT.
                      Availability of facilities and equipment – If there is a lack of
                      adequate facilities and equipment to handle the student flow,
                      you would want to consider OJT, self-study, ICW, and others.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                          154



Selection              Development time – Training methods such as CBT require
considerations         considerable development time. If development time is limited
(Continued)            or only a few students are to be trained, consider other
                       training methods such as self-study, OJT, and others.

                    Cost-Efficiency
                      Trained Personnel Requirements (TPR) – Expensive delivery
                      systems such as CBT may be justified if the TPR is large and
                      the training is required over a long period.
                      Content stability – If the training content requires frequent
                      updates or revisions, CBT is less suitable than classroom,
                      OJT, or self-study.
                      Amount of practice required – If a lot of practice is required,
                      you would want to consider CBT as a training method since
                      practice time is limited only by the availability of the student
                      and the equipment. In the classroom or OJT, an instructor or
                      trainer is required, which is costly.

                    Training Considerations
                       Task criticality – If task performance is critical, you would likely
                       consider formal classroom training or OJT. Self-study would
                       be a questionable training method for a critical task.
                       Learning difficulty – A task that is difficult to learn should be
                       trained using the classroom, CBT, ICW or OJT method.
                       Training fidelity – If the training fidelity requirement is high, you
                       should select a training method that uses the actual
                       equipment to train the process or procedures.
                       Interaction level – If the learning process requires a great deal
                       of interaction, OJT is probably the best since it is highly
                       interactive. If the group size is small, classroom training can
                       provide moderate interaction. You would not want to use self-
                       study if the learning process requires high interactivity.

                                        Select Media

Introduction         Although selection of training methods and media is discussed
                     individually, they can't always be considered separately. No
                     single medium is the most appropriate choice for every training
                     situation. Proper media ensures that information is presented to
                     the students by the most effective and cost-efficient means
                     possible.


What are media?      Media are the means, instrument, or material used to
                     communicate information – in other words, the means used to
                     give information to the students. Examples of media include
                     classroom instructor, study guides, CBT, ICW, satellite training,
                     interactive video, and numerous other types.


Who is               Selecting media for the training system is the overall
responsible?         responsibility of the instructional developer. If a design team
                     approach is used, the appropriate team members will assist the
                     developer in selecting the most effective, cost-efficient media for
                     the system.


Types of media       There are several types of training media, as shown below.

Media selection by   Selections of training methods were discussed previously in this
learning outcomes    section. Selection of the "right" method(s) is important and has

Media selection for   Most types of complex skills involve multiple objectives from
integrated            different domains of learning. A skill that involves two or more
activities            objectives from different learning domains involves integrated
                      learning activities. Media selection for integrated learning
                      activities must take into consideration the enterprise and the
                      learner's schema, metaskills, and experience.

                      Enterprise. An enterprise is an integrated, purposeful activity
                      that usually leads to accomplishment of a goal. For example, an
                      individual might have an enterprise to build and fly an airplane.
                      An individual does not have to have all the prerequisite skills to
                      engage in an enterprise. The importance of an enterprise is that
                      it is purposeful and relevant to the learner. This motivates the
                      learning behavior necessary to complete the component tasks.

                      Schemas. A schema is an individual's organization of
                      knowledge. Schemas may take the form of scripts (a kind of
                      story or scenario that organizes information) or frames (a
                      structure that looks like a table or matrix into which information
                      fits). Different levels of learners have different types of schemas.
                      A novice learner (in a particular subject area) has a very sketchy
                      schema or structure into which new information can be placed.
                      An experienced learner (one who has had some training in a
                      subject area) has a better structure and therefore is a quicker
                      learner than the novice. Finally, an expert has a very highly
                      developed schema and is probably capable of rapid learning with
                      very little learning support.

                      Metaskills. Metaskills are cognitive strategies that an individual
                      applies to the processing of new information in a novel situation
                      (a scenario not previously experienced). These skills include
                      chunking or organizing new information, recalling relevant
                      schemas, adding the new information to the old schemas, and
                      creating new schemas. Although metaskills are probably subject-
                      independent, different individuals have different metaskill
                      capabilities depending upon their experience with a particular
                      subject content. For example, an expert has developed
                      metaskills and can relate better to a novel situation than a novice.
                      An expert is more efficient at processing new information and
                      applying it to the novel situation.

Media selection for   Learner Experience. It is helpful to know how experienced a
integrated            learner is when selecting media or teaching strategies. The more
activities            experience, the higher the level of metaskills and strategies the
(Continued)           learner will be able to employ. Experienced learners can deal
                      with larger steps of instruction and more complex learning
                      environments. Novices, on the other hand, require simplification
                      of complex contexts so they don't experience information
                      overload while learning.


Guidelines for        Several guidelines for media selection are:
selecting media
                         Select media that do not conflict with the specific training
                         environment.
                         Select media that effectively meet the training objectives.
                         Select media that support the training strategy.
                         Select media that allow individualization of training to the
                         greatest extent possible.
                         Select media with time, know-how, and dollar resources in
                         mind.
                         Select media that are effective and cost-efficient.

                                 Finalize Training Plan

Introduction            In the analysis phase of ISD, the manager started developing the
                        training plan for the training system at that point. However, much
                        of the information and documentation to be included in the
                        training plan was not available. As training development
                        progresses through the design phase, more information and
                        documents are available for finalization of the plan.


Purpose                 The purpose of finalizing the training plan is to:

                           Compile resource and course control documents into a single
                           document that describes the training system being developed.
                           Document approval to implement the training.


When do you             Ideally, finalization of the training plan should occur at the end of
finalize the training   the design phase after the training has been designed and all of
plan?                   the resource requirements have been accurately identified. If
                        information or a document is not available at this point, the
                        manager needs to gather it soon after entering the development
                        phase in order to complete the training plan and get it approved.


Tasks to finalize       To finalize the training plan, perform the following tasks:
the training plan
                           Compile all of the necessary resource and course control
                           documents into a simple plan.
                           Write a narrative that describes the content of the training and
                           the parameters of the course.
                           Provide a synopsis of the resource requirements to support,
                           operate, and maintain the training system.


Who is                  The manager is responsible for developing as well as finalizing
responsible?            the training plan. Training and support organizations will provide
                        the manager with all the necessary information and documents.

                                   Section F
               Design Training Information Management System

Introduction         Managing training information is a difficult task. It involves
                     updating records, scheduling students, tracking equipment and
                     meeting budgets. Well-managed training information is
                     necessary for an effective and cost-efficient training system.


Purpose              An automated training information management system enables
                     those responsible for supervising various aspects of a training
                     system to manage the training system in real time. It can also
                     provide the instructors with the latest training/data materials
                     available. For example, the automated system can be used by:

                        Instructors to update student status.
                        Registrar to track student status.
                        Curriculum developers to update training materials.
                        Training manager to manage resources.


Who is               The responsibility for designing a training information
responsible?         management system normally falls on a project manager or
                     officer. However, the training or single-point manager has a
                     responsibility for ensuring that the training information is
                     managed effectively and cost-efficiently for the training system.
                     In most cases, the manager will not have an option as to whether
                     an automated information management system is designed for
                     use or not. The decision is based on the availability of a
                     management system. If a system does exist, it will likely be used
                     by all involved in the training organization.


Design               There are many things to consider when designing or redesigning
considerations       a management system. Some of those are:

                        What is the system cost?
                        What are the hardware capabilities?
                        Are there any special environmental requirements for the
                        hardware?

                               Update ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction           An ISD evaluation plan was developed during the initial stages of
                       ISD project planning. This plan was updated in the analysis
                       phase of ISD to ensure that it remained an effective tool for
                       evaluating the quality of the ISD process and products. Likewise,
                       at the end of the design phase, the evaluation plan should be
                       updated again as necessary.


Assessing quality      ISD is a quality management process. There are different
                       ways to assess the quality of the design phase. One of the
                       simplest ways is to develop a job aid using questions focused on
                       quality improvements. Examples of questions are:
                          Does the ISD evaluation plan assess the quality of both
                          process and products in the design phase?
                          Can the instructional design process be improved? If so,
                          how?
                          Are the metrics or standards for the design process and
                          products realistic and adequate? If not, why not?
                          Can the products of the design phase, such as objectives and
                          tests, be improved? If so, how?
                          Are the products of the design phase accurate?
                          Do the products of the design phase contain adequate
                          information? If not, what information should be added?
                          Do the products of the design phase contain information that
                          is not needed?
                          Are products being developed during the design phase that
                          are not needed?


Why update the         Most ISD projects will be different due to the nature and scope of
plan?                  the project itself. For example, one ISD project may be to revise
                       the training in an existing course while another project may be to
                       develop training for a new course. Since most ISD projects have
                       differences, it may be difficult to develop a totally accurate plan
                       that doesn't require some updating. Therefore, as the design
                       phase is completed, it may be necessary to update the evaluation
                       plan. Updating the plan ensures that the most current and
                       accurate information is used when evaluating the process and
                       products of the development phase.

Who is                Updating the evaluation plan after the design phase is the
responsible?          responsibility of the instructional developer in cooperation with
                      the training manager. However, everyone in the training
                      organization is responsible for quality.


What should be        To remain an effective evaluation tool, the plan should be
updated?              updated after the design phase to reflect the most current and
                      accurate evaluation data. Updating the ISD evaluation plan may
                      include:

                         Revisions to the plan such as:
                             Procedures to be used in evaluating the design process
                             and products.
                             Design products to be evaluated, such as objectives and
                             test items.
                             Standards to be used to evaluate the design process and
                             products.
                         Revisions to the evaluation schedule, such as:
                             When the design process and products will be evaluated.
                             Quality of products to be evaluated.
                         Results of the design phase.
                         Rationale for changes made to the ISD evaluation plan.
                         Lessons learned during evaluation of the design process and
                         products.


Tracing the quality   Quality of the design process and the resulting products is
process               essential to the training development process. Therefore, you
                      should document evaluation of the design phase to the point that
                      the quality process can be traced throughout the entire ISD
                      process, including the design phase. However, document only
                      what is needed; never document more than you need.

                      Update Management Strategies

Introduction       Management strategies provide a roadmap for managing training
                   systems during the analysis phase and guide training
                   development during the design phase. During the design phase,
                   you need to update the management strategies to reflect current
                   information and the latest status of the project. The update may
                   include new or revised milestones, changes in resource
                   constraints, or revisions to resource requirements.


Importance of      Management strategies ensure that the training project is on
management         track, on schedule and under budget. Remember, training
strategies         strategies:

                      Serve as a tool for managing the training system and the
                      training development process.
                      Establish milestones for system and training development.
                      Ensure that an effective and cost-efficient training system is
                      developed.


Why update         Updating management strategies ensures that they reflect the
management         current status of the project and remain an effective management
strategies?        tool. For example, during the design phase, you learn that you
                   will not get all of the classroom and laboratory space you need
                   and will have to use a smaller facility. An update in the
                   management strategies is required to reflect information such as
                   changes in the number of groups you can have in session, group
                   size, and equipment requirements.

                   As you can see, if the management strategies are not continually
                   updated, they can quickly become outdated, not reflecting the
                   current status of the project.

                   Management strategies should be updated upon completion of
                   your training design. The updated strategies enable you to enter
                   the development phase with the latest "roadmap" of where you
                   are going and how you are going to get there.


Who is             The manager is responsible for seeing that the management
responsible?       strategies are updated to reflect the current status of the project.

What should you      When updating management strategies, include the latest
update?              information from the design phase such as:

                        Changes to the overall management strategy for the training
                        system and process.

Introduction          After you have specified the objectives, developed tests, planned
                      strategies and activities, you are ready to implement your design
                      in the development phase. Some of the tasks in this phase
                      include writing lesson materials, producing training media,
                      developing ICW, etc. As an instructional developer, this is where
                      all your efforts from earlier phases of ISD start to come together.


Where are you in      To this point you have completed the analysis and design

                          Prepare Plan of Instruction

Introduction      A Plan of Instruction (POI) serves as the overall plan or blueprint
                  for conducting training in a given course. In some training
                  organizations a course syllabus is used for the same purpose.
                  POIs standardize training and control its quality.


Purpose           The POI is a control document used for planning, organizing, and
                  conducting training.


POI contents      POIs expand the basic course control documents and provide
                  necessary details for an instructor to develop specific lesson
                  plans. Although the POI can be in different formats, it is normally
                  organized by units or modules of training with each unit
                  containing information such as:

                     Name of instructor
                     Course title
                     Unit or block title
                     Course content
                     Time allocations for each block or unit
                     Objectives
                     Student training materials
                     Audiovisual equipment
                     Training equipment
                     Training method(s) and time
                     Instructional guidance
                     Lesson plan approval date and signature
                     Lesson plan/teaching guide


Who is            Instructional developers and instructors prepare the POI or

Guidelines for POIs   The basic guidelines for preparing a POI or syllabus are that it
                      should:

                         Be usable.
                         Document the plan of instruction.
                         Be easily maintained.
                         Meet the organization's needs.

                      The format of the lesson plan is determined by the organization
                      providing the training.

 ATTENTION:

 Imagine if you will, a time three to four weeks from now. You have just finished teaching your first
 class of students. They did well and all graduated. You have received a number of compliments on
 the way you presented the material and it made you feel good. Tomorrow you can relax - it's
 Saturday. Then the phone rings. It's the Boss! He just realized that a group from the Rotary club is
 scheduled to visit the Department tomorrow at 10:30 and since your class has graduated, he wants
 you to prepare a briefing for them, to include visual aids. You hurriedly visit the visual services branch,
 and they have nothing that could fill the bill and besides their workload is such that they couldn't
 possibly produce a thing for you before next Thursday. What do you do?


 OVERVIEW:

 5a.    Given the necessary materials, prepare one transparency, suitable for projection, using the
        Color-Lift Process. Show TP #1.

 MOTIVATION:

 There may be times that you are required to present a briefing or lesson and there are no training aids
 available. Today you'll learn a process that will enable you to develop colorful and professional-looking
 transparencies with very little cost or time involved.


 TRANSITION:

 We will begin our lesson by first defining the Color-Lift Process so that each of us has the same
 understanding of this term.

 REMOTIVATION:

 We never know when we will be called upon to give a presentation. The Color-Lift Process, because it
 is fast and professional looking, will aid us greatly in being able to give a no-notice or last-minute
 lecture or briefing containing transparencies of the highest quality.

 CLOSURE:

 Don't forget how to use the Color-Lift Process. It's easy and it will distinguish your future presentations
 in a very positive way.

                               Develop Training Materials

Introduction           In the design phase, you select the training method and media
                       that best suit your training needs. At this point, you start
                       developing the media selected to implement your training design.
                       Developing training materials is a time-consuming and exacting
                       task. Regardless of the media selected, it is essential that you
                       develop a quality product since it is the vehicle that carries the
                       information to the students.


Description            As a reminder, media are the means, instrument, or material
                       used to communicate information; in other words, the means
                       used to give information to the students. Examples of media
                       range from the classroom instructor using a lesson plan to study
                       guides, CBT, satellite training, interactive video, or numerous
                       other types of media.


Training material      Training materials can be delivered via:
delivery
                          Instructor
                          Print-based material
                          Slide/tape
                          Audio/video tapes
                          CBT
                          Interactive video
                          Training devices/aids
                          Satellite


Factors in media       Several factors affect the development of training media and
development            materials. The relative importance of each of these factors
                       depends on the media you have selected. These factors are:

                          Development personnel required
                          Development time required
                          Development cost required

Development       Development of training materials requires many activities to be
activities        performed. The type and number of these activities depend upon
                  the type of training materials being developed. Some of the most
                  common development activities are listed below.

Who is            Developing training materials normally involves teamwork and
responsible?      requires various skills. Curriculum developers are responsible for
                  planning, scheduling, and making sure the training materials get
                  produced. Team members required for production of different

Effective           To ensure that materials are instructionally sound, make sure they:
instructional
design                 Support the objectives.
                       Are student-centered.
                       Build learning on learning.
                       Meet the design that was specified in the design phase.
                       Lead students in the direction of the behavior specified in the
                       objective and guide them toward mastery of the task with
                       proper stimuli and reinforcement.
                       Use appropriate vocabulary at the level of the target population.
                       Are properly paced.
                       Are easy to understand.

                                    Section C
               Install Training Information Management System

Introduction         As stated in the previous chapter, you will probably not be
                     involved in designing or redesigning a training information
                     management system. However, you may be involved in its
                     installation. This section discusses the basic issues of installing a
                     training information management system.


Who is               A project manager or officer will normally have the overall
responsible?         responsibility for installing a new training information
                     management system, revisiting an existing system, or modifying
                     the software of an existing system. However, individuals from
                     various training organizations will likely be involved in testing of
                     the system. For example, an instructor may be asked to update
                     student records and an instructional developer may be asked to
                     update training materials in the system.


What should be       During the installation and testing of a training information
checked?             management system, there will likely be documents that guide
                     installation and checklists to test system operation. These
                     documents or checklists are normally sufficient; however, if they
                     are not, there are numerous items that should be checked.
                     Examples of items that can be checked are:

                        Are the operating instructions adequate?
                        Is the hardware user-friendly?
                        Is the software user-friendly?
                        Are the hardware and software sufficiently documented to
                        support maintenance?
                        Are there adequate terminals to do the required tasks in a
                        timely manner?
                        Is the information management in each area accurate?
                        Is the information management in each area complete?
                        Is the system reliable?
                        Is the system adequately interfaced with other users in the
                        organization?

                               Update ISD Evaluation Plan

Introduction           An evaluation plan is a "metric" or standard for evaluation of the
                       ISD process and products. It is developed initially in the planning
                       stage and updated through the analysis and design phases. To
                       ensure that the evaluation plan is effective throughout the life
                       cycle of the project, you need to update it again in the
                       development phase.


Assessing quality      ISD is a quality management process used to ensure the quality
                       of the development process as well as the products of that
                       process. The ISD evaluation strategy should include procedures
                       for evaluating the development phase and its products to assess
                       the overall quality. A good method for assessing quality is to
                       develop a job aid. There are other ways but they may not be as
                       easy to develop and use. One of the simplest ways to develop a
                       job aid is to use a series of questions such as the following.

                          Does the ISD evaluation strategy for the development phase
                          assess both process and product quality?
                          Are the quality standards for the development phase realistic
                          and adequate?
                          Can the development process be improved? If so, how?
                          Can the products of the development phase be improved or
                          simplified? If so, how?
                          Are the various products of the development phase accurate
                          and do they agree with other products of this phase? For
                          example, do the objective, training standard, POI, lesson plan,
                          and student materials all agree?
                          Are there any products in the development phase that are not
                          needed?
                          Are there additional products that should be developed?
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9       1 November 2002                                     189



Why update the        Each time you start an ISD project you will need to develop an
evaluation plan?      ISD evaluation plan or strategy. The strategy you use to evaluate
                      the various ISD projects will likely be different since most ISD
                      projects are different. For example, in some ISD projects you
                      may develop training to be delivered by an instructor. In other
                      cases, you may develop computer-based training to be exported
                      to the field. For this reason, it will be difficult to develop an
                      evaluation strategy during the initial planning stages that doesn't
                      require updating. If you are to effectively evaluate the entire ISD
                      process, you must periodically update the evaluation strategy to
                      keep it current, reflecting the actual status of the evaluation
                      process. Updating the strategy will not only keep the
                      development effort on course but will also ensure quality.


Who is                Managers are responsible for developing and updating the ISD
responsible?          evaluation plan with assistance from the instructional developers
                      or design team.


What should be        The ISD evaluation plan should be upgraded periodically so that
updated?              it remains an effective management and evaluation tool. Update
                      the ISD evaluation plan to include new or revised information
                      such as:

                         Changes in the evaluation strategy for the development
                         phase. For example:
                             Types of products to be evaluated such as training
                             materials, lesson plans, and ICW
                             Procedures to be used in evaluating the development
                             process and products
                             Standards or metrics to be used in the evaluation
                         Revisions to the evaluation schedules such as:
                             Quantity of products to be evaluated
                             When the development process and products will be
                             evaluated
                         Documentation of results of the development phase
                         Rationale for changes made to the ISD evaluation strategy
                         during the development phase

Tracing the quality   QI is an important part of the ISD process. The quality process is
process               documented to the point that it is traceable throughout the life
                      cycle of the project. Document only what is necessary, and no
                      more.

                             Validate and Revise Training

Introduction          At this point in the instructional development process, objectives
                      have been developed, tests written, instructional methods and
                      media selected, and instruction is being developed. Yet, there is
                      no assurance the instruction will be effective. Therefore, the
                      instruction should undergo validation to prove that the instruction
                      provides graduates with skills, knowledge, and attitudes to meet
                      job performance requirements. If deficiencies are found in the
                      instruction during validation, they are corrected before course
                      implementation. Validation consists of technical accuracy review,
                      individual tryouts, and small-group tryouts that are conducted as
                      a part of formative evaluation and operational (field) tryouts that
                      make up summative evaluation.


What is validation?   Validation assesses the effectiveness of instruction while it is
                      being developed with the intention of improving it. It is a process
                      of repetitive cycles of development, tryouts, and revisions until
                      evidence shows that the instruction is effective.


When should           When possible, validation is done as segments, units, or blocks
validation be         of instruction are developed or revised. It is best for instructional
done?                 developers and instructors to wait until all of the instruction has
                      been developed before determining its effectiveness.

                                Develop Validation Plan

Introduction          For a training system to be effective, adequate planning should
                      take place in the initial stages of training development. A part of
                      that planning is the evaluation plan which often includes a plan of
                      how the instruction is to be validated. These plans can be
                      separate or can be subsets of other plans. Validation planning is
                      essential for successful implementation of an instructional
                      system.


Purpose               A validation plan provides instructional developers and instructors
                      with a roadmap for validating the instruction. A validation plan
                      provides organization and creditability to the validation process.


Who is                Validation planning is the responsibility of managers within the
responsible?          organization or the design team. This responsibility is often
                      delegated to instructional developers since they often provide
                      much of the information that goes into the validation plan such as
                      the validation schedule, number of individual tryouts, and number
                      of tryouts to be conducted.


What is in a          Validation plans may contain information such as:
validation plan?
                         Description of instruction to be validated (objectives, method,
                         and media).
                         Who may conduct the validation?
                         Validation procedures.
                         Validation schedules.
                         Program schedule constraints.
                         Number of tryouts to be conducted in each of the tryout
                         activities.
                         Number and availability of students to be used in the tryouts.
                         Sources and how the results should be documented.
                         How problems should be resolved.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9       1 November 2002                                      193



Getting ready to      Prior to starting validation, you should:
validate
                         Understand each activity in the validation process.
                         Know who is expected to conduct the various activities.
                         Know when the activities are to occur.
                         Ensure that the training is ready.
                         Ensure that students have been scheduled.
                         Know how to document any deficiencies.
                         Know procedures for revising training, if applicable.


How to use a          Using the plan, those validating the instruction follow the
validation plan       predetermined guidelines and standards for evaluating the
                      effectiveness of the instructional system under validation. Using
                      the plan also provides organization to the process and adds
                      credibility by providing a documented process. Following the
                      validation plan's established guidelines and standards ensures
                      that:

                         Each component of the instructional system is measured
                         against a predetermined standard. If components of the
                         system do not meet the criterion/standard, then an analysis of
                         the component(s) should be conducted to determine why they
                         do not meet the established standard. First, determine if the
                         standard is realistic and valid. If so, then examine why the
                         established standard is not being achieved.
                         For example, a majority of the students are unable to
                         accomplish a specific performance task in the time specified.
                         A check of the technical data and with subject matter experts
                         (SMEs) indicates that the standard is correct. A further
                         analysis of the lesson plan reveals that the task procedures
                         are being taught incorrectly, thus causing additional time to be
                         needed to complete the task.
                         Validating each component of the instructional system against
                         standards established in the plan allows those components
                         not meeting standards to be identified and corrected as
                         necessary, thus ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the
                         instructional system to be maintained.

How to use a            Following the established guidelines in the validation plan
validation plan         ensures that the validation of the instructional system is
(Continued)             performed in an organized, timely manner with each
                        component of the instructional system being validated at the
                        appropriate time in the process.
                        For example, the plan identifies each component of the
                        instructional system, how each component will be validated,
                        when each component will be validated, and the standard to
                        be used in the validation process.
                        The plan also serves as the basis for reporting results of the
                        validation process.

                     Remember, keep the validation plan as simple as possible – only
                     include information that is necessary to validate the instructional
                     system.

                      Conduct Technical Accuracy Reviews

Introduction        The technical accuracy review, which is a formative evaluation
                    activity, is the first step of the actual validation process. This
                    review identifies inaccuracies and weaknesses in the materials
                    under review. Materials should be thoroughly reviewed, since
                    this may be the last opportunity to revise draft materials before
                    they are tried out on the students. If possible, and when
                    applicable, conduct technical accuracy reviews each time
                    instruction is developed, updated or revised.


Purpose             The purpose of the technical accuracy review is to verify the
                    accuracy of the training materials as they are developed, if
                    possible, in order to identify inaccuracies and weaknesses in the
                    materials so they can be corrected.

How to conduct a      There are many ways to review training materials for accuracy,
review                completeness, and quality. The bottom line is to cross-check the
                      materials against the data sources such as technical orders,
                      regulations, directives, and checklists. One method of helping
                      conduct the review is to develop a job aid. An example is
                      provided.

                      1. Is the content of the material accurate?

                      2. Is the material current?

                      3. Is the material complete?

                      4. What are the "good" parts of the material?

                      5. Are there any "bad" parts in the material?

                      6. Does the sequence of the material build learning on learning?

                      7. Are the practice exercises adequate?

                      8. Are the review exercises adequate?

                      9. Does the material/lesson effectively teach the behavior
                         specified in the objective?

                      10. Is the objective adequately evaluated?

                      11. Is the content of the material compatible?

                      12. Can the materials be improved? If so, how?



During a review       When conducting a review, the reviewers should:

                         Take careful notes while conducting the review.
                         Make specific comments.
                         Identify weaknesses in the materials.
                         Recommend ways to improve the materials.

                             Conduct Individual Tryouts

Introduction         Individual tryouts, a formative evaluation activity, are normally
                     the next step in the validation process. During this step, as the
                     training and materials are being developed, they are tried out on
                     individual students. The instruction and materials need to be
                     tried out on several students, if practical, in order to add validity
                     and reliability to the data collected during the tryout. It may not
                     always be possible to conduct individual tryouts due to resource
                     constraints.


Purpose              The purpose of individual (one-on-one) tryouts is to determine the
                     effectiveness of small segments or units of instruction and
                     materials as they are developed, updated or revised.


Select students      A great deal of care should be used when selecting students to
                     participate in the individual tryouts. During the selection process,
                     consider the following factors:

                        Students selected for the tryouts should be from the target
                        audience and fall within the predetermined range of:
                            Aptitude
                            Skills
                            Attitude
                            Prior knowledge
                            Background experience

                     If students do not fall within the range, tryout results can be
                     skewed. Thus, student performance cannot be generalized to the
                     target audience.

                        Students for the first tryouts should be selected from the upper
                        percentage ranges in aptitude and background because:
                            Brighter students are often more likely to point out and
                            analyze weaknesses in the instruction and materials.
                            If better students cannot learn the material, less capable
                            students may not be able to.
                            If lower-level students are used in the individual tryouts
                            and they do well, there is no way to tell if the training and
                            materials are at the proper level.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9       1 November 2002                                          199



Select students               It is easier to work down from a known point of difficulty
(Continued)                   than to work up from an unknown point of difficulty.
                              It is simpler to add material to make a lesson or material
                              easier than to delete material to make it more difficult.


Media use during      The nature of the tryout should depend, to some degree, on the
tryout                media selected for use in the course. Certain types of media
                      selected for use in the course may be too expensive for use
                      during the individual tryouts or may not be available. However,
                      there are ways to validate the instruction and materials without
                      having all of the media selected for the course. Following are
                      examples.

                                                                      Conduct

Before a tryout      Before conducting the individual tryouts, instructional developers
                     should prepare the students for the tryouts. Students need to
                     know:
                        The purpose of the tryout.
                        Their role in the tryout.
                        That they are not being evaluated; the training and material
                        are.
                        That their active participation is essential if the individual tryout
                        is to be successful.
                        That their feedback is necessary in determining adequacy of
                        the training and materials.

                     If instructors are involved with the individual tryouts, they should
                     be aware of their role and the role of the student.


During a tryout      During the individual tryouts, instructional developers should:
                       Closely observe students as they use the material.
                       Make careful note of where students seem to have problems
                       or uncertainties.
                       Give assistance to students only when it is essential to student
                       progress.
                       Administer the relevant test item at the appropriate time.
                       Get the students' view about the difficulties encountered
                       during the tryout.

(Continued)           Student Comments               instruction and materials,
                                                     especially their difficulties.
                                                     Ask students for suggestions on
                                                     how the instruction and materials
                                                     can be improved.


Typical problems      Often, when conducting individual tryouts, problems are identified
                      that are typically found during the first tryouts. Some of the
                      typical problems are:

                         Improper sequencing of the training.
                         Instruction not clear and concise.
                         Lack of supporting training materials.
                         Confusing test items.
                         Test items that do not measure objectives.
                         Insufficient practice time.


After a tryout        When the individual tryouts have been completed, analyze the
                      resulting data to determine if error patterns or problems have
                      occurred on successive tryouts. If so, changes or revisions to the
                      training or materials may be appropriate.

                      Example: Each student participating in the individual tryouts fails
                      to meet the performance standard for a particular objective.
                      Review the objective, training materials, and test, and revise as
                      necessary.

                      In most cases, several tryouts should be conducted before
                      making any significant revisions or changes to the training or
                      materials.

                      When significant revisions or changes are required in the training
                      or materials, it is recommended that additional individual tryouts
                      be conducted in order to determine if the problem was solved.

                             Conduct Small-Group Tryouts

Introduction         After the individual tryouts have been completed and all
                     necessary revisions have been made to the training, it is time to
                     conduct the next stage of validation, which is the small-group
                     tryouts. In this stage, which is the last activity in formative
                     evaluation, the training and materials are tried out on small
                     groups of students, if practical. Again, a lack of resources may
                     prevent or reduce the number of small-group tryouts that can be
                     conducted. Up to this point, the success of the instruction has
                     been based on a limited sampling of students with higher
                     aptitudes. It should be pointed out that the training and materials
                     are developed for average students; thus, small-group tryouts are
                     focused on the average group.


Purpose              The purpose of conducting small-group tryouts is to determine if
                     the training and materials work under conditions approximating
                     the actual teaching-learning activity.


Select students      Student selection for the small-group tryout is again very
                     important in terms of validating the effectiveness of the training
                     and materials. Students selected to participate in the tryout
                     should be representative of the target audience. If possible,
                     students selected should have:
                        Even distribution between low and high aptitudes.
                        Varying skill levels.
                        Different backgrounds.

                     Even distribution of students helps determine if the training and
                     materials will be effective under operational conditions.

                     The number of students included in the small groups should be
                     determined based on factors such as:
                        Need for teams of students within the small group (for
                        example, some tasks may require students to work in teams of
                        two; if so, the small-group size should be based on multiples
                        of two).
                        Planned normal group size of the operational system.
                        Availability of equipment.
                        Availability of facilities.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 9       1 November 2002                                       203



Time is a critical      To this point in the validation process, time required to perform a
factor                  task has not been of major concern. However, time becomes a
                        critical factor in the small-group tryouts. Learning the material or
                        performing a task is not sufficient; students should be able to
                        learn the information or perform the task within a reasonable time
                        period. Therefore, effort should be made to develop training that
                        can be accomplished within a realistic time period based on
                        training requirements and the capability of average students.


Before a small-         Before trying out training on small groups, you should:
group tryout
                           Determine number of students to be included in the small
                           group.
                           Determine the number of groups to be used in the tryouts.
                           Select representative students from the target audience.
                           Ensure that the training and materials have been revised to
                           include the applicable information resulting from individual
                           tryouts.
                           Ensure that student materials are available in adequate
                           quantities.
                           Ensure that resources such as equipment, personnel, and
                           facilities to be used during the tryout approximate the
                           operational conditions.
                           Ensure that the instructional information management system
                           is operating for data collecting, analysis, and reporting.


During a tryout         When conducting small-group tryouts, you should:

                           Ensure that the time required for each student to complete the
                           material is accurately recorded. This information is used to
                           determine unit times, course length, and course content.
                           Record accuracy of student responses. This information
                           should help determine deficiencies in the training or materials.
                           Establish the number of trials a student should be permitted to
                           meet performance requirements.

                        Don't supplement the instruction. Supplementing the instruction
                        may skew the results of the tryout.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                           204



After a tryout      Conduct a sufficient number of small-group tryouts to ensure that
                    the data collected is both valid and reliable. Once the data has
                    been collected, they should be analyzed to determine:

                       Median time required to complete each segment or unit of
                       training (this information is used to set the approximate times
                       for lessons, segments, units, or modules of instruction)
                       Need to revise equipment requirements, make changes to
                       facilities, and adjust personnel authorizations
                       Training and materials requiring revisions or changes
                       Priority for accomplishing revisions or changes and plan of
                       accomplishment

                    As with the individual tryout, if the training or materials require
                    significant revisions or changes, it is recommended that
                    additional small-group tryouts be conducted to determine if the
                    revisions were effective.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 9       1 November 2002                                      205



                          Conduct Operational (Field) Tryouts

Introduction           The operational tryout is the final step in the validation process.
                       An instructor conducts this evaluation activity under normal
                       operating conditions. Field tryouts of training may vary from a
                       single block or module of training to an entire course. The training
                       to be validated will depend largely on whether it is a new course
                       or a block or two of an existing course that has been revised.


Purpose                The purposes of operational tryouts are to:

                          Determine if the training system actually works under
                          operational conditions.
                          Provide feedback from a large sample of the target audience
                          on which to base final revisions or refinements to the training
                          system prior to it becoming operational.
                          Work out any implementation or operational problems, such
                          as equipment and facilities.
                          Provide feedback from field units on quality.


Student selection      For operational tryouts, students are selected to participate from
                       the target audience, using the normal student scheduling
                       process.


Before a tryout        Before conducting the field tryouts, ensure that:

                          Resources such as equipment, facilities and instructors are
                          available.
                          Training and materials have been revised based on the results
                          of the small-group tryouts.
                          Materials are available in adequate quantities.
                          Students have been scheduled to participate in the tryouts and
                          have been informed of their role.
                          Size of tryout class is compatible with operational conditions.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9       1 November 2002                                          206



During a tryout      Conducting an operational tryout is like operating a course under
                     normal day-to-day conditions. However, when conducting
                     operational tryouts, you should:

                        Ensure that instruction is conducted in the normal operating
                        environment.
                        Collect validation data such as time requirements, test results,
                        instructor and student comments, and problem areas.
                        Use adequate data samples to ensure valid and reliable data.
                        Gather feedback from field on quality of course graduates.


Collect data         Operational tryout data is collected before, during, and after the
                     training is provided.

                        Before conducting training, the instructional developer or
                        instructor should:
                             Determine if the students have met the course
                             prerequisites and identify their entry skill and knowledge
                             level.
                             Collect data using such methods as pretests, oral
                             examination, or by directly asking the students if they
                             have specific skills or knowledge.

                        During conduct of training, the instructional developer or
                        instructor should:
                             Identify breakdowns in the training and checks student
                             progress.
                             Record the duration of the training.

                        After conducting training, the instructional developer or
                        instructor should:
                             Administer posttest.
                             Interview students.
                             Critique the training.
                             Gather supervisors' critiques of graduates.

                     The field data collection is summarized below.

                    conducted, you should:

                       Analyze the data gathered during the tryouts.
                       Revise the instructional system as necessary.

                    As with other forms of validation, continue to try out, revise, and
                    try out as long as the quality of the training system is improved.

                               Finalize Training Materials

Introduction           After you have validated the training, you should finalize the
                       training materials. During this step, you make sure that all
                       necessary changes are made to the training materials and they
                       are ready for implementation.


Purpose                The purpose of finalizing the training materials is to ensure that
                       they:

                          Have been revised to include the most current and accurate
                          information.
                          Are complete.
                          Are ready to use in the teaching-learning activity.


Who is                 Curriculum developers are responsible for finalizing training
responsible?           materials. Training or single-point managers have the overall
                       responsibility to ensure that training materials are finalized and
                       ready for implementation.


What needs to be       When finalizing training materials, update:

                                       Overview

Introduction          Before you put the course "on-line," make sure the system
                      functions are in place, instructors and supervisors are prepared to
                      conduct and administer the training, and all of the required
                      resources such as personnel, equipment, and facilities are
                      available. Once the course becomes operational, you should
                      ensure that the system continually receives the necessary
                      support and maintenance. Also, periodically conduct an
                      operational evaluation to ensure that the course continues to
                      operate effectively and cost-efficiently and to produce graduates
                      that can meet the job performance requirements.


Where are you in      The training has been designed and developed and now you are
the process?          ready to enter the implementation phase. An ISD model, with the
                      implementation phase highlighted, is provided in Figure 14 to
                      help you visualize where you are in the process.

                  Implement Training System Functions

Introduction       In most formal training environments, you will not be required to
                   implement the training system functions, which were likely
                   implemented when the training organization was established.
                   Your job is to make sure someone is performing these functions
                   in the training organization and to clearly understand how the
                   system functions interface with the training system to support,
                   operate, and maintain the system. System functions can be
                   divided into management, administration, delivery, and support.
                   This section discusses each of these functions.

                             Management Function

Introduction      Initially, the training system started as a concept. With a great
                  deal of careful planning and hard work, this concept has become
                  a course ready for implementation. One of the key training
                  system functions is management. Management has the overall
                  responsibility for the training system. No matter how careful you
                  may have been, training can be inadequate if management fails
                  to perform its functions.


Who is            It is often thought that only supervisors or managers have
responsible?      management responsibilities, but that is not the case within the
                  training organization. Each individual within the training
                  organization has certain management responsibilities. For
                  example:

                     Instructors manage the teaching-learning activity.
                     Instructors' supervisors manage the scheduling of courses and
                     make sure that instructors are available and properly trained.
                     Instructional developers manage development of the
                     instruction.
                     Development branch chiefs manage the training development
                     process to ensure that effective, cost-efficient training is
                     developed in a timely manner.
                     Managers manage the overall training programs to ensure
                     they are meeting the users' needs.

                  In addition, organizations such as Resource Management, the
                  Registrar, and Faculty Development also have management
                  responsibilities.


Management        The management function is the practice of directing or
activities        controlling all aspects of the training system from the initial
                  project planning to day-to-day training. The training system
                  management function includes:

                     Planning for the design, development, implementation,
                     support, operation, and maintenance of the training system.

Management          Organizing the resources, which involves identifying,
activities          arranging, and bringing together resources such as personnel,
(Continued)         equipment, and facilities required for the training system.
                    Coordinating activities between the training and supporting
                    activities such as civil engineering, resource management,
                    and services.
                    Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of each
                    element of the project such as personnel, milestones, budget,
                    and production.
                    Reporting status and progress of the project to management
                    and other organizations involved such as Air Force functional
                    management, MAJCOM functional management, and HQ
                    AETC training operations.

Relationship to      Every aspect of the training system depends on the training
implementation       system management function. Its planning, organizing,
                     coordinating, evaluating, and reporting activities all work toward
                     ensuring the successful implementation of a training system.
                     Without this function, the system could be ineffective and
                     inefficient.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 9       1 November 2002                                     217



                                     Support Function

Introduction            The importance of the support function in the training system
                        cannot be over-emphasized. You can design, develop, and
                        implement an outstanding training course, but without the
                        necessary support, it will not be effective or cost-efficient. In
                        most cases, you will find the support function already exists. The
                        structure is there, "networks" have been established, and training
                        support activities are actively supporting the training systems at
                        your base. Although the structure is there, each time a training
                        system is developed the support requirements for that specific
                        course must be established. For example, a base has several
                        courses that require seven technicians to maintain the training
                        equipment. If you develop a new course, the additional
                        maintenance support requirement may drive an additional
                        maintenance authorization. So, each time a new course is
                        developed or an existing course is revised, you must ensure that
                        all support requirements are identified and adequately supported.


Definition              The support function can be defined as those long-range, as
                        well as day-to-day, tasks performed by training support
                        organizations in order to implement, operate, and maintain a
                        training system. Examples of support functions are:

                           Maintaining equipment and facilities.
                           Supplying equipment parts and materials for the courses.
                           Providing services such as engineering, visual, and
                           publication.


Support activities      Some of the basic support activities include:

                           Supplying equipment, parts, and materials.
                           Maintaining equipment and facilities.
                           Providing instructional materials.
                           Constructing instructional aids and facilities.
                           Providing funding and services.

Who is                As with other training system functions, managers have the
responsible?          overall responsibility for ensuring that their training systems are
                      getting adequate support. Examples of support organizations
                      are:

                         Civil Engineering
                         Resource Management
                         Visual Services
                         Information Management

                      These are only a few of the many support organizations that have
                      support and maintenance responsibilities for your training
                      systems. Your training systems may require many more than
                      these. You should always be aware of the role that other
                      organizations play.


Examples of           Various support organizations perform many tasks in support of
training support      the training system. Examples of training support tasks are
tasks                 provided below.

Relationship to       Implementing a training system requires a great deal of planning
implementation        and preparation. A part of that effort is to ensure that the
                      necessary support functions are available. Without necessary
                      support, you will not be able to operate the training system.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                        220



                             Administration Function

Introduction        Often overlooked, the administration function plays a vital role in
                    the day-to-day operation of a training system. Management may
                    be doing an excellent job managing a training system and the
                    training staff may be outstanding in providing training. But, if the
                    administration function is not working, the training system suffers.
                    You may not be involved in any administrative activities but you
                    should still be aware of what is being done on a daily basis by
                    other organizations to support and maintain the training system.


What it is          Administration is the part of management that performs day-to-
                    day tasks such as maintaining documentation, typing reports,
                    keeping equipment, supply, and other records, and maintaining
                    student records.


Who is              Once again, managers have the overall responsibility to ensure
responsible?        that the administration function is "in place." However, various
                    training support organizations also have their own individual
                    administration responsibility:

                       Registrar
                       Typing pool
                       Unit orderly room
                       Student squadron
                       Information management
                       Contract office (if fees are required)


Administration      Administration includes activities such as:
activities
                       Provide administrative support for documents such as training
                       standards, plans of instruction, lesson plans, and student
                       workbooks.
                       Maintain personnel, training, and equipment records.
                       Type reports, letters, and messages.
                       Perform student support, which includes tasks such as in and
                       out processing of students.

Administration         Administer staff support tasks such as leave process, prepara-
activities             tion and maintenance of personnel records, and administration

                       Schedule resources such as programming of the annual TPR,
                       scheduling students for classes and establishing equipment
                       utilization schedules.
                       Track students and equipment.


Examples of         Within a training organization there are many tasks being
administration      performed in support of the training system. Examples of
tasks               organizations and some of the tasks they are performing are
                    provided.

Relationship to    The training system administration function should be "in place"
implementation     before successfully implementing a training system. For example,
                   the training materials must be produced and available, students
                   must be scheduled and tracked, and the health and welfare
                   concerns have to be addressed.

                        Remember, you always need administrative support for
                                       your training system.

                                Delivery Function

Introduction      During design and development of the training system, you must
                  take special care to ensure that the appropriate delivery method
                  is selected and is ready to function when it's time to implement
                  the training. The delivery function, like the other two functions, is
                  also critical to the training system.


What it is        The delivery function is defined as the means or methods by
                  which training is provided to the students. Examples of delivery
                  functions include:

                     Instructors
                     Computers (which includes ICW, CAI and CMI)
                     Training devices including simulators, part-task trainers,
                     maintenance trainers, and mockups
                     Satellites
                     Programmed text
                     Career development and specialized courses
                     Job aids


Who is            Individuals responsible for the training delivery function are:
responsible?
                     Managers – responsible for ensuring adequate planning and
                     analysis before the delivery method is selected. Once the
                     method has been selected, management must make sure it is
                     adequately supported.
                     Instructional developers – responsible for selecting the
                     appropriate delivery method for training.
                     Instructors and instructors' supervisors – responsible for using
                     the selected method to deliver training and evaluating its

Ensuring readiness   At this point, the delivery function should be fully developed and
                     operational. Validation will have given an indication of the
                     suitability and readiness of the delivery system; however, prior to
                     implementing the instructional system you should "check it out" to
                     be sure that everything is ready. You need answers to questions
                     about the delivery function, such as:

                        Are there adequate instructors to support the training
                        requirements?
                        Have the instructors been qualified, and are they certified to
                        deliver the instructions?
                        Are the student workbooks printed in adequate numbers?
                        Is the necessary equipment available and operational, such as
                        computers, projectors, and simulators?
                        Has the programming of the ICW been completed?
                        Have slides and/or transparencies been produced?

                               Conduct Training

Introduction       To this point, managers have spent considerable time planning
                   the training system, securing resources, managing the training
                   development process, and arranging for system support.
                   Instructional developers have analyzed the tasks, designed the
                   training system, and developed and validated the training. You
                   have now reached the point of training implementation.

                   During implementation, management continues to plan and
                   manage the training system; instructional developers monitor and
                   refine training as necessary; the instructional staff conducts and
                   evaluates the training; training evaluators periodically conduct
                   operational evaluation; and the support personnel continue to
                   support and maintain the training system.

                      Preparations for Conducting Training

Introduction        Preparing to conduct training starts with the initial planning for the
                    training system and continues throughout the analysis, design,
                    and development phases of the ISD process. As you are getting
                    ready for implementation, you should ensure that everything is
                    ready to support the training.


Why make            Adequate preparation produces graduates who can meet their job
preparations?       performance requirements. Inadequate planning and preparation
                    can result in complete failure of a training system. For example,
                    if the instructors have not been qualified in the subject matter,
                    they may not be capable of providing the training necessary for
                    the students to achieve the objectives. Thus, the training system
                    produces students who can't do the job. These checks are also a
                    quality assessment of the development process and an
                    evaluation of the ISD application to this point.


Who is              Everyone involved in the support, operation, and maintenance of
responsible?        a training system shares some of the responsibilities for ensuring
                    that everything is ready for implementation. This includes:

                       Managers
                       Instructional developers
                       Instructors


What should be      During final preparations to conduct training, each component of
checked?            the training system should be checked "one last time" to ensure
                    that everything is ready. Some of the items to be checked are:

                    Equipment
                      Training, support, and test equipment should be available in
                      adequate numbers and in operational condition.
                      Logistic support, including maintenance and spare parts,
                      should be available for all training, support, and test
                      equipment.
                      A "backup" system is available if the primary system is
                      unavailable or not usable.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                       227



What should be      Facilities
checked?              Training and support facilities should be available.
(Continued)           Modifications to facilities such as electrical and air conditioning
                      should be complete.
                      Student support facilities should be available and adequate.
                      Alternative facilities should be available to support "backup"
                      system, as needed.

                    Human Resources
                      Adequate personnel must be available including instructional
                      developers, instructors, maintenance personnel, students, etc.
                      Instructors and instructors' supervisors must know their
                      importance and role in the training system.
                      Instructors must be qualified and certified to teach the
                      courses.
                      Instructors must be assigned to classes.
                      Maintenance personnel should be properly trained.
                      Students must be scheduled for the classes.

                    Funds
                      Adequate funds should be available to meet implementation
                      cost and the cost associated with daily operation of the
                      course.

                    Time
                       Instructional developers should have had adequate time to
                       develop effective and efficient training to meet the users' need
                       date.
                       Instructors should have enough lead time to get certification.

                    Materials and Supplies
                      Instructional and student materials should be available in
                      adequate quantities to support training.
                      Training and office supplies should be available in adequate
                      quantities to support training implementation.

                             Conducting Training

Introduction      Because of poor planning and lack of adequate preparation, the
                  conduct of training has often been viewed as a difficult task.
                  However, if you have planned well and made adequate
                  preparations, you should have very few problems while
                  conducting the training.


Why conduct       The purpose of conducting training is to impart the necessary
training?         skills, knowledge, and attitudes required for the graduates to
                  meet job performance requirements and to prepare them for
                  further progress through OJT.


Who is            The following are examples of people responsible for conducting
responsible?      training and their respective tasks.

                     Managers have the overall responsibility for the daily
                     operation of a training system. This responsibility includes
                     managing the support, operation, and maintenance of the
                     system.
                     Support organizations have responsibilities to provide the
                     necessary logistic support and services to maintain the
                     system.
                     Instructional developers have the responsibility to ensure
                     that deficiencies identified during operation are corrected and
                     all materials are updated as necessary.
                     Instructional staff are directly responsible for conducting
                     training and evaluating students.
                     Instructional evaluators have the continuing responsibility
                     for evaluating a graduate's technical performance throughout
                     the life cycle of the training system.

                  As you can see, managers and support activities have
                  responsibilities for the operational system. However, the focus of
                  primary responsibility is now on the instructional staff.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9       1 November 2002                                       229



Before you begin      Consider this situation. A new part-task trainer has been installed
                      in one of the classrooms in your training facility. When students
                      enter the classroom, you turn on the trainer. It trips the electrical
                      circuit breaker; you don't understand why. You performed an
                      operational check yesterday and there was no problem with the
                      circuit breaker. Further investigation reveals that when the
                      equipment in the next classroom is on, it overloads the electrical
                      circuit. This is an easy problem to fix, but a bad time to find the
                      problem.

                      The above situation should not have occurred. Between the
                      manager and instructor supervisor, every aspect of the training
                      system should be checked out before implementing the training, if
                      possible. Examples of areas that you may want to look at (if you
                      haven't already done so) are:

                         Personnel including students, instructors, and support
                         personnel such as maintenance.
                         Facilities including training and support.
                         Equipment including training, support, and test.
                         Supplies including training and support equipment, and spare
                         parts.
                         Materials including training and student handouts.
                         Schedules including facilities, equipment, students, and
                         instructors.


Conducting the        Once the training system becomes operational, it will remain so
training              until there is no longer a need for the training or the course has
                      gone through so many revisions that the course is given a new
                      course number. When conducting training, make sure the
                      system continues to operate effectively and cost-efficiently,
                      producing graduates who can meet job performance
                      requirements. During the operation of the training system, there
                      are ongoing activities that ensure system integrity.

                      Resource management is probably the single most critical issue
                      for training managers as well as instructors. You should manage
                      resources. For example:
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9       1 November 2002                                         230



Conducting the          Instructors' supervisors must schedule students for training in
training                a timely manner to ensure that students do not remain in an
(Continued)             ineffective status any longer than necessary. Instructors,
                        when not in the classroom, should be scheduled to work on
                        course-related items such as writing questions for the test
                        pool or posting changes to technical orders used in their units
                        or blocks of instruction.
                        Managers must make sure that equipment is available, in
                        adequate quantities, and in an operational condition.
                        Unneeded equipment should be turned in to supply or
                        returned to lender if it was borrowed.

                    Staff development is an activity that goes on continually while
                    training is being conducted. There is always someone who
                    needs to attend a staff development course. For example,
                    instructors and supervisors must periodically attend courses such
                    as Test and Measurement, and ISD. These courses, as well as
                    others, continue to help the staff to develop professionally.

                    Conducting training is the centerpiece to system integrity. No
                    matter what has been done to this point, the training system can
                    fail or be rendered ineffective or inefficient if the training is not
                    properly conducted. There are many items that will help you
                    conduct training.

                       Training should always be student-centered. Never allow the
                       training to be focused on the instructor.
                       Instructors are not allowed to change the training at will. They
                       must follow the plan of instruction.
                       Instructors must always perform professionally in the teaching-
                       learning environment. For example, instructors should be
                       willing to assist students when necessary and within limits.
                       Instructors should always be qualified to instruct and be
                       certified in the units/blocks they are assigned to teach.

                    Evaluation maintains the quality of the training system. During
                    the conduct of training, operational evaluation is continually
                    performed to ensure the quality of the training system. It is
                    covered in detail in the next chapter of this handbook.

Introduction       After the instruction is validated, a summative evaluation has
                   been completed, and the system functions are in place, the
                   instructional system is ready for implementation. Once the
                   system is implemented and starts producing graduates, it's time
                   to begin conducting operational evaluations. Operational
                   evaluation is a continuous process that assesses how well course
                   graduates are meeting the established job performance
                   requirements.


Objectives         The objectives of this chapter are to:

                      Describe the operational evaluation process.

                               Operational Evaluation

Introduction         Evaluation is a continuous activity that is integrated throughout
                     each stage of ISD, beginning with analysis and continuing
                     throughout the life cycle of the system. Its focus is quality
                     improvement. The last stage of the evaluation process is
                     operational evaluation.


What it is           Operational evaluation is the continuous process of gathering and
                     analyzing internal and external feedback data to ensure that the
                     system continues to effectively and cost-efficiently produce
                     graduates who meet established job performance requirements.
                     It is a quality improvement activity.


Purpose              The two main purposes of operational evaluation are:

                        To ensure that graduates continue to meet established job
                        performance requirements.
                        To continually improve system quality.

                        How well the graduates are meeting job performance
                        requirements.
                        Whether training is being provided that is not needed.
                        Whether any needed training is not being provided.
                        How well each system component is contributing to overall
                        system quality.

Operational      The two operational evaluation activities are:
evaluation
activities       Internal evaluation – Gathers and analyzes internal feedback
                 and management data from within the training environment to
                 assess the effectiveness and quality of the training process. The
                 instructional developers and instructors normally gather internal
                 evaluation data.

                 External evaluation – Gathers and analyzes external feedback
                 data from the field to assess graduates' on-the-job performance
                 in an operational environment. Most external evaluation data is
                 gathered by training evaluators from the organization providing
                 the training or is provided by the graduates and their supervisors
                 directly from the field. However, in some cases, external
                 evaluation data is gathered and provided to the organization by
                 both Air Force and non-Air Force inspection and evaluation
                 teams, consultants, advisory bodies, Board of Visitors,
                 accrediting agencies, and professional certification groups.

                                  Internal Evaluation

Introduction         Internal evaluation activities begin with implementation of the
                     instructional system and continue throughout the life cycle of the
                     training system. Some organizations call this evaluation activity a
                     "course review." Internal evaluations look at the training system
                     from within to determine system effectiveness and quality.


What it is           Internal evaluation is the acquisition and analysis of internal
                     feedback and management data, such as test data, student
                     critiques, instructor comments, and data correlation from within
                     the training system.


Purpose              The purpose of internal evaluation is to improve the effectiveness
                     and quality of the training system.


Possible causes of   Although training systems are validated prior to implementation,
problems             students may still have difficulty with the instruction during day-to-
                     day system operation. Possible causes of student problems are:

                        Instructors do not follow the POI or course syllabus.
                        The developed course is different from the course that is
                        actually implemented.
                        Resources required to support, operate, and maintain the
                        system are inadequate.
                        Instructional materials are not correlated.
                        Students do not meet course prerequisites.
                        Instructors not adequately qualified.

                     Periodic internal evaluations may identify weaknesses (problems)
                     as well as strengths of the training system.


Data collection      Several methods of collecting internal evaluation data are listed
                     on the following page.

Data analysis            Before beginning analysis of the data, ensure that:

                             Data has been collected from each component of the training
                             system.
                             Adequate data samples are collected in order to validate the
                             reliability of the findings.

                         Following are some methods of analyzing the internal evaluation
                         data.

                             Compare the training standard with the POI/course syllabus to
                             determine if the requirements of the standard are being met.
                             Compare POI/course syllabus with operational course to
                             determine if the planned and operational courses are the
                             same.
                             Review POI/course syllabus, LP, and instructional material to
                             determine if they are current, adequate, and in agreement.
                             Compare stated resource requirements with actual resources
                             to determine if adequate resources are available to support,
                             operate, and maintain the training system.
                             Review records to determine if instructors are qualified to
                             teach the course.
                             Review test data to ensure that students are meeting course
                             objectives.
                             Analyze test data to determine if test items are valid and
                             reliable.

                     can be made to correct identified problems, they should be made
                     in a timely manner in order to receive the greatest benefit from
                     the changes.

                     Revisions resulting from the analysis may require re-entry into an
                     earlier phase of the ISD process to correct the problem(s). The
                     need to re-enter an earlier phase of ISD is determined by the
                     nature and scope of the revision. For example, changing a test
                     item or adding time to a unit of training may not require you to re-
                     enter an earlier phase of ISD. However, adding a new piece of
                     equipment to the course would more than likely require you to do
                     so.

                                    External Evaluation

Introduction         How well graduates meet job performance requirements is
                     learned through external evaluation. This evaluation activity
                     relies on input from the field to determine how well graduates are
                     performing.


What it is           External (field) evaluation is the process of gathering and
                     analyzing data from outside the training environment in order to
                     determine how well recent graduates are meeting job
                     performance requirements.


Purpose              The purpose of external evaluation is to determine if recent
                     graduates of the course:
                        Can meet job performance requirements.
                        Need all of the training they received.
                        Need any training they did not receive.


Possible causes of   Some possible problems that may be identified during external
problems             evaluations are:
                        Test did not measure graduates' ability to meet job
                        performance requirements.
                        Objectives do not reflect job performance requirements.
                        Job performance requirements were incorrectly identified
                        during task analysis.
                        Job performance requirements changed after task analysis.


Collecting data      Several methods of collecting external evaluation data are listed
                     below.

                                 Questionnaires

Introduction       Questionnaires are effective, cost-efficient evaluation tools. The
                   discussion on questionnaires will focus on:

                      Advantages and disadvantages of questionnaires.
                      Types of questionnaires.
                      How to prepare and distribute questionnaires.
                      Analysis of data gathered using questionnaires.


Purpose            The purpose of using questionnaires is to:

                      Determine the ability of recent graduates to perform specific
                      tasks on which they received training.
                      Identify the specific nature of any deficiency.
                      Determine what tasks graduates are actually performing.
                      Identify what training is not needed for on-the-job
                      performance.


Advantages         Advantages of questionnaires include:

                      They are comparatively inexpensive to administer.
                      They can be used to collect large samples of graduate and
                      supervisor data.
                      They yield data that can be easily tabulated and reported.
                      Respondents give their opinions freely.


Disadvantages      Disadvantages of questionnaires include:

                      They may not be the most reliable form of evaluation; data
                      validity depends on preparation and distribution.
                      Communication is one-way; respondent may not understand
                      some of the questions.
                      They may not ask the most relevant questions.
                      They collect only opinions, which may not be as reliable as
                      other methods of collecting external data.
                      Developing effective and reliable questionnaires may be costly
                      and require extensive experience.
                      Low return rates and inappropriate responses affect accuracy.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 9        1 November 2002                                        244



Types of            Two types of questionnaires can be used to collect external
questionnaires      evaluation data:

                       One is for the graduates' immediate supervisor. However,
                       responding may be delegated to the graduates' trainer.
                       The other questionnaire is for the graduates. This
                       questionnaire is designed to find out what graduates think
                       about the training they received.


Preparing           Well-constructed questionnaires that are properly administered
questionnaires      are extremely important to the field evaluation process. The
                    following table identifies the five basic stages of questionnaire
                    development.

                        Stage                             Activity
                       Stage 1        Define purpose of questionnaire. Focus only on
                                      relevant information.
                       Stage 2        Determine specific information to be collected.
                                      Specify exactly what is needed in a list of
                                      objectives.
                       Stage 3        Develop questions that ask for specific informa-
                                      tion such as:
                                          What conditions/equipment are required to
                                          do the job.
                                          Exact action to accomplish the performance.
                                          Standards of performance.
                                          Results of performance.
                       Stage 4        Consider motivational factors when developing
                                      questionnaires. You want the respondents to
                                      answer fully and conscientiously.
                                      Questionnaires will likely motivate if you:
                                          Explain the purpose of the questionnaire.
                                          Tell the respondents how they can benefit
                                          from answering the questionnaire.
                                          Write clear and concise instructions.
                                          Make questionnaire format uncluttered and
                                          easy to answer. For example, using boxes
                                          for check marks should make the
                                          questionnaire easier to answer.

                       Stage 5        Test the questionnaire on sample respondents.
                                      Ask them to:
                                        Evaluate the cover letter.
                                        Check instructions and questions for clarity.
                                        Explain how they feel about answering the
                                        questions.
                                        Revise the questionnaire, if necessary,
                                        before distribution.

                    Note: Questions can be taken directly from the task statements in
                    the training standard.


Guidelines for      Guidelines for developing effective questions are:
developing
questions              Use closed-end questions when you want the respondent to
                       choose answers from a small number of possibilities. This
                       makes tabulation easy but may not give the range of answers
                       desired.
                       Use open-end questions when you don't know all the possible
                       answers. The respondent will probably suggest possibilities.
                       Word questions to the respondent's level of understanding.
                       Use vocabulary and concepts that are easy for the respondent
                       to understand.
                       Limit each question to one aspect of a topic.
                       Decide on the logical order of the questions (task order,
                       general to specific). Each question increases the responde-
                       nt's frame of reference and further establishes upcoming
                       responses.
                       Avoid questions that make it easier to answer one way or
                       another.
                       Avoid questions that show biases or exceptions.
                       Word questions so they will not threaten the respondents.
                       Supplemental "information-seeking" questions may be used.
                       Such questions may ask how much time the graduate spends
                       on individual tasks or what equipment or materials the
                       graduate uses.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                   246



Guidelines for       When constructing a questionnaire, several guidelines should be
constructing         considered.
questionnaires
                        Provide short, concise, and specific directions for completing
                        the questionnaire. The directions should be printed in heavy,
                        bold type, if possible.
                        Provide space for the respondent's name, title, organization,
                        and location.
                        Number the questionnaires to allow for administrative control.
                        Whenever possible, allow the respondent to use the same
                        type marking for all questions. For example, one of the best
                        methods is to allow use of check marks for responses.
                        Arrange "yes" and "no" responses vertically rather than
                        horizontally.

                        No __

                        Number each page of the questionnaire.
                        The questionnaire should be easy to read and mark. Further,
                        it should be printed.
                        Print on both sides of the pages to conserve materials, if
                        possible.
                        Send self-addressed return envelope with the questionnaire.
                        Fold the questionnaire in such a manner that the respondent
                        can refold it the same way to place it in the return envelope
                        after completion.


Guidelines for       Each questionnaire should have a cover letter. When developing

                        to improving instruction.
                        Includes a statement that assures the respondent that the
                        information will be treated confidentially.
                        Includes a statement that the evaluation is being conducted
                        per AFR 50-38.

Before you           Before distributing the questionnaire, it should be administered to
distribute the       a small number of select individuals to:
questionnaire
                        Provide valuable feedback on the quality of the questionnaire.
                        Preclude acquiring misinformation resulting from the
                        administration of a faulty questionnaire.
                        Allow correction of problems in the questionnaire before
                        distribution.


Distribution of      Distribution of the questionnaire is a critical aspect of external
questionnaire        evaluation; you just don't pick a few graduates' names and drop
                     a questionnaire in the mail to them. You plan the distribution to
                     help ensure a random sample so that the data collected is valid
                     and reliable. When distributing the questionnaire, you should:

                        Decide to whom you are sending the questionnaire – recent
                        graduate, his or her supervisor, or both. You may collect
                        important information from both.
                        Select a representative sample to ensure valid results.
                        Graduates may perform different tasks or their job
                        requirements may vary depending on the major command,
                        geographic location, or organization level; therefore,
                        questionnaires should be distributed to each area as evenly as
                        possible.
                        Determine how many questionnaires you need to mail out.
                        That decision is based on:
                            Expected response rate.

Distribution of               Level of confidence (a statistical consideration which
questionnaire                 means the size of the sample required for you to be, say,
(Continued)                   95 percent sure the sample truly represents the larger
                              population). The graduate sampling chart on the following
                              page shows how to determine the number of
                              questionnaires you need based on this consideration.
                        Decide when to distribute the questionnaires. Timing is
                        critical. Usually, questionnaires should be sent to the
                        graduates within three to six months after graduation. Beyond
                        six months, it may be impossible to tell whether the graduate
                        learned the skill or knowledge in the course, or on the job. If
                        the questionnaire is sent too early, the graduate may not have
                        had time to perform many of the tasks that were taught in the
                        course.

                     To ensure that sufficient numbers of the questionnaires are

How to use the      The table can be used as shown in the following example:
graduate sampling
table                  Annual course production is 4,000 - 95% confidence level
                       desired.* Estimated return rate of usable questionnaires is
                       85%. From the table, 364 usable questionnaires are required.
                       Therefore, this figure should be 85% of the questionnaires to
                       mail out. The number of questionnaires to mail is computed as
                       follows:

                        85%   364
                            =
                       100%    X

                       X = 364 x 100 = 428 = number of questionnaires to mail
                              85

                       * It is recommended that the 95% confidence level be chosen.
                       This is the level commonly used in business decisions.


Data analysis       When a sufficient number of completed questionnaires have been
                    returned, you should begin analyzing the data. In this process,
                    the data is:

                       Compiled.
                       Collated.
                       Analyzed (data from each command should be analyzed
                       together).

                    Pay special attention to:

                       Notes made by respondents on the questionnaires.
                       Answers to supplemental questions that were included in the
                       questionnaire.

                    Use with caution any data that contain such obvious errors as:

                       Halo effect – indiscriminate rating of all items positively.
                       Central tendency – indiscriminate rating of items in the center
                       of the scale.

                    Examine the responses to ensure, insofar as possible, that the
                    information accurately reflects the opinion of the graduates and
                    their supervisors.

                                    Field Visits

Introduction       Field visits are a very effective method of conducting external
                   evaluations. A training evaluator, often assisted by an
                   instructional developer or instructor normally conducts them.
                   Ideally, field visits should include specialists who are familiar with
                   the graduates' jobs. However, in most cases this is not possible
                   due to limited TDY funds, scheduling constraints, and number
                   and variety of graduates to be interviewed.


Purpose            The purpose of a field visit is to get first-hand information on the
                   graduates' assignment, utilization, and proficiency on the job, and
                   to validate information gained from other evaluation activities.


Advantages         Advantages of field visits are:

                      Graduates and supervisors on the job normally talk freely.
                      Guidance and information about the evaluation is given
                      directly to graduates and supervisors.
                      Information is gathered first-hand by the evaluator. Any
                      questions or assumptions can be clarified.
                      Field visits help validate questionnaire data.
                      External evaluations build rapport between the training activity
                      and the user.
                      Additional information can be gained by observing nonverbal
                      messages and asking leading or probing questions.


Disadvantages      Disadvantages of field visits are:

                      They are time-consuming. Travel to several different bases
                      requires considerable time. Interviews and observations also
                      require a lot of time if they are done correctly.
                      The sample is limited. Since the evaluator only goes to a few
                      bases, the number of interviews and observations conducted
                      are limited.
                      The cost is high. Field visits require evaluators to spend
                      limited TDY funds to travel to the various bases.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 9       1 November 2002                                         253



Disadvantages             Information gathered by the evaluator can be subjective and
(Continued)               biased.
                          Graduates may feel they are being scrutinized.
                          Evaluators are not always skilled at interviewing and
                          observing.
                          Graduates may feel intimidated by a higher ranking evaluator
                          and rate more positively than they actually feel.


Data collection        Two methods of collecting data are:

                          Interviews
                          Observations

                       Evaluators should interview recent graduates and their
                       supervisors and observe the graduates' on-the-job performance
                       when possible. However, observations are almost useless
                       unless the observer is familiar with the tasks being performed.


Preparing for the      Visits to the field to collect evaluation data should be adequately
field visit            planned. Adequate planning should ensure that useful data is
                       gathered. To prepare for the visit, you should:

                          Develop a list of questions to get honest, pertinent answers
                          and to keep the discussion focused.
                          Determine the bases to be visited.
                          Establish the schedule for the visit.
                          Select the individuals to be interviewed and observed.


Conducting the         The following are some of the tasks to be performed during the
field visit            field visit.

                          Inform graduates and supervisors of the purpose of the visit.
                          Tell them that their answers will furnish valuable information
                          for improving the training.
                          Interview the recent graduates and their supervisors.
                          Supervisors should know how well the graduate has
                          performed on the job.
                          Determine graduate's proficiency.

Conducting the         Determine how the skills learned during training are being
field visit            used.
(Continued)            Find out how the graduates are progressing on OJT.
                       Guide the interviews with your list of questions. (As the
                       interview progresses, you may need to add, delete, or revise
                       questions.)
                       Take accurate and complete notes, especially on information
                       that is freely given.
                       Have the supervisor rate the graduates' performance.
                       Observe graduates perform tasks. This may not be beneficial
                       if the training evaluator does not have job or task knowledge.
                       Take careful notes on the graduates' performance. After the
                       task has been completed, ask questions to clarify actions
                       taken by the graduate during task performance.


Data analysis       Data collected from interviews and observations are analyzed in
                    the same manner as questionnaires – that is, compiled, collated,
                    and analyzed by major command.


Reporting the       The results of the field visits and questionnaires should be
findings            combined and reported in the Training Quality Report (TQR).
                    The information gathered during field visits is not normally used
                    or reported independently. The analysis results of the
                    questionnaires and field visits are compared in order to validate
                    the findings.

                             Job Performance Evaluations

Introduction         Job performance evaluations are accomplished jointly by the
                     training activity and the using command in the operational
                     environment, at representative Air Force bases.


Purpose              The purpose of job performance evaluations is to determine how
                     well recent graduates meet the using command's job
                     performance requirements.


Advantages           Advantages of job performance evaluations are:

                        Evaluations are conducted on the job by the supervisor.
                        Evaluations are very thorough.
                        The supervisor submits reports on a weekly basis, which
                        ensures an accurate assessment of the graduates'
                        performance.
                        Data can be used to validate other forms of field evaluations.


Disadvantages        Disadvantages of job performance evaluations are:

                        It usually takes eight to ten weeks to conduct the evaluation.
                        The supervisor reports progress weekly.
                        The evaluator makes at least two TDYs to each base.
                        The sample is limited.
                        They normally focus on a single command.


Data collection      Data is collected via field reports submitted by the supervisor to
                     an evaluation element for analysis. These reports "recap" the
                     progress made during the previous week.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 9       1 November 2002                                       256



Preparing for the      As with any evaluation method, you should make adequate plans
evaluation             before starting. Planning tasks include:

                          Select recent graduates and their supervisors to participate in
                          the job performance evaluation.
                          Allot enough time in the schedule to meet with the supervisor
                          and the graduates to explain job performance evaluations and
                          get the supervisor's commitment to support the evaluation.
                          Determine tasks to be evaluated based on the training
                          standard. The criteria of performance is the training standard.
                          Establish evaluation milestones.


Conducting job         Once the participants have been selected and briefed on the
performance            process and its importance, it's time to begin the evaluation. The
evaluations            evaluation consists of the following activities:

                          The supervisor evaluates and records the graduates'
                          performance on each task performed.
                          The supervisor reports, on a weekly basis:
                              Tasks performed.
                              Frequency of performance.
                              Time required to perform the tasks.

reporting              the supervisor, they are analyzed to determine how well the
                       graduates are performing the tasks they were taught during the
                       course. Evaluators should watch for reports that indicate:

                          The graduate can't perform a task learned in the course.
                          The graduate requires excessive help to perform the task.

                       In these situations, data analysis should focus on determining
                       why the graduate is not able to meet job performance
                       requirements.

                       Since the job performance evaluation is normally conducted in
                       conjunction with the other forms of field evaluations, the results of
                       data analysis are included in the TQR.

                         Other Sources of Evaluation Input

Other data sources   Other external data sources that can be used to evaluate the
                     graduates' job performance are:

                        Inspection team (IG) reports – AF and MAJCOMs periodically
                        inspect instructional activities to determine their effectiveness.
                        Other inspections conducted by these teams may also
                        discover related problems. Use this source of data to
                        determine if graduates are meeting their job performance
                        requirements. Take appropriate action to correct deficiencies.
                        One example of an IG report is the Functional Management
                        Inspection (FMI).

Introduction          Evaluation is integrated throughout each activity of the
                      instructional development process. It starts in the planning stage
                      with development of an evaluation plan and continues for the life
                      cycle of the training system. The focus of evaluation is
                      continuous improvement in training system quality.

                               Section A
                           Formative Evaluation

Introduction      The formative evaluation process begins during analysis and
                  continues through small-group tryout in the development stage of
                  ISD. Within each stage – analysis, design, development, and
                  implementation – formative evaluation seeks to improve the
                  quality of the activities and products of ISD. In some
                  organizations, formative evaluation is equated to four stages of
                  validation – technical accuracy reviews, individual tryouts, small-
                  group tryouts, and operational tryouts.


What it is        Formative evaluation is a form of evaluation designed to collect
                  data and information that is used to improve the activities and
                  products of the ISD process while the system is still being
                  developed. Formative evaluation is also used when the design or
                  development phases are reentered in order to update or revise
                  the system.


Formative         Formative evaluation includes the following activities:

activities        Process Evaluation
                  Process evaluation ensures quality in the analysis, design, and
                  development activities.
                  It checks each activity against standards, or metrics, established
                  during ISD project planning, to assure process quality, while
                  continually seeking improvements within each activity. Process
                  evaluation enables instructional developers to "form" an effective
                  and efficient training system based on quality principles.

                  Product Evaluation
                  Product evaluation is an integral part of each stage of the ISD
                  process. Product evaluation focuses on the products of the
                  analysis, design and development activities such as task lists,
                  objectives, tests, plans of instruction and training materials.
                  During product evaluation the focus is again on quality. Products
                  are measured against standards and metrics established in the
                  planning stage of ISD to ensure quality. Product evaluation also

(Continued)      Validation, which takes place during training development and is
                 the final activity in the formative evaluation process. This
                 component, which is discussed in Chapter 6, forms the training
                 system by trying out instruction on individuals and small groups
                 when possible and if applicable. Validation identifies quality
                 improvements that should be made to the instruction prior to
                 implementing the system.

                 Quality control, which starts in the initial stages of ISD planning
                 with the strategy of controlling quality, and continues throughout
                 training analysis, design and development. This process ensures
                 that each activity such as equipment acquisition, facility
                 construction, etc., is based on quality principles.

                 Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)
                 DT&E is an active part of training system development. As a
                 formative evaluation activity, it is conducted to demonstrate that
                 training system equipment design and development is complete,
                 design risks have been minimized, and the system meets
                 performance requirements. It ensures the effectiveness of the
                 manufacturing process, equipment, and procedures.

                 Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)
                 OT&E completes the formative evaluation process for training
                 system equipment. This formative evaluation activity evaluates
                 the system's operational effectiveness, maintainability,
                 supportability, and suitability. It identifies any operational and
                 logistic support deficiencies, and the need for modification. In
                 addition, OT&E provides information on organizational structure,
                 personnel requirements, support equipment, doctrine, training
                 and tactics. It should also provide data to verify operating
                 instructions, maintenance procedures, training programs,
                 publications, and handbooks.

                      focuses on evaluating the readiness of the "bed-down" site for the
                      training system. This evaluation ensures that the site, including
                      training facilities and support equipment, is ready for OT&E of the
                      system. Site readiness reviews help ensure training system
                      effectiveness.


Relationship of the   Each formative evaluation activity contributes to the overall

                         Training development and revision activities are effective.
                         Training is cost-efficient.
                         The products of each development activity meet quality
                         standards.
                         The instruction meets training requirements.

                                 Summative Evaluation

Introduction             With the conclusion of small-group tryouts, formative evaluation
                         activities are complete. Summative evaluation is the next stage
                         in the continuous evaluation process. This stage of evaluation
                         involves trying out the instruction on the target audience in an
                         operational environment. In some organizations, summative
                         evaluations are conducted after the instructional system becomes
                         operational and include two components: internal and external
                         evaluation.


What it is               Summative evaluation is a form of evaluation designed to collect
                         data and information during the operational (field) tryouts in order
                         to determine the "summed" effect of the instruction under
                         operational conditions and to make any changes or revisions to
                         the system prior to becoming operational. Summative
                         evaluations are also conducted when significant revisions or
                         updates have been made to the instructional system.


Summative                The only summative evaluation activity is the operational tryouts.
evaluation activity      Operational tryouts are used to:

                            Determine if the training system works under operational
                            conditions.
                            Provide feedback from a large sample of target audience in
                            which to base revisions prior to implementation of the training
                            system.
                            Identify possible implementation or operational problems.
                            Determine if training is cost-efficient.
                            Determine if training is adequate and needed.


Evaluating the           Summative evaluations are conducted on fully integrated training
integrated system        systems. This form of evaluation is essential in determining the
                         effectiveness of the system and correcting any deficiencies prior
                         to implementation.

Period of        Summative evaluation is focused on the period of operational
summative        tryouts. These tryouts begin after the small-group tryouts have
evaluation       been completed and continue until the training system is
                 implemented. Normally, the operational tryout period is limited to
                 two or three classes.

                             Operational Evaluation

Introduction         As previously mentioned, the evaluation process is continuous.
                     Once the formative and summative evaluation activities have
                     been completed and the training system is implemented,
                     operational evaluation begins. Operational evaluation
                     continues as long as the system is operational.


What it is           Operational evaluation is a form of evaluation designed to gather
                     and analyze internal and external feedback data to ensure that
                     the system continues to effectively and cost-efficiently produce
                     graduates who meet established training requirements.


Operational          Operational evaluation includes the following activities.

activities           Internal Evaluation

                     Internal evaluation focuses on evaluating the training system
                     internally. This form of evaluation continuously evaluates
                     feedback data such as instructor comments, student critiques,
                     and test results in order to continually improve the system and
                     ensure quality.

                     External Evaluation

                     External evaluation focuses on evaluating the training system
                     externally. This form of evaluation continually evaluates
                     feedback data from the field such as inspection and evaluation
                     reports to ensure that graduates meet the established job
                     performance requirements.


Relationship of      Each operational evaluation activity contributes to the overall

                        Each system component continues to contribute to the overall
                        effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the system.
                        Graduates of the course continue to meet the established job
                        performance requirements.
                        Training is adequate and necessary.

                                         TERMS
The following list of definitions includes those terms commonly used in technical training
as it relates to instructional system development and as used in this handbook. The list
is not to be considered all-inclusive.

Association. The connection made between an input (stimulus) and an action
(response).

Attitude. (a) The emotions or feelings that influence a learner's desire or choice to
perform a particular task. (b) A positive alteration in personal and professional beliefs,
values, and feelings that will enable the learner to use skills and knowledge to
implement positive change in the work environment. Also see Knowledge and Skill.

Behavior. Any activity, overt or covert, capable of being measured.

Cognition. The mental or intellectual activity or process of knowing, including both
awareness and judgment.

Cognitive Strategies. The capability of individuals to govern their own learning,
remembering, and thinking behavior.

Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI). The use of computers to aid in the delivery of
instruction. A variety of interactive instructional modes are used including tutorial, drill,
practice, gaming, simulation, or combinations. CAI is an integral part of computer-based
instruction (CBI) and computer-based training (CBT).

Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) and Computer-Based Training (CBT). The use
of computers to aid in the delivery and management of instruction. CBI and CBT are
synonymous and are used interchangeably. CAI (the delivery of instruction) and CMI
(computer-managed instruction) are both elements of CBI and CBT.

Computer-Managed Instruction (CMI). The use of computers to manage the
instructional process in CAI or CBT. Management normally includes functions such as
registration, pretesting, diagnostic counseling, progress testing, and post-testing. CMI
is also used to schedule and manage training resources such as trainers and actual
equipment.

Constraints. Limiting or constraining conditions or factors, such as policy
considerations, time limitations, equipment, environmental factors, personnel,
budgetary, or other resource limitations.

Course Chart. A qualitative course control document that states the course identity,
length, and security classification, lists major items of training equipment, and
summarizes the subject matter covered.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                         278


Course Control Documents. Specialized publications used to control the quality of the
instructional system. Examples are training standards, plans of instruction, syllabi, and
course charts.

Courseware. Training materials such as technical data, textual materials, audiovisual
instructional materials, computer-based instructional materials.

Criterion. (a) The standard by which something is measured. (b) In test validation, the
standard against which test instruments are correlated to indicate that accuracy with
which they predict human performance in some specified area. (c) In evaluation, the
measure used to determine the adequacy of a product, process, behavior, and other
conditions.

Criterion-Referenced Test (CRT). A test to determine, as objectively as possible, a
student's achievement in relation to a standard based on criterion objectives. During
instructional development, the CRT can be used to measure the effectiveness of the
instructional system. The test may involve multiple-choice items, fill-in items, essays, or
actual performance of a task. If given immediately after the learning sequence, it is an
acquisition test; if given considerably later, it is a retention test; if it requires
performance not specifically learned during instruction, it is a transfer test.

Discrimination. The process of making different responses to a stimulus. A
discrimination requires a person to determine the differences among inputs and to
respond differently to each.

Distance Learning. Training that is exported, such as from a resident course to a field
location. Also called Exportable Training.

Duty. A large segment of the work done by an individual; major divisions of work in a
job.

Evaluation. A judgment expressed as a measure or ranking of trainee achievement,
instructor performance, process, application, training material, and other factors (see
DoD Inst. 29612). It includes Formative Evaluation, Operational Evaluation and
Summative Evaluation.

Exportable Training. See Distance Learning.

External Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback data from outside the
formal training environment to evaluate the graduate of the instructional system in an
operational environment. Also called Field Evaluation. Also see Operational
Evaluation.

Feedback. Information that results from or is contingent upon an action. The feedback
does not necessarily indicate the rightness of an action; rather, it relates the results of
the action from which inferences about correctness can be drawn. Feedback may be
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                       279


immediate, as when a fuse blows because a lamp is incorrectly wired; or delayed, as
when an instructor provides a discussion pertaining to an exam taken the previous
week, or when completed graduate evaluation questionnaires are reviewed.

Fidelity. The degree to which a task or a training device represents the actual system
performance, characteristics, and environment.

Field Evaluation. See External Evaluation.

Formative Evaluation. An activity that provides information about the effectiveness of
training materials to meet training objectives and the trainees' acceptance of training
materials as they are being developed. It is conducted while the instructional system or
course is still under development, to gather data on lessons, units, or modules of
instruction as they are completed. The purpose is make improvements to the system or
course while development is still in progress. Also see Evaluation.

Generalization. Learning to respond to a new stimulus that is similar, but not identical,
to one that was present during original learning. For example, during learning a child
calls a beagle and spaniel by the term "dog"; a child who has generalized would
respond "dog" when presented with a hound.

Instructional Objective. See Objective.

Instructional System. An integrated combination of resources (students, instructors,
materials, equipment, and facilities), techniques, and procedures performing effectively
and efficiently the functions required to achieve specified learning objectives.

Instructional System Developer. A person who is knowledgeable of the instructional
system development (ISD) process and is involved in the analysis, design,
development, implementation, and evaluation of instructional systems. Also called
Instructional Designer, Instructional Developer, Curriculum Developer, Curriculum
Development Manager, and other terms.

Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly, but flexible,
process for planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional systems.
ISD ensures that personnel are taught in a cost-efficient manner the skills, knowledge,
and attitudes essential for successful job performance.

Interactive Courseware (ICW). Computer-controlled training designed to allow the
student to interact with the learning environment through input devices such as
keyboards and light pens. The student's decisions and inputs to the computer determine
the level, order, and pace of instructional delivery, and forms of visual and aural outputs.

Interactive Videodisc (IVD). A form of ICW instruction that specifically makes use of
videodisc technology. Video and audio signals are pressed onto the laser videodisc;
programming codes may or may not be pressed onto the disc depending on the IVD
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                       280


level. As a result, motion sequence, still-frame shots, computer-generated graphics,
and/or audio may be displayed and heard through a monitor under computer and user
control.

Internal Evaluation. The acquisition and analysis of feedback and management data
from within the formal training environment to assess the effectiveness of the
instructional system. Also see Operational Evaluation.

Job. The duties, tasks, and subtask elements performed by an individual. The job is
the basic unit used in carrying out the personnel actions of selection, training,
classification, and assignment.

Job Aid. A checklist, procedural guide, decision table, worksheet, algorithm, or other
device used by the worker to aid in task performance. Job aids reduce the amount of
information that personnel must recall or retain.

Job Analysis. The basic method used to obtain salient facts about a job, involving
observation of workers, conversations with those who know the job, analysis
questionnaires completed by job incumbents, or study of documents involved in
performance of the job.

Job Performance Requirements (JPR). The tasks required of the human component
of the system, the conditions under which these tasks must be performed, and the
quality standards for acceptable performance. JPRs describe what people must do to
perform their jobs.

Knowledge. Use of the mental processes that enable a person to recall facts, identify
concepts, apply rules or principles, solve problems, and think creatively. Knowledge is
not directly observable. A person manifests knowledge through performing associated
overt activities. Also see Attitude and Skill.
Learning. A change in the behavior of the learner as a result of experience. The
behavior can be physical and overt, or it can be intellectual or attitudinal.

Lesson Plan. An approved plan for instruction that provides specific definition and
direction to the instructor on learning objectives, equipment, instructional media material
requirements, and conduct of training. Lesson plans are the principal component of
curriculum materials in that they sequence the presentation of learning experiences and
program the use of supporting instructional material.

Media. The delivery vehicle for presenting instructional material or basic
communication stimuli to a student to induce learning. Examples are instructors,
textbooks, slides, and interactive courseware (ICW).

Metrics. Measurement tools used for assessing the qualitative and quantitative
progress of instructional development with respect to the development standards
specified.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                          281




Motor Skill. Physical actions required to perform a specific task. All skills require some
type of action.

Norm-Referenced Test. The process of determining a student's achievement in
relation to other students. Grading "on the curve" involves norm-referenced
measurement since an individual's position
on the curve (grade) depends on the performance of other students. Generally, norm-
referenced measurement is not appropriate in the Air Force ISD process.

Objective. A statement that specifies precisely what behavior is to be exhibited, the
conditions under which behavior will be accomplished, and the minimum standard of
performance. Objectives describe only the behaviors that directly lead to or specifically
satisfy a job performance requirement. An objective is a statement of instructional
intent.

Operational Evaluation. The process of internal and external review of operational
training systems. It is designed to gather and analyze internal and external feedback
data to ensure that the system continues to effectively and cost-efficiently produce
graduates who meet established training requirements. It includes Internal Evaluation
and External Evaluation. Also see Evaluation.

Perceptual Skill. The process of information extraction; the process by which an
individual receives or extracts information from the environment through experiences
and assimilates this data as facts (sight, sound, feel, taste, smell).

Performance. Part of a criterion objective that describes the observable student
behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the instructor as proof
that learning has occurred.

Plan of Instruction (POI). A qualitative course control document designed for use
primarily within a school for course planning, organization, and operation. Generally,
criterion objectives, duration of instruction, support materials, and guidance factors are
listed for every block of instruction within a course. Also called Syllabus.

Posttest. A criterion-referenced test designed to measure performance on objectives
taught during a unit of instruction; given after the training.

Pretest. A criterion-referenced test designed to measure performance on objectives to
be taught during a unit of instruction and performance on entry behavior; given before
instruction begins.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 9        1 November 2002                                       282


Reliability. (a) A characteristic of evaluation which requires that testing instruments
yield consistent results. (b) The degree to which a test instrument can be expected to
yield the same result upon repeated administration to the same population. (c) The
capability of a device, equipment, or system to operate effectively for a period of time
without a failure or breakdown.

Sampling Test. A test that measures knowledge objectives and knowledge
components of performance objectives in sufficient quantity to provide an acceptable
degree of confidence that the students have attained the required knowledge.

Skill. The ability to perform a job-related activity that contributes to the effective
performance of a task. Skills involve physical or manipulative activities that often
require knowledge for their execution. All skills are actions having specific requirements
for speed, accuracy, or coordination. Also see Attitude and Knowledge.

Subject Matter Expert (SME). (a) An individual who has thorough knowledge of a job,
duties/tasks, or a particular topic, which qualifies him/her to assist in the training
development process (for example, to consult, review, analyze, advise, or critique). (b)
A person who has high-level knowledge and skill in the performance of a job.

Summative Evaluation. The overall assessment of a program at the completion of the
developmental process. It is designed and used after the instructional system has
become operational. Data gathered during this form of evaluation is used to determine
the effectiveness of the instructional system. It identifies how well the system is working
– that is, how well graduates can meet job performance requirements. Also see
Evaluation.

Syllabus. See Plan of Instruction.

System Approach to Training (SAT). Procedures used by instructional system
developers to develop instruction. Each phase requires input from the prior phase and
provides input to the next phase. Evaluation provides feedback that is used to revise
instruction. Also see Instructional System Development.

Target Audience. The total collection of possible users of a given instructional system.
The persons for whom the instructional system is designed.

Task. A unit of work activity or operation which forms a significant part of a duty. A
task usually has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or otherwise
measurable processes, frequently but not always resulting in a product that can be
evaluated for quantity, quality, accuracy, or fitness in the work environment. A task is
performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent upon other tasks, although it may
fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 9        1 November 2002                                        283


Task Analysis. The process of describing job tasks in terms of Job Performance
Requirements (JPR) and the process of analyzing these JPRs to determine training
requirements. Also see Job Performance Requirements.

Terminal Objective. An objective the learner is expected to accomplish upon
completion of the instruction. It is made up of enabling (support or subordinate)
objectives.

Training. A set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner,
through one or more media, for the attainment and retention of skills, knowledge, and
attitudes required to meet job performance requirements.

Training Needs Assessment (TNA). The study of performance and the environment
that influences it in order to make recommendations and decisions on how to close the
gap between the desired performance and the actual performance.

Training Planning Team. An action group composed of representatives from all
pertinent functional areas, disciplines, and interests involved in the life cycle design,
development, acquisition, support, modification, funding and management of a specific
defense training system.

Training Strategy. An overall plan of activities to achieve an instructional goal.

Training System. A systematically developed curriculum including, but not necessarily
limited to, courseware, classroom aids, training simulators and devices, operational
equipment, embedded training capability, and personnel to operate, maintain, or employ
a system. The training system includes all necessary elements of logistic support.

Utilization and Training Workshop. A forum to determine Specialty Training Standard
requirements and responsibilities for the specialty. Workshop attendees include, but
are not limited to, representatives from the training and using organizations.

Validation. The process of developmental testing, field testing, and revision of the
instruction to be certain the instructional intent is achieved. The instructional system is
developed unit by unit and tested (or validated) on the basis of the objective prepared
for each unit. Validation allows instructional designers to guarantee specific results.

Validity. The degree to which a criterion test actually measures what it is intended to
measure.
