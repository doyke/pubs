SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include deleted inpatient services and Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) Forms 3012,
Throat Worksheet and WHMC Form 5028, Microbiology Log.
1. Introduction.
     1.1. 59 MDTS Laboratory Flight Accreditation.          Clinical and Anatomical Laboratory
     support is accredited by the following agencies:
        1.1.1. The College of American Pathologists. Certification Number: 21422-01.
        1.1.2. The Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program
        (CLIP). Registration Number: DoD 7823601.
        1.1.3. The Food and Drug Administration. License Number: 610; Registration Number:
        1677552.
        1.1.4. The American Association of Blood Banks. Membership Number: 008035.
        1.1.5. Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). Certification
        Number: 93832.
     1.2. Point of Care Testing. To ensure the validity of results, AAAHC and CLIP have
     determined that laboratory tests performed by testing sites other than 59 MDTS Laboratory
     Flight must be done under the same guidelines, methodologies, controls, and procedure
     documentation as if they were performed by 59 MDTS Laboratory Flight. Refer to
     59MDWI44-103, Quality Assessment for Point of Care Testing for more information.
        1.2.1. New Point of Care Testing. Anyone wishing to establish Point of Care Testing
        must request the approval of the 59 MDTS Laboratory Medical Director, through the 59
        MDTS Laboratory Flight Quality Improvement Office (SGVLL). All approved or
        operational Point of Care Testing sites must be in compliance with 59MDWI 44-103.
     1.3. Laboratory Information Systems. The Laboratory Information System (LIS) is one
     component of the Composite Health Care System (CHCS). LIS/CHCS is an integrated
     health care system that provides order-processing, specimen processing and results
     management.
        1.3.1. LIS support for a particular patient is triggered by an order entered into the system.
        The system is designed for physician order entry, but will support order entry by other
        authorized users.
        1.3.2. Only certified results are electronically available to local Military Health System
        users outside of the laboratory. Certified results maintained in CHCS become available
        to authorized users who inquire via any CHCS terminal in the Wilford Hall Ambulatory
        and Surgical Center (WHASC) or outlying medical clinics. Users inquiring about
        laboratory results identify the patient, review a display of orders for the patient (in
        chronological order) and select the order(s) of interest.
        1.3.3. Outside Health Care Providers (HCPs). Outside HCPs must coordinate their
        request with the Laboratory Information Systems at 292-5459. To obtain results on
        patients that were ordered by an HCP different than the inquiring HCP/Clinic, the outside
59MDWI44-136 29 APRIL 2014                                                                      3


      HCP/clinic must contact the Release of Health Care Information Office at 210-292-
      5081/0284/2128.

3. Laboratory Handbook.
3.1. A comprehensive Laboratory Handbook including test panels for all sections of the lab,
special instructions, proper request procedures which includes specific test-related information is
available on the 59 MDW SharePoint, under Clinical, 59th Laboratory Squadron at
https://clinical.sammc-
eis.lackland.af.mil/59LSQ/Laboratory%20Handbook/Laboratory%20Guide.pdf and
https://kx.afms.mil/whmclab (Lab Guide) for external customers.
4. Test Requisition Form.
     4.1. Direct order entry must be accomplished before sending patients and/or specimens to
     the lab. In the event that CHCS is down, all test requests must be accompanied by a properly
     completed test requisition form 59 MDW Form 120, Standard Lab Request. The request
     form must be filled out by the requesting HCP, and sent to Laboratory Specimen Collection
     (first floor) or Central Operations Processing Laboratory (2G01A).
     4.2. For outpatient clinic(s) collected samples, the family member prefix, sponsor’s social
     security number, date of birth, sex, requesting location, requesting provider, provider’s
     contact (i.e. pager number), and the collection date/time are items that must be on the 59
     MDW Form 120 in order for the laboratory to process the request(s). If the outpatient is sent
     to the laboratory to be drawn, family member prefix, sponsor’s social security number, date
     of birth, sex, requesting location, requesting provider, and provider’s contact (i.e. pager
     number) are items that must be on the 59 MDW Form 120 in order for the laboratory to
     process the request(s). The tube station number is highly encouraged in case results need to
     be sent to the requesting HCP, [in the outpatient clinic], via the tube system during CHCS
     downtime. The HCP, in the outpatient clinic, must properly indicate the test(s) required by
     checking the adequate box from the options given. If a test needed is not one of the options
     provided, write it under the “Additional Test/Comments:” box. Enter therapeutic drugs in
     the “Additional Test/Comments:” box and circle RANDOM, PEAK, OR TROUGH
     accordingly. To determine the status of the request (Stat or Routine), check the appropriate
     box next to the test name; each test has a Stat or Routine option box next to it. If the Stat box
     is not available (box is black), the test is not orderable Stat. Most Chemistry tests may be
     collected either on a Green Top (Lithium Heparin) or Gold top (serum) tubes, but the
     laboratory prefers Green Top (Lithium Heparin) tubes. Any test marked with a specific color
     tube next to the test name must be collected in that specific color tube.
     4.3. All 59 MDW Form 120 forms processed by the laboratory will be kept in a secured area
     for two years. After the retention period expires, they will be discarded according to the
     records disposition schedule Table and Rule T 44 – 02 R 01.00.
5. Microbiology Forms.
     5.1. The Microbiology section will use 59 MDW Form 120, 59 MDW Form 3014,
     Respiratory Worksheet; 59 MDW Form 3016, Stool Worksheet; 59 MDW Form 3022,
     Aerobic Wound Cultures; 59 MDW Form 3055, Urine Worksheet; 59 MDW Form 3155,
     Blood Culture/CSF Worksheet; 59 MDW Form 5027, Anaerobic Worksheet; 59 MDW Form
     5029, R/O VIS/MRSA/B-STREP/VRE to track and record results of all specimens cultured in
     Microbiology. All mentioned forms fulfill the same purpose but are for different specimen
     types/cultures.
59MDWI44-136 29 APRIL 2014                                                                   5


   5.2. 59 MDW Forms 3014, 3016, 3022, 3055, 3061, 3062, 3155, 5027, and 5029 processed
   by the laboratory will be kept in a secured area for two years. After the retention period
   expires, they will be discarded according to the records disposition schedule Table and Rule
   T 44 – 02 R 01.00.
6. Legal Blood Alchohol Test (BAT) Form, 59 MDW Form 5071, Sobriety Determination
Report.
   6.1. 59 MDW Form 5071, will be used for all legal BATs requested for judicial and/or
   administrative actions. When a legal BAT is authorized the laboratory technician will
   complete Sections I, II, III, and IV. Contract personnel are not allowed to draw legal BATs.
   6.2. All laboratory testing of legal BATs will be performed at San Antonio Military Medical
   Center using 59 MDW Form 5071. All legal BAT results that are performed will be kept in a
   secured area for three years. After the retention period expires, they will be discarded
   according to the records disposition schedule Table and Rule T 44 – 02 R 01.00.
