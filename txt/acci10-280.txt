SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It must be reviewed concur-
rently with AFPD 10-28. This instruction establishes ACC policy to implement new United States Air
Force (USAF) policy on concept development. It provides additional guidance for the mandatory concept
elements in AFPD 10-28. The Directorate of Plans and Programs, Strategy, Concepts, and Doctrine Divi-
sion (HQ ACC/XPS) is designated the central point of contact for ACC concepts and will provide and
maintain a central web-based library for those concepts at.


1. ACC Concept Development Guidance:
   1.1. Definition. ACC concepts represent the ACC position as force provider on the planned/expected
   approach to deploy, employ, and redeploy for air power operations. ACC concepts guide ACC opera-
   tions planning, and how ACC organizes, trains, and equips to deliver ready forces with the capabilities
   desired by combatant commanders. They educate ACC and Combat Air Forces (CAF) personnel on
   the conceptual framework for how individual actions link together to accomplish an operational task.
   They provide a clear picture of how ACC intends to operate in the future.
   1.2. Concept Construct. Figure 1 depicts the relationship between vision, concepts, and doctrine.
   How the Air Force operates today is captured in doctrine which drives tactics, techniques, and proce-
2                                                                       ACCI10-280 5 JANUARY 2004


    dures (TTP). Notwithstanding that concepts can be historical or current, new concepts function to
    bridge the gap between how the AF employs forces and systems today and how it envisions future
    operations. The concept life cycle begins with a vision or idea of how to solve a military problem. The
    idea can take further shape in the form of a white paper or journal article. It becomes a concept when
    the vision is formalized to address the necessary elements of a concept. Concepts identify key technol-
    ogies, operational concepts, and organizational structures required to achieve future desired effects.
    Concepts are validated through wargaming, exercises and experimentation, lessons learned, and oper-
    ational experience. Validated concepts are incorporated in changes to doctrine or in TTPs.
    1.3. Development. ACC concept development is warranted by the need to describe how to perform an
    operational task. This need may be driven by: a capability shortfall identified through analysis, a lack
    of conceptual framework for an operational task where TTPs have not been established, or to encap-
    sulate operational experience applicable to maturing technologies/systems not captured in doctrine.
    ACC concepts may be used: to support capability-based planning; in support of exercises, experi-
    ments and wargames; as the basis for theater-specific campaign plans and operations plans; to support
    the Air Force resource allocation process; or to inform and educate a particular audience.
       1.3.1. Recommended Approach. In general, begin with the purpose which is driving you to
       develop a new concept. With that in view, state the military challenge, which is the problem to be
       solved by your concept. To ensure an effects-based approach, identify the desired outcomes
       (effects) that characterize success in meeting the challenge. The desired effects will guide the
       development of a course of action. The sequenced actions section is your solution. It should
       explain how military functions and capabilities will be applied in time and space and what actions
       and tasks will create the desired effects to meet the challenge. In the course of formulating a solu-
       tion, assumptions and risks tend to emerge which may not have been apparent beforehand. Write
       them down as you go. Now you can analyze your solution to derive the tasks and actions which
       must be performed to create the desired effects. The ability to perform those actions and tasks are
       necessary capabilities. Any remaining capabilities required to successfully execute the concept are
       enabling capabilities. Finish up with the synopsis and summary sections.
    1.4. Limitations:
       1.4.1. General. ACC concepts are not plans, TTPs, or technical orders (TO) but are broader in
       scope and may require more specific description in follow-on documents written by/for the user.
       Operating procedures for existing capabilities as well as organizational changes, implementation
       plans, and operating instructions are not considered concepts for the purposes of this instruction.
       Due to their broad nature, ACC concepts generally should not exceed 7-15 pages in length,
       excluding annexes.
       1.4.2. Acquisition. A concept is not intended to serve as a system requirements document, but
       systems will ultimately be justified and evaluated on the basis of the desired effects they generate
       and the capabilities they provide the warfighter. This instruction does not create a requirement for
       weapon systems concepts to be developed. Preferably, materiel solutions are created to satisfy
       capability shortfalls identified in higher-level operating or functional concepts, such as Air Force
       CONOPS, which have been validated through wargaming and experimentation. The concept for
       employing the capability may be sufficiently described in the existing operating or functional con-
       cept. Before undertaking concept development, offices of primary responsibility (OPR) should
       verify the requirement for greater specificity that will not be captured in initial capability docu-
ACCI10-280 5 JANUARY 2004                                                                                3


       ments (ICD), capability development documents (CDD), or capability production documents
       (CPD).

2. ACC Concept Format Guidance. ACC concepts will be formatted in accordance with AFPD 10-28
to standardize ACC implementation of the mandatory elements. Use the elements identified in paragraph
5 of AFPD 10-28 in the order they appear. Make any added headings subordinate to one of the mandatory
elements. Refer to AFPD 10-28 for descriptions of each element. Include the additional considerations
listed in this section in enabling concepts when applicable. Describe the overall concept without excessive
detail. Detailed and lengthy information (such as functional support plans) may be included in annexes as
required. A sample format with additional guidance is provided at Attachment 2.

3. Responsibilities. HQ ACC/XPS is the ACC point of contact (POC) for all concepts and office of col-
lateral responsibility (OCR) for ACC-developed concepts and is responsible for policy, guidance, proce-
dures, and oversight for concepts development within ACC.
   3.1. ACC Process--Tasking, Staffing, Approval, Publishing:
       3.1.1. Tasking. Commander, ACC (COMACC) is the authority for ACC-developed concepts. HQ
       ACC/XPS is the ACC central POC for all concepts. COMACC will originate or approve all
       requests for concept development. If an ACC directorate identifies a requirement for concept
       development and COMACC approves, the directorate will transmit a request for tasking to ACC/
       CS to include a recommended OPR. The tasking will specify the type of concept (ACC, CAF,
       USAF, or Joint). The directorate with functional responsibility will be the OPR for the concept.
       Tasking will flow from ACC/CS to the designated OPR for concept development. HQ ACC/XPS
       will be an OCR on all concepts developed within ACC.
       3.1.2. Staffing ACC-Developed Concepts. The action officer (AO) and OPR write and staff the
       document in accordance with established staffing procedures described in the ACC AO handbook.
       The AO may need coordination outside ACC, depending on the content and type of document.
       Outside agencies could include major commands (MAJCOM), numbered air forces (NAF), other
       services, wings, etc. CAF, MAF, and NAF coordination requests should come from COMACC.
       3.1.3. Approval. COMACC is the approval authority for ACC concepts and coordinates on all
       concepts developed within ACC. After COMACC approval/coordination, concepts are forwarded
       from ACC/CS to HQ USAF/XO.
       3.1.4. Publishing/Distribution. HQ ACC/XPS will maintain a web-based central file of ACC con-
       cepts at . The intent is to make these documents accessible and minimize distribution costs.
           3.1.4.1. After approval, the authoring directorate will electronically send two files, Microsoft
           Word© and Adobe Acrobat PDF versions, to HQ ACC/XPS at or acc.xps@lan-
           gley.af.smil.mil. The required index information for web posting is given in Table 1.

   A2.1.1. Purpose (5.1*). Include a purpose statement that lays out the intended uses of the concept. In
   addition to the purpose statement, identify the category of the concept using the definitions in AFPD
   10-28. ACC concepts will usually be enabling concepts since they will normally not encompass the
   full scope of military actions required to achieve joint force commander (JFC) objectives. Identify any
   hierarchical relationship to existing USAF, ACC, CAF, Mobility Air Forces (MAF), or joint concepts.
   A2.1.2. Time Horizon, Assumptions, and Risks (5.2*). Specify the applicable time period, critical
   assumptions that establish the limits of the concept, and applicable risks that influence further concept
   development and execution. Reference AFPD 10-28.
   A2.1.3. Description of the Military Challenge (5.3*). A future concept must include a description of
   the military challenge the concept is meant to solve. The problem to be solved should include any pos-
   sible ground threat and related physical security concerns. The problem statement may also highlight
   a deficiency in a system, structure, architecture, etc., or the desired deployment/employment defini-
   tion of a new or revised system or organization.
