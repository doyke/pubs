     1.5. Unit Fitness Leaders will:
        1.5.1. Consider conducting physical training (PT) indoors when severe environmental
        conditions exist. Refer to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2905, Fitness Program,
        paragraph A3.4 “Prevention of Injury and Illness” for environmental conditions
        limiting PT activities.
        1.5.2. Retrieve the heat stress index from the ―Kirtland General Announcement Bulletin
        Board‖ https://kc4portal/sites/kirtlandafb/default.aspx, prior to conducting PT.
     1.6. Supervisors will:
        1.6.1. Routinely retrieve the heat stress index from the Kirtland General Announcement
        Bulletin Board https://kc4portal/sites/kirtlandafb/default.aspx, and implement thermal
        stress safety procedures accordingly. Work center supervisors may have to adjust the
        work-rest cycles for operations that require heavy personal protective equipment.
        1.6.2. Ensure employees working outside in hot environments increase their fluid intake,
        and implement appropriate work-rest cycles, reference Attachment 3.
        1.6.3. Ensure all employees are trained to recognize thermal stress disorders and first aid
        treatment, reference Attachment 4.
KAFBI48-151 29 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                   3


      1.6.4. Ensure employees are acclimatized in accordance with paragraph 3.
      1.6.5. Report all thermal stress illnesses to 377 AMDS/SGPM at DSN 246-3461 or
      commercial (505) 846-3461.
   1.7. Work center employees will:
      1.7.1. Understand the signs and symptoms of thermal stress, and the associated first aid
      treatments.
      1.7.2. Report all thermal stress illnesses to the work center’s supervisor.
2. Monitoring Heat Stress.
   2.1. BEE will routinely monitor heat stress index during the summer months. The summer
   monitoring period will begin 1 May and end 30 September. The summer monitoring period
   may be increased or decreased based on seasonal variations.
   2.2. When the predicted or forecasted outside temperatures reach 850F as a daily high, BEE
   will perform heat stress monitoring at hourly intervals beginning at 1100hrs until 1400hrs or
   until the WBGT drops below a ―Yellow Flag‖ condition, whichever is later.
   2.3. The heat stress index is a tool to provide guidance to workplace supervisors in order to
   reduce heat stress injuries. An indoor measurement of the heat stress index should used
   instead of the outdoor measurement for hot indoor operations.
   2.4. On weekends and non-duty hours, the Photovoltaic Systems Evaluation Laboratory at
   Sandia National Laboratories maintains a website with the WBGT when the ambient
   temperature is above 70o F at: http://photovoltaics.sandia.gov/weather/Weather.htm.
3. Acclimatization.
   3.1. Acclimatization is a series of physiological adjustments, which occur when an
   individual is exposed to a hot or cold climate. A period of acclimatization is required for all
   personnel regardless of each individual’s physical condition. The better the individual’s
   physical condition, the quicker acclimatization is reached. Acclimatization is achieved
   through progressive degrees of heat exposure and physical exertion. Acclimatization to heat
   begins with the first exposure and is usually developed to about 50% by the end of the first
   week. Substantial acclimatization (about 78%) should occur by the end of the second week.
   Full acclimatization is attained quickest by gradually increasing period of work in the heat.
   3.2. For personnel needing acclimatization (see paragraph 3.3.), supervisors should adjust
   work schedules. The most strenuous tasks should be performed early in the morning or late
   in the evening, with lighter duty tasks performed during the remainder of the duty day. As
   personnel become acclimatized, work schedules can be shifted back to normal routines.
   When un-acclimated personnel are exposed to heat, they may experience some discomfort
   and signs of heat strain, such as high body temperature, increased heart rate and fatigue on
   the first day. On each succeeding day, personnel’s ability to perform at the same level of
   heat stress improves as signs of discomfort and strain diminish. During the two weeks it
   takes to acclimatize, personnel should be especially aware of the signs and symptoms of heat
   stress disorders and drink plenty of water. When discomfort and heat stress symptoms occur,
   personnel should self-pace their activities to perform below maximum physical capacity by
4                                                       KAFBI48-151 29 SEPTEMBER 2011


    adjusting their work speed and interspersing brief, unscheduled and in-place breaks. After a
    period of one to two weeks, personnel should be able to perform all tasks without difficulty.
    3.3. The following applies to personnel who need acclimatization:
       3.3.1. Individuals who are routinely and occupationally exposed to strenuous duties or
       heavy work need acclimatization each year. This may occur during regular duty or work
       as outside temperatures increase during the spring and summer.
       3.3.2. Newly assigned personnel arriving from cooler climates should follow the
       acclimatization guidelines given above.
       3.3.3. Personnel returning to work after four days of illness should undergo a four-day
       re-acclimatization.
       3.3.4. Personnel returning to work after nine or more days away from work should
       undergo a four-day re-acclimatization.

Terms
Acclimatization—A series of physiological adjustments, which occur when an individual is
exposed to a hot or cold climate. In simple terms, this is considered a break-in period to help
personnel slowly adjust to hot and cold environments.
Heat Stress—The net heat load to which a worker may be exposed from the combined
contributions of metabolic cost of work, environmental factors (air temperature, humidity, air
movement, etc.) and clothing. In simple terms, heat stress is the body burden from these three
categories above.
Thermal Stress—The common term used to cover both heat and cold stress.
Work/Rest Cycle—A guidance schedule for personnel to ensure adequate rest breaks are taken
to avoid heat stress disorders.

A3.1. Permissible Heat Exposure Limits. The permissible heat exposure limits are extracted
from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value
booklet. The limits in the table below are based on the following assumptions.
     A3.1.1. Personnel are assumed to be acclimated, fully clothed, with average water and salt
     intake.
     A3.1.2. Personnel can take breaks to prevent becoming overheated.
     A3.1.3. Exposure limits are based on personnel working in normal work clothing.
        A3.1.3.1. Continuous Work = No work restrictions.
        A3.1.3.2. 25% rest = 15 minute rest each hour.
        A3.1.3.3. 50% rest = 30 minute rest each hour.
        A3.1.3.4. 75% rest = 45 minute rest each hour

A3.2. Personal Protective Equipment Adjustment: Personnel required to wear heavy personal
protective equipment (e.g., disposable coveralls, respiratory protection, etc.) during normal work
center processes have an increase potential for heat stress. Supervisors of personnel who require
heavy personal protective equipment should contact 377 AMDS/SGPB, 6-4259, to identify the
appropriate correction factors to Table 2.
A3.3. Prevention of Heat Stress Disorders:
   A3.3.1. Education.   Personnel working and/or training in hot environments must be
   educated on the causes, symptoms, first-aid treatments and prevention of heat disorders.
   Personnel must also be educated on the following factors, which may contribute to heat
   injury.
   A3.3.2. Water. Drink large quantities of cool water to make up for water lost through
   sweating. It is better to drink small amounts of water frequently (a pint every 20 minutes) to
   replace water than to drink large amounts less frequently. Milk and coffee do not make up
   for water loss. Carbonated beverages, while containing water, are not as effective as water
   in keeping the body hydrated because of the tendency to delay gastric emptying.
   A3.3.3. Salt. Some salt is lost in the sweat. Because the typical North American diet
   contains so much salt, an individual should season food to taste, but should not make any
   additional attempts to add excessive salt to the diet. Salt tablets must not be used except
   under special operating environments when ordered by competent medical authority.
   A3.3.4. Clothing. Wear loose fitting clothing, especially at the neck and wrist, to allow air
   circulation. Wear appropriate headgear. When exposed to the Sun’s rays, cover yourself
   and apply a sun-blocking lotion to prevent sunburn.         When not exposed to the sun,
   consideration should be given to wearing the least allowable amount of clothing.
   A3.3.5. Acclimatization. Personnel must be acclimated to heat exposures. See paragraph
   3.
   A3.3.6. Work Schedules. Modify work schedules to perform the heaviest work in the
   coolest parts of the day. When working in hot environments, establish work and rest cycles
