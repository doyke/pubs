                          MILITARY PERSONNEL RECORDS SYSTEM

1.1. System Description. The military personnel record is the document keeping method used to main-
tain the military service chronicle of each person. It includes building new records and keeping records at
all levels. The records consist of:
   1.1.1. Field Record Group (FRGp).
   1.1.2. Officer Command Selection Record Group (OCSRGp) or Airman Command Record Group
   (ACRGp).
   1.1.3. Master Personnel Record Group (MPerRGp).
   1.1.4. Officer Selection Record (OSR).

1.2. System Objectives. The purpose of the system is to:
   1.2.1. Maintain personnel documents to protect the legal and financial rights of the government and
   the individual and to record the history of the person’s service.
   1.2.2. Support personnel managers, commanders, and supervisors as they manage Air Force person-
   nel.
   1.2.3. Maintain documents to support the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS).
   1.2.4. Provide procedures for managing records.

1.3. Creating the Field Record Group (FRGp):
   1.3.1. AF Form 10, Unit Personnel Record Folder. Make the folder as follows:
       1.3.1.1. Officers. The first permanent change of station (PCS) or temporary duty (TDY) unit or
       agency that processes the officer onto EAD, active Reserve, or Guard status, whichever occurs
       first, establishes the AF Form 10.
       1.3.1.2. Enlisted. The first MPF servicing the person initiates the AF Form 10.
   1.3.2. Health Record Group. This record is the AF Form 2100 series, (AF Form 2100A, Health
   Record - Outpatient (Orange) (For use by USAF Medical Treatment Facilities ONLY) and 2100B,
   Health Record - Dental (Orange) (For use by USAF Medical Treatment Facilities ONLY). The first
   medical facility that services the member establishes the Health Record.
   1.3.3. Personal Clothing and Equipment Record Group. The Base Equipment Management Office
   (BEMO or EMO) keeps this record.
   1.3.4. Placement and Custody of the FRGp. See Table A3.1.

1.4. Creating the Command Record Group (CMRGp) Maintain IAW AFRDS Table 36-12, Rule
01.01:
   1.4.1. Officer Command Selection Record Group (OCSRGp). CMRGp custodians (see Table
   A3.2., Note 2) initiate the OCSRGp, utilizing the AF Form 10A, Personnel Information File,
   Record of Performance: Officer Command Selection Record Group, when they receive docu-
8                                                                      AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006


    ments for file. Custodians are required to make the OCSRGp for most line of the Air Force (LAF)
    officers in grade of captain when they complete 7 years of active commissioned service (based on the
    EAD), 4 years for Air National Guard (ANG) computed from promotion service date (PSD), and for
    non-line officers upon promotion to grade of captain. MPFs will provide custodians with copies of all
    performance and training reports contained in the UPRG to create the OCSRGp. Attachment 2, Col-
    umn C, by code "OCSR" identifies the documents kept in this record.
       1.4.1.1. Custodians must make records of performance (ROPs) available to support Management
       Level Reviews (MLR) prescribed by AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, and
       other boards and requests as applicable. The ROP at base level will also be set up using the AF
       Form 10A.
    1.4.2. Airman Command Record Group (ACRGp). This record has “Statements of Disagreement”
    (see paragraph 2.21.) for enlisted personnel and is required to be made only when the custodian
    receives a dispute statement processed IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program.
    1.4.3. CMRGp record custodians, designated by position, will set up and enforce administrative pro-
    cedures and physical safeguards for the OCSRGp and ACRGp.
    1.4.4. See Table A3.2. for placement and custody of the CMRGp.

1.5. Creating the MPerRGp. A document in the MPerRGp may be the original or the designated copy,
and may be the only existing copy. Clear, distinct, and legible documents must be sent to either HQ
ARPC or the Records Imaging Section (HQ AFPC/DPSOM) for processing into the Automated Records
Management System (ARMS), which is now a part of the MPerRGp. Each document must contain a
complete social security number. Master personnel record documents may consist of paper, microfiche,
or electronic media. Use AF Form 170, Master Personnel Record (MPerR) (Microfiche Jacket), to
transmit the microfiche MPerR.
    1.5.1. Officer MPerRGp. HQ AFPC or Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) creates this record,
    consisting of two parts, when they receive the first documents on the member who receives a commis-
    sion. HQ United States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), or ARPC maintains
    the MPerRGp while the officer has a military status.
       1.5.1.1. Officer, HQ USAF Selection Record (OSR) Group. This record is kept in paper, micro-
       fiche, or electronic media. Attachment 2, Column D, by code "OSR" identifies the documents
       kept in this record.
       1.5.1.2. Officer Correspondence and Miscellaneous Record Group (CM). This record is main-
       tained on microfiche or electronic media. HQ AFPC/DPSOM determines where to assign autho-
       rized documents on the microfiche or electronic media record. Attachment 2, column D, by code
       "CM" identifies the documents kept in this record.
    1.5.2. Enlisted MPerRGp. HQ AFPC or ARPC initiates this record, consisting of two parts, when
    they receive valid enlistment documents.
       1.5.2.1. NSR. HQ AFPC maintains this paper record copy on active duty master sergeants, senior
       master sergeants, and chief master sergeants.
       1.5.2.2. Enlisted Command Record Group. HQ AFPC or ARPC maintains this record on all
       enlisted members on microfiche or electronic media.
AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                             9


   1.5.3. General Officer Selection Record. Air Force Senior Leadership Management Office (AFS-
   LMO) creates and maintains this record when a colonel is selected for promotion to brigadier general.
   1.5.4. MPerRGp record custodians, designated by position, will set up and enforce administrative
   procedures and physical safeguards for the MPerRGp.
   1.5.5. See Table A3.1. for placement and custody of the MPerRGp.

1.6. Records Disposition. Maintain and dispose of all records created by processes prescribed in this
publication IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule (https://afrims.amc.af.mil).

AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                               11


2.3. Management Controls.
   2.3.1. Storage. Record custodians must secure records in a locked area or container when access is
   not under the direct control of a person.
   2.3.2. Disposal. Dispose of documents as provided in AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures
   and Responsibilities. Comply with reporting instructions in AFI 37-138 for records destroyed under
   conditions in Title 44, U.S.C.; Section 3311 (state of war or threatened war).
   2.3.3. Maintenance. Record custodians must set up and enforce administrative and physical safe-
   guards for the UPRGs. Situations differ at each installation and the record custodian must be familiar
   with local needs in determining what controls are necessary and practical. Written guidelines that
   have the approval of the Mission Support Commander (or equivalent) are encouraged.
       2.3.3.1. Military personnel records are "For Official Use Only." DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air
       Force Supplement, DoD Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program, AFI 33-332 and Chap-
       ter 7 of this instruction govern access to these records.

       for disclosing information in unclassified military personnel records.
       2.3.3.3. Refer to AFI 31-401 for access to and disclosure of classified military personnel records.
   2.3.4. Unauthorized Disposal. Record custodians will ensure personnel who are authorized to use
   military personnel records are aware that the concealment, removal, mutilation, or destruction of
   records or documents may be a criminal offense under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 2071 and Article 134,
   Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
   2.3.5. Penalties. Record custodians will inform users that the Privacy Act of l974 (Title 5, U.S.C.,
   Section 552a) provides for criminal penalties against anyone who discloses information to unautho-
   rized persons. Anyone who obtains information about an individual under false pretenses may also be
   subject to criminal penalties enforceable under Article 134, UCMJ.

2.4. Preparing the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Selection Record (NSR). The MPF Customer
Service element prepares the selection record immediately after the data verification process when a
member is selected for promotion to master sergeant. Use the light green letter-sized pressboard folders.
Place a label with the person's last name, first name, middle initial followed by the SSN on the bottom
right-hand corner of the folder's tab. Forward all prepared records to HQ AFPC/PBR, 550 C Street West,
Suite 5, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4707 not earlier than the member’s effective date of promotion and not
later than 30 calendar days after the member’s effective date of promotion to master sergeant, except
when conditions in paragraph 2.4.2.1. exist.
   2.4.1. Required Documents:
       2.4.1.1. All Enlisted Performance Reports (EPRs/APRs). Place original reports on the right side
       of the folder. Arrange in chronological sequence with the most recent report on top. Career

       gaps in dates according to AFI 36-2406.
       2.4.1.2. Citations for Decorations. Place citations for all awarded decorations listed in AFI
       36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program, on the left side of the folder. Arrange
       them in order of precedence with the highest-ranking decoration on top. For multiple awards of
12                                                                       AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006


        the same decoration, arrange in chronological sequence with the most recent on top. If a citation
        is missing, use a copy of the special order that awarded the decoration.
        2.4.1.3. Article 15. Place Articles 15 received after promotion to master sergeant in the NSR (see
        Chapter 8).
     2.4.2. Review of Selection Record. Individuals will review the NSR before it is forwarded to AFPC.
     After the member reviews the NSR, have the member sign and date the folder on the inside lower
     left-hand corner.
        2.4.2.1. For personnel assigned to a GSU, send a copy of the selection record and suspense a rea-
        sonable time for return. Have them sign and date the folder and return it to you.

            2.4.2.2.1. Does not report for two scheduled reviews.
            2.4.2.2.2. Is assigned to a GSU and fails to sign and/or return the record.
            2.4.2.2.3. Is on leave or TDY and will not return within 120 days.
            2.4.2.2.4. Is in the hospital.
        2.4.2.3. If the record custodian signs the folder, place the following remarks on the inside lower
        left-hand corner of the folder:
            2.4.2.3.1. Date of the scheduled review.
            2.4.2.3.2. Reason why the member failed to review record.
            2.4.2.3.3. Custodian's signature, grade, and date signed.
     2.4.3. HQ AFPC/PB and AFSLMO/CG maintain and keep the NSR current.

2.5. Record and Data Review Procedures. Personnel will receive an email notification on their birth-
day advising them to review the Records Review Application in vMPF.
     2.5.1. Individual Data Review Listing (IDRL). The CSS or MPF automatically produces the IDRL
     on the anniversary of the member’s date arrived station or at any time upon a member’s request. A
     copy of the IDRL is sent to the member for review. If changes are required, member should include a
     source document to substantiate the change. After verification of information, the CSS or MPF will
     update any valid changes to the RIP.
     2.5.2. ANG/USAFR Point Credit Summary. This is a computer-generated form for members in the
     ANG and USAFR including those serving on extended active duty (EAD) under Title 10, U.S.C., Sec-
     tions 10301, 10211, 12301(d), 12310, 10305, 8038 or Title 32, U.S.C., Section 708.
     2.5.3. National Guard Bureau (NGB) Form 22, Worksheet. MPF/Personnel Relocation uses NGB
     Form 22 according to AFCSM 36-699, Vol. 1.
     2.5.4. Medical and Dental Record Inventory. Personnel Employment verifies receipt of medical and
     dental records from the AF IMT 330, Records Transmittal Request, during in-processing.
     2.5.5. Record Reconciliation Audit Procedures (USAFR MPF). The Records Review Listing (RRL)
     is automatically produced to support the record reconciliation audit program. The RRL used during
     in-processing is produced 30 days after the date assigned to the MPF and after the record status
AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                            13


   changes to 110 (excludes Non-Prior Service [NPS] members awaiting initial active duty for training
   [IADT]). The RRL used for the 2-year mail-out audit is automatically produced 2 years minus 1
   month from date assigned to the MPF. Detailed procedures for using the RRL are explained below:
       2.5.5.1. Do a complete record audit when requested by a member or each time a change in servic-
       ing MPF occurs. Conduct record audits for Category Reserve members in two steps. Step one
       requires a check of required source documents filed in the UPRG against MilPDS data. Step two
       requires review by the member either in a face-to-face situation or sending the RRL to the member
       for review.
   2.5.6. In-Processing Record Reconciliation Audit. Conduct a face-to-face record audit for all person-
   nel during in-processing. Verify each item on the RRL from appropriate source documents or the
   member. Additional Requirements. When you conduct a face-to-face review, always verify the accu-
   racy of DD Form 1172, Application for Uniformed Services Identification Card DEERS Enroll-
   ment (if appropriate), and VASGLV Form 8286, Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Election
   and Certificate.
   2.5.7. Upon receipt of UPRGs on newly assigned participating individual Reservists, review for accu-
   racy all forms maintained in Section 1 of the UPRG. If a discrepancy exists, forward a letter to the
   member requesting he/she visit the nearest MPF to reaccomplish any of the forms listed in this sec-
   tion.

2.6. Loss of a Major Record Group or Subgroup. In the event that a major record group or subgroup
is lost or destroyed, the custodian, as shown in Chapter 1, will be responsible for recreating the docu-
ments necessary for maintaining the accuracy of the Military Personnel Records System.
   2.6.1. FRGp Reconstruction. The MPF record custodian will request an RRL, have the member
   review and sign the RRL during a reconstruction, and file it in the new UPRG. Do not prepare source
   documents to support data on the RRL unless needed or the individual does not agree with the data
   item. Request the individual to provide copies of source documents whenever possible.
       2.6.1.1. For participating individual Reservists, HQ ARPC/FMFOP will reconstruct the UPRGp
       for incoming Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) assignments that have not been received
       for in-processing. As a minimum, the UPRGp will contain a copy of the assignment order.
   2.6.2. OCSRGp Reconstruction. Send requests for command selection record documents to HQ
   AFPC/PBR1, 550 C Street West, Suite 5, Randolph AFB TX 78l50-4707. For Reserve and ANG
   members not on EAD, send requests for command selection documents to HQ ARPC/DPBR1, 6760
   East Irvington Place, #2000, Denver CO 80280-2000.
   2.6.3. MPerRGp. The Contingency Operations Plan provides that the MPerRGp be reconstructed due
   to loss through war or natural disaster. When required, AFPC will send a message giving instructions
   to appropriate record custodians for recovering each category of documents.

2.7. Document Requirements. Any questions relating to the filing, removal, or disposition of any docu-
ments in the Military Personnel Record System not covered in this instruction should be brought to the
attention of the OPR listed in Attachment 2, Column A. Documents and forms that become obsolete,
re-titled, renumbered, or replaced remain in the record folder until normal disposition as shown in

2.8. Documents Maintained by Other Activities. Relocatable documents are identified in Attachment
2, Column B, by the code "UP-R." Do not file these documents in the UPRG; Column E states where
these documents will be filed.

2.9. Transitory Documents. Managers may place transitory documents in the record groups when they
will aid in the administration of records and assist the custodians in performing their duties. MAJ-
COM-developed forms may remain in the record group during intracommand reassignment. Remove all
transitory documentation upon transfer of the record group to another MAJCOM.

2.10. Managing Individual Documents. Attachment 2 identifies where to file authorized documents in
records. Attachment 1 explains the codes used in columns B, C, and D.
     2.10.1. Temporary Documents. Temporary documents are removed from records when filing
     replacements, when they become obsolete, or when a requirement exists to screen or review the
     UPRG. However, for exceptions check Attachment 2, Column E. Temporary documents no longer
     required should be returned to the member whenever possible.
     2.10.2. Permanent Documents. These documents are retained in the record groups until the member
     separates or retires. Those documents not contained in the MPerRGp are forwarded to AFPC or
     ARPC, as applicable.
     2.10.3. Lost or Misfiled Documents. When missing or misfiled documents on active duty members
     are located, file them in the appropriate record or send them to the proper custodian. Forward perma-
     nent documents on separated members to HQ AFPC/DPSOM or HQ ARPC/DPSR, as applicable. In
     the case of separated members, temporary documents may be destroyed IAW with AF Records Dispo-
     sition Schedule (https://afrims.amc.af.mil).

2.11. Records Screening Procedures. Table A5.4 illustrates how to screen records.

2.12. Procedures Relative to Service Status. When an individual with prior service duty enlists in the
Regular Air Force (RegAF), HQ AFPC/DPPAOR obtains all records pertaining to the prior service and
completes an AF Form 1613, Statement of Service, showing all creditable service-to-date. HQ AFPC/
DPPAOR will transmit the AF Form 1613, along with EPRs, decoration orders, citations, medical and
dental records, to the servicing MPF to build the FRGp. MPFs should not request these documents until
120 calendar days from date the record status becomes “Present for Duty” (record status code 10).
     2.12.1. When a prior service individual enlists in the USAFR or ANG, HQ ARPC/DPSRP requests
     the prior service records or statement of service from the appropriate branch of service and forwards
     the FRGp to the servicing MPF.
     2.12.2. When an individual who previously served on EAD as an USAF officer then enlists in the
     RegAF within 120 days, HQ AFPC/DPPAOR obtains the officer records from HQ AFPC/DPSOMR,
     the office responsible for maintaining these records. HQ AFPC/DPPAOR sends an AF Form 1613,
     medical and dental records, copies of all decorations, and orders, as well as of any other documents in
     the officer record necessary for the management of records at base level, to the servicing MPF.
     2.12.3. OTS/22TSS/DPM initiates the FRGp for officers commissioned through Officer Training
     School (OTS).

     of the Chief of Staff, USAF."
     2.22.7. Board actions taken by the BCMR under AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board For Correction of
     Military Records, will be in the following format: "Report for this period not available for administra-
     tive reasons which were not the fault of the member.”

2.23. War and Mobilization Military Personnel Records System Procedures. During contingency or
emergency conditions, certain procedures must be implemented to ensure integrity of the military person-
nel records system and to streamline procedures to meet mission requirements.
     2.23.1. Record custodians will develop local procedures to destroy the UPRGs and Command
     Records in their custody IAW AF Records Scheduled Disposition (https://afrims.amc.af.mil) if secu-
     rity of the UPRGs is jeopardized and it is not feasible to relocate the records. If it becomes necessary
     to destroy or relocate the UPRGs, notify HQ AFPC/DPSOM as soon as possible.
     2.23.2. If UPRGs are destroyed IAW AF Records Scheduled Disposition, or are otherwise unavail-
     able, and the situation allows for maintenance of UPRGs to resume, establish an Emergency Person-
     nel Record to record significant personnel actions as follows:
        2.23.2.1. On whatever type of folder available, type or print the person's last name, first name,
        middle initial, and SSN.
        2.23.2.2. Place an Emergency Military Personnel Record (figure A4.5) in the folder. This form
        should contain the member's name, grade, SSN, present address, home phone number, PAFSC,
        date prepared and by whom.
        2.23.2.3. Record only personnel actions that do not have source documents available for place-
        ment in the Emergency Personnel Record under Personnel Actions.
        2.23.2.4. When feasible, prepare and maintain personnel actions on micro or mini computers to
        make records easier to manage, store, or transfer.
        2.23.2.5. Maintain until the situation allows for reconstruction of the UPRG and normal mainte-
        nance resumes.
AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                       19


  2.23.3. Record and data review programs are not considered essential during these conditions. The
  MPF chief or ANG Director of Personnel determines when to suspend these programs. Reinstate
  them when conditions cease.
  2.23.4. The Emergency Action Book contains specific guidance on the above procedure.
20                                                                        AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006

                           RELATED ACCESSION DOCUMENTS

3.1. General Information. This chapter tells how to use and forward DD Form 220, Active Duty
Report, and AF Form 1299, Officers Certificate of Statement of Service. The instructions are only for
ANG and USAFR members coming on EAD (including active duty under Titles 10 and 32 U.S.C.) when
strength accountability changes. MPF Personnel Employment forwards these and associated documents
as prescribed in the following paragraphs to AFPC within 10 workdays after member processes on sta-
tion. Mark envelopes "Do Not Open In Mailroom."

3.2. DD Form 220 Purpose. Use this form to record the date USAFR or ANG personnel come on EAD
and report to the first EAD processing station. It is used as a source document to compute active service
dates. It is not required for USAFR or ANG members ordered to AD during contingency or emergency
mobilization call-ups.

3.3. Preparing DD Form 220. The TDY or PCS MPF, Personnel Employment element, will process this
form when processing members to EAD:
     3.3.1. Preparation is not required for USAFR or ANG personnel processed to EAD by a permanent
     duty MPF. However, the permanent MPF Personnel Employment element will forward a legible copy
     of the member's travel voucher to HQ AFPC/DPPAOR, 550 C Street West, Suite 10, Randolph AFB
     TX 78l50-4712.
     3.3.2. Prepare in two copies for USAFR personnel and three copies for ANG personnel.
     3.3.3. Type the member's complete itinerary on the reverse side of the DD Form 220.
     3.3.4. Forward the original with the member's itinerary on the reverse side to HQ AFPC/DPPAOR,
     550 C Street West, Suite 10, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4712.
     3.3.5. Give a copy to the member.
     3.3.6. For ANG personnel, send the third copy to the appropriate adjutant general.
NOTE: When the member enters EAD, complete items 1 - 8, 10, 11, 13, and 19. When submitting an
itinerary, include date and place of departure and arrival and all modes of transportation from home of
record to TDY station (ensure member dates and signs the itinerary). Special instructions include:
        3.3.6.1. Item 10: Enter date member started travel as reflected on DD Form 1351-2. If this date
        is different from that on the orders, comply with paragraph 3.4.
        3.3.6.2. Item 11: Enter the date the member physically reports at the initial duty or processing sta-
        tion or effective date of duty shown on EAD orders, whichever is later. If this date differs from
        that of the orders, comply with paragraph 3.5. This date can not be earlier than item 6.
        3.3.6.3. Item 15: Complete this item only for nonparticipating Reservists; for example, Individual
        Ready Reserve and Retired Regulars.

   TX 78l50-4712.

3.4. Determining EAD Date. Use the date shown on the EAD order for members ordered to EAD while
at a duty station.
   3.4.1. The date for members who must travel from their homes to their first duty or processing station
   is based on the mode of travel. To find it, subtract the travel time allowed from the actual reporting
   date. (See Department of Defense Pay and Allowance Manual and Joint Federal Travel Regulations,
   Vol. 1, to compute travel time.)
   3.4.2. The EAD date may be any date between the effective date of the orders and the actual reporting
   date. The EAD date can never be before the effective date specified in the EAD order.

3.5. AF Form 1299, Officer’s Certificate of Statement of Service. The MPF Career Enhancement ele-
ment assists officers entering on EAD in preparing this form. This form is used to establish the initial pay
date and total active federal military service date (TAFMSD) for Defense Joint Military System (DJMS)
accession transactions on members entering EAD. Do not use AF Form 1299 for officers being mobi-
lized.
   3.5.1. MPF Career Enhancement element will:

         HANDLING COMMANDER’S OR SUPERVISOR’S ASSIGNED PERSONNEL
                        INFORMATION FILES (PIF)

4.1. General Information. These files are maintained and kept under authority of Title 10, U.S.C., Sec-
tion 8013, and solely by offices or levels of command where there is a requirement for them in the perfor-
mance of day-to-day business. PIFs must be set up using the AF Form 10A, kept up to date, correct in
content, and safeguarded to ensure the PIF is not misused or that unauthorized access occurs.

4.2. Record Content. Effective 1 February 1996, PIFs are mandatory for officers who receive Letters of
Admonishment or Letters of Counseling which are not filed in their Unfavorable Information File (UIF).
At the discretion of the Unit Commander, any document relating to the member at the unit level should be
maintained in the PIF. Some examples of documents to file in the PIF are separation actions, newcomer’s
letters, line-of-duty determinations, assignment and sponsorship correspondence, local clearance actions,
promotion actions, credit information, favorable or unfavorable correspondence not filed in the UIF,
counseling records, appointment scheduling correspondence, additional duties and duty roster informa-
tion, duty status correspondence, personnel actions correspondence, and participation or training informa-
tion on ARC personnel. Enlisted Performance Reports/Officer Performance Reports cannot be
maintained in the PIF.

4.3. Record Storage. Keep records in a locked area or container, except when being used.

4.4. Record Access. The member may gain access to their PIF at any time per AFI 33-332. The PIF con-
tents must be available for commanders, raters, first sergeants, senior raters, OSI, and Staff Judge Advo-
cate personnel as warranted. The release and review of the PIF contents in these instances are for
“Official Business” or “routine use” in accordance with AFI 33-332.

4.5. Retaining and Disposing. Guidance provided in IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule (T36-12,
Rule 2) (https://afrims.amc.af.mil).

                                                Chapter 5

                  RECORDING AND CHANGING BASIC IDENTIFYING DATA

5.1. General Information. The SSN serves as the numerical identifier for all Air Force military person-
nel. The Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) also uses it for reporting contributions withheld
from members under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). Executive Order 9397, 22 Novem-
ber l943, requires disclosure of one’s SSN to enter the Air Force. Applicants for appointment or enlist-
ment in the Air Force must obtain SSN cards. The SSN is entered on all records requiring a numerical
identifier:
   5.1.1. For input into the MilPDS, enter it as an eleven character number, with a hyphen after the third
   and fifth digits; for example, 123-45-6789.

5.2. Replacing the SSN Card. The MPF Customer Service element will assist the member in filling out
all items on SS Form 5, Application for a Social Security Card.

5.3. Resolving SSN Discrepancies. If the number on a member’s SSN card is incorrect, the MPF Cus-
tomer Service element will follow the directions in Table A7.1. to resolve the issue.

5.4. Recording and Changing Name in Official Records. Air Force military personnel records use the
name shown on a birth, baptismal, marriage, or naturalization certificate, civil court order, or other legal
document.
   5.4.1. The name that appears on the appointment memorandum or DD Form 4/1 and DD Form 4/2, is
   the official name in Air Force files until changed under this instruction.
   5.4.2. Record the name in order of last name, first name, middle initial or middle name, and any des-
   ignation, such as “Junior, Senior” or a numerical designator. Exceptions are documents whose gov-
   erning directives require the full name.
       5.4.2.1. Example, Stephen Maxwell Smith is normally recorded as “Smith, Stephen M.” At his
       request, however, record the name as “Smith, Stephen Maxwell.
       5.4.2.2. Abbreviate designations such as “Jr.” for “Junior.”
   5.4.3. When entering the name into PC-III or MilPDS, do not include hyphens, apostrophes, or spaces
   between sections of a compound name. The name “David E. O’Brien,” for example, will be reflected
   in the MiLPDS as OBRIEN, DAVID E.” “Teresa M. Santa Ana” will be “SANTAANA TERESA M”;
   “Lee Halsey-Jones” will be HALSEYJONES LEE.”
   5.4.4. Names typed or written on forms and documents will be written to reflect any hyphens, apos-
   trophes, or space in the member’s name. There is no need to correct a document that reflects the
   MiLPDS spelling, except at member’s request.
   5.4.5. Changing Name. The requesting member submits the evidence required by Table A7.2. to the
   office designated in Table A7.3., Column B. Action agencies act as directed in Table A7.3., Columns
   C and D.
24                                                                  AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006


5.5. Correcting Date of Birth, Place of Birth, and Changing Citizenship Status:

                                                Chapter 7

                          ACCESSING AIR FORCE MPERR AND MPERF

7.1. Using MPerRs and MPerFs. The MPerRs and MPerFs contain personal and privileged information
and may only be disclosed to authorized persons conducting official Air Force business. Authority to
obtain copies of, information from, or possess MPerRs and access data in the MPerFs is limited to those
persons with an official requirement for the information. MPerRs are not to be further furnished or trans-
ferred to anyone other than those shown in Table A8.1.
   7.1.1. Users have the responsibility to provide adequate justification for receipt of records or access
   to MPerFs, and must show a valid need to review or obtain information from them in the course of
   official duties.

7.2. Safeguarding MPerRs. Protect copies of paper and microfiche MPerRs, on line access and hard
copy output of MPerF records according to AFI 33-332. Destruction is directed by AFI 37-138. The AF
Form 652, Request for Loan of Master Personnel Record, and the ARPC Form 291, Record Trans-
mittal, must remain attached to MPerRs returned to HQ AFPC and ARPC, respectively.

7.3. Safeguarding MPerFs. User access is permitted only after validation of the need for that access.
Access is controlled by the OPR for the particular records, data items, or systems affected. Any outside
organization receiving file extracts, optical disks or electronic media must use the information for the des-
ignated purpose and protect it as AFI 33-202, Computer Security prescribes. Do not release data to
another organization without first gaining approval from HQ AFPC/DPDOST.

7.4. Penalties for Misuse of MPerRs and MPerFs. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, persons who know-
ingly and willfully disclose personal information from an Air Force record, regardless of media, to a per-
son or agency not entitled to receive it, without the advance consent of the subject of the record, are
subject to a fine. Under Title 44, U.S.C., Section 2107, persons who willfully and unlawfully conceal,
remove, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy Air Force records are subject to dismissal and disqualification
from further Federal service in addition to a fine, imprisonment, or both. Unauthorized disclosure of “For
Official Use Only” information may result in disciplinary action.

7.5. How to Establish Routine Access to MPerRs. All activities or persons, not listed in Table A8.1.,
requiring routine access to the MPerRs maintained at AFPC must submit a memorandum request to HQ
AFPC/DPSOMP, 550 C Street West, Suite 19, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4726. The request must include
justification for access and include the requester’s name, SSN, grade, office symbol and duty phone num-
ber. Access to colonel selectees, colonel and general officer records requires approval by the Air Force
Senior Leadership Management Office (AFSLMO). HQ AFPC/DPSOM will coordinate these requests
through AF/DPO and AFSLMO for a final determination:
   7.5.1. Requests for access to MPerRs maintained at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC),
   St Louis, Missouri, by any activity not listed in Table A8.1. require approval by HQ AFPC/DPSOM.
   Forward such requests by memorandum to HQ AFPC/DPSOM, 550 C Street West, Suite 19, Ran-
   dolph AFB, TX 78150-4721.
   7.5.2. The paper selection record, a component of the MPerR, is not normally loaned outside the orga-
   nization maintaining it, with the exception of records NPRC maintains.
28                                                                       AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006


     7.5.3. The memorandum request must be signed by:
        7.5.3.1. For AFPC offices, the division chief or equivalent level for submission to HQ AFPC/
        DPSOM.
        7.5.3.2. For offices outside AFPC, a division chief or equivalent level. Limit the number of des-
        ignees to two in each office.
     7.5.4. Submit a revised memorandum request to HQ AFPC/DPSOM when adding or deleting desig-
     nees.
     7.5.5. Memorandum requests require annual revalidation.
NOTE: AFPC offices requesting active duty Air Force MPerRs need only revalidate request when their
office symbols change.

7.6. How to Request MPerRs.
     7.6.1. AFPC and ARPC users should use the Automated Records Management System (ARMS)
     on-line request system.
     7.6.2. All others see Table A8.2.

7.7. Who is Authorized Access to MperFs. USERIDs and password combination control access to the
MPerFs. Table A8.3. shows standard access for routine users. Requests for access not shown in Table
A8.3. must be submitted in writing, with justification, to HQ AFPC/DPSOMP, 550 C Street West, Suite
19, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4726. Upon approval of requests by the functional office of primary
responsibility (OPR), HQ AFPC/DPSOMP will update the system to allow the user the capability to
access the desired information and notify the requester.

7.8. Access to Restricted Data. Several data elements within the MPerFs are restricted from common
use. Users may submit their requirement for access to these elements. The OPR determines if the justifi-
cation is sufficient and grants access by USERID:
     7.8.1. Access to records on senior officers (colonel selectees and above) assigned to the same MAJ-
     COM as the user is controlled by the senior officer management activity for the MAJCOM.
     7.8.2. Access to senior officers not assigned to the same MAJCOM as the user is considered to be
     non-standard access and is determined by AFSLMO.
     7.8.3. Requests for access to restricted data or non-standard access to senior officers’ records should
     be forwarded in writing to HQ AFPC/DPSOMP, 550 C Street West, Suite 19, Randolph AFB, TX
     78150-4726.
AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                               29


                                               Chapter 8

         ARTICLE 15, RECORD OF NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT, PROCEDURES

8.1. Article 15 Procedures. A commander imposing nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice must decide whether to file the NJP in the OSR or NSR. NJP, and
selection record decision based on the NJP, are recorded on an AF IMT 3070B for senior NCOs and on
AF IMT 3070C for officers. The commander's determination regarding the OSR also applies to filing the
NJP in the OCSRGp.
   8.1.1. Who Makes the NJP Filing Decision.
       8.1.1.1. If an NJP for a senior NCO results in a reduction to a grade below master sergeant, the
       commander makes a filing determination because the NJP was received as a senior NCO.
       8.1.1.2. In a joint command, if a commander from a different Service imposes nonjudicial punish-
       ment on a member of the Air Force element, the senior Air Force officer or commander of the ele-
       ment decides whether to file an NJP in the selection record, provided that official is senior to the
       commander imposing the nonjudicial punishment.
          8.1.1.2.1. If the senior Air Force officer or commander of the element is unavailable, or is not
          senior to the commander imposing the nonjudicial punishment, the general court-martial con-
          vening authority (GCMCA) of the Air Force host command (see AFI 25-201, Support Agree-
          ments Procedures) who is senior to the commander imposing nonjudicial punishment makes
          the filing decision. If there is not a GCMCA in the Air Force host command senior to the com-
          mander imposing punishment, a GCMCA of the host service, who is senior to the commander
          imposing punishment, makes the filing decision.

8.2. When a Senior Commander’s Review is Required.
   8.2.1. The decision to file the NJP in the appropriate selection record is subject to review by the next
   senior Air Force commander to the commander imposing the NJP. There are two exceptions to this
   rule:
       8.2.1.1. If the commander imposing NJP punishment exercises GCMCA or is a higher level com-
       mander, the decision to file in the appropriate selection record is not subject to review.
       8.2.1.2. In a joint command if an officer other than the senior Air Force officer assigned (host
       command or service GCMCA as described above) makes the decision, the decision to file is not
       subject to review.
   8.2.2. The review authority may either concur or nonconcur with the commander imposing the NJP
   and this decision is final. NOTE: References to "commander" or "commander imposing the NJP"
   include the decision authority described above in joint commands where a commander of a different
   service imposes the nonjudicial punishment.
   8.2.3. If the review authority decides not to file the NJP in the selection record, the review authority
   prepares a memorandum (Figure A4.1.) and forwards it with the NJP to the commander imposing
   punishment.
30                                                                         AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006


     8.2.4. If the review authority agrees to file the NJP in the selection record, the review authority signs
     the decision memorandum (Figure A4.4.) and returns it, the NJP, and related correspondence to the
     commander imposing punishment:

8.3. Who Conducts the Senior Commander Review.
     8.3.1. The Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) or comparable level organizational head performs the review
     for members assigned to the Air Staff.
     8.3.2. The senior Air Force officer assigned performs the review for members assigned to commands,
     activities, or agencies outside the Department of the Air Force.
        8.3.2.1. If the NJP recipient is the only Air Force member assigned (or is the senior Air Force
        officer assigned), the office of primary responsibility (OPR) in HQ USAF or MAJCOM headquar-
        ters appoints an officer, senior to the member imposing the nonjudicial punishment, to complete
        the review.
     8.3.3. For an NJP imposed by the host commander on a TDY or tenant member, conduct the review
     through the host Air Force commander’s chain.
     8.3.4. A commander, who is a general officer or exercises general court-martial convening authority
     (GCMCA), may delegate his or her review authority to a principal assistant (see AFI 51-202, Nonju-
     dicial Punishment Guide).

8.4. When a Commander Decides Not to File the Record of NJP in the Selection Record.
     8.4.1. The commander imposing NJP records that decision by initialing the appropriate selection
     record decision block on the AF IMT 3070.

8.5. Commander’s Process for Selection Record Decision.
     8.5.1. The commander imposing NJP punishment notifies the individual in writing of the intent to file
     by initialing the appropriate block on the AF IMT 3070.
     8.5.2. The individual acknowledges receipt of the notification and right to submit a statement, if any,
     of rebuttal, mitigation, or circumstances for consideration on the AF IMT 3070.
     8.5.3. After reviewing the individual’s statement and circumstances, the commander determines
     whether the NJP is appropriate for filing in the selection record.
        8.5.3.1. If the commander decides not to file the NJP in the selection record, the commander
        annotates the decision on the AF IMT 3070, Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings and returns the
        AF IMT 3070 to the servicing staff judge advocate.
            8.5.3.1.1. The servicing staff judge advocate forwards a copy of the AF IMT 3070 to MPF/
            Career Enhancement after review according to AFI 51-202.
            8.5.3.1.2. The AF IMT 3070 is filed in the MPerRGp, but not in the individual’s selection
            record.
        8.5.3.2. If the commander decides to file the NJP in the selection record, the commander anno-
        tates the AF IMT 3070 and:
AFI36-2608 30 AUGUST 2006                                                                              31


           8.5.3.2.1. Forwards it to the senior commander for review, if a senior commander review is
           required, (refer to paragraphs 2.5.2. and 2.5.3.) or
           8.5.3.2.2. If a senior commander review is not required, forwards the NJP and related corre-
           spondence to the servicing staff judge advocate, who forwards a copy to member's MPF/
           Career Enhancement after review according to AFI 51-202.

8.6. The MPF/Career Enhancement Element suspenses the NJP until final action is complete, then for-
wards a copy of the review authority’s decision memorandum and/or the NJP to the OCSRGp custodian,
if the commander’s decision is to file the NJP in the selection record, and forwards the decision memoran-
dum and/or NJP to the MPerRGp custodian IAW Table 8.1. or Table 8.2.

      3. If a member elects to reenlist instead of being discharged or released from active duty, return all
         records to the respective record custodians. Send required documents (reference Table A6.3.,
         note 6) to HQ AFPC/DPSOM, 550 C Street West, Suite 21, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4723.

NOTES:
  1. When member is reassigned to or from a GSU, the member hand-carries the relocatable FRGp
     records (OJT, Medical, Dental, Education, etc.).
      2. Comply with additional instructions in conjunction with reassignment action as provided in AFI
         36-2110.
      3. For personnel assigned PCA without PCS to home awaiting orders, keep FRGp at MPF of assign-
         ment.
      4. MPFs should permit individuals to hand-carry their records unless prohibited by notes 5 or 6. If
         UPRG is mailed, the UPRG must be mailed to the gaining MPF not later than 15 calendar days
         prior to member's Projected Departure Date (PDD). If member is assigned to a GSU without a
         personnel function (or AFIT assignments) not collocated with the gaining MPF, mail the UPRG.
         However, if member is required to personally report to the GSU, hand-carrying UPRG is autho-
         rized.
      5. If UPRG is not mailed to arrive 10 days before class reporting date, forward a message to OTS/
         22TSS/DPM with date records were mailed.
      6. For members returning for separation processing under AFI 36-3208, the Personnel Relocation
         element entrusts the individual's FRGp to an Air Force NCO for delivery to the CONUS MPF
         Personnel Relocation element. This NCO should also be returning for normal separation and be
         booked on a prior or the same flight as the projected separatee. Mail record if hand carrying is not
         feasible.
