This instruction implements AFPD 10-5, Basing. It establishes requirements and assigns responsibility to
AFRC organizations involved in programmatic executions. It explains responsibilities, procedures, the
format for developing and managing AFRC Programming Plans (PPlans) and Programming Messages
(PMsgs), and applies to all action officers who write them.

Section A—General

1. References and Terms: See Attachment 1.

2. Inter-MAJCOM PPlan: If a programming action involves two or more major commands (MAJ-
COM) for which AFRC is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) policies, procedures, and formats
contained in this instruction apply. For in tercommand PPlans/PMsgs for which another command is
OPR, PPlan development is accomplished according to that command’s respective governing publication.
The gaining MAJCOM, or the MAJCOM preparing the majority of actions, will normally be the OPR.
An intercommand PPlan requires adequate lead time for coordination and signature by each command
prior to publication.

3. Programming Plan Authority:
   3.1. HQ AFRC Director of Plans and Programs. HQ AFRC Director of Plans and Programs (HQ
   AFRC/XP) is designated the overall OPR for command PPlan/PMsg policies, procedures, manage-
   ment, and administration. HQ AFRC/XP delegates authority for AFRC PPlans and PMsgs to the HQ
   AFRC Plans and Programs Division (HQ AFRC/XPX). HQ AFRC/XPX is the central controlling
   agency for the development of all AFRC PPlans/PMsgs and may authorize other AFRC staff agencies
   to develop PPlans/PMsgs when appropriate. In addition, XPX:
       3.1.1. Appoints a program manager for each PPlan/PMsg developed.
2                                                                         AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999

       3.1.2. Monitors the USAF Programming Document (PD) and initiates development of PPlans/
       PMsgs to implement directed and authorized changes in AFRC force structure.
       3.1.3. Assigns a control number for and monitors the development status of all AFRC PPlans/
       PMsgs. HQ AFRC/XPX has sole authority to assign AFRC PPlan/PMsg control numbers.
       3.1.4. Maintains a record of division staff agencies that have been delegated approval authority
       for PPlan/PMsg inputs by their respective director.
       3.1.5. Assists other AFRC organizations with development of PPlans/PMsgs. Ensures proper
       coordination and approves, releases, and manages the final product for the respective director.
    3.2. Functional Area OPRs for PPlans/PMsgs:
       3.2.1. Directorates appoint Annex Managers to represent their functional area during PPlan/PMsg
       development.
       3.2.2. The approval authority for PPlan functional area inputs to PPlans /PMsgs, including PPlan
       functional annexes and time-phased action (TPA) inputs, rests with the respective director for that
       functional area or designated functional representative.
    3.3. Signatures on PPlans. To facilitate the use of electronic mail (e-mail) capabilities in the devel-
    opment and distribution of PPlans, the basic plan is the only P Plan component requiring a signature.
    Coordinating approval by the appropriate director is indicated by coordination slip or draft approval
    initials prior to final XP review.

Section B—Responsibilities

4. Staff Responsibilities.
    4.1. Program Manager.
       4.1.1. Obtains PPlan/PMsg control number and all information pertaining to the proposed action.
       4.1.2. Reviews AFI 10-501, Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans
       (PPLAN); AFI 16-403, Updating the USAF Program Installations, Units, and Priorities and
       Movement of Air Force Units; and AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting. An
       action involving a unit move requires a movement directive according to AFI 16-403. An action
       affecting an installation (activation, inactivation, transfer, etc.) must comply with the provisions of
       AFI 32-9005. An action affecting a unit type code is processed under the provisions of HOI
       10-402, AFRES Unit Type Code Management.
       4.1.3. Promptly processes an environmental evaluation for all proposed actions in conjunction
       with programming document development. AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting, applies to
       both CONUS and overseas actions. All actions require submission of an AF Form 813, Request
       for Environmental Impact Analysis, to the host command environmental plannin g office for
       review and final disposition. If the action is on a non-AFRC base, the program manager must ask
       the host command to process the environmental evaluation. At an AFRC base, the environmental
       planning office is in the Environmental Programs Division (HQ AFRC/CEV). The program man-
       ager must state in the programming document that the environmental evaluation has begun and its
       status at the time of publication. The program manager makes the environmental evaluation
AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999                                                                              3

     request available for review during the entire planning phase, and notifies annex managers of its
     final disposition.
     4.1.4. In instances which involve the creation of a new AFRC unit, promptly processes request
     for basic identity data element (BIDE) unit registration in the joint master data base according to
     Joint Pub 1-02.
     4.1.5. Develops the basic PPLan/PMsg and Concept of Operations, Annex Alpha.
     4.1.6. Sets up the initial annex managers meeting and notifies all staff agencies, furnishing them
     applicable background information and a draft basic plan, if available. Prepares a list of annex
     managers for inclusion in the basic plan.
     4.1.7. Chairs and schedules annex manager meetings. Ensures proper coordination across all
     staff levels during plan development.
     4.1.8. Coordinates with the designated functional area OPRs to generate PPlan/PMsg inputs and
     initiates development of supporting functional staff annexes/Time-Phased Actions (TPA). For
     actions requiring a full PPlan (versus a PMsg), consideration should be given to the option of con-
     ducting a PPlan development conference. The PPlan development conference may limit the need
     for additional site activation task forces (SATAF), closure task forces (CTF), and realignment task
     forces (RTF).
     4.1.9. Provides PPlan templates to annex managers.
     4.1.10. Establishes suspense dates for the various developmental and implementation phases.
     4.1.11. Schedules and conducts site visits, site surveys, or SATAF visits as required.
     4.1.12. Within Annex Y of the PPlan, or as the final section of a PMsg, establishes reporting pro-
     cedures including frequency (normally monthly), due dates, and required format for progress
     reports. Specifies all agencies to be included as addressees for unit reports. Includes criteria for
     projecting when unit reporting requirements expire, but state continued reporting is required until
     either (a) standards set forth in Annex Y or re porting section of PMsg have been met, or ( b) the
     unit is otherwise notified by HQ AFRC/XPX that reports are no longer required.
     4.1.13. Publishes and distributes the PPlan/PMsg and changes or revisions. Ensures all agencies
     participating in or affected by the execution of the PPlan/PMsg are included as PPlan/PMsg
     addressees. The primary method of distribution is electronic mail. Offices requiring hard copy
     will identify such requirement to HQ AFRC/XPX.
     4.1.14. Reviews recurring progress reports from the field and coordinates with appropriate HQ
     AFRC staff agencies to resolve problems.
     4.1.15. Via message, announces the declassification of classified PPlans/PMsgs as soon as possi-
     ble after public announcement. Ensures the message includes an accurate citation of the declassi-
     fication authority, and that all agencies on distribution for the original PPlan/PMsg are included as
     addressees.
     4.1.16. Takes action to officially close PPlan/PMsg when the objective and last activity are com-
     pleted. The closure message should include all agencies that received the original PPlan/PMsg.
  4.2. Annex Managers. HQ AFRC directorates appoint an Annex Manager to:
4                                                                        AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999

       4.2.1. Assist the program manager with the development of the draft basic plan/PMsg as required
       and ensure the development of supporting annexes and TPAs, as applicable.
       4.2.2. Act as single point of contact within the functional area. Responsible for coordinating all
       aspects of the PPlan/PMsg within the f unctional area prior to submission of PPlan/PMsg inputs.
       Ensure coordination with other AFRC staff agencies and with counterparts in non-AFRC agencies
       when their respective annex or TPA affects those agencies.
       4.2.3. Ensure that action items identified during SATAFs, site surveys, and site visits are incorpo-
       rated into the appropriate annex/TPA.
       4.2.4. Provide the PPlan manager with finalized annexes and appendices to include supporting
       TPA (see Attachment 2).
       4.2.5. Ensure accomplishment of HQ AFRC TPA within the respective functional area. Notify
       the program manager of any suspected problems, including proposed resolution. Monitor the sta-
       tus of field TPA within the respective functional area by reviewing recurring progress reports from
       the field and provide assistance to affected units as required. Monitor the adequacy and currency
       of the respective functional area annex/TPA and submit required revisions of assigned functional
       annex manager to the PPlan manager.
       4.2.6. Provide the program manager a list of agencies, office symbols, addresses, and number of
       copies for final distribution.
       4.2.7. File progress reports with the PPlan OPR if directed by Annex Y of the PPlan or by the
       PMsg.

Section C—Format and Report Procedures

5. Format and Administrative Procedures.
    5.1. Page Format. Format PPlan and supplement pages using templates developed by HQ AFRC/
    XPX.
    5.2. Annex A. Annex ALPHA, Concept of Operations, explains the execution of the programming
    document, addresses the total intent of the document, and directs how and when to accomplish the
    objective. The decision to prepare Annex ALPHA rests with the PPlan OPR and program manager.
    Explain in detail the scope and size of the program or project, the relative timeframe, and any other
    pertinent data that may be helpful in executing the objective. Explain any peculiar situations that may
    impact execution and how to handle these situations. Explain impacts on other programs or projects
    and how the execution of this objective relates to them. If Annex ALPHA is not used, the Basic Plan
    must state that Annex ALPHA is not necessary.
    5.3. Reporting Procedures. Reports for PPlans are governed by both Annex Y, Required Reports,
    and Appendix 1 to Annex Y, Progress Report format. Units include their respective NAF as an info
    addressee for progress reports prescribed by PPlans/PMsgs. Additional guidance pertaining to report-
    ing is in paragraph 7. of this instruction (see Attachment 2 for format/content examples).
    5.4. PPlan Elements. Attachment 2 to this regulation consists of format/content examples for
    selected PPlan elements, as follows:
AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999                                                                           5

      5.4.1. A PPlan Table of Contents example which specifies the alphabetic designators to be used
      for each annex. Annexes required for any given PPlan will vary depending on the nature of that
      PPlan (that is, not every PPlan will have an Annex H; only those requiring a Manpower & Orga-
      nization Annex). Additionally, some designators are not currently used.
      5.4.2. An example for the basic plan.
      5.4.3. An example for a functional staff agency annex using Annex E--Operations as an example.
      5.4.4. An example showing the appendix formats for PPlan TPA. All PPlan TPA will be incorpo-
      rated into the PPlan as appendices to the functional annexes as follows: Appendix 1 for HQ
      AFRC TPA, Appendix 2 for field-level TPA. If there are no HQ AFRC TPA, but fields TPA are
      required, the fields TPA become Appendix 1 to the annex. Other appendices may be added, con-
      secutively numbered, as necessary.
      5.4.5. Examples for Annex Y, Required Reports, and Appendix 1 to Annex Y, Progress Report.
   5.5. Other Examples. A PMsg example is included at Attachment 3 and PPlan Closure message at
   Attachment 4.
   5.6. Security Classification. Classify PPlan/PMsg data according to content, according to
   DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401, Managing the Information Security Program. Information which is sen-
   sitive but not classified should be identified as "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" and handled according
   to AFI 37-131, Freedom of Information Act Program.
   5.7. Documentation Management Procedures. Record copies of each PPlan/PMsg and associated
   documentation will be maintained and disposed of by the PPlan/PMsg OPR according to AFI 37-133,
   volume 2. Destruction of classified PPlans/PMsgs and associated documentation will be accom-
   plished according to DoD 5200.1/AFI 31-401.

6. Preparation of Changes/Revisions.
   6.1. Interim Change. An interim change to an existing PPlan/PMsg is issued under urgent circum-
   stances and transmitted, by message, to only those addressees required to take immediate action.
   Interim changes are assigned consecutive change numbers until a formal change is published, nor-
   mally within 120 days after issue of an interim change.
   6.2. Formal Change. Address a formal change issued in letter form with attachments as necessary
   or in message form to all agencies on distribution for the original PPlan/PMsg. A formal change con-
   sists of write-in and/or page revisions. Formal changes are assigned consecutive numbers and incor-
   porate all interim changes published since the previous formal change. A distribution page is
   published with each change (except for message changes where the message addressees will serve as
   the distribution page).
   6.3. Revised PPlan/PMsg. When a program in a published PPlan/PMsg has changed significantly,
   publish a revised PPlan/PMsg. The revised PPlan/PMsg title and number remains the same as on the
   original; however, reaccomplish the PPlan/PMsg totally. Mark the front cover of the new PPlan
   "REVISED" and redate it. For PMsgs, the word "REVISED" will follow the PMsg title in the subject
   line.

7. Reporting.
6                                                                        AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999

    7.1. Unit. Unit commanders tasked by AFRC PPlans/PMsgs submit progress reports according to
    specific reporting instructions contained in each PPlan/PMsg. For PPlans, reports indicate status of
    all TPA for which the unit is responsible. When an action has been completed, report it as complete
    and continue to report it as complete in subsequent reports. Include the PPlan/PMsg OPR, all func-
    tional AFRC staff agencies that have provided annexes to the PPlan or are affected by the PMsg, and
    the appropriate NAF and/or intermediate counterparts for each applicable AFRC functional agency.
    On all correspondence containing PPlan/PMsg progress report information, reference the respective
    PPlan/PMsg number and title.
    7.2. Intermediate Headquarters. Any agency designated as an int ermediate headquarters in the
    implementation of a PPlan/PMsg reviews the unit reports and will endorse the report to the appropri-
    ated HQ AFRC functional staff agency, with an information copy to HQ AFRC/XPXP.
    7.3. HQ AFRC Staff Agency. Each functional annex manager (FAM) reviews unit reports, moni-
    tors the status of unit TPA within its functional area, and notifies the PPlan/PMsg manager of any sus-
    pected problem areas. The respective OPR initiates action, through appropriate channels, to assist
    units in resolving problems. Additionally, functional annex managers endorse progress reports with
    the PPlan OPR if directed by Annex Y of the PPlan or by the PMsg.

Terms
Attrition Reserve (AR) -- Based on availability, AR aircraft may be procured for a unit to replace
anticipated losses of primary aircraft authorization (PAA). For more details, see AFI 16-402.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) -- BAI are those aircraft authorized over and above PAA to permit
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections, and repa irs without reduction of
aircraft available for the operational mission. BAI are normally computed using 10 percent of total PAA.
For more details, see AFI 16-402.
Closure Task Force (CTF) and Realignment Task Force (RTF) -- The organization and process
employed to implement the required actions directed by the Defense Base Realignment and Closure
Commission. It is an extension of the Directorate of Plans and Programs, augmented by appropriate
members of the HQ AFRC and/or supporting command staffs, to provide on-scene assistance/surveillance
to support unit-level agencies in the accomplishment of closure actions (CTF) or to effect the realignment
or transfer of a base to another MAJCOM, DoD, or federal agency (RTF).
Contingency/Wartime Tasking Susceptibility Date -- The specific date a unit is programmed to be
susceptible to contingency/wartime tasking (initial operational ca pability (IOC)/operational ready (OR)
date for a converting unit).
Equipage Quarter -- The most frequently applied definition for equipage quarter is the quarter of the
fiscal year during which a unit is programmed to receive its PAA. This is the same as conversion quarter,
as outlined in the USAF Programming Document (PD). Equipage quarter may also pertain to the quarter
during which a unit is programmed to receive special weapons or radar systems equipment. *New aircraft
or equipment (other than maintenance trainers) for a conversion may flow into a unit prior to the equipage
8                                                                          AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999

quarter, if the environmental process allows it. Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS)
reporting during the equipage quarter is according to the applicable SORTS regulations. AFRC units
undergoing conversions which require a change to their SORTS Designated Operational Capability
(DOC) statement may expect to receive their new DOC statement during the equipage quarter.
Forecast Operational Ready (OR) Quarter -- The end of the quarter following the equipage
conversion quarter. If an additional quarter is required to attain OR status, this should be spelled out in the
applicable PPlan/PMsg.
Formal Change -- A PPlan/PMsg change transmitted by message or letter to all addressees who
received the original PPlan/PMsg.
Functional Annex Manager -- The focal point within a HQ A FRC staff agency that is tasked to
provide input to a PPlan/PMsg for that re spective functional area. For a PPlan, input provided is in the
form of comments/recommended changes to the basic plan, as well as an annex and associated TPA. For
a PMsg, input milestones or verbiage pertain ing to a specific detail or set of details falling within the
respective functional area of responsibility. The specific duties of functional area managers are outlined
in chapter 4 of this instruction.
Interim Change -- A PPlan/PMsg change of urgent nature that is transmitted, by message, to only those
addressees required to take immediate action or having an immediate need to know.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC) -- Normally the firs t attainment within the USAF of the
capability to effectively employ a weapon item of equipment or system, which is manned and operated by
an adequately trained, equipped, and suppor ted military unit. IOC is used only for bedown of newly
developed weapon systems. Specific dates for IOC are forecast on a case-by-case basis. Conversions in
an established weapon system are given a forecast OR quarter.
Limiting Factor (LIMFAC) -- A cause or reason that may preclude a unit from attaining IOC/OR
status as forecast in a PPlan or PMsg. Unit commanders bring LIMFAC to the attention of the appropriate
AFRC agency, through normal channels and as soon as possible.
Maintenance Trainers -- Aircraft that will be pre-positioned at units to be used for training
maintenance personnel. There will normally be two to thre e trainers, which will be on-station 60 to 90
days prior to the equipage quarter.
Milestone -- A major action or key event identified in the PPlan/PMsg and essential to accomplishment
of the programmed objective as scheduled.
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) -- A designated staff office or field-level agency that is
responsible for a particular aspect of a PPlan or PMsg.
Operational Ready (OR) -- A unit will be considered OR when no longer reporting C-5 according to
the applicable SORTS instructions. The term OR will apply to all units repor ting under SORTS, and in
the case of the first unit equipping with a new system, IOC, and OR will be synonymous.
PPlan Development Conference -- A conference called by the PPlan manager and attended by
functional annex managers for the purpose of developing an entire draft or final PPlan. Attendance by
numbered air force (NAF), unit, and other agency personnel to the PPlan development conference is at the
discretion of the PPlan Manager.
PPlan Manager -- The focal point within HQ AFRC/XPXP who is primar ily responsible for
developing and managing a PPlan/PMsg.
AFRCI10-501 4 January 1999                                                                                   9

Programming Message (PMsg) -- A PMsg used in lieu o f a PPlan is a l ess comprehensive
documentation which suffices for implementation of a program objective; however, exercise caution in
making such a determination. Use a PMsg as an interim measure to establish the overall goal and provide
basic guidance pertaining to a major program action while a PPlan is being developed.
Programming Plan (PPlan) -- A coordinated document whi ch is directive in n ature, consisting of a
basic plan and supporting functional staff annexes, which defines the actions required and outlines the
responsibilities for achieving a specific program directive.
Revised PPlan -- A completely new PPlan that replaces a previously published PPlan of the same
number and subject.
Site Activation Task Force (SATAF) -- The organization and process required to bring a pr ogram,
system, equipment, and/or site to OR. SATAF are also conducted to fa cilitate unit inactivations, unit
relocations, and conversions from one weapons or radar systems to another. The SATAF process is an
extension of the Directorate of Plans and Programs, augmented by appropriate members of the HQ AFRC
and/or supporting command staffs, to provide periodic on-scene assistance/surveillance to support
unit-level agencies in the accomplishment of force structure program objectives. The following is a brief
synopsis of S ATAF assessment criteria (assessment of the process, not the unit): G REEN: Maintain
standards with organic capability or proven work-around to disconnects (low-risk situation). YELLOW:
Standard is attained by "high-risk" work-arounds or insufficient information is available to make an
assessment. RED: Disconnects with no solution; showstopper, action will not occur as programmed.
Tasking Relief Date -- The specific date a deactivating unit is relieved of contingency/wartime tasking.
Time-Phased Actions (TPA) -- Actions/events to be initiated and completed at a specific time ensuring
timely accomplishment of a PPlan’s programmed objective(s).
Training Quarter -- This is the quarter of the fiscal year immediately following the equipage quarter.
During this quarter, the unit trains with the new weapon system with the intent to be OR by the last day of
the quarter. A training quarter will not be r equired for all weapons system conversions. If required,
details will be spelled out in the PPlan/PMsg.
Unit Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA) Increases -- PAA increases will flow to allow the unit to
attain an overall C-level of C-3 or better for the new authorizations by the first of the quarter following the
quarter in which the PAA increases become effective.

NOTES:
Appendix 1 will be used for "HQ AFRC" TPAs; Appendix 2 will be used for "Field" TPAs. If there are
no headquarters TPAs, then the “field” TPAs will become Appendix 1.
OPR column should reflect an AFRC 3- or 4-digit agency for HQ TPAs and a unit element for field TPAs.
Start and end dates should be reflected using day-month-year. If a TPA does not have to start on a specific
date but rather within a specific month, use the first of the month for the start date and the last day of the
month for the end date.
If an action does not have to start/end by a particular time, it is not time-phased and should not be included
in the TPAs. If it still needs to be addressed as a requirement put it in the appropriate section of the func-
tional annex.
If a start/end date is TBD, explain contingent upon what in the remark column. Otherwise, TBD dates
will have to be provided via a change to the PPlan.

SUBJECT: XXX AW (specify frequency) Progress Report according to AFRC PPlan 98-XX As Of
(specify)
PART I - COMMANDER’S COMMENTS: The commander should assess the current status of the con-
version and comment on any factor that limits or creates a problem with meeting program objectives. Sta-
tus of current or potential problems should include actions being proposed or taken and expected “get
well” date. If higher echelon assistance has been requested on any problem related tothis PPlan, include
a brief summary of unit action take n to resolve the problem, and the nature of the request for assistance
including date of request, headquarters addressed, and response to date.
PART II - Status of Milestone/Active Time Phased Actions (TBA)
1. Report the current status of all active milestones/TBAs for which the reporting activity is responsible.
Active action items are those actions that have begun, have been completed, or were scheduled to start
during the current reporting period. Discontinue reporting milestones/TPAs once they are reported com-
plete.


Milestone/TPA              Scheduled Completion      Actual Completion          Status


Use the appropriate num- Date published in the Actual date completed            St a t e “ C o m p l e t e ” o r
ber from the applicable PPlan                                                   “Behind Schedule”
annex

2. If a milestone/TPA is behind schedule, comments are mandatory. Comments should include why the
activity is behind; the estimated completion date; the impact of the delay on the milestone/TPA, the
annex, and the PPlan as a whole; and the corrective action. Example as follows:


DO-1            A lack of formal school quotas has delayed completion of aircrew qualification. HQ
                AFRC/DOT has been no tified and additional quotas are forthcoming. New estimated
                completion date is 30 June 1999. No impact on overall PPlan completion.
