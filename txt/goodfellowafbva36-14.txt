   IS ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) FOR YOU?
  ADR encompasses a range of problem-solving processes with the basic purpose
  to resolve disagreements without litigation. The Air Force offers the MEDIATION
  method of ADR to resolve complaints for military and civilian employees.

                                                         •ADR is voluntary – the parties to a dispute decide
                                                         whether they want to use it or not.
                                                         •ADR allows the parties to mutually determine the
                                                         outcome of their own dispute.
                                                         •ADR seeks to satisfy interests, not argue positions.
                                                         •ADR is confidential – what’s said in connection with ADR
                                                         usually can’t be disclosed unless the parties consent.
